I. 5 called for the papers that had been received from Bombay and Bushire in the presence of the. Viziers and principal officers of State. They were accordingly produced and read. His Majesty expressed himself in terms of the deepest concern and surprise at the extraordinary event which they related : never, he said such an occurrence was heard as that of an ambassador and his suite beinsj attacked by the armed men of the country receiving him : to impute it all to accident as Mehdi Ali Khan would have him was impossible. 14 Mirza Mahomed Khan Kajar next spoke: 'What Mehdi Ali Khan had written was, he said, evidently framed to prevent the disagreeable impres- sions which such intelligence might produce in His Majesty s mind, lor his part he did not conceive it possible that a trifling disagreement or altercation amongst servants should produce the necessity of a recourse to firearins on the part of an honorary guard, and with this remark the sitting closed. Shah Kvsur eldest son of the Shah, was present at the next discussion of this subiect * he said he understood that His Majesty had it in contemplation to send another ambassador to India, The King said this was not the case . that he had himself no object in view from the connection, but, as two embassies had been sent him from that quarter, he thought it but proper to send one m return. As it had come to such a termination, he was not immediately occu pied with the thoughts of renewing it. The prince said he had in that case a favour to ask of His Majesty, which was, that he would put under his orders a body of 10,000 men, merely for the sake of the name; that he would himself add to these an army of 60,000 Abdally and Yusufzy horse; and that he engaged in four months not to leave a trace of English name in India. Mirza Reza Kooly smiled, and the King said nothing, until after the prince was gone, when turning to the Vizier he asked him ^vhat he thought of Shah Kysur's proposal. ' The fate of battle8, , ' replied the Vizier, ' rests with Him who knows all things; to speak from my own imperfect judgment of the probable chances on either side, I confess, I think the Prince s proposal partakes much of the sanguine character of his age. Not that I deem the number of men which he * has specified inadequate to the magnitude of the undertaking, but I think his imagination has carried him on rather too quickly in forming an estimate of the requisite time. From what I have heard, if Prince Kysur was to set off full speed and travel four months without interruption, he would not in that space of time encompass the British Dominions in India, much less subdue them.' 15. He then produced a paper which he said had been privately sent him by Mehdi Ali Khan, expatiating on the advantages to be derived from the most intimate friendship with the English nation, as instanced in the late ex pedition to Egypt, noticing the entire dependence of Persia upon England and India in a commercial point of view, and stating the comparative unimport ance of such an accident as Haji Khalil's death. Mahomed Khan Kajar said he entirely agreed with the Nawab in the sentiments expressed in his letter, which had been communicated in like manner to him. He enlarged upon the signal vigor and liberality that had been displayed in the Egyptian expedition; where four hundred ships of war conveyed the united forces of England and India for the recovery of that invaluable province. He extolled their noble and unrequited generosity on this occasion and^ said that the death of one hundred Haji Khalils was not to be put in competition with such friendship. Solyman Khan acknowledged the justice of his remarks, but said he did not see how anything they had now heard was to alleviate the disgrace of a Persian Ambassador being killed in India. 16. The King after commending the good sense which had been shown by all parties in the debate, now proceeded to declare his determination, which was, that all thoughts of appointing another ambassador should be laid aside and no notice for the present taken of the letters which had been received from Bushire and India. A few days subsequently it was decided to reply to the communications. It was at first proposed that the young Prince should write them: but this task, from some consideration of etiquette, was after wards transferred to Cheragh Aly Khan, Governor-General of Ears, who accordingly despatched Mirza Naum in charge of them. The substance of 20th Jany. 1803. this communication was, that another Embassy was expected from the English Government before His Majesty would appoint a successor to Haji Khalil.6 Part I—Chap. !• 17* Meanwhile Major Malcolm had been ordered by a letter, dated 26th August 1802, of the Governor-General to Bombay from Calcutta as the fittest man for throwing oil over troubled waters. On his arrival at Bombay he had an inventory made of the deceased's property, which he despatched to the Persian Government for orders. He wrote letters to the Shah and his ministers representing the catastrophe as being due to a merest accident and not to the slightest fault or neglect on the part of the authorities, who did everything in their power to make the Persian Ambassador's stay a pleasant and comfort able one. 18. The clamorous retainers of the late ambassadors were satisfied from the highest to the lowest. ' But,' writes Kaye in his Life of Sir John Malcolm, ' the magnitude of the crisis had been greatly exaggerated. The death of the ambassador created but little sensation in Persia, and that little soon passed away. It was not regarded as a national outrage, but as a debt con tracted by us, which money payments might promptly discharge, and it was said soon afterwards that the English might kill ten ambassadors, if they would pay for them at the same rate.' 19. The body of the deceased Khan was despatched to Kerbella with every circumstance of honour, a number of Persians and Mr. Pasely accom panying it.Part I—Chap. II. 7 CHAPTER II. MAHOMED NABI KHAN'S MISSION TO INDIA, 1805-1806. 20. The glitter of the English money tempted another Persian to offer himself for the service of an ambassador to the Governor-General's court at Calcutta. This was Aga Mahomed Nabi, mentioned above (paragraph 5), whose sister had been married to the deceased ambassador, and who had himself married the deceased's widow. As the terms of his expenses during the mission were the same as those of his brother-in-law, the Persian Government whose wrath had already been appeased by the English presents, and who were now anxious to find an ally against the Russians, readily welcomed the offer of Aga Mahomed Nabi. Dr. Jukes, who was a good Persian scholar, was appointed to accompany the ambassador (Bombay Government letter to Mr. Bruce, dated 22nd April 1805). 20 A. Mahomed Nabi Khan arrived on 10th October at Bombay where he has been obliged to put into owing to a severe gale of wind and one of the ships carrying away her masts and the fleet being much in want of water, for the supplying of which they intended to have gone into Goa, had not the bad weather assailed them and the above accident happened, which obliged them to make for Bombay. On his arrival in the Bombay harbour, and the instant the ship was recognised to be his, a party of gentlemen was sent off on the part of the Governor to congratulate His Excellency and express his regret at his having met such bad weather during his voyage, and to inform him that the promptest orders would be issued for getting ship and the rest of the fleet ready as quick as possible to proceed on their voyage to Calcutta, but His Excellency expressing a wish to land and proceed from thence overland to Calcutta, every preparation for his landing was made accordingly and advices sent to the Supreme Government. He landed on the 18th October with all the honor due to his high rank, the ships in the harbour being dressed out and saluting him as he passed and was received on the pier head by persons of rank and conducted in state to his tent on the Green, from whence he proceeded in the same style (music playing all the time) to the house prepared for his reception at Chints Poogly. On the 25th he paid his first visit in very great style to the Governor, accompanied by a number of gentlemen sent on purpose. After the accustomed congratulations and ceremonies were exchanged, the letter from His Majesty the King of Persia was brought in by His Excellency's son-in-law, the ambassador rising and advancing to receive delivered it for mally to the Hon'ble the Governor. After the usual refreshments were done, the ambassador returned to his house at Chints Poogly in the same style and under the same honors as he came. On the 31st October the Governor returned His Excellency's visit in great style and magnificence, and on the 2l8t November His Excellency was invited to a grand entertainment by the Governor where a very splendid party of upwards of 100 persons were present. He spent the morning in inspecting the Grand Arsenal and Dockyard at which he expressed great satisfaction and astonishment and in the evening went to the entertainment. His Excellency was afterwards visited by the Governor and chief members of Government. The ambassador soon after wards proceeded to Calcutta and was received and entertained there with no less pomp and honor. 21. Mahomed Nabi Khan returned from India without effecting anything. ♦See Kaye's Life of Sir John Malcolm, The treaties* drawn up by Haji Ibrahim Volume I, pages 143-144. anc l Captain Malcolm never received the Royal ratification from London, and Haji Nabi Khan's demands for the interference of the British Government in the settlement of the disputes between Persia and Russia were never taken into serious consideration.8 Part I—Chap. III. CHAPTER III. SELF-ASSUMED MISSION OF MR. MANESTY TO THE COURT OF PERSIA, 1804. 22. We find iu 1804 Captain Lovett, who had been appointed Resident at Bushire in 1803 in succession to Mehdi Ali Khan, resigning on the score of ill-health his appointment into the hands of Mr. Manesty, the restless and fussy Resident at Basrah, without the previous orders of Government. Mr. Manesty no sooner had taken charge of the Residency than he proceeded on a mission to the Court of Persia on the self-assumed title of Envoy of the Government of India. He was received cordially at the Court. The King of Persia was very urgent with Mr. Manesty to obtain the interference of the British Government in the settlement of his dispute with Russia. But the so-called ambassador had no powers to promise anything, and he was soon obliged to retrace his steps from Teheran by the peremptory orders of the Governor-General of India to leave Persia at once and return to Basrah. Orders were also given to stop the payment of his bills drawn on the Bombay Government. This order was, however, rescinded by the Governor- General, as appears from his letter No. 11, July 1804, quoted below: — Secret a»d Poll. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters under date the 14th of Dept., Diary May and 2nd of June, on the subject of the instructions contained in my official letter to your Ko. 159 of 1804, address of the 28rd of April prohibiting the acceptance of any of the bills drawn by pp. 2335-283T, M anes ty upon the Government of Bombay on account of his unathorised expedition to the Court of Persia. Althousrh it was proper in the first instance to manifest a disposition to check Mr. Manesty's proceedings, by a public act of the Government, it has appeared to me that the final rejection of his bills may probably affect the public credit. I have therefore resolved to authorize the payment of them, and to render Mr. Manesty responsible for his unwarranted expenditure of the public money. You will accordingly be pleased to authorize the discharge ot all bills drawn on the Government of Bombay by Mr. Manesty in his assumed capacity of ambassador on the part of British Government to the Court of Persia, directing the Secretary to transmit to Fort William an Account Statement of such bills for the information of the Governor- General in Council. By my official despatch of the 23rd April, you were also apprized of my intention to transmit to you instructions recalling Mr. Manesty from Persia, and directing him immediately to return to his station at Bussorah. I deem it proper to inform you, that considerations connected principally with the personal safety of Mr. Manesty, have induced me to suspend that measure. At the same time it is not my intention to sanction Mr. Manesty's unwarrantable proceedings by a recognition of his assumed capacity of ambassador at the Court of Persia.Part I—Chap. IV. 9 CHAPTER IV. THE SECOND MISSION OF JOHN MALCOLM. TO PERSIA AM) THE PERSIAN GULF, 1808. ARRIVAL OF KING GEORGE HI'S AMBASSADOR SIR HARFORD JONES AT BOMBAY. 23. As early as 23rd November 1806 Colonel Malcolm wrote from Mysore to Lord Minto pointing out the danger to India from the termination of the war between France and Russia, which must lead to the occupation of Turkey by the Prench and making Persia their highway for an invasion of India, in alliance with Russia. Already an ambassador of Bonaparte had arrived at Teheran and had been very successful in establishing an influence at the Court of Persia. The Shah had gained nothing by the treaties with the Government drawn up by Captain Malcolm, while now Bonaparte came forward to settle the Persian difficulties with Russia, by war at first, and later on, when the treaty of Tilsit was signed between France and Russia, by friendly negotiation with the Russian Emperor, now Bonaparte's ally. ^ 24. The Resident at Bushire, Mr. Hankey Smith, was apparently much perturbed bv the news of the arrival of a French Ambassador at Teheran, and to calm his apprehension Nasurullah Khan, Minister to the Prince of Fars, wrote the following letter [translation] to Sheikh Abdul Rassul, Governor of Bushire. Translation of a private letter from Nasurala Khan to Shaik Ahdil Russool Khan, Governor of Bushire, At the present time we have understood from the communications of some of the 4 p 11 merchants at Bushire and from those who are coming and going, that the Resident at Bushire, p° arv * in consequence of the arrival of the French Ambassador in Persia, has entertained 8 0™ e No. 223 of 1808, degree of apprehension. In the first place, according to the established rules, this intelii- pp. lOTSMObJi. ^ence ou^rht first to have been communicated by you to His Royal Highness, and to myself and not that we should have become acquainted with the things through the medium of the merchants, communications or the reports of travellers : in this particular you have been extremely thoughtless and inattentive. Mohummed Hussein Khan Kishtee is now dispatched to Bushire in consequence of the above intelligence being received iu order that he may do away the fears of the Resident and make him perfectly satisfied in this subject. In the first place, it is self-evident that during the former Governments of Persia ambassadors from distant Kingdoms as India, Rome, Turkey, Europe, friends and enemies from every nation were alike received at their Courts, and every one who had demands or communications to make was admitted and the Sovereigns of those ages acted as appeared themselves advisable, and no one prevented the coming and going of ambassadors to their country. The first Europeans who came and established a friendship with Persian Government were the English, and His Majesty the King of Persia received and treated them with every kindness and friendship, and he is even now continually writing most particularly to His Royal Highness the Prince and to myself to maintain and support this friendship with the English nation unimpaired hitherto, nothing has occurred to disturb the existing harmony and good understanding between the two nations, why then should the arrival of one or two Frenchmen cause any disturbance in the mind of the Resident of Bushire. I swear by the Almighty God and the head of my Sovereign that the servants of Ins Majesty and those of His Royal Highness the Prince entertain the highest regard and friendship towards the English and in no way can the arrival of the French in the Empire diminish the attachment which subsists or cause them to abandon the path of friendship and the long established connexion between the States of England and Persia will not undoubtedly be even regarded with utmost respect and attention by His Majesty and His Royal Highness. Mohummed Hussein Khan Kishtee, who is now dispatched, is commissioned to bear some messages which he will personally communicate to you, and it is necessary that by consulting together you adopt some plan by which the Resident may be fully satisfied in every particular, and with the favour of the Almighty nothing will ever be manifested contrary to the communications and assurances of attachment which you may make to him. Make known to me your wishes and rely upon their being complied with.10 Part I—Chap. IV. 25. 'With a view to check the French intrigues in Persia, the Home Government in London decided in February 1807 to depute Sir Harford Jones, formerly Resident at Bagdhad, on a mission to the Shah of Persia. It was intended that he should proceed to Persia by way of Russia, but when preparations were being made for this journey and his departure was con stantly put off, the Treaty of Tilsit was concluded between Russia and France; and thus the Russian route became practically closed to the British Envoy. Sir Harford Jones had then to choose the Cape course and he left Portsmouth in October 1807 on the sloop Sap hire with the following gentlemen in his staff :— Mr. James Morier, Private Secretary; Major Lovet Smith, Public Secretary, and others - 26. The Saphire arrived at Bombay only on 26th April 1808, when Bri gadier General Malcolm, who on account of the delay that had taken place in Sir Harford Jones' arrival, had been appointed by Lord Minto his Envoy to the Court of Persia and had just sailed in the Fsyche to the Gulf. Sir Harford Jones decided to await at Bombay the result of Malcolm's Mission before proceeding further. 27. Lord Minto had furnished Brigadier-General Malcolm with elaborate instructions dated the 7th March 1808, from which is quoted the following extract bearing principally on the Persian Gulf and Sir Harford Jones' concurrent mission. ****** Secret and Poll. 19. A future object of importance to obtain from Persia is the exclusion of the French Dept. Diary 2 63 f r om an establishment in any of the ports or islands in the Persian Gulph subject to the 6194 808, ^ ' au thority of that Government, or from any commercial establishment within the limits of the Persian Dominions. The official documents to which you will have access at Bombay will apprize you of the progress which the French appear to have made in the attainment of both those objects, as well as generally in the formation of a close connection and alliance with the State of Persia, and this information will aid your judgment in devising the means best calculated to counteract them. 20. Government is desirous also of knowing your opinion with regard to the expediency of undertaking at an early period an expedition on a small scale, for the purpose of preventing the French from occupying a maritime station on the coast or of dislodging them if they should already have obtained possession of such a post. 21. The mere grant of an establishment to the French within the territories of Persia, is a direct violation of the Political Treaty concluded by your agency with that Government, and with reference to the declared views of France in soliciting such an establishment, is of itself a justifiable ground of war with Persia; still more so is the tenor of the negotiations which that Government is known to have entertained with the ambassadors from France. You are aware however that the Court of Persia has interpreted that article of the Political Treaty which declares in the general terms of cordial amity between States, the friend and enemies of the one shall be the friends and enemies of the other, into an obligation of defensive alliance, and has considered the refusal of this Government to co-operate against the Russians to be a violation of that engagement. If circumstances should enable you to proceed into Persia in the character of ambassador, you will probably have occasion to enter into a discussion of this question and you will find no difficulty in proving to the satisfaction of the Court that such could not have been the comprehensive intention of that article and especially that this Government could not poseess the authority, and consequently could not under any circumstances entertain the design, to employ its arms against a firm and ancient ally of the British nation, and this explanation may possibly be of use in securing the full reliance of the Court of Persia on the punctual fulfilment of any defensive engagement which under that conviction the Court may be disposed and circumstances may enable you to conclude. It may be of use also in demonstrating the just ground of complaint which this Government possesses against the conduct of Persia and afford to you in your negotiation the advantage of that superiority which will arise from being enabled to give to the purpose of your mission the character of remonstrance and demand rather than of submission and solicitation. 22. You will consider yourself at liberty, at any time when you may judge proper, to avow your diplomatic mission to Persia and to present your credential provided that Sir Harford Jones shall not have arrived, or that circumstances shall admit of the exercise of your diplomatic functions notwithstanding his arrival, in the manner indicated in a subsequent part of this despatch. ****** 81, If Sir Hartford Jones should have arrived before you in the Persian Gulph or should arrive soon after you, it will be advisable that you should sound him on the question ofPart I—Chap. IV. 11 your continuing to act as Envoy from the Government of India and in that character co-operating with His Majesty's Envoy. If however you should find that measure incom patible with a good understanding between yourself and Sir Harford Jones, or with the interests of the public service, it will then be necessary that you should refrain from the exercise of your diplomatic powers in Persia and should confine your character to that of Political Agent or Commissioner of the Governor-General of India. Government would in that event still have the benefit of your valuable advice afforded both to this Government and to Sir Harford Jones, and it might be expected that the happy influence which you have established in Persia would be efficaciously exerted in promoting the public interests in those countries. 32. If Sir Harford Jones should not be accredited to the Pacha of Bagdad or to any other neighbouring States, you would be at liberty to exercise your diplomatic powers in those countries. In the opposite case, you will still be enabled to act under the General Agency on the part of the Governor-General with which you are invested. 33. The delicacy of your situation with regard to the concurrent mission of Sir Harford Jones is duly felt and appreciated by Government, but a confident hope and expectation is entertained that the difficulties and embarrassments of such a situation will be surmounted by your temper and that any impression of discomforts or disgust to which your personal feelings may be exposed by the intervention of a separate authority, will be effaced by the superior sense of those important services which you are called upon to render to your country and to the world in a crisis of affairs more momentous than any that has ever yet required in this country, the exertion of individual magnanimity, ability, and public zeal. 28. The proceedings of General Malcolm at Maskat were reported to Secret and Poll. Lord Minto on the following despatch, dated 1st May 1808 :— No P 237 of y i808, I sailed from Bombay on board His Majesty's ship Psyche which had been appointed by His Excellency Sir Edward Peile to convey me to the Gulph on the 17th ultimo, aud on the 80th I arrived at Muscat anchored in the offing, and sent a message to the Imaum through my Moonshee Mahomed Hussen, to acquaint him that I meant to remain only a few hours, and hoped he would (considering the precarious state of the season) excuse my not landing, and send one of his confidential officers to see me, as I had a communication to make, which I thought of some importance to his interests. 2. The Imaum received the Moonshee in a very friendly manner, and sent one of his first and favourite officers, Mahomed Gholoom, to hear what I had to state. I shall shortly report for Your Lordship's information the substance of my conference with Mahomed Gholoom, whom I was glad to see deputed on this occasion, as he was an old particular acquaintance of mine and I knew him to be a sincere friend to the connection between the Muscat and English Governments, 3. I shortly explained the nature of my mission to him, and the general causes which had occasioned it: though the British Government, I said, did not give much credit to the reports of the designs of the French, it was its principles to be always vigilant and it hastened to meet every danger that threatened to approach its dominions, as it knew such conduct would always keep its enemies at a distance. English Government, I told him, had acted on all occasions towards the State of Muscat with singular moderation and generosity and had lately allowed it {rather than bring distress upon its trade) to maintain a friendly intercourse with the French. This indulgence, I informed him, there was no wish to withdraw unless circumstances required it, but that it was my duty to state to him, for the information of the Imaum, the precise line that Chief ought to adopt under every possible change ; if he meant to preserve the favor of the British Government, he must on no account, I stated, allow any French Agent to come to Muscat or to any other port of his territories nor permit any vessel, belonging to his port to convey a F'rench subject from one place to another whether in lndia 9 the Red Sea, or the Gulph, and he should under no extremity, I added, allow the French to take possession of any port or island in the Gulph, or to land in any place that was occupied by the troops of his Government; and if an attempt was made by that nation to seize any such port or island, the Imaum must give orders for his troops to resist them to the last, and to act on such an occasion in co-operation with the English should any of the vessels or troops of that State be in the vicinity, and not to hesitate to put the troops or vessels of the English Government in possession of any post they required for the purpose of effecting this object. Mahomed Gholoom here spoke of the neutrality which the Muscat State was so desirous to preserve. This I told him with some warmth was very well, if the French did not approach the Gulph, or the shores of India in any quarter where the Imaum could aid or oppose them j but in such an event if his master was not found to be a decided friend, he would most undoubtedly be treated as an enemy. It would be very strange, I added, if the Imaum considered in an equal |light a State to which he owed his prosperity and existence and one which possessed only the power to injure him by the casual capture of a few trading vessels belonging to his port. 4. I further informed Mahomed Gholoom at this conference that I had instructions to obtain a written engagement from the Imaum by which he was to agree to admit us to the possession of such of his ports in the Gulph as we might eventually require to enable us to resist any attempt of the French in that quarter, but* that I had not insisted upon this formal engagement because I did not wish by so public an act to precipitate a rupture^2 Part I—Chap.

IV. 13 30. Nothing of consequence occurred at this visit, except that the Sheikh made a very pointed enquiry regarding the Envoy's intention of pro ceeding to Court, to which he made a reply in general terms explanatory ^ of the nature of his appointment to this quarter. On the 12th in ^tlie morning General Malcolm landed, was received on the beach by the Sheikh, and then proceeded to his house where the party was entertained in the manner usual to the country. 31. As the Envoy's escort had not arrived he thought it right to order 50 men of*the Light Infantry of His Majesty's 84th Eegiment who were acting as mariners on board the Fsyche to attend him to the house of the Sheikh. This was the first party of British soldiers that had ever been landed at Bushire and their appearance seemed to excite equal admiration and astonishment. Nothing could exceed the attention which the Sheikh paid to the Envoy, since his arrival and this was more gratifying as he acted under the direct orders from the Prince Regent at Shiraz. 32. Captain Paisley was sent with Lieutenant Bruce to Teheran with 0 f General Malcolm's letter to the King, but when they had reached Shiraz, 1 g 08) p ^3^ their further progress was peremptorily forbidden and Malcolm himself directed to communicate with the Viceroy at Shiraz. The Court at Teheran was now completely under the influence of the French, who held out assurances of delivering Persia from the grip of Russia by friendly negotiation. General Malcolm saw now no other course than to leave Bushire and he embarked on H. M.'s ship Doris on 12th July 1808 with Mr. Smith and sailed direct to Calcutta to lay the affairs before Lord Minto. Captain Paisley was left to act for General Malcolm and to do duty as Resident in the Gulf and Lieute nant Bruce as his Assistant.14 Part I—Chap. V. CHAPTER V.

There seeming under these circumstances but little likelihood that General Malcolm will return into the Gulph, more especially in view to the objections that officer has himself stated in his last official letter to the Supreme Government of the 10th of July to repair to Bussora or Baghdad, it may be promotive of economy and convenience should the several articles provided for presents by the General and that may be still undisposed be as well as the tents and travelling equipage be transferred for the use of the Mission of Sir Hartford Jones, who will in that case furnish you with receipts for the same.

Diary July 1808, he had been pleased to express his approbation of th^ conduct of 1809 ' Sheikh Jabarah, then Governor of Kongun, on several occasions, and he ordered Mr. Bruce to send him a present. Soon after that period considerable confusion took place in the Government of Kongun ; Sheikh Jabarah was displaced and thrown into confinement by his father who now obtained possession of Government. This disturbance prevented the intended present being sent, and Mr. Bruce wrote to Mr. Sheikh Jabarah to inform him that it should be forthcoming at any time he chose to apply for it.1 Part I—Chap. V. 15 35. In February 1809 the Sheikh having made his escape from prison arrived at Bushire from Bahrein and applied to the Residency for assistance in his present distress, and 400 piastres in cash and other trifles to make up the sum o 500 piastres, were given him (Dr. Juke's letter to the Government of India) dated 18th February 1809). 36. In this connection we might read the despatch of Sir llaifoid Jones, dated at Konah, 7th February 1809, which gives an account of what he had heard to have been results in the Gulf of General Malcolm's proceedings during his last mission :— I have the honour to transmit the duplicates of my Despatches Nos. 1 and 2 and to acquaint Your Excellency that I moved from Schyras on the 23rd January and have prosecuted pp. 2069-^)72. ' my journey to this place honoured with every mark of distinction and favour from the King and Ministry that can be imagined. It is necessary, however, I should not conceal from Your Excellency that the measures adopted in India created a suspicion and distrust in the breast of the monarch, and his Ministers, that required some management to calm 'and tranquillize. Ihis however has fortunately been effected; but I lament I am obliged to acquaint Your Kxcellency that the measures above alluded to have produced serious distress and inconvenience to many innocent families as Your Excellency will perceive from the following extract of a private letter to me from Schyras dated the 24'th January :— ' Yesterday accounts from Mahomed Nebee Khan arrived informing the Minister that all the country from Rangoon to the southward was ready to join General Malcolm the moment he arrived and shake off the Persian yoke. The report of Jaffer Khan's son being with him lias ^ had some serious effect here, for all the Lacks [?) his tribe, amounting to 4 of o,0 K famihep, are ordered out of the city and Mahomed Zekia Khan has been ordered to see it executed : they aie to be dispersed in small bodies in different places. This Government are afraid or their rising in open rebellion on the arrival of General Malcolm if that person should be with him, 37. The result of Sir Harford Jones' mission was the conclusion of a Preliminary* Treaty on 12th March 1809, • Volume X of Aitchison's Treaties. ^ («) All treaties concluded by the Shah with European Powers were annulled. {b) The Shah engaged to prevent the passage of European armies through his dominions towards India. (c) The English were to assist him with troops or a subsidy if any European forces should invade his territories, and to take no part except as mediators in any war between Persia and Afgha nistan. Clauses (5) and (6) of the Treaty concern our projected occupation of the nc island of Karrak (see next chapter) and are quoted in full;— 5. If a detachment of British ti' oops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia, and by the consent of His Persian Majesty landed on the Island of Carrack, or at any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia, the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive Treaty. 6. But if the said troops remain by the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Carrack or any other port in the Gulf of Persia, they shall be treated by the Governor there in the most friendly manner, and orders fehall be given to all the Governors of Paristan that whatever quantity of provisions, etc., may be necessary shall, on being paid for, be furnished to the said troops at the fair prices of the day. 38. 'When the treaty was just signed, Harford Jones received news that the Governor-General of India had directed that the bill he had given to Persian merchants on Bengal to be protested, and that he had annulled his mission. Brigadier John Malcolm soon after arrived in Persia on his third Mission. .. 39. In return for the embassy from King George III, the Shah sent Hap Mirza Abul Hassan Khan on a mission to London, with the special object of clearly ascertaining who was to pay the subsidy, which he was entitled to receive under the treaty signed by Sir Harford Jones. The Government of India was ultimately saddled with the burden. »16 Part I—Chap. VI. CHAPTER VI. PROJECTED OCCUPATION OF THE KARR4K ISLAND, 1808-1809. 40. During his recent return voyage from Persia to Calcutta, General Malcolm had formed an important project—in fact it was a revival of an old and long cherished design—which would place us in a position to baffle the intrigues of our enemies in Persia and in the Gulf. This was to occupy one of the important Persian islands, preferably the island of Karrak. He supported his project by an array of arguments, which are quoted below :— firstly. —That in the event of an attempt to invade India being made by an Kuropean State, it was impossible to place any dependence on the efforts o£ the King of Persia or the Pacha of Baghdad unless we possessed the immediate power of punishing their hostility and treachery. Secondly. —That the States of Persia, Eastern Turkey, and Arabia, were from thfir actual condition to be considered less in the light of regular Governments than as countries full of combustible materials, which any nation whose interests it promoted might throw into a flame. Thirdly. —That though the French and Russians might, no doubt, in their advance, easily conquer those States, in the event of their opposing their progress, it was their obvious policy to avoid any contest with the inhabitants of the country through which they passed, as such must in its progress inevitably diminish the resources of those countries, and thereby increase the difficulty of supporting their armies—which difficulty formed the chief, if not the sole, obstacle to their advance. Fourthly. —That though it was not to be conceived that the King of Persia or Pacha of Baghdad would willingly allow any European army to pass through his country, but there was every ground to expect that th« fear of a greater evil was likely not only to make these rulers observe a neutrality, but to dispose them to aid the execution of a plan which they could not resist, and make them desire to indemnify themselves for submission to a pow^r they dreaded by agreeing to share in the plunder of weaker States—a line of policy to which it was too obvious they would be united, and to which their fear, weakness, and avarice made it probable that they would accede. Fifthly. —That under a contemplation of such occurrences, it appeared of ultimate import ance that the English Government should instantly possess itself of means to throw those States that favoured the approach of its enemies into complete confusion and destruction, in order that it might, by diminishing their resources, increase the principal natural obstacle that opposed the advance of an European army, and this system, when the Government had once established a firm footing and a position situated on the confines of Persia and Turkey, it could easily pursue, with a very moderate force, and without any great risk or expendi ture. Sixthly. —That with an established footing in the Gulf of Persia, which must soon become the emporium of our commerce, the seat of our political negotiations, and a depot for our military stores, we should be able to establish a local influence and strength that would not only exclude other European nations from that quarter, but enable us to carry on nego tiations and military operations with honour and security to any extent we desired, whereas without it, we must continue at the mercy of the fluctuating policy of unsteady, impotent, and faithless Courts, adopting expensive and useless measures of defence at every uncertain alarm, and being ultimately obliged either to abandon the scene altogether, or, when danger actually come, to incur the most desperate hazard to complete failure by sending a military expedition which must trust for its subsistence and safety to States who were known, not only from the individual character of their rulers, but from their actual condition and character, to be undeserving of a moment's confidence. Seventhly. —That there was great danger in any delay, as the plan recommended could only be expected to be beneficial if adopted when there was a time to mature it and to organ ize all our means of defence before the enemy were too far advanced ; otherwise that moment ary irritation which must be excited by its adoption would only add to the many other advantages which our want of foresight and attention to our interests in that quarter had already given to our enemies. 41. The proposal was approved by the Government of India and General Malcolm proceeded under their orders to Bombay in order to equip a fleet and force for occupying Karrak. Orders were at the same time issued to Sir Harford Jones to return from his mission. But he had left Bushire before the arrival of the orders. Meanwhile preparations were being made atPart I—Chap. VI. 17 Bombay for proceeding to the Gulf. The force was to consist of about 2,000 men, to be followed if necessary by 3 or 4 thousand more. 42. The following correspondence discloses the feelings of the Turkish authorities on the project of the British occupation of Karrack:— No. 27, dated Camp Mohumrah, the 19th February 1809. From—C. P aslet , Esq., Acting for Brigadier-General Malcolm, T 0 —jj, J3. Edmonstone , Esq., Secretary to Government in the Secret, Political and Foreign Department, Fort William. I had last the honour to address you on the 1st instant, and have now much satisfaction in reporting to you, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor-General in ^^ 2091-2095.' Council, that the present despatch conveys to India otficial intelligence of the termination of hostilities between Great Britain and the Porte. The definitive Treaty of Peace was signed by Mr. Adair and the Turkish Plenipotentiary on the 5th of January. 0 2. A despatch from Brigadier-General Malcolm of the 30th December announces to me the resolution of His Lordship in Council for taking possession of the Island of Carraek, and for the formation there of a permanent British Establishment. I have now the honor to enclose copy of my letter to General Malcolm in answer to that dispatch and of the several communications which I have made on that subject in conformity to his instructions, to the Resident at Bagdad and the Acting Resident at Bushire. 3. The Honourable Company^s Cruizer Fery has been for this last month past cruizing between Bushire and Carrack with dispatches to the address of General^ Malcolm, fiom Sir Harford Jones, having references I imagine to the operations which the General has been directed to pursue in that quarter, but I have not received any communication from His Excellency as to the nature of their contents. 4. By the enclosed copy of a despatch from the Resident at Bagdad in a,nswer to that which I had the honour to forward you in my address No. '6, His Lordship in Council will observe the sentiments of Mr. Rich concerning the light in which the Basha would be inclined to view the arrival of General Malcolm in his territories. The peace which has since been concluded between the two Empires must of course cause a considerable alteration in the feelings and politics of His Highness ; but the opinion of Mr. Rich appears to be, that e\en the occurrence of that event (which hns subsequently taken place) would not entirely remove his fears and alarm on the occasion. I shall however suggest to Mr. Rich that if circumstances should hereafter render it expedient for General Malcolm to debark nny patt of his force at this place or at Bussorah, the expression of any doubts or jealousies on the part of His Highness would in the present posture of affairs, appear to imply a degree of distrust in the honour and public faith of the British Government altogether as unmeaning and unfounded as it is injurious and indecorous, and 1 entertain little doubt but the representations of Mr. Kich on this point (if it should prove necessary to make them) will be successful in reconciling Hia Hin-hness to that arrangement should any change in affairs hereafter induce General Malco.m to consider it advisable to suspend for a time the execution of His Lordship^ orders concerning Carrack. Dated Camp Mohumrah, the 9th February 1809. From—C. P aslbt , Esq., Acting for Brigadier-General Malcolm, To— Claudius James Rich , Esq., Resident at Bagdad. In conformity with suggestions made to me by Mr. Manesty since his perusal of my despatch to you of the 6th instant I again take up the pen. p 0 l]. p e p^ Diary It appears to Mr. Manesty that no representation which can he made will have any No. 883 of 1809, effect in disabusing the Basha of the idea that the proposed establishment at Karrack will pp. be preiudicial to the commerce of Bussorah, if that subject is once touched upon. It may there fore be as well in your eventual communications with His Highness to avoid as tar as possible the introduction of that topic, and only to use the observations with which I have furnished you on the subject in the event of your being questioned by His Highness as to that parti cular point. With regard to general outlines of the arrangement, your communications may be in every other respect the same as those I before suggested j but in pursuance of my former ideas on the subiect of withholding from the Basha all direct and explicit communications to as late a period as possible, it may not be inadvisable, whenever the Pasha may interrogate you on tha subject of our preparations at Bombay, to speak of them as the prelude to measures, the policy of which is still under discussion, rather than to expose prematurely to his view that system of arrano-ement which the Governor -General has determined to pursue. It is needless to aiid that if General Malcolm actually have debarked at Karrack no further reserve will b e either necessary or advisable, and that you will of course in such case carry your communications to the full extent laid down in my preceding despatch, withholding however the commetc al question as much as possiblle and enlarging principally on the necefsity of occupying Karrack as a check on the politics of Persia and as a station by the possession of which ^e slv uul enabled effectually to suppress all future piratical depredations in the Gulph. 1285 F.D.18 Part I—Chap. VI Poll. Dept. Diary 43, it appears from a letter of Nasrullah Khan to Dr. Jukes, Surgeon in charge p. 2125 * 1 11 ^ ^ le K/esidenoy at Buahire, that when Sir Harford Jones had been in Shiraz, His Excellency reported that General Malcolm might shortly be expected in on the Gulf and requested that His Royal Highness the Prince would be pleased to allot the Island of Karrak for his temporary residence, and that a farman was accordingly granted that on the General's arrival he should reside on the above-mentioned Island of Karrak till such time as he may receive intelligence from the Ambassador of what were the agreements entered into between the two States. 4iL The projected expedition was however not destined to sail to the Gulf» for the tide of events in Europe was now running against Bonaparte, and his projects for the invasion of India had to be indefinitely suspended, if not entirely relinquished, and the Shah of Persia, likely to be disappointed in his hopes from his French allies, would now turn to the British for help. There was therefore no necessity now for an armed occupation of the Island of Karrak and to send an expedition for the purpose.Part I—Chap. VII. 19 CHAPTER VII. MALCOLM'S THIRD MISSION TO PERSIA-1810-1811. 45. The Preliminary Treaty concluded by Sir Harford Jones with the Shah of Persia on 12th of March 1809, had hound the British Government to aid Persia with troops or on default with an annual subsidy, should it be attacked by an European Power. This burden would probably fall on the Government of India. At the same time the Persian Government was bouud by corresponding obligation in case British India was invaded by the Afghans or any other Power. Under this treaty moreover the Shah had cancelled his treaties with France and expelled its Ambassador. In order to carry out obligations on our part and to see that the corresponding Persian obligations were carried out under the Treaty, which Lord Minto thought was binding on both Powers, was a task which, in his opinion, only an Envoy deputed by the Government of India would satisfactorily fulfil. Moreover, Lord Minto believed that the prestige of the Government of India, as an Asiatic Power, had been lowered by Sir Harford Jones' proceedings. To restore that prestige and to see to the carrying out of the recent treaty, and further to collect information required about the geography, history and manners about Persia, with which we were now bound by an important treaty of alliance. General Malcolm was considered the fittest man to be deputed for these purposes, and he was accordingly ordered to proceed to Persia as an Envoy of the Government of India. 46. Malcolm left Bombay with the following staff :— Captain Charles Parley Lieutenant Stewart . H. Ellis, Esq. A, Jukes, Esq. . , Lieutenant P. Briggs Lieutenant John Macdonald Lieutenant Little Secretary. 1st Assistant. 2nd Assistant. 3rd Assistant. Supernumerary Assistant. Ditto. Ditto. Ditto. Commandino: the escort. Mr. Surgeon Cohhoun . Mr. Surgeon Cannick Captain N. P. Grant Lieutenants Frederick, Martin, Lindsay, Johnson, Potteringham attached to Do. Ensign Monteith—Engineer .... Lieutenant Christie and Ensign Pottinger. Many of these played important parts in Persia subsequently. 47. During the voyage to the Gulf, Malcolm left Hankey Smith at Maskat to transact some business and proceeded to Bushire, where he arrived on 13th February 1810. He was received with due ceremony and pomp, and escorted to Teheran with the same attentions and honors as had attended him on his first mission to Persia in 1800. On his arrival at Teheran Sir Harford Jones did his utmost to balk Malcolm's movements and to discredit his position. But the Shah was determined to receive Malcolm with all the honors as had been accorded him on 1800, and Sir Harford Jones was at last obliged to accommo date matters with the Indian Envoy. The latter was received by the King on 23rd June 1800, with every demonstration of friendship and respect, and accepted the presents with evident pleasure. 48. General Malcolm and Sir Harford Jones then proceeded with the Persian Camp, which was moved to Tabriz in order to organize defensive and oUensive operations against the Russian advances; both the Envoys assisted the Persians much with valuable advice. 49. On their way to Tabriz, Sir Harford Jones received despatches from England, from the contents of which it appeared that the Home Government had determined still to regulate our diplomatic relations with Persia and20 Part I—Chap. VII. had in prosecution of this intention to repudiate the power and authority of the Governor-General in that direction, appointed Sir Gore Ouseley Ambassador to the Court of Teheran. These orders had been passed after the receipt of Lord Minto's reference to the Foreign OfELce on the subject of the future control of our Persian diplomacy. So Malcolm had no other alternative than to bring his mission to a close. He left the Shah's Camp on 23rd July 1811, loaded with magnificent honors, having been created Honorary General in the Persian service, and bestowed a newly created Order that of the Lion and Sun* He returned by way of Baghdad and Basrah. 1762 F.D.© Part I—Chap. VIII. 21 CHAPTER 1III. MISSION OF SIR GORE OUSELEY, HENRY ELLIS AND JAMES MORIER, 1811-1814.—DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PERSIA. 50. Sir Gore Ouseley concluded the Definitive Treaty in 1812, the basis of which was the preliminary treaty concluded by Sir Harford Jones. Some of the stipulations of this Definitive Treaty were altered in England, and in order to obtain the consent of the Shah to the modification, Mr. Henry Ellis was sent on a mission to Persia. Mr. Ellis accordingly, in conjunction with Mr. James Morier, then British Minister at the Court of Persia, signed with the State Government an amended treaty on 25th November 1814.* ^ e lft !I ll ? s0 7io a 1 4 es f shall quote below the article 10 of the Treaty bearing on the Persian Gulf : published in Ait- Should any Persian subject of distinction showing signs of hostility and rebellion take ^ison.. Treaties, refuge in the British dominions, the English Government shall, on intimation from the 0 ume Persian Government, turn him out of their country, or, if he refuse to leave it, shall seize and send him to Persia. Previously to the arrival of such fugitive in the English territory, should the Governoi of the District to which he may direct his flight receive intelligence of the wishes of the Persian Government respecting him, he shall refuse him admission. After such prohibition should such person persist in his resolution, the said Governor shall cause him to be seized and sent to Persia, it being understood that the aforesaid obligations are reciprocal between the contracting parties. 51. Sir Henry 'Willock was sent to Persia as the British Envoy in 1815, and arrived at Teheran in July of that year. 52. In 1823 the control of the British relations with Persia was trans ferred from the Home Government to the Government of India, and the Envoy of the Governor-General of India were substituted for the plenipoten tiary of the Crown. This change was accepted most reluctantly by the bhah, which was believed by him not only to be derogatory to his dignity, but dangerous to his power. The conflict between two rival Envoys representing the Crown and the Government of India, ending in the discomfiture of the latter had lowered the position of the John Company in the eyes of the Persians, while the British expeditions for the suppression of piracies in the Persian Gulf, ending in the occupation of the Kishm island, had impressed the Persians with the notion that the Indian Government was a very aggressive Power. 53. After the treaty of Turkomanchai in 1828 with Russia, opportunity was taken by British Envoy to purchase abrogation of the 3rd and 4th articles of the Treaty of 1814 by payment of 200,000 Tomans as one year s subsidy This had one further effect— increasing the Gulf between Persia and Great Britain. The Persian power was treated by us a negligible quantity, and Persia in its turn regarded our power with contempt. 54 —55. The British merchants had for long not even a commercial treaty on a solid basis to protect them ; Malcolm's Treaty of 1801, the Shah s Govern ment contended, had been abrogated by the Treaty of Tiie Jf that Treaty of 1814 provides that a commercial treaty should be concluded atter- wards, but this was not done at the time. The British representatives, Mr. Ellis and Mr. Morier in 1814, addressed a note to the Shah proposing that commerce should remain on the footing of the Treaty of 1801, but this proposal was never accepted. 56. In 1823 t a farman was granted by the Shah abolishing the export duty on horses, and another granted m Ibou t See Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. x. permitting British merchants to trade on the same duties as paid by the Russians. A commercial treaty was not con cluded till after the occupation by us of Karrak in 1839. 57.- On accession of Mahomed Shah in 1835, the crown resumed the control of our relations with Persia, and sent Sir Henry Ellis as His Majts &gt; Envoy.Part II.

One of these vessels had short y be fore taken an Arab ship, and Syed Sultan coming down from the tort with thirty or forty followers, went in the Cabrass brig and wounding forty men brou -bt on shore the others. They were kept as prisoners and employed at the ffuns'a&lt;'ainst his father. The French from Mauritius sent a vessel in return for the H Arab one they had taken and indemniaed them for their loss.

From Gwadur Seyf went to the coast of Africa and died there: he was some time at Mosambique with the Portuguese. a i t i j 59 On the death ot his father Sultan returned to Oman,_ and established himself through bis mother's relations to the exclusion of us brothers. His dominions consisted at this time of ttie Oman from Ras-ul-hud to Ivabora, a hundred miles to the westward of Maskat. Witbm this on the hills are two strong forts Uostak and Nukhel, he was never able to take. The first was in possession of bis brother Ahmed and the other of Malik bin Seyf, the head ot the familv of Yarabi of which tribe only about sixty men now remained He had nothing to fear from his brothers on the Coast o, Africa: be bad ZanzTbar port of Mombassaand Melinda and other places acknowledged him as they h^'done the Portuguese.

The goods of the Mussallim and Imam were reciprocally passed at the lowest rates in their respective ports, viz., 3 per cent, and the Turks would now as well as Persians conciliated him as much as possible on account of the Waliabi. 62A. Oman is surrounded by hills and mountains, in which were many cultivated valleys inhabited by independent tribes hereditary enemies to one another. Whilst they opposed, the W^ahabi could not enter Oman, but they were being gradually converted to Wababi faith, which calming their feuds united them against those of a different faith. The Wahabi thus had advanced close to Rostak. 63. \V ith Cutch, the Imam had merely a mercantile communication without any particular privileges. lie was in general courted by all the northern Mussulmen Afghans, etc., as they must come to him to o-o on pilgrimae-e to Mecca. © f 6 6 64. He had also a communication with Abyssinia and received slave girls and eunuchs yearly as presents and had intentions of setting a factory at Kapine a port to the eastward of the Straits of Babelmandeb. 65. The vessels at Maskat numbered fifteen ships from seven hundred to four hundred tons, and three brigs, 50 dows and 50 large dingeys at Sur and Jahelan, '260 dows and buglas and a great number of small dingeys were every year freight ed by the Maskat merchants to go to Bombay and Cutch. The ships went to Bengal and returning some went to Batavia and the Malay Coast, others touched on the Coromandel Coast and Malabar. The large dingeys which were the pro perty of Hindus went to Surat, to which they made two voyages yearly touch ing at Bownaghur for cotton, wool and oil seeds. Dows and buglas went the beginning of the season to Basrah, took in dates copper and horses while some of the large dingeys went to Bombay, Surat, Rajapore, and the Malabar. One or two dows proceeded direct to Goa and Malabar and the African Coast, 66. The articles imported were from Surat, coarse piece-goods, silk and cotton fabrics ; from Bownaghur, oil, cotton and gr;jin; from Bombay, iron, lead and other Europe goods ; Malabar, rice, spars and timber ; the Coromandal Coast calicoes and chints; Bengal, rice, muslin, sugar, silks and piece-goods ; Batavia, sugar and cloves ; the Malay Islands, spices, etc.; Zanzibar, couries, rice, wood, elephants' teeth, hides, wax, and gums and drugs; from the Coast of Eatar and Bahrein, pearls and black camalines ; from Bussorah, dates and copper ; from Persia, copper, hardware, drugs, brimstone, salt, carpets, cama lines, and dried fruits ; from Mekran, sheep, joaree and grain ; from Sind, cotton, cjoth, saltpetre, tallow, butter, grain, oil, hides and indigo; from Cutch, cotton, oil, silk, and cotton stuffs. On all these articles they paid 5 p.c. import duty, if they sold them ; if not, 2^ per cent. And every boat going up and coming down the Gulf must touch at Maskat. They had no export duty to pay.

THE POINTS OF DIFFEKEXCE BETWEEX' THE IMAM OF MASRAT AXD THE BItlTISH COVERXMEXT.* 67. The first point of diLference with the Imam arose from his partiality for the Erenchmen whom he had taken prisoners (paragraph 58 above). A vessel had also been wrecked on the coast at Masiras and a Prenchman, its joint owner, who was formerly a Surgeon in the French armies, named Manrelle, found his way to Maskat. He cured in a few days a wound that had been inflicted on one of the Imam's right hand fingers. He thus became a great favorite with Seyyid Sultan and introduced others of the countrymen into his service. At last he abused his favour and went off with a sum of money he had been entrusted with; and his countrymen knowing his intentions concealed them, which lost them much in the opinion of the Arabs. Under one pretence or other they had been all sent away and the only European in Imam's service was a native of Elanders, Justaigne, who had been shipwrecked at Maskat in an Imperial ship from Mahe. He had a wife and child in Bengal and on the conclusion of peace intended going to them. The Imam had also purchased a ship called Armenia, which the Erench had captured from the British and brought with their vessels to Maskat. 68. When the Bombay Government were apprized of this, the Resident at Secret acd Poll. Maskat, Captain Seton, was instructed (orders dated 31st July 1801) to remon-' mu , strate with the Imam that his enterteining Justaigne in his service, who must p. 427. necessarily be in the French interest, who appeared to volunteer its uniform, and was of a countiy now subject to that Government, could only be considered an infraction of the treaty entered into by His Highness with Mehdi Ali Khan and afterwards confirmed with the late Persian Envoy from the Su preme Government. The Imam was therefore asked immediately to remove this man and all other Erench subjects from his territories, inclusive of course of those lately arrived with the returned vessels from the Mauritius. Although the Government did not positively object against the Imam's purchase of the Armenia* yet they thought that it would have been more suitable and con sistent with the spirit of the connection between the Company's Government in India and that of the Imam, if he had declined to turn to his own advantage even in the way of purchase, any ship or vessel made prize of by the Trench from his friends the English. 69. It had once been customary for Chellaby and other Gulf merchants at Surat to bring the piece-goods intended for the consumption of Hasa and Kalif to Maskat, as the number of pirates made it dangerous to go to those places themselves. The Imam's ships freighted part of these goods, and the others they left to the Arabs on their paying them a small duty. This system was at last extended to every kind of goods that went up to the Gulph and Seyyid Sultan was particularly solicitous to extend it as far as possible. Mahomed Nabi and Hazi Khalil trading under the British flag however avoided it. Not knowing Mahomed Nabi's boat the Ahauh had a flag and pass or Company's property on board he ordered it to be seized by Swedi pirates, because it did not touch at Maskat. The Bombay Government despatched the ship Duncan with sepoys on board under the command of Captain Taylor to attack and punish the Swedi. Strong remonstrances were also conveyed to the Imam and the Ilegent at Maskat. The captured boat was offered back or indemnity in lieu of. lo have accepted the boat again or the indemnity would have given the Swedi tacit per mission to take every boat that had not a flag and pass, or, had they Company's property, they had only to return that, whereas the native property, trusted under the protection of our flag would be lost and the flag itself would cease to be respected. The Swedi was subject of the Wahabi. He was not so in any case till on repeated representations he drove them from under his protection and even then the Swedi came to him as if nothing has happened ready to • See foot note on page 26.28 Part II—Chap. X be employed when ho chose it. It became therefore necessary to cause a greater breach between them, and Captain Seton refused the indemnification he offered insisting on Imam recovering the boat from the Swediand punishing them for taking it, and he was certainly well inclined to it from a conviction of the necessity of satisfying the English as we set out a force of five hundred men. The Swedi were pursued but escaped to Hasa under the Wahabi's shelter. The Imam still held out the indemnification and after what had happened it was decided to accept it. Nasir Swedi was now a Wahabi and separated by religion from Seyyid Sultan. 70. With regard to the use of the British flag the Imam's complaint appeared to have been unreasonable, as the Arabs now went direct to Bengal and purchased silks and other goods they formerly bought at Surat, when they paid us a revenue now lost, and allowing his claim in the fullest extent, it was only the Surat goods Chellaby used to carry for Nejd, not the Basrah goods he had a freight on. The change was due to the road to Hasa and Katif being shut, and the goods now going to Basrah and thence to Graine, not to any change of system by the English^Part II—Chap. XI. 29 CHAPTER XI. ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH A FRENCH RESIDENCY AT MASKAT.* 71. The following correspondence on the subject of tlie attempt made to ^pt.

Translation of a letter from SyeA Seyf, to the Hon'hie Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay, dated 12th Rejeb or 29th October and received 14th November 1803. I have the pleasure to inform your honour that I wrote two or three letters a little while ag-o to Captain Seton communicating the occurrences and news of this place, particularly the arrival o/'Me French vessel and her departure, and the object of her coming for the Captain openly declared, their views were to establish a French Residency ; to which the Imam replied he could not possibly permit a man to remain for that purpose and it should not be done. The particulars of which were fully detailed in my former letter 4th Rejeb which I despatched by dow belonging to Ahmed bin Mohammad Sooree through the respectable Captain Seton to your Government, and I hope as this is now the 12th it has ere this reached your illustrious presence and that you have perused and duly considered its contents. It is now the 12th Rejeb and the French vessel left this iJTth Jamadee Sanee. I have not as yet been able to learn where she is gone; by the last accounts that arrived nothing particular, thank God, has transpired, and we are all here well and in perfect peace and security. In regard to the operations of the Wahabees, continual reports are coming in every day of the death of Abdul Azeez, the Head and Chieftain of that tribe. His brother was absent and he appointed his eldest son a Wahabee who was with him at the time to succeed to his titles and the power of his dominions. This has occasioned a rupture between them, all cordiality has ceased, and the brother and the son of Abdul Azeez are now at daggers drawn. I hope to God they may not be again reconciled. This much has yet come to my knowledge which I thought it my duty to communicate for your information. I have in the next place to inform you that Syed Sultan is gone on some particular expedition with the victorious forces to Mckran where he will remain for the space of 10 or 15 days and having succeeded in the object of hw views in that quarter will return to Muskat. He has appointed me in the meantime to act for him in the administration of affairs in Oman and its depend encies till his return from Mekran. Draft of a letter from the Hon'ble the Governor to Syed Sultaun Emaum of Muscat, dated 21st October 1803. I have been favoured with a letter from Syed Seyf notifying the arrival of the Fi-ench Secret and ^ Poll, frigate Atalanta at your port. The probability of this event and the nomination of a Resident 6?/^(9 ^ remain in your country I communicated through Captain Seton p 419 ' ^ ' who returned with the strongest assurances and promises on your part of resisting their settlement at your ports on any terms. These assurances were satisfactory and agreeable to me in the highest decree, as they were consonant to the Treaties existing between the two States ; and also to the advantage and well-being of the M iscat State since, if the French obtain a footing at Muscat on any terms or in any situation, all communication between Muscat and India must cease. It would be extremely disagreeable should I be obliged (which God forbid !) to have recourse to this measure, but being indispensAble with a view to the safety of the ships and property of this state, it must however reluctantly be adopted, if the French should be allowed to obtain a footing at Muscat.

THE CHARGES AGAIXST THE IMAM OF MASRAT AND HIS '''i Poll- EVPLAIVATION, 1804. Dept. Diury No. 158 _ ' of 1804, p. 2467. 72. Seyyid Sultan deputed his Vakil Haji Mahomed Ibrahim with a view to place certain facts before the Governor of Bombay (Mr. Duncan) and clear misunderstanding. He explained the facts in a letter addressed to the Governor dated 17th April 1804. 73. In the first place, he stated there was a certain person inhabitant of Who is Swedi or Suvedi ? His piracies. SoVedy of tJlB trib6 o/* Joncishim* who • Jowasim ? having offended the Sheikh left that place and fled for protection to Syud Sultan, and took up his abode in Hormuz; as Syud Sultan was at that time at war with the tribes Jonashim and Ootaob, he took this opportunity of ravaging and plundering these people by carrying on a piratical warfare in their coasts. It once happened that a botella belonging to the Mehedi Ali Khan from Bushire by which Mr. bruce had dispatched a Government packet was stranded on the Islands of Sheikh Syil and seized and plundered of its cargo. When the Imam received this intelligence he sent out his people for the recovery of the Botella, which \ he retook with the packet and what remained of the cargo, and though the vessel belonged to Bushire (with the people of which port he was not on terms of friendship) yet from respect to the Company's packet he gave back the vessel and forwarded the dispatches himself. He at the same time wrote to the Souvedy, in the most clear and positive terms, that if in future he were guilty of any outrage or disrespect to the property vessels or packets of the Hon'ble Company, he would put him to death and confiscate all his effects. 74. In another instance from motives of friendship and a wish to strength en the bonds of attachment and unanimity, he told Mr. Seton in the Vakil's Danger of sending Company's packets and goods presence that oil account of avei y boister- in small ships. Imam undertakes to convey them. qus weather and i'oughness of the sea in the Gulf at that season, it would he dangerous to trust the Company's goods or packets in small botellas or dows without people. He could be de pended upon to navigate them. It would be better when it should be necessary to send any goods or packets on small craft either from Bombay to Bussorah or from Bussorah to Bombay to consign them to him, or any of his agents that they might be forwarded on vessels of his own, or that he might ensure them, ^ a safe passage by granting them his pass or protection by convoy, by which they would reach their ports without fears being entertained for their safety. 75.

The Imam from Bombay OU a small VCSSel, Which attacks him. no t make Maskat, but after being tossed to and fro from the wide oceSn was at last taken and fell into the hands of this Souvedy ;t when he discovered that the vessel and cargo which he had plundered were English property, in consequence of the letter which he had a short time before received from the Imam in which he was warned by all that was sacred to desist from laying violent hands on the goods and packets of the Honourable Company, he thought that this destruction must be the inevitable consequence and from fear of death, and confiscation of his house and property went to Hormuz, and carrying off with him all the effects, 3* he had in that quarter, fled over to the Wahabis; when this intelligence reached the Imam he took with Mr. Seton, and went himself in pursuit of this renegade with his own fleet and army. When the contest took a turn and the field of action was transferred to the shore (as the enemy had left the sea and landed on the coast of the Wahabis), Syud Sultan was anxious to disembark his troops and seize him on shore, but Mr. Seton did not approve of t Written also Swedee. This was a consignment of gunpowder proceeding from the Company's Arsenal al Bombay to the Basha of Bagdad on the botella.Part II— Chap. XII. 31 the measure and the Imam returned. One man belonging to the Army of Seyyid Sultan was killed and several wounded. The troubles and expenses, which his zeal for the cause of the English Government led him into—by going himself in person, the equipment of his fleets and armies, the supplies of money from bis own Treasury, lie did not consider ; urged solely by wish to conciliate good opinion by supporting the cause of the Honourable Company. 76. On this occasion, stated the vakil, in consequence of a mis representation of facts by some persons, a sum of 8,000 Rupees was taken by the Bombay Government from Syud Syuf the Gomastah of Syud Sultan on account of the loss of this gunpowder, but had the circumstances of this affair been fairly stated, the British Sarkar would not have approved of such a proceeding and though so small a sum would be too trilling a subject for discussion between the two Governments, yet the circum stance would bring contempt on the head of the Imam from every quarter of the Globe. 77. When the French, continued the vakil, lately brought several presents The French offer of gifts and friendship de- and a lac of dollars ill n ady money to be dined by the imam. presented to the Imam and they wished to land and obtain an interview, Syud Sultan, sincere in his alliance and properly conceiving that the friends or enemies of the English should be considered as such by himself, refused the proffer of gifts, and to preserve the friendship of the English he considered not the danger of this own vessels and those of his subjects then at sea, but told them plainly and positively they must not land, that he would not give them an audience, or receive either their presents or their letters, he left his own vessels as well those of his subjects exposed to the danger of being captured by the Erench. 78. The vakil further stated that not long after this, it happened that some Visit of Frenchmen to Maskat tinder British Erenchmen airrved in a dingy from Goa, passport. Breach of neutrality by an English they brought with them a letter Signed man-of-war carrying them. ^ ^ Resident, with permission to return to their country. The Imam concluded that had it been necessary to seize these people, the British Resident or the Portuguese Governor (who was also on terms of friendship with the Maskat Shirkar) would not have granted them a passport. On their arrival an order was immediately issued for them to embark and proceed on the first vessel going to Zanzibar. There was nobody at Maskat, who understood English or who could read their letter or comprehend what it contained or by whom it was signed. They went on board a vessel bound for Zanzibar. The very day an English man-of-war arrived and the Erenchmen were taken prisoners in the inner harbour of Maskat. The Agents of Syud Sultan then sent off a message to the Captain to say these people had with him an English pass, and came from Goa, that if it had been proper to seize them the Resident at that place would not have given them a passport, that he must not make them prisoners in the Cove, and carry them off; because were an English packet or any other vessel to be riding in the harbour on the following day and a French Frigate were to put in, they in return would pay no respect to the (neutrality) of the Port and the English must suffer the consequences. The Captain refused to listen to anything of the kind and carried them off with him to Bombay. The Governor disapproving of the conduct of the Captain of the men-of-war, sent them back to Maskat and wrote to desire they might not be detained but sent off immediately to their own country. It would not have been very politic to have dispatched any of the Imam's vessels after having given such offence to the Yrench frigate. The Imam did not send one of the vessels to convoy them back, and as the season did not then admit of small craft going to Zanzibar lie embarked them on board a dow and sent them again to Bombay. 79. There was a complaint against the Imam of Maskat on the subject of Reception of the Sheikh of Nakhelo at Sheikh Rehma IS ekluvi, to the effect that Maskat. Ije been plundering the Company's property, and carried it to Maskat when he had sold it and desiring at the same time that the said property with the offender be delivered up to your honour.* On this matter, the Imam's agent stated that should a single particle of this property be landed at the Custom House of Maskat, or any of the brokers or agents gain any information of it, Syud Sultan would be answerable for its32 Part II—Chap. XII. Secret and Poll. Dept. Diary No. 158 of 1804, pp. 2370-2375. being restored. But tliere was lot of traffic carried on in the wide ocean unknown to the Custom House Officers or Brokers of Syud Sultan. Now in regard to Rehma's coming to Maskat he was deputed from the Utuhis, and to seize or refuse admission to au ambassador was impossible, Syud Sultan thought he could have obliged him by persuasion and inspiring him with a dread of the Company's vengeance to have restored the goods, he therefore received him as an ambassador, and sent for him once to confer on this subject, he urged him by every persuasion he could advance, and when he saw there were no hopes of recovering the property (and as the person of an ambassador is sacred all over the world) be could only refuse to listen to any overtures regarding his Mission, and he sent him from his presence without any hope of reply. 80. The Governor of Bombay replied on 25th April 1804, translation of which is given below: — Your letter comprising S paragraphs has come before rae, to each o£ which I have now to reply. In regard to the first on the subject of the Souvedy, you say that Syud Sultan prevented him from maldug further 'iepredations on the goods and property, and that accompanied by Mr. Seton he went forth himself to repulse him, all which is very true, but had Syud Sultan in the like manner prohibited his own agents from sharing the spoils of the gunpowder which the Souvedy had plundered, certainly would have remained with this Government, but that he did share this booty has been so clearly proved, you have not a word to advance in defence of it. In reply to the second paragraph that the Imam refused the presents of the French and would not allow them to land is certainly the case; this was the true spirit of sincere alliance and attachment, and in return for this ^reat attention on the part of Syed Sultan you have seen what took place here when the Captain of the man-of-war seized and brought away some Frenchmen from Muskat (though it was not inconsistent with propriety) after you told him that they came from Goa with a passport from the British Resident, and when upon demanding the said paper, it is well known they had nothing of the kind, anu though it waa bis attempt to deceive him that induced him to make them prisoners, yet as on every occasion I have done all I could to promote as far as lies in my power the interests of Syud Sultan, I could not approve of such a proceeding as that of taking them in the harbour of Muskat, and from a regard from the character of the Government of Synd Sultan and the respect due to his port I sent back to him these Frenchmen j and bes: you will now well consider what must have been the extent of my respect for the character and authority of the Sirkar of Syud Sultan when I sent them back after having once had them in my power. In reply to the third paragraph on the subject of Riohmeh Nukluvee in which you state that he was deputed from the Ootubees and came to you in the character of an ambassador whose person was sacred, and could not be seized—in the first place let me observe that in no state whatever are thieves or highway robbers admitted as ambassadors, then how could Syud Sultan allow a thief and a robber to come to his Court under auch a character; and in the next place, Jabier the son of Abdul Kideir whom Syud Sultan sent to me, told me himself that the son of Ruhmeh first camo to Syud Sultan; that the Imam gave an asylum and after making assurances to the same effect Rhumeh himself invited him to his Court, and that he told me this I have many witnesses; and Jabeir, moreover, alleged that Rhumeh brought with him the property he had plundered from the Hobble Company and sold it in Muskat harbour to Umbur Gholam Daood Khuleel who sent it to Judda, Was it consistent with the situation of Syud Sultan to offer protection or to invite any of the enemies of his Government, and in the next place, that the stolen property should be sold in the very cove of Muskat, and the subjects of Syud Sultan be the purchasers; and you say that all this took place without the knowledge of Syud Sultan, what can be more derogatory than for the proprietor or Ruler of a country to lie as to what is taking place in his own dominions and the transactiona of his subjects ? As the respectable Mehedi Ali Khan was the first who founded a friendly alliance between the two States, and now interesting himself as mediator, and you have come here to take upon yourself the adjustment of the unpleasant business, I have accordingly to propose that which here follows. What has hitherto passed with the Agent of Syud Sultan I look over and consider this day as the period from which we may date our reconciliation, and I now wash from my recollection all suspicions of these vile prac tices which have lately settled on my mind on the two following conditions that you and the Nuvab stand responsible for any future irregularities in the conduct of the Agents of Syed Sultan, or otherwise I will not interfere in future with the affairs of Syed Sultan, but submit them to His Excellency the Most Noble Governor-General, whose province it is, and who will pursue such measures as His Excellency may deem most suitable and requisite. The second condition is that Syud Sultan and Hajee Saheb must exert every means and expedient in their power to seize Ruhmeh Nukluvee ; it matters not whether they send him here, or detain him at Muskat; he must be imprisoned till he restores the Company^s property; it ia well known that the property is not lost, though it may take some time to recover it, yet if Ruhmeh withholds it (though at the distance of 70 generations after him) it shall ultimately by some means or other be recovered, and if the Syud Sultan will interest himself a little in this business, I shall have an opportunity of speaking in his favour to His ll &lt;xcellency the Governor- General.part II—Chap. XIII. 33 CHAPTER XIII. PIRACIES 1^ THE GULF, 1800-1805. DEATH OF SYUI) SULTAN OF MASRAT. RE-APPOINTMEKT OF RESIDENT AT MASKAT (CAPTAIN SETOX). 81. We now come face to face with the disturbances of the peace of the Gulf caused by piracies of the Joasmis, an Arab Maritime tribe in North Oman, which occupied our attention and taxed our military and naval energies to their utmost for the first quarter of the 19th century. Up to the year 18u4, the only piracies committed by the Joasmis against British ships were in the case of the Bassein Snow and the Viper. The Bassein Snow, under British colours, and charged with public des patches, was taken on the 18th of May 1797, off Ramse, by a fleet of dows belonging to Eas-ul-Khima : she was, however, released by the Sheikh two days after. In October following the Viper cruiser was attacked by the Joasmis, whilst at anchor in Bushire Roads, Ihe Joasmi dows had arrived about six days before the Viper, under the command of Sheikh Saleh, Chief of the Beni Joasmi Arabs, and nephew to the Joasmi Sheikh, who were at war with the Imam of Maskat. Their object was to intercept the Suri Arabs, who were at Basrah. On the day the Viper arrived, Sheikh Saleh had an interview with the Resident at Bushire, when, after the strongest piofessions of friendship, he stated what his views were, and begged that we would not protect the Sari dows, nor ship any British property on board ; but if we did, he promised that it should be held sacred. After these professions, Sheikh Saleh requested a supply of balls and powder from the Viper, ^hich having been furnished, he treacherously attacked the cruiser, but was beaten off. 82. The Resident at Basrah remonstrated against both these acts; they were met on the part of Sheikh Saggar by professions of regard for the English, contending, in respect to the attack of the Viper } that the cruiser had fired first on the dows. He stated that Sheikh Saleh left Ras-ul-Khima, separated himself from the tribe, had proceeded to the Persian shore, and there established himself among the Beni Khalid Arabs, marrying a woman of that tribe, which was one of a villanous nature and character ; that since the commencement of hostilities between the Joasmis and people of Oman, Sheikh Saleh had acted independently of Ras-ul-Khima, committing depreda tions according to his inclination; that the Joasmis had no disputes with the English, and considered the people of Oman alone as their enemies. 83. These disputes arose in consequence of the unsettled state of the Maskat Government on the death of Syud Ahmed, and the usurpations of Syud Sultan. He had involved himself in serious disputes with the Arabs of the Gulf, which brought on a war with many of them., who had united against him; and the Bombay Government conceived that those acts of aggression experienced by British vessels had been from Arabs in the interest of the deposed Prince of Oman. 84. In 1804 Syud Sultan met his death at the hands of the Joasmis. It was about this time that the Wahabis had gained a complete ascendancy over the Joasmis and the latter displayed a remarkable change for the worse in their depredations in the Gulf. In 1805 they captured two vessels, t e Shannon and Trimmer, belonging to Mr. Manesty, with public despatches, and treated the commanders with the greatest severity and cruelty, and a fleet of forty sail surrounded and fired into the Mornington cruiser, but a broadside or two compelled them to fly off. They were also co-operating with Mull a Hussein of Kishm, with whom they were allied, against Bandar Abbas and Mmao. 85. From the Gulf let us turn over to Maskat. On the death of Syud Sultan, the Governor-General, Lord Wellesly, thought that the circumstances required the presence of a Resident at Maskat and accordingly ordered the Bombay F34 Part II—Chap. XIII. Secret and Poll. Dept. Diary No. 164 of 1805, pp. 354-357. Secret and Poll. Dept. Diary No. 165 of 1805, pp. 968-976. Government to tike the necessary measures for this purpose. He wrote to Mr. Duncan on the 10th January 1805 as follows:— I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your official dispatch No. 32 , under date the 12th of December 1S04, communicating the intelligence of the death of 8eyud Soolfcan, the Imaum of Muscat, and the probability of the succession of his sons being disputed by the brothers of the late Imaum. 2. I deem it to be necessary without delay to furnish you with instructions for your guidance in this event, with a view to the preservation of the interests of the British Government at Muscat, and to the security of our trade in the Gulph of Persia, which may be exposed to hazard by the establishment of a Power at Muscat, less favorable to those interests, than the Government of the late Imaum. 3. The existing engagements between the Company and the Imaum of Muscat do not impose on the former any obligation to support the succession of the sons of the late Imaum to the rights and power of their father; but the nature of the connection existing between the Company and the Imaum, and cemented by the engagements concluded with that Prince in the year 1798 and 1800, justify the interference of the British Government in support of that candidate, whose pretensions shall appear to he founded on justice^ provided that support can be afforded without the hazard of involving the British Government in hostilities with the State of Muscat. 4. It is my desire therefore that every degree of countenance and support be afforded to the sons of the late 8eyud Sooltan which can be effected through the meaiife of the British influence at Muscat, and without engaging in hostilities with the opposing pqfrty. 5. Should the interests of the brother of Seyud Sooltan prevail against those of their nephews, it is nevertheless my wish to maintain with the ruling party at Muscat the same relations of amity which subsisted with the former Government, and 1 accordingly desire that you will enjoin the Kesident at Muscat, in the event supposed, to cultivate harmony with the successful candidates, and to endeavour by every means consistent with the dignity of the British Government to conciliate their good-will. 6. It will be desirable that the engagements concluded by Mehedee Ali Khan and Major Malcolm with the late Imaum should be formally recognized by the person who shall ultimately succeed to the Government of Muscat. W ith a view to secure the British interests at Muscat under any result of the contest for power among the relatives of Seyud Sooltan, it is essential that the British Resident at Muscat should be directed immediately to return to that station. 7. I accordingly desire that you will immediately order Captain Seton to proceed to Muscat, and that you will furnish him with instructions for the guidance of his conduct in the spirit of this dispatch. Should any impediment however oppose Captain Seton s return at the present moment, you will be pleased to select some other persons, properly qualified for the trust, and direct him to proceed without delay on the execution of the prescribed duties. 8. With a view to the maintenance of the British influence at Muscat under any issue of the expected contest, it is my desire that agreeably to the engagements concluded by Major Malcolm in the year 1800, a Residency on the part of the Company shall be permanently established at that station, under the superintendence of a Civil or Military servant of the Company of the establishment of Bombay. 86. The Bombay Government issued the following instructions to Captain Seton oq 3rd March 1^)5 :— The communication made to you previously to your recent return from Surat will have apprized you of the circumstances which render it desirable that you should resume your duties as Resident at Muscat, as speedily as may be practicable, and I am now instructed to convey to you instructions founded on order from His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General, for the regulation of your conduct under the recent change in that Government occasioned by the premature death of Seyud Sultan, an event requiring that measures should be adopted for the preservation of the interests of the British Government at Muscat and for the security of our trade in the Gulph of Persia, objects which (independently of the events of the intermediate period) might be exposed to increased hazard by the establish ment of a Power at Muscat less favorable to those interests than the Government of the late Imaum. ***** 6. With a view to the maintenance of the British influence at Muscat, under any issue of the contest of power among the relations of Seyud Sultaun, it is intended that, agreeable to the engagement concluded by Major Malcolm in 1S00, a Residency on the part of the Company shall be permanently established at that station, but, notwithstanding this intention it is not meunt, under the already experienced deleterious effects of the climate of Muscat on European constitutions, to restrict you from returning to Bombay in the month of August next or even sooner should the state of your health require it. 7. The most recent accounts from Muscat rendering it highly probable that you will find the late Imaum's son Salem in the exercise of the powers of Government on your arrival1 Part II—Chap. XIII. 35 there, a letter to his address is, in this expectation, enclosed, accompanied by a translation for your own information. Should, however, intermediate circumstances have placed the powers of the Muscat Government in other hands, you will abstain from delivering the letter to Salem. In such case it will become yoar duty to conduct yourself towards^ the ruling pai'ty for the time being in the spirit of that part of the preceding instructions which apply to such a contingency. 8. The suggestion contained in your letter of the 26th ultimo in favour of this Govern ment assisting Imaun of Muscat in chastising the Joasmees by affording the assistance of the cruiters on the Gulph, as may now be conveniently done through the means of the Morning ton already there, appears very advisable in as far as it may be found free of objection in respect to the Wahabee, who, from your report, would appear to have been formerly their protector. They are now said to have quarrelled with the tribe. Provided, therefore, that you shall, on your arrival at Muscat, have every reason to believe, that the Wahabee will not take offence at the intended coercion, it may (all other local circumstances continuing, in your view of them on your arrival, to render the same urgently advisable) be pursued or otherwise. As Mr. Manesty has intimated his intention to depute a proper person to Ueryah, to demand the restitution of the captured vessels and property, you may await the result of that intervention of which Mr. Manesty has been instructed to advise you, with all practicable dispatch. 9. In view to its being thus eventually determined to act against the Joasmees, a letter under flying seal to the Commander of the Hon'ble Company's Cruizer 2Iornington is now enclosed in which he is instructed to comply with all your requisitions and to remain in the Gulph, while you may require his presence. 10. On the ground of the suggestion contained in the concluding paragraph of your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Superintendent of the Marine has been instructed to prepare a small vessel as therein proposed, or if there be none such to arm the Queen in the mode desired ; upon which she is, after delivering her packet, to be employed in concert with the Mornington under your direction in the protection of the British navigation, by suppressing the pirates in the Gulph. The (^ueen is, in this view, to have 11 artillery men, under a good Serjeant, put on board of her ; and to be victualled till the end of August, as is also the Morninglon ; the supplies necessary for this purpose being as far as there may not be room for them on the Queen sent on board of the dingy engaged by you. 11. As the Queen must in the first instance proceed up the Gulph to Bushire and Bussora, with the Basha of Bagdad's ship the packet to Bussora, you should by the same opportunity write to Mr. Manesty tor the purpose of advising that gentleman of the views in relation to the suppression of the pirates, if still requiring to be hostileljf coerced and desire his advice as to the effect which any active proceedings against the Joasmees or any others may probably have on our national interests with the Wahabees or other Power on either coast of the Gulph; such as it may be perhaps in Mr. Manesty's power (through his local influence more particularly in the upper part of the Gulph) to avert. You will accordingly request of him and wait to answer, before our vessels enter on any offensive plan of hostility against the pirates ; unless as above observed the urgency of circumstances should for the protection of our trade and navi- tion call for speedier course. 12. In your proceedings towards the pirates, you are to be particularly cautious to act with the greatest moderation, to aim at pacification by means of negociation, and to avoid hostilities, at all events, with any classes of the armed boats and vessels belonging to either side of the Gulph which may have respected the British flag so as that we may not prove the aggressions in any instance. 13. You are likewise to correspond with, and to act generally in commerce with the views and advice of Mr. Bruce at Bushire, with a view to keep clear of all disputes with the Wahabee, or either of the two Governments of Turkey or Persia. H. It appearing by a letter from Mr. Bruce of the 12th of January that part of the crew of the buggla employed by Messrs. Yaul Loane and Houre, in the recovery of the Fly s packet were, after having been captured by the pirates—left at Busheab on board of a dow— supposed to be bound to Muscat, it is in consequence desired that your utmost endeavours in recovering and relieving those helpless British subjects in the event of your being enabled to obtain any information respecting them. 15. On this occasion I am directed to enclose to you, as received in a dispatch from Lieutenant Pasley of the 14th of January last, copy of the translation of a Memorandum from Munshee Muhamed Hussein at Shiraz respecting the position at that period of the Sheikh of Busheab, and other circumstances connected with seizure by him of the ship Hector. From the information of the Munshee, it would seem that some of the plundered property has been lodged at Ormuz, a point to aseertainment of which is recommended to your enquiring. If this should be found to be still the case, it may perhaps be in your power to effect its recovery through the good offices of the Muscat Government on which Ormuz is dependent. 87. Before leaving Bombay, the following objections were pointed out by 1805 Captain Setan to the establislimsnt of a permanent Residency at Miaskat Secret and (letter dated 20tli March 1805) :— (1) The Arabs had already consented to a person residing permanently pp- 130h3u among them, hut would not allow a flag or a factory.36 Part II—Chap. XIII. (2) The house they gave to reside in was extremely bad, consisting of three small rooms, eight feet square, with a space in front covered with a single mat, and as it was shut in with two dead walls open at the ends only; two of the rooms were of no use, having no windows. (3) It being impossible for three months in the year to live at Maskat, they allowed a house at Barka which was a mud building 25 feet square with an open cajim shed on the top, nine feet high, and flat roof, so that the rain came through in every direction, the lower part having no windows was only fit for lumber. (4) The distance from Barka to Maskat is only 60 miles; but there being an ascent and the weather hot, the best horses fainted under it. The accommodation on the road was the shade of a tree ; going to Burka was not much felt, as it is to a better climate, but returning had in two instances in Captain Seton s time and one before, proved fatal to Europeans. Those with him, 11 and 24 days after their return died of a fever and inflammation in the bowels. Doctor Bogle had died of a disease peculiar to the country, eruption all over the body, attended with fever and other symptoms, as in small-pox, which turning to large sores eat into the body, and destroy the patient. (5) The air of Maskat is such that none escape illness, but in some it attacks the spleen, in other the liver, the latter generally die, but the first on a change of climate, recover subject to relapse, again on a return to Maskat. It was therefore the practice of the Arabs to have offices at Maskat, where they come, for four or five days^ and return to the country again; the Hindus, Persians, and Baluchi who could not go far into the country had houses in the little bays near the coves, to which they retired occasionally. 88. Under these circumstances Government would only have to regret the lives of those they sent there, unless they put it, in their power, to live as much in the style of the natives so far as the difference of habit and education would admit of, In his view permission should be given to build a house or bungalow at Burka, and a double establishment for two houses should be allowed, and six or seven horses and as many camels for travelling should be provided, that he might be enabled to place relays to avoid exposures to the sun. The emoluments of the Resident of Maskat were 670 Eupees a month and the military pay and superior batta, without any establishment or expenses whatever. This might be sufficient to live little better, than in a private capacity, but could only by a most rigid economy be made to answer all demands. It was not allowed to better himself by trade or any other emolument whatever, and consequently if his health failed him, he must trust to chance and constitution for a recovery, not having the means of relief by a change of country and air, without finding himself in a state to begin world again with a broken constitution. 89. The Bombay Government thereupon addressed the following letter to the Governor-General in Council (20th March 1805):— Our daily expectation of receiving accounts of the reduction of Bhurtpoor, having- led to the detention hitherto of the packet for the Gulph has given occasion to Captain Seton^s laying before us the accompanying address on the subject of his situation there, the particulars in which being we have no doubt well founded, it will afford us satisfaction to be favored with the instructions of Your Excellency how far we may sanction the expenses that must prove necessary for the several accommodation therein pointed out, the amount of which may we presume be (as far as Your Excellency may be pleased to sanction them) chargeable to Bengal in consideration to Muscat being a Residency for general purpose and not solely or principally for the service of Bombay.

PERSIA'S PROTEST AGAINST HIS CO-OPERA TION. THE J OAS MIS BROUGHT TO BOOK AND TRUCE AND TREATY WITH THEM, 1805-1800. (i) POLICY OF SYUD BEDER. HIS INTENDED EXPEDITION I\TO THE PERSIAN GULF. 90. Captain Soton waited on 15th May 1805 on Syud Beder, and as Salim Secret and Poll, had delivered up charge of the Government to him, he kept back the letter for 16 ( 8 pt of 1 0 - Salem and in his compliments expressed the Governor's regret at having not p. 2862. heard from Beder. Syud Beder went seven times to see the Resident and his orders and actions were all meant to impress an idea of his strong desire May 1805 to cultivate the friendship of the English Government in India. He atten tively considered the treaties with Syud Sultan and declared he would not only confirm them hut add something more that would he advantageous to the English. Confirmation of the treaties was drawn up and he came to seal and deliver it&gt; but the crowd that came in upon him was so great that it was deferred and he sailed to Burka where the treaties were duly confirmed. 91. The object then of the AVahabi was to take Basrah and they plundered a village near that place and took many horses, camels, etc., and ordering Syud Beder to proceed with his fleet to Basrah as Saud was sending seventy thousand men by land. 92. Captain Seton gives the following outline of Beder's history. When the late Syud Sultan was absent in 1803 on a pilgrimage at Mecca, Beder attempted to seize the forts at Maskat but failing he fled to Zobaraand sought the protection of Abdul Aziz Wahabi, who ordered the tribes bordering on the Oman to assist him with them. He twice entered the country but was driven out and fled to Deraya. When Syud Sultan was killed, he was at Zobara, and a force was collecting to assist him. Hearing the news he set oif with three men to Kas-ul-Khima, where they were going to cut him off; but procuring a fishing boat he reached the Oman coast whilst Syud Khis was besieging Mattra and refusing any terms except surrender of all the forts into his possession. In this distress the sister and children of Syud Sultan gave up the management of everything to Beder, returning to the forts in their own power. Beder by his influence with the Wahabi caused a diversion towards Sohar which made Syud Khis retire. And an army of 4,000 Wahabis coming by land to his aid and 15 vessels by sea by Bahrein, he endeavoured to recover what Syud Khis had usurped from the late Imam's children, but the Wahabis perceiving this would make him independent of them stopped short and refused to act, ordering Beder and Khis to wait the division of Sehud and in this state they then remained. The Uttubi fleet returned to Maskat and entered the harbour with pieces of the winding sheet plundered from the Tomb at Kerbela, flying colours, and firing guns which set the women in the late Imam's zenana a crying and then screams were heard in the streets. In the evening when they called to prayer not a soul was in the streets and in the following night the Uttubis called in the old way which relieved the alarm. 93. An expedition sailed in a few days for Ormus with Syud Beder and the Uttubis. He requested that the might accompany them, with which request Captain Seton complied with. It might be, feared Captain Seton, that Syud Beder preferred the Wahabi to all others and should his fleet and that of the Uttubi fall on Sheikh Nair then at Husheab and destroy his ships, there would be nothing on the whole coast of Persia able to oppose them and they would go direct to Basrah which would also fall into their hands. Captain Seton however proposed to accompany the expedition, and promised to see that Beder did not act against the Persians or lurks. As ho38 Part II—Chap. XIV expected to be joined by the Queen he would be able to make them respect us without giving offence. The object of the Expedition to Ormus was to relieve Minab besieged by the Bani Mdi-en and recover Bandar Abbass. After that Syud Beder would proceed to Katif to confer with Saud who was expected to come there for that purpose. And it was also said that in prosecution of the former plan of the Uttubi's throwing of the Wahabi yoke, Syud Beder would protect them with fleet whilst they remove their families from Zobara to Baherein. 94. Should Syud Beder during the present expedition offer to give the English Bandar Abbass or a share of it and the Dutch factory. Captain Seton thought it would be well to accept them as a station for our ships and as that country produced sulphur, salt and copper in great abundance it would defray all expenses: the Persians being well affected to us there was nothing to fear by land, whilst two or three ships would protect it by sea against all the power of the Arabs; there was no place in the Gulph equal to it for convenience in respect to trade; its revenue was Rs. 30,000 yearly, which arose from chance caravans that came there in the cold weather. (ii) THE IMAM'S EXPEDITION AGAINST BANDAR ABBASS, 4ND THE BLOCKADING OF THE JO A SMI FLEET AT RISHM IN BOTH OF WHICH THE BRITISH TARE PART- PROPOSED PEACE WITH THE JOASMIS—1805. 95. Captain Seton embarked in the Mornington on 28th May 1805 and sailed Secret and Poll. Barka, w 7 hence the Imam had sailed the night before, and on the Dept. Diary 5th June found him lying at Kishm. The same night he stood over to Bandar fp 0 ieVws 05 ' Abbass and landing his troops invested the place. Captain Stton's 90. His object in going there had been the relief of Minab, besieged by July 1805. tbe 2dth Mulla Hussan, but the latter had raised the siege before his arrival. Syud Beder's force was about a thousand men, and fifteen hundred Uttubi. Witli these he was in hopes of forcing Mulla Hussain to give back the Bandar, and restore matters to the same state they were in the Sultan's time, and sent the Uttubi Sheikh to propose terms to this effect at Kishm. But not wishing for peace, they brought back an insulting message and excusing themselves from remain ing longer with their vessels, as they were heavy loaded, set sail and left him. 97. As the only chance of restoring peace in the Gulf depended on res toring the Maskat power to the state it had been before the disturbances broke out, it was necessary in Captain Seton's opinion to get back the places seized by the Beni Main Arabs: as all the neighbouring countries, Kishm, iias-ul-Khimah, etc., drew their supplies of dates and grain from Minab, the possession of * that and the Bandar obliged them to depend on their owner for the necessaries of life particularly when he was strong at sea. 98. Captain Seton saw Syud Beder in the morning of the 6th June. He had then driven the garrison within the walls and got possession of a house near them, where he intended to raise a battery. His boats had made some awkward attempts at battering the fort, but were so injudiciously placed as to do no harm. 99. He left the management of his ships to Captain Seton and Captain Gilmour. Having got 4 guns and 25 Europeans with the first and second officer on board, they birthed her in a proper situation and on the 7th in the morning opened fire on the fort with great effect, and being well seconded by a dow nearer the shore, the enemy offered to surrender, if not relieved in two days; but as it was more than a probability this would be the case, their offer was rejected, and on the 8th in the evening Lieutenant Nathl. Gilmour, first officer, having carried the Ounjava on the opposite angle to the other vessel, the garrison perceived they would have no shelter from her fire without exposing themselves to that, from which they had first fled, and surrendered at discretion. 100. On the 12th Khaji Salmoon arrived at the Bandar and reported that Shaikh Nasir was employed against Eusheab. Captain Seton offered to return with him, if assistance was required ; but the said Sheikh Nasir's force was more than sufficient.Part II—Chap. XIV. 39 101. On the 15th the fleet went o'ver to Kishm, as Captain Seton expected to find a fleet of Joasmi boats said to be coming there ; but on their arrival seeing none, the British vessel remained inactive. The Imam having only about eight hundred men independent of the garrison, was unwilling to risk them on shore, where the Joasmi could land three or four thousand and destroy them; he therefore determined to blockade Kishm, and returned to Ormuz. 102. Syud Beder returned to Captain Seton 45 bales of broad-cloth which* Sheikh Rhemah had lodged at Ormuz and would have given him the ♦ See ChapterXIX. people who had plundered the wreck of the Cypher, but not knowing what to do with them, he declined receiving them. 103. On the 3rd of July they had certain information of the Joasmi intending to come to Kishm. On the 5th at daybreak, their fleet of 30 small boats entered Kishm, having about a thousand men onboard. The Imam's fleet with the Mornington immediately made sail and anchoring off Kishm blockaded them. 104. They had now no choice but to come out and fight, make peace or remain and starve. The first they were not strong enough to do even with the joint force of Kishm, and they sent to Syud Beder to make peace. This he could not do without excusing the late Imam's death, but his presence being required at Maskat, he made a truce for seventy days at the expiration of which time the Bassorah fleet consisting of 60 dows and three or four thousand men sailing from Maskat, would admit Beder's recovering from the Sheikh of Kishm what of the late Imam's possessions he still held and punishing the Joasmi for his murder. 105. On the British part, Captain Seton required them to make good, all the losses, they had occasioned us and return the Trimmer, with assurances of their not being guilty of piracy in future. They were ready to make peace, and asbamed of what they had done, but unable to make good our losses, they proposed a subscription among their principal men ; but on calculating the amount, it was found to be only 10,000 Rupees and that to be paid only by instalments. 106. As Mullah Hussain was anxious that Captain Seton should settle with the Joasmis, the latter agreed that if they returned the Trimmer to him at Maskat in 25 dnys, with a letter for the Honorable Governor express ing their sorrow for what had happened and their inability to repair our losses as justice required, but assuring him it would never happen again, he would make a truce until the Governor's pleasure was known, and if he granted peace on these terms, the Trimmer should be restored. Mulla Hussain said that this would be complied with but wished Captain Seton to go on shore and make an agreement with Sultan bin Saggar their Sheikh, who was there in person, but as he found they wanted him to make agreements with regard to their going to India, which was not authorised to do, he declined and sailed for Maskat. (iii) ALARM OF THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE OPERATIONS AT GOMBRUN. EXPLANATION OF THE BRITISH PART PLAYED THEREIN—180a. 107. In the opinion of the Bombay Government there seemed on the whole but little reason to apprehend that any umbrage could be taken by the Persian Government at the degree of indirect assistance which under Captain Seton's orders appears to have been atforded to Syud Beder, the party now in authority at Maskat, for recovering that place out of the hands of Mullah Hussain, the ruler of the adjoining Island of Kishm, who availing himself of the troubles that followed the death of the late Imam of Maskat possessed himself of that place and harbour which had for years past been held by the MasTcat family in farm from the Persian Government together with considerable extent of the same line of coast. 108. The Persian Government, however, displayed much alarm at the opera tions conducted by the Imam of Maskat at Gombrun, in which the British had40 Part II—Chap. XIV, taken a part. The following correspondence in the matter shows how the opera tions were viewed by the Persian Government on the one hand and the British authorities on the other :— Dated Bushire, the 30th June 1805. Fron— Libctenant William Bbucb , Acting Resident at Bushire, To— C aptain D avid S eton, Resident at Muscat. Secret and Poll. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 4th May, which Dept. Diary No. 171 reached me on the 2Uth instant per the Queen. On the same day I waited on His Excellency the of 1805, pp. 4343- Persian Ambassador and enquired of him whether the Benemain, the Shaiks of Lingua and Shinas were under the protection of the Persian Government and whether our acting hostilely against them would be agreeable to the latter. He at that time answered tney were subjects of Persia but their allegiance was very precarious in general and entirely depended up^n the state the country was in at the time, and he did not suppose there would be any objection to our punishing tbem if they had acted in any manner deserving of it. In your application to me you mention that I shall have time enough by the ret urn of the Queen to get answer to any applications I might make to Shiraze as to the propriety of your acting hostilely against the above mentioned tribes. I should agreeably to your wish have made an application oi» the subject to the Shiraze Government, but being too well acquainted from txperience of the dilatoriousness of the Persians in answering any applications on matters relating to the redress of grievances on our part (for instance the unfortunate Nuckheloo business) and knowing ti'at it must be referred to Court before the Shiraze Government could presume to give answer and which would occupy some months, at l^ast 3 or 4. I thought it advisable not to do it, but merely to know tue opinion of the Persian Ambassador on the subject which I before mentioned, but I have to observe to you that his opinion related to these tribes inhabiting the islands and not any part of the Main. It has since turned out very fortunate that I did not make any application to Sheraze on the subject ; for yesterday evening His Excellency Mohumtned Nubee Khan sent to me wishing to speak ^itii me. of course went and was not a little astonished after having received your advices of the 4th ultimo when he read me a letter from Cheragh Allee Khan and Firmaun from the in nee mentioning that official accounts had been received from the southern ports and from Mulla Hussim Mainie that Said Budder with a fleet accompanied by you in a ship o£ war had attacked Gombroon and reduced the town and fort, and that Said Budder had taken the latter which he would not have been able to effect without the assistance you afforded him. I he letter and Firmaun mentioned that this was very strange conduct on our part to act in such a hostile manner towards them, while such good understanding existed between the two nations and to enquire of the Resident here how such circumstance could take place and for what reason we should act in such a manner, while they were exerting themselves to give us everv satisfaction for the plunder and ill-treatment of British subjects at Nuckheloo. 1 answered the Khan that the accounts sent to Shiraze must certainly be false, for that you would never co -operate with Said Budder in hostile measures against any of the subjects belonging to His Majesty the King of Persia; that so far from it you had made an application to me to know of some particular tribes were under the protection of the Persian Government or not, on purpose to avoid giving the least shadow of offence ; but that I should taice the tirst opportunity of advising you on the subject, and that I had no doubt but that the answers would prove the accounts forwarded to Shiraz to be false. As the different tribes mentioned in your letter are under the protection of the Persian Government and as no regular complaint has as yet been made to them for the restitution ot British property and the redress of grievances on our pirt, which were ever done and denied us, I should then think it proper in us to act in such a manner as to force it, but not till then unless we saw them in the very act of piracy. I have to request your answer as soon as possible by the return of this boat whi^h I ha\e taken up for the express purpose of giving you this information and to acquaint you that I do not think it advisable in you to act in an offensive manner against any of the ports or islands on this side of the Gulph as it may interrupt the harmony now existing between the two nations and even to go so far as to stop the Embassy now on foot from proceeding to Calcutta unless it is against Nuckheloo and Busheab; and these not unless it is at the particular request of Shykh Nassur, in which case should any blame arise it will fall on Ir.m and not on us. Retolution of the Bombay Government, dated 4th September 1905. Ordered that copies of the above papers be sent to the Resident at Muscat accompanied by an expression of our concern that he should have given the umbrage he appears to ave done to the Persian Government in taking any part in the recovery of Gombroon tor e Muscat Government, considering that his instructions so fully cautioned him against every occasion of offence towards the sovereigns of either Persia or Turkey.Part II—Chap. XIV. 41 Ordered that the acting- Resident at Bushire be advised of the precedin? intimation to Captain Seton, and instructed to represent through the Ambassador (if still at Bushire) or otherwise to the Government at Sheeraz in the event of any dissatisfaction still remaining in their minds on this account, that considering how clearly Captain Seton was in his instructions cautioned against any act that might prove in the least degree of offence to the Persian Government (of which his application to Mr. Bruce respecting particular classes of the piratical depredators in the Gulph is in proof), should he have been led to afford any assistance to Seyed Peder in the recovery of Gombroon, it must have been in the idea and belief that instead of counteracting he would thereby he promoting the views of the State of Persia, in restoring a place to the Muscat Government which it is understood to have long held in farm from that of Persia and of which he musk have been maile to understand that the piratical powers in the Gulph had forcibly taken posses-ion contrary to the intentions of His Majesty the King of Persia in the course of the confusion into which that quarter was involved immediately after the dvath of the late Seyed Sultin of Muscat or otherwise. It could never have entered into Captain Seton's mind to adopt any step in the most remote degree obnoxious or disagreeable to the Persian Government with whom he so well knows that it is so much the object of His Excellency the most Noble the Goveraor-Geueral to cultivate the most perfect harmony. Dated Muskat, Ist August 1805. From— Ca-PTain David Sbton , Resident at Muskat, To— Mb. William Bbucb , Acting Resident, Bushire. I have bean favoured with yours of the 8th instant, and duplicate of the 30th ultimo, Secret and Poll the original is not yet arrived. Dept. Dj ai7 I am extremely sorry the Court of Shiraze wxs allowed to receive the first accounts of ^ 0 ' being employed against the Joasmee pirates from our enemies ; and you may assure the PP ' Ambassador that the JEnglish ship did not fire a gun, as K.ha ijee Sal moon, who was present, will inform him; and how much I respected the subjects of the King of Persia, although they were harbouring notorious pirates who had plundered our vessels. Bunder Abassee, by a Firmaun, was granted t3 the Emams of Muscat, and they paid tribute* on the death of Seyud Sultan, it was given by the Vali in charge to Mulla Hussim Mainie to redeliver to the successor of Syud Sultin, and on Seyed going to demand it, they fired on him. Our vessel was present but did not fire. 1 lent some of our people to the Arab vessels and the Kheledan making this a pretence for giving up his charges surrendered and told Mulla Hussim, that, should the English open their fire on him, he would nob have a place to hide his wife in; under this impression he wrote to Shiroze, but finding afterwards we did not fire, he came on board ship to ma. told what he had done, and warned me to prepare myself for a complaint from Court. I do not know whether he will write to rectify' his mistake, but your informing Mahomed Nuby the circumstance will be sufficient. It is to be regretted you did not communicate my being in that quarter to the Court of Persia; in every point of view they ought to have known it. I was serving and protecting their subjects, more than ten of their vessels were conveyed by the Arab fleet, and by us, in safety. You appear ignorant of the connection between the Joasmee and Mainie, that Shaikh Gadeef o£ Lingua and Shinass is the person who plu-idered the Shannon, and also that the tribes on the islands and the main are the same—that the very Shaikh who took the Trimmer, Sultan ben Sugger, was with forty boats and thousand men at Kishm where respect for His Majesty of Persia prevented our burning his fleet, and we simply shut him up till he promised to send back the Trimmer and refrain from piracy in future. Extract of a letter from Captain David Seton to the Honourahle the Governor, dated Muscat, 14th Secret and Poll. August 1805. Dept. Diary No. 171 of 1805, Enclosed are some papers from Mr. Brace which I suppose reached by the Margarett, ^ ^-il—4345. and have to regret my answer did not then accompany them. The Bushire people are extremely jealous of any settlement being made at Uunder Abass, which induces them to make a noise whenever Arabs get possession of it. Shaikh Gadeef of Lingua on the Persian side of the Gulph is a Joassim by birth, uncle to Sultan ben Sngger of Rassul Khemeh on the Arabian shore and a Wahabee by religion, and pays tribute to Sohood, the present leader of that rising sect; but living on the coast of Persia, he calls himself, when it suits his purpose, a Persian subject though he obeys no order but what pleases him. Mulla Hussain (the Chieftain of the Isle of Kishm) is father-in-law and cousin to the same Sultaun, and in the same predicament with Persia. Their boats cruize with the Joassims, they receive and shelter and supply their wants in their ports, and as the trade is obliged to go along the Persian Coast, they can ^ally out on it, an advantage they would not otherwise have.I 42 Part II—Chap. XV. The Persian Court know all this and had Mr. Bruce informed them of my being there, they would not have been surprised at Mulla Hussim's letter, as they must well know, it is impossible to do anything in this Gulf without some one of these nominal powers being hurt. The Morninglon and Minerva sailed last mght in company. I wrote Mulla Hussain to know why he had not sent the sulphur and the Trimmer, and telling him that I would renew the war again, if his answer was not agreeable one. It is impossible to continue hostilities without offending the Wahabeeor Persians and it is safer to do the latter, than the first for they increase every day, and can bring seventy thousand men into the field, whilst the Turks cannot trust themselves without their walls, nor the Persians make head against the Russians * who are overwhelming them. Shaikh Nassur is still at Busheab ; they say here, he fires a few suns every day, and at night goes on shore to dine with Shaikh Rehma; one of the last ships that arrived said he was looking for assistance from the Morning ton which will be odd after refusing it, but 1 imagine the report unfounded or Mr, Bruce would have wrote to that effect. Resolution of the Bombay Government dated Ath Seplemler ISOo. Ordered that copy of the Extract of the letter from the Resident at Mu«kat dated the 14th ultimo and copies of correspondence between that officer and the acting Resident at Bushire be transmitted to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Fort William, with notice that as the pirates against whom, their late depredations led to our equipment of the force now in Gulph of Persia, appear to be thus connected on both the shores ol it, so as to claim the protection of the Wahabie or King of Persia as may best suit their views of plunder and security, it becomes peculiarly difficult to pursue measures towards their suppression without giving offence to either or perhaps to both Powers ; at the same time that from neither ean effectual redress be expected in the event of our trusting implicitly to such interposition, as has V been exemplified in the case of applications unavailingly made for length of time past for the recovery * of the goods plundered from the Hector by Shaikh Kehma, the Chieftain of Nuckheloo and Busheab which according to all accounts is likely to terminal e in the ineffec tual and collusive shew of assistance adverted to in the last paragraph ot Captain Seton's present address. Ordered that the Commander of the Margaret be called up to explain why he did not remain at Muscat (when last there) 24 hours according to his instruction, as reported by the Resident at that station. Under these circumstances, it must afford us great satisfaction to have the benefit of the farther instructions of the Supreme Government how far we may act in suppression of the pirates sheltered as they thus are by powerful however indirect protection on either shore of the Gulph, and meanwhile it should be enjoined to Captain Seton to adhere to the letter and spirit of his first instructions, by undertaking nothing that may give umbrage to the Persian or Turkish Government without our previous sanction and acting for this purpose in concur rence with the opinion of the Acting Resident at Bushire, and consulting him and the Aeting Resident at Bussora, on all applicable cases. The Acting Resident at Bushire to be furnished with a copy of Cstptain Seton's letter of the 14th of August and advised of the instructions thereon issued to that officer inclusive of a full copy of this minute, desiring him thereon to report his sentiments as well to Captain ^ Seton as to this Government on the best means of suppressing the pirates and extending the requisite security to the British navigation in the Gulph, without giving offence to the Persian Government, which it is in every respect our wish to avoid of all which the Supreme Government to be advised. (iv) Treaty of Peace with the Joasmis, 1806. 109. In the month of October an Agent arrived at Maskat from Mulla Hussein, deputed by the Joasmis to negotiate a peace for them. The instruc tions of the Bombay Government having been applied for, Captain Seton was informed, that in the event of its becoming a party to the peace, it should not be of a limited nature, but extend generally to the whole Gulf, and every other place and situation, and he was to require full indemnification for the losses we had sustained. 110. Captain Seton, finding it impracticable to obey the orders of the Government to obtain the required indemnification without having recourse to hostilities, which would have involved us in a general warfare with tbe whole Gulf, judged It advisable to enter into the agreement, dated the 6th of ^February 1806, with the Joasmis the whole bulk of whom he represented as desirous of returning to their former mercantile pursuits. This agreement does not appear to have been negotiated with the consent, or even with the knowledge, of the Wahabi Shaikh. * Vide paragraph 148 et seq. below.Part II—Chap. XIV. 43 CHAPTER XV. EXPEDITION AGAINST THE JOASMIS IN 1809-1810! 1\S- TUmiO\S TO Mil. BUNCE, NEW KESIDENT AT MASRAT. 111. The Joasmis continued true to their engagements in every point that regarded the British; but they Bombay Selection no. XXJK co-operated in the following year witli Syud Beder, the Imam, in an attack on Syud Ghes, who had refused to become a party to the peace, which he could not in honour do until he had revenged the blood of Syud Sultan. 112. Precluded by the Treaty of 1806 from carrying on their cruises in the Gulf, and urged by the Wahabis, the Joasmis extended them to India. In the month of April 1808 they made their first appearance as pirates in the Indian Seas on the coast to the northward of Bombay. The VVahabi Shaikh had long contemplated the extension of piratical cruises to India. r lhe Joas mis had by a late order of the Wahabi been rendered independent of their lawful Shaikh, Sultan, who had at this period nothing left but Ras-ul-Khyma; Eamse, IShargah, and other places sent out their boats without his permission. Gadif, an Arab Chieftain of the Joasmi tribe, on the Persian main, was averse to piracy; but his subjects, cut off from trade on account of the general disrepute of their tribe, sought a livelihood in the vessels of others. These piracies (as stated by Captain Seton) ' can only be considered as a general one at the instigation oi the Wahabees.' In one cruise in this year they captured twenty country boats, which so elated them that they deter mined on sending a fleet of fifty towards Sind and Kutch. 113. On the 20th of October they committed a breach of the Treaty of 1806, by attacking and capturing 'the Sylph cruiser, in the Gulf of Persia. She was re-taken by H. M.'s frigate Nereid, which was in sight when the Joasmis boarded the cruiser, 114. In 1809 the Wahabis directed the Joasmis and the Uttubis to proceed against Grane. The latter excused themselves, but the former offered to go if they were supported by ships. 115. The Persians from Lar attacked the Joasmis at Lingah, and the town of Cbarrack, and compelled them to retire to Bassidub, in the island of Kishm. The Joasmis were jhowever successful against a fleet fitted out by Mahomed Nubhi Khan against Khor Hassan, which twenty-two Joasmi boats encountered, beat, and took six of the Bushire vessels. 116. The Wahabi Chief having appointed Hussein bin Ali, a Joasmi, and who was the Shaikh of Bamse, his vicegerent in the Seer principality, vested him with authority over Ras-ul-Khirna, and nominated Wahabi officers throughout the Joasmi country. Sheikh Sultan, the Joasmi Chief, having been invited to Deriah, proceeded to that capital, and was detained and imprisoned by the Wababi Chief. He contrived to escape from prison, and finding his way to Yemen, embarked at Mocha, and, proceeding to Maskat, made overtures to the Imam, besought His Highness's protection, disclaiming all countenance to, or concurrence in, the attack of the Sylph, and professing on this occasion a desire to conform to the Treaty of 1806. The Imam took him to Shargah, and placed him over the Joasmi tribes at that place, Sheikh Sultan occasionally living at Lingah. 117. The British Government, determining to relieve the Imam from the power of the Wahabis, and to suppress these piracies, an expedition proceeded to the Gulf under the instructions dated the 7th of September 1809. Their first operations were directed against Bas -ul-Khima. The attack commenced by a bombardment during the 12th of November. On the follow ing day, the Joasmis were vigorously attacked by sea and land : after a bloody but ineffctual resistance they were driven into the interior of the g 244 Part II—Chap. XV. country. The town, with the vessels in port, amounting to upwards of fifty, with the English prize ship the Minerva, were burnt. 118. The Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khima, in the most insulting manner, had the audacity to demand a tribute from the Government to allow British ships to navigate the Persian Gulf in safety. 119. Prom Ras-ul-Khima the armament proceeded to Lingah, where twenty dows were destroyed, the inhabitants abandoning the town on the approach of our ships. Finding no vessels in the ports of Congoon, Bunder and Homer am, the armament proceeded to Luft, situated on the north side of the island of Kishm. The town was soon taken possession of by our troops, but the unexpected strength of the fort, and the desperation with which it was defended, frustrated every attempt to carry it by storm. All the essential objects of the attack were however fully attained ; their boats ard dows were completely destroyed. The bombardment having continued, Mulla Hussein surrendered the place, together with property to the amount of two lakhs of rupees, belonging to the Imam, which, with the fort, were delivered in trust for the Imam to Sheikh Dervish, the head of the Beni Nairn, a tribe of Arabs who have always been firmly attached to His Highness. On the reduction of Luft, the armament proceeded to Maskat. The commanders of the expedition expressed their readiness to co-operate with His Highness in the recovery of any other of his ports. He proposed to accompany the armament with a considerable force to the attack of Shims and Rhore Fakavn. 120. They reached Shin as on the 31st of December. A summons to surrender a n isoq - i sin being unattended to, it was immediately bombarded. The fort, however, being too distantly situated to be reduced by those means, the troops were landed, those of His Highness taking up their ground on the left of the British. A battery having been raised and completed on the evening of the 2nd of Janu ary, a breach was made on the morning of the 8rd. It having been determined to storm the place, in which a body of four hundred of the Imam's troops was to co-operate, these, considering the movements mane by our different detachments in taking up their stations as moving to the attack, or misunder standing their orders, got before the British, and entered the breach first, but the moment the British got up, they readily yielded to us the remaining labour and honour of the day. 121. After a most determined, san guinary and heroic defence on the part of the Wahabi officer, the fort surrendered, and was given up to the Imam's troops, but the fort was so mueh demolished that His Highness did f not think it prudent to keep possession of it. 122. The Imam having expressed some hesitation on the policy of attacking Khore Fakaun, from an apprehension of experiencing a similar obstinate resistance as was made at Shinas, which would render it untenable, the object was abandoned, as it had no British interest connected with it, there being no pirate vessels belonging to that port; nor was it deemed necessary to attack Khor Hassan, as the Utubis of that place had never molested the British t v ade ; the armament accordingly returned to Bombay, 123. The commanders were unable to form a treaty with Ras-ul-Khima, Sheikh Sultan their chief having been seized by the Wahabis, and their Government completely withdrawn ; independently of which no treaty could be binding on the Joasmis without the direct authority and participation of Saud on which tribe th(y were entirely dependent; but as the commanders observed, such had been the impression of our operations against the principal pirate ports, that they succeeded in their demand to destroy all the dows and large boats of the petty chieftains from Ramse to Ahooshe'/le, on the Arabian side as well as Mogu, on the Coast of Persia. The Chief of Charrak, not having any dows of large boats, was admonished to refrain from giving encourage ment or protection to future pirates. A similar message was sent to the Chief of Nakheeloo, with a demand, at the request of the Imaum, for the release of Sheikh Jabara of Congun, the friend of the English. It was not deemed material to insist on the destruction of trankeys and small boats,— a measurePart II—Chap. XV. 45 that would have been hard on the poorest of the inhabitants, and created an odium against the British name which did not generally exist, many of the small 'villages on both sides of the Gulf having been compelled to join in piratical pursuits. 123-A. As the TJitubis had never committed any depredations against our trade, even at times when the Joasmis were eniiching themselves by their frequent captures of British vessels, the commanders determiued on not attack ing Kh(&gt;r Hassan. 124i.

The following instructions were issued to the Commanders of the Poll. Dept. Diary expedition, J. Wainwright, Esquire, Captain of H. M.'s Ship Chiff'onne, and No - 339 1809 ' Commanding the sea force of the Expedition destined to the Gulph of Persia, pp * 8428 ' 8444 ' and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, Commanding H. M.'s 65th Regiment and the land force of the Expedition destined to the Gulph of Persia :— The Governcr-General of India having determined as you are already apprized to under take an expedition, in view to the defctruction of the piratical powers in the Gulph of Persia, and procured for tl&gt;is purpose the co-operation of part of His AJajesty's naval force in India and committed the equipment of the land force to proceed with it, to the Government of this Presidency as well as the general arrangement and dispatch of the armament in consideration of the vicinity of this port to the intended place of operation ; it is in consequence int nded to furnish you with the following general instructions for your guidance entm!«tin£r to you to apply their spirit and purport wherever the letter of them may not be found sutliciently opposite. 2. It may be useful britfly to premise who these pirates are, and with whom they are chiefly connected and by whom supported; as well as to designate who are their principal opponents. 3. The Province of Oman comprehend the south-easterly region of Arabia, extending from Cape Rassulhud on the south, to the territory of Zobara on the north-eastern Coast and is divided into two Principalities. The Capital of the first of which is Kosfack and of the other Seer or Julfar, of the former, the principal seaport is Muscat and of the latter fiaisul Khima. But although Rostack be the ancient capital of thaf part of Oman, known to Europeans under the denomination of the territory of Muscat, its inland situation rendering it of less consequence than the last mentioned seaport, the Hon'ble Company's communi cations have always been carried on with the Chieftain of the latter, as if he were the superior of the whole territory, whereas in strictness he may rather owe obedience to the real Imaum, whose ordinary residence is at Bostack. But as all the British Treaties and engage ments have been with that member of the family in possession of the seaport of Muscat and who also assumes title of Imanm, and is moreover iu possession of Zanzibar on the Coast of Africa and of Ormaz, Goombroon, part or the whole of the Island of Kishm, and other territories on the Persian Coast; which he holds in farm or by sufferance from the Persian Government, all your intercourse must be with him. The name of the present Imaum of Muscat is Sayed Saced, the younger son of the late Sultan, who having been a prince of great activity and judicious management maintained not only his own dominions in good order, but overawed the licentious spirit of his maritime rivals. The principality of Sur, who under their known designation of Joasmee have ever more or less mixed the practice of piracy with some degree of addiction to commercial \&gt;\xrsmis, waii haviny of late years become willing, or corn- trained, converts to the reformed Mahomedan faith of the Wahabee who has overrun their country, they hive more recently availed themselves of that want of coercive control, so beneficially exercised over them by the late Sultan, to have carried their piratical depredations to a height scarcely ever before known ; appearing to spare or respect no vessels, whom tiny have the power of mastering, whether Arabian, Turkish or Brit : sh, having of the latter des cription captured, within the last two years, no less than three, viz., the Sylphe Cruizer, which was taken before they could carry her into port, and on the 3rd of July 1808 the Ueria Doiolut, Captain Flemming, in June 1809, and the Minerva, Captain Hopwood, both of which may probably still be found lying in the harbour of Rassul Khima, if one or both of them should noti have been intermediately broken up. 4. The immediate or rather ostensible Chieftain of Rassul Khima is Sheik Sultan, the son of Sheik Suger ; but there is reason to believe that his authority is not sufficient to restrain these unprincipled depredations influenced and dominated over as they are by delegates of the 'Wahabee who is said to receive a fifth of their plunder, could his own inclination be even depended on; under some disgust arising probably out of these circumstances, this Sultan deserted Kassnl Kiiyma in the course of last year, and retiring to a neutral territory, made overtures to Syed Saeed of Muscat, who is in a state ef war with the Joasmees, to feconciij4)6 Part II—Chap. XV. their differences, professing on thit occasion a desire to conform to a treaty or convention which Captain Seton, the late Resident at Muscat had entered into, under the instructions o£ this Government, and the approbation of that of Bengal with his now deceased father Sugger, under date the 6th of February 1806, by which he engaged on the part of his tribe, as per copy enclosed, to respect British property, which having, however, failed to perform, and the present extension of this piratical annoyance having risen to a height which appeared to the Supreme Government to involve, not only the safety and independence of Muscat, but the currency of the commercial intercourse between the Gnlph and India, the object of your expedition is, according to the instructions from the same high authority, to be directed to the destiuction of fhese pirate vessels, the operations of the force under your command, being excepting in cases » of particular emergency, limited to the sea, neither are the troops or crews of the ships meant to be employed on shore against any land forces in the service of the Wahabee Chiefs, unless their being so should he found essentially requisite, either for the destruction of the piratical boats or to recover for the Imaum of Muscat some of the seaports between Ra*ut Nud and ]\Iuss''ndum ) at present in the hands of the piratical J oaswees, ■who aie all, more oi less, under the general protection, and even dominion, of the Wahabee power, which had also, about ten months ago, reduced Syed Saeed of ^Muscat, and the other branches ol the Stime family, particularly that subdivision thereof, the Chieftain of which named Uzzon holds his residence at Sohhar to much the same sort of subserviency, obliging them to acknowledge themselves subordinate to his power and engaging also, as is creditably reported to assist in the extension of the same innovating and oppressive influence as well in the direction of Hussoraas eventually towards India, giving admission also to the Doctors of the reformed faith into Muscat, and involvino- of course^ a cessation of hostilities with the Joasmee, the same superior sovereign bein'- thus understood to be at the head of both States. It was, however, sufficiently obvious that^these compulsatory acts on the part of the Joasmee of Muscat would be of no longer operation than the duration of the necessity that had lead to them ; nor has the latter ever ^ made any formal avowal to this Government of his having been reduced to such a state of even temporary and only seeming subjection, from which it is understood that lie has availed himself of the late extraordinary events in so many of the Wahahee family including Saood, its last chief, being not long ago cut off by the plague at Deriah, their capital leaving only a minor son and heir to carry on their consequently enfeebled Government, to shake off the yoke and expel the Wahabee teachers from his capitals, who are since said to have been murdered, through tli3 indignation of the people on their journey homeward. 5. However that may be, it may likely prove the most promotive of success to the Supreme Government, objects in your expedition, that you should, without stopping at Muscat advance immediately with such native pilots as may be sent out to you from the latter place, to Rasul Khyma, for the purpose of recovering as much as possible of the plundered property, concurrently with the liberation of the British subjects and natives of our settlements in India now held in bondage by these barbarians, bu 1 : chi fly in the view pf burnimg and destroying all the vessels and crafts that may be found in that harbour, meddling no more with the town, and not employing the force by land any further than may be found indispensable for the attainments of the first mentioned object. 6. Besides the principal port of Rasul Khima, there are several contiguous ones from Rums to Aboo Seyle : as laid down in a topographical sketch of that part of the coast procured from Syed Tucky, the boats in which may as appertaining to the same piratical Power, be all destroy ed if opportunity offers. f 7. In addition to these ports on the Arabian Coast, the Piratical Joasmee possess on the opposite one of Persia the Port of Linga, with the three subordinate roadsteads, in the same bay of Koonzj Hemeraum, and Bundi Mallum, and have also occupied the Port of Luft on the Isle of Kism, all the rest of which is still understood to be in possession of the Imaum of Muscat. With respect to the last mentioned of these places, i.e., the Port of Luft, Mr. Bruce, the present Resident at Muscat, will be instructed to procure and communicate to you the assent of the Imaum of Muscat to destroy the maritime equipment of the Joasmee at that station, and although this Government have not yet received an answer to a communica tion made 'by order of the Supreme Government in India last to the Persian Government through the armament accompanied by an imitation to the same Government to join and coperate in its objects, or can consequently be said to havtj hitherto procured the direct acquiescence of the Persian State to similar measures being carried on at Linga and its dependencies, as well as such of the other ports and places on the Persian Coast as you may find the pirates in the occupancy, still there can be but little doubt of the ready acquiescence of the Government being received by the earliest opportunity as you will pro bably find to have bean already communicated to the Residency at Muscat, or received perhaps direct intelligence of from Bushire ; with which you should take the earliest opportunity of communicating for the purpose previously to the course j but in any ca*e you need not hesitate to proceed to destroy the maritime equipment of the pirates on that state of the Gulph wherever you may ascertain them to exist, taking care to proceed in all such cues with the utmost practicable respect towards the undisputed right of His Majesty the King of Persia the present ally of our sovereign ; and to cause it to he well explained to such of his officer as the course of events may lead you in communication with that, the British Government have no other object than to free the obstructions and heavy losses to which it is now, and has so long continued exposed from the predatory attach of the Joasmee, and other pirates, without the slighted in ention to occupy any part of the territory, or to molest or annoy so much as onePart II—Chap. XV. 47 of His Majesty's loyal suhjeets ; and whom in pursuance o£ the happily cemented friendship between the two States, it is on the contrary the desire of the linglish nation to cherish and protect and promote the prosperity of, to the greatest practicable extent, on which subject you are moreover furnished with the triplicate of a letter from the (iovernor of Bombay to the Prince of Shheraz, which it is left to you to forward or to make such of as circumstances may point out the expediency of; as well as of its copies in English and f'ersian, which are likewise forwarded for such local communication or distribution as you may find conducive to the gieat object of precluding misconstruction to, and insuiing satisfaction with, the course of your proceedings against the freebooters in question. 8. A similar application has been preferred for the co-operalion of the Turkish Govern ment in the objects of the expedition, should you theref ire receive any communication from the Resident ab Bassora connected with that application, you will not taii to attend to the same in as far as the nature of it may be found compatible with the general powers with which you are ves'ed by these instructions ; considering also that His Maje.-ty's and the Signior s {sic) Governments being now restored to a fortunate state of harmony ami friendship, it will be the more desirable to cultivate the good-will of the Turkish Government during the course of your opeiationp. 9. The unfortunate loss by death of Captain Seton at a period so critical as the present, when he might have been depended on for a variety of local information which must now remain defective, renders it necessary to caution you to consider the particulars adverted to in the preceding observations, as affording only some general views for your guidance, amo'inting to a line of indication for your own more satisfactory enquiries on the spot; sim e in several respects, local circumstances may have altered after the } ericd our latest adv.ces from Arabia. But as enough has been said to intimate to you the several points of primary attainment in the extirpation of the means of future annoyance hy the pirates ; the Governor in Council places the utim st reliance on your approved zeal and ability to direct the application of the lorce in the most advantageous manner, towa ds the easiest and most effectual acquisition of its genuine objects, as prescribed in the decision of the Supreme Government, the desiring the best means of carrying which into execution, His Lordship having, as above observed, been pleased to devolve on this Government; under such suggestions as might be furnished by General Malcolm, the Governor in Council has, after consulting that otlicer accordingly adopted the measures and appointed the force deemed in his, and other competent opinions, adequate to the service to be performed, the employment thereof to your professional skill and gallantry, which will not fail to surmount such intervening difficulties as may occur, and to conduct the undertaking to the most creditable termination for the general good and to the relief of the commercial (world), against those irreclaimable pests to the general prosperity. 10. Your intercourse with Imaum of Muscat will of course be carried on chiefly through the medium of Mr. Bruce, the present Resident, in which channel you will asce'tain the wishes of Syed Saed, which you will attend to and even comply with as far as may be found compatible, with the general success of the service entrusted to your charge, and at the same time within the line of the preceding instructions, beyond which, as prescribed by superior authority, the Governor in Council is neither authorized nor disposed to proceed. 11. I might, no doubt, be desirable (more especially in view to their connection with and decree of dependence on the Wahabee power) that after the entire destruction of their vessels a Conciliatory convention nrght take place between the British and their petty Mates stipulat- ino- for their future quiet behaviour and forbearance from piracy, which if you can effect the terms thereof, may be converted in conjunction with the Jmaum of Muscat, and with a due regard to his permanent interest as our ally, or, if the piratical powers prefer it, they might be^allowed to send over authorized vakeels, by the opportunity of your return, to treat at this place for a permanent accommodation. 12. Whatever may occur in the respect you will be careful to discover throughout the service on which you are about to proceed, any intention of hostility towards the Wahabee Tower of whose present connection with the Joasmees it is not even not necessary that you should acknowledge any privity or acquaintance or enter, consequently at all into the considera tion or discussion as to any share or interest that the Chieftain in question may possess in their depredations ; hut acting towards and Ireating with them altogether on the footing of an independent State, as they appeared to he on the occasion of the treaty concluded with Captain Seton; although no doubt, they were &gt; even, then in constrained subordination to the superior power of the Wahahee who did not however think it necessary to obtrude hmself ostensibly in those transactions. 18, The Governor in Council earnestly recommends that the opportunity of obtaining the most accurate topographical information of the countries inhabited by the Joasmees, should not be best and you will no doubt select for this purpose proper otlicers, marine as well as military, to survey and make charts and sketches of the coasts, creeks, harbours and countries tj^at are in the possession of the Joasmees. ]4. Governor in Council would also be happy to be favoured with your opinion in respect to the most eligible island in the vicinity of the Joasmee ports which it would be advisable for us to occupy as a maritime station of Besidency in preference to Muscat, with the view of more effectually commanding the entrance of the Gulph and checking the future depredations of the pirates, accompanied by your sentiments in respect to the force that may be m cessary48 Part II— Chap. XV, to maintaiu the posses-ion not only against the Native powers in the Gulph but also with refeience to such European force as occasionally visit that quarter, and whicn it is not to be supposed will ever exceed two French fri^aies at the utmost, so long as we maintain our maritime superiority the removal of the Residency from Muscat is the more desirable from the lamentable casualties that have occurred at th.it insalubrious station ; at which perhaps every object we have in view would be attainable ttirough the agency of the Mative broker, con trolled by the presence of the Resident at a vicinal port.

Diary 1809 :— No. 339 of 1809, pp. 8147-8453. In proceeding to your station, which the Governor in Council understands you intend doing by the Aurora Cruizer, I am directed to observe you will no doubt make yourself fully acquainted, by a present of the rec«)rds of the Rasilency, with the nature and extent of the happy relations that having so long subsisted between the British Government and the State of Mascat. As the immediate or local duty of maintaining those relations unimpaired has devolved on you, I am directed to enjoin to you the observance ot the utmost moderation arid conciliatory and respectful demeanmr towards the Imaum and his subjects, and to require that you strictly abstain from all interference with the internal relations of that Governnenty confining the objects of your suptrintendence lo the main'enaice of the stipulations contained in existing Treaties between the two States. With regard to the impending expedition, it being the intention of Captain Wainwright on approaching the Arabian shores to direct the Aurora to push on to Muscat for the purpose of apprizing Captain Gordon of His Majesty's Ship Caroline, and who will be at that station, of the arrival of the armament, you will immediately aft^r reaching Muscat and in concert with Captain Gordon hold a communication with the Imaum and ascertain the nature and extent of the co-operation which His Highness may have determined to afford to the Expedition pursuantly to the exposition which the late Captain Setoa has made of its objects as stated in the letter to that officer under date the 6th June last, of which a copy is enclosed for your fuller information. Should you find His Highness disposed and prepared to extend his co-operation you will press upon his consideration the policy and advantage of the carrying in the attack against the piratical ports on the east side of the Cape Mussuldum whilst our force is engaged on the west, and such a movement on the part of that Chieftain, even if it should not succeed or be actively prosecuted, would at least produce a powerful diversion in our favor and be the most beneficially promotive of the general service. The result of your intercourse with the Imaura you will communicate to Captain Wainwright exclusive of such reply as Mr. Bruce, the Acting Resident at Bushire, may have transmitted to the letter from the late Captain Seton to that gentlemen to the purport of mine dated the 6th of June, making an enclosure to this address, directing Mr. Bruce to explain to the Persian Government the nature of the expedition and to obtain its acquiescence i n its prosecution against the pirates infesting the Persian side of the Gulph. You will also engage as many trankeys as Captain Wainwright may apprize you he will have occasion for inclusive of pirates and despatch them under the protection of His Majesty's Ship Caroline with a report of your proceedings to Captain Wainwright. It is also desirable that an agent on the part of the Imaum should be prevailed upon to accompany the Expedition with the view of affording that officer every information in regard to the ports and places belonging to the Imaum of Muscat, it may be necessary to effect the restoration as eventually provided for in the instructions to the officers Commanding the Armament of which a copy is enclosed that you may be fullv authorized of its extent and of the motives by which the British Government is actuated in its present interposition in promoting the mari time independency of the Gulph, and in restoring its commercial prosperity, in particular reference to the 7th paragraph of which you will procure and communicate to Captain Wainwright and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, the assent of the Imaum of Muscat to destroy the maritime equipments of the Joasmees at the Port of Luft on the Isle of Kishm. The agent in question can be accommodated on the Aurora which you will return placing her Commander under the orders of Captain Gordon. The several objects it is essential that you should accomplish within four and twenty hours after your arrival, if, as the Governor in Council hopes it may be practicable or otherwise, with as short a time as possible. You will remain at your station pending the expedition, complying with any applications which you may receive from the Naval and Military officers or Departments of the Armament for supplifs of provisions as for such other aid as they may require.Part II—Chap. XV. You are positively restricted from carrying on any commercial dealings on your own account or for your 'personal benefit or as agent for others, confining' your sole attention to the promotion of the political interests for your charge, in the course of which you will keep the Governor in Council constantly advised of the changes that may occur among the Native Powers on either side of the Gulph, and the interior of the country, fully satisfying ourselves of the authenticity of the intelligence you may receive and apprizing Government in occasions where you may doubt its accuracy. With the view of conducting the Department of supplies to the detachment proceedino- on service on as economical principles as practicable, I am instructed to require you to certify to all purchases which the Commissary of Provisions may make, that the rates of purchase correspond with those in the market, including those that may be made by the Ao-ent Mr. Henshaw on furnishing the supplies that may be required by the cruizers attached kTthe armament, which is committed to ivlr, Henshaw on the terms of his agency, I am further directed to inform you that on your occasional supplies to cruizers visiting Muscat your bills must be also supported by the certificates of soma respectable merchants purporting that your rates do not exceed the market prices, a rule that is in force at Bussorah and i3ushire under the supplies made by the Resident. I enclose copy translate of a letter from the Honourable the Governor to the Imaum and convey the directions of Government that in the event of His Highness recurrino- at any W to an application he formerly preferred to be supplied with convoy for the Arab trade for Muscat to Bengal, you communicate to him in general terms that His Excellency Rear- Admiral Drury had ordered Commodore Byng to dispatch a vessel to the Gulph for that purpose; that Captain Wainwright had previously directed the Comwallis to sail with the trade from Bussorah on the Ibthof June, and after collecting the ships at Bushire and Muscat to repair to Bombay. That Captain Montague in pursuance of this ord^r called at Muscat early in July and after staying a sufficient time to receive advices from the Resident, then at Burka, sailed for the Presidency, having had no application for convoy from the Imaum Should His Highness express any serious disappointment at this uncertain state of the convoy, you wi 1 communicate with Captain Wamwnght as to the best means of affording h-m satisfaction, when it perhaps maybe in the power of the Commander of the Chiftonne to detach to Bengal either one of His Majesty's frigates or of the Honourable Company's cruizers, with such of the Muscat ships as may be still waiting at that port, and unwilUno- to proceed on their voyage without such protection. 3 pi.Lieutenant William Bruce reported from Bushire that he had received intelligence from Mahomed Nubi Khan at Shiraz. savin' that TTk Eojal Highness the Prince of Shiraz intended sending a bodv of' tmnm „ J Mr. Brwe'. letter against the Joasmi settlements on the Persian Coast and that the^vould be « d 8ep ^ ready foi that seivice in the month of Ramazan or as soon as ever the weithpr ^® CIet an ^ ^ ,0 ^• became sufficiently cool for them to proceed.

The town or h o ad place of Nnklieloo being occupied by the son of the late Sheikh Rehma, under the general protection (which on account of his own weakness and want of power he solicits) of Sheikh labara the son of Sheik Mahomed the Kuler of Kungoon, and partly also of the surviving brother of the late Aberrehman the son of the late Allack ; now Sheikh labara is at present in amity with the Imaum of Muscat, whilst the brother and present Representative of the Allack family is indepen dent, being connected neither with the Joasmees nor with the aforesaid Imaum. 'With respect to Khore Hussan on the Arabian Coast, it appears by the same information to have been held by Jabir of the Julahimu tribe of Utoobees who had two sons, the elder Ubdoolla and the younger Ruhman. After the death of their father these two brothers fled from fear of the other Utoohees and took up their re^i'ience for some time at Bushire and Charack, after which they returned to Khore Husson and betook themselves to piracy pending which occupation (some particulars of which are adverted to io the 7th and 3-irJ. paragraphs of the summary of the late Captain Seton^s correspondence recorded on the 24th of June last), Ruhman the younger brother obtained the ascendancy and continues in the commission of piracy, having recently captured, as is said, twenty Utoobees Botellas on their voyage from Grain to Muscat and killeii the person in charge of them, the son of Uhdoollah ben Suhbah the Chieftain of Grain, who has long been on terms of amity with the English and is now reported to have fitted out a marine expedition against Khore Husson in the view ot reprisals ; meanwhile the elder biother UbtlooUa has resorted to and sought the protection of the Imaum of Muscat, soliciting thut Chieftain's interference to procure an equipment from Muscat, which in conjunction with the British armament may enable him to recover his influence at Khore Husson. Lutf was in the hands of the Joasmees of Rasul Khima, during the period of Moola Ubdalla's being detained as a prisoner at Muscat. Ubdalla fled from thence on the 20th of Shaban answering to about the Ist of October, in breach of his engagements and oath to the Imaum and arriving at Luft in ten days, the Joasmees allowed him to reinstate himself from about the 1st cf Kumzun or about the 11th of October ; since his reinstatement Moola Ubdalla remained (according to Syed Tuckey's information) in amity and connection with his friends the Joasmees as aforesaid, being also related by affinity to Sugger the Chieftain of Kasul Khima. 131-A. There was then the question of conducting operations against Sheikh Rahma of Khor Hassan. The Resident at Bushire was for destroying the maritime equipment of this Chieftain, but the Bombay Government did not wish this, and their final decision was conveyed in the following letter to Mr. N. H. Smith, Resident at Bushire, dated 10th February 1810:— 1. I am directed by the Hon'ble the Governor in Council to acknowledge the receipt of g e i ec tj on your dispatches marked in the margin advising of the measures which you intended to pursue No. 71 of 1805- for the purpose of destroying the martime equipment of Sheikh Rehma at Khor Hussan. 1810, pp. 53-o6. 2. Concluding that under the course of communication between General Malcolm and yourself and Colonel Smith you could scarcely be unaware of the single condition on which the Governor in Council had acquiesced in an eventual attack on Rehma, the Chieftain of the Port in question or of the last mentioned officer and Captain Wainwright's having with the latitude conveyed in their instructions deemed it in concurrence with the opinion also of General Malcolm not only unnecessary but impolitic to proceed aggressively against the port in question, the Governor in Council cannot approve of your having taken up on you to set on foot an expedition thither on principles exceeding the degree of discretion vested for that purpose in the Commandant of the expedition such as for your fuller information in the possible event of your being unacquainted therewith, is herewith made known to you in the accompanying copy of the letter to those officers from the Chief Secretary of the 6th of January last, to the tenor of which it is accondingly still the wish of Government that you should adhere as nearly as may be practicable consistently with the state of circumstances at the period of your receipt of this communication especially in the case of a man (such as Rehma) who instead of hostility has shewn in the remarkable instance of his forbearance towards the Augusta Cruizer when in the power of his fleet a marked desire to maintain towards us the most unexceptionable neutrality. 3. An additional motive for desiring to avoid hostility with Rahma is from the knowledge acquired by Government through native channels that he has recently entered into strict counectioa with the Wahabee and has in coniunction with that power (which it has all along e 2i 52 Part II—Chap. xV. been the object of the Governor-General to attend as little as possible) taken possesion o£ Zoobara, the Chief town of the Uttuhis, who have thereon been obliged to suntudtr t Islands of Bahrein to the same political ascendency. Selection 132 The Government of India entirely concurred in the instructions which were issued by the Bombay Government on the 6th January to the so-D. Commanders of the Expedition, and in those subsequently issued to Mr. m t for the purpose of checking the operations which he proposed to undertake against the port of Khor Hassan and requiring his attention to the former orders of the 6th January respecting that port and the Chief of the Uttoobee pirates. In the opinion of the Governor-General in Council, the complete success which had attended all the operations of the expedition to the Gulph ot Persia afforded grounds for the highest satisfaction, and reflected great honor on Captain Wainwright and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, who appeared to have conducted all the operations committed to their management, with distin guished zeal, prudence, promptitude, and ability (Lord Minto to Mr. Duncan, dated 7th March 1810.)(S) KsJ Part II—Chap. XVI. 53 CHAPTER XVI. t THE mm OF MASRATS EXPEDITIONS AGAINST THE JOAS- mS IN 1813 AND 1814. HIS CLAIM FOR OUR ASSIST ANCE ON THE BASIS OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN HIM AND THE BRITISH REPUDIATED. 133. In 1813 the Imam prepared an expedition against Eas-ul-KMma for the purpose of reinstating the Joasmi Chief in his Government, Sheikh Sultan promising that if His Highness would restore him to his hereditary posses sions, he would ever consider himself as a vassal of the Imam and his allies and never again or his tribe commit piracies. The Imam requested that Mr. Bruce, who was at Maskat, would accompany him to witness the treaty, which he would enter with Sultan bin Saggar and for the purpose also of negotiating a treaty with the Joasmi Chief on the part of the British Govern ment, which, as observed by the Imam, would have more effect in keeping him to the performance of his engagements than anything else, as Sultan bin Saggar was now aware of our determination not to allow the slightest insult to pass'unnoticed. As the renewal of the treaty entered into by the Joasmi Chief was deemed essential, Mr. Bruce was instructed to adopt the necessary measures accordingly and to contract similar engagements with the other Chieftains in the Gulf. 134. The first expedition having failed, the Imam equipped a second one in 1814, and addressed through his Vakil at Bombay an appeal to the Governor of Bombay, Sir Evan Nepean, for aid of two ships of war with a body of troops. He based his demand on the basis of the old alliance between the British and the Imam, as explained in his letter to the Vakil, translation of which is given below ;— Translation of a letter from His Highness Syyud Saeed the Imam of Muscat to Mahomed Vo\\.Y)e^i.D\ &amp; rj Aleekhan. No ^ ?/ I. 814 - pp. 2562-2564. My former intimation and application for aid and assistance against the Juwasimee, who are still carrying on their excesses and violent proceedings, was induced by the idea that my enemies were those of the English, that my friends were those of the English ; that the foes of the English were my foes; that their allies were my allies ; that our State, and property, and cities and territories were identified and that there existed no separate interest. You have now, no doubt, heard of the excesses of the Juwasimees, and of the plunder com mitted by them. They have piratically carried off several vessels and dingeys loaded with cargoes, on their way to Curachee and Cutch, and these under English Colours or my own. 'Whenever I go in quest of them, they make off and will not remain in their own haunts. In obedience to the Divine Command I am now setting out to attack them, for the purpose of destroying or capturing them, and I hope I shall obtain the countenance of Heaven in my effort to suppress and annihilate them. Under these circumstances, I think it proper to notify the circumstance to my friend the Right Honourable the Governor—should it be in his power to afford me his assistance, I request that he will detain two ships of war with such a body of troops as he may deem advisable, and adequate for this service, and I entreat that he will dispatch them with the utmost expedition, that, God willing, the excesses of that tribe may be repressed and relief thereby afforded to God's creatures. I should not have intruded on the present occasion if I did not only consider the English as my friends and allies; but our situations as identified, and our property and cities as the same, in view to which I make this communication. 135. The Bombay Government replied by a note from the Secretary Dept. Diary and Translator in the ofiBce of Country Correspondence to Mahomed Ali No. 412 of isii, Khan Shusturi, Agent to the Imam of Maskat, dated the 2nd June 1814 :— ^ I have been directed by the Right Honourable the Governor in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your note bearing date the 14th of last month and to communicate to you the following observations on the subject letter from His Highness the Imaum of Muscat inclosed in it.54 Part II—Chap. XVI. The Right Honourable the Governor in Council deems it necessary in the first instance to explain to you for the information of His Highness the Imaum, that a more enlarged con struction has been put upon the nature of the alliance subsisting between the State of Oman and the British Governntent than that under which the latter has been accustomed to consider it. The nature of the connection subsisting between the two States is for the maintenance of a friendly intercourse, between the contracting powers exclusively, without involving the allies or enemies of either in the connection, or any obligation in either of the contracting powers to co-operate in the views of the other* The Governor in Council is not aware of any measures which can be pursued at the present moment for the assistance of His Highness besides those which have been already taken by this Government, and for the general security of commerce, against the depredations of the Joasmee pirates, in the prosecution of which the mercantile interests of Muscat will be pro tected equally with every other fair trade by our cruizers, which are maintained in the Gulph principally for the security of its commercial interests. You will also be pleased to inform His Highness that Mr. Eruce in consequence of the orders he had received from this Government had determined to proceed to Rassul Khyma to remonstrate with the Chief of the Joasmees as the subject of their predatory proceedings and to demand restitution of the boats and property they may have captured ; as well as to endeav our to bind them by some engagement to pursue a more creditable course for obtaining a livelihood, and in the execution of this mission he will not be inattentive to the interests of the Imaum; at the same time it is to be observed that had the means now to be adopted been less likely to insure a favourable issue, it would not have been convenient at this to have sent a force into the Gulph for inforcing a compliance with our reasonable expectations. Yoil. Dept., Diary i30 # From a report of the broker at Maskat, dated lOtfi June 1814, it appears pp^tf-a^so! 4, that Syud Said having proceeded to Ras-ul-Khima with all his disposable forces from Maskat, with the view of making an attack on that place, the chief people there sent a mediator to hitn and solicited peace, which he agreed to grant, and the same principal people thereon waited upon him, and concluded an amicable arrangement, the stipulations of which were that all His High- ness's subjects on the Arab shore, Bahrein to Uasul Had, and on the Persian shore from the port of Kongun, to that of Gwader, all of whom were His High- ness's subjects, should be included in the peace, but there were three tribes who were excluded from the Arrangement, namely, the inhabitants of Bushire,Bassora, and the Utubis of Grane, and as about the period of His Highness's departure for Ras-ul-Khima, and previously to his arrival, the inhabitants of that place had sent to sea about twenty vessels, it was at the same time stipulated, in the event of those vessels having committed depredations on any of His High ness's subjects, although they might not be h^ld answerable for any life which might be lost, yet the vessel and property should be restored. 137. In the course of their cruize seven of these Joasmi vessels fell in with a dow, belonging to one Bin labir, a Persian, which had taken in a cargo at Maskat and was proceerling to the port of Bunder Abbass and an action O took place between them, which ended in the capture of the dow. The slaughter amongst the Joasmi was also very great. Tiie dow was carried to Ras-ul- Khima, but it was reported that the inhabitants of that place have written to those concerned in her inviting them to come to take charge of her. 138. There were two tribes who were not satisfied with the peace made by His Highness Sayyud Said, with the inhabitants of Ras-ul-Khima, one of them Sultan bin Saggar and the other Sheikh Huza ; but it was said that they had been afterwards compelled to accede to it by compulsion. They stipu lated with Sayyud Said that Ras-ul-Khima should remain in his own possession, and that Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar should be established at Shargah, and that each person should remain within his own limits.Part II— Chap.

On the 1st of February 1815 the Bombay Governmpnt received of following despatch from the Resident at Bushire, dated the 11th October 1815, pp. 122-125. 1814, containing information of the arrival at Bushire of a Vakil from Amir Hassan bin Rehma, the Chieftain of the Joasmis, enclosing at the same time letters from that Chieftain and Abdulla bin Sand the Chieftain of the Waha- bis and stating that he had agreed on the JPreliminary article of Treaty with the first -mentioned person. I have the honour to acquaint that on the 2nd instant a vakeel on the part of Ameer Hussen bin Rehmah Joassemee arrived here in a despatch boat from Katife with the letters from the Wahabee Chief Abdalla bin Saoud and Hassan bin Rehmah. copy and translation of which I have the honour to enclose, from which documents the Ilon'ble hoard will observe that the Wahabee Ihief by no means approved of thp conduct of Hassan bin Rehmah and his tribe; and has in a manner bound himself to compel the latter to deliver up such piop -rty as we can prove them to have captured. At the same time Hussan bin Hehmah continued to deny having captured any British property arid hopes that we will not be too severe in scrutinizing the past; the Hon'ble Board will also observe that he has authorized Hassan bin Mohumed bin Gaith the bearer of these letters to enter into engagements with me; after a great deal of conversation with him on their late predatory conduct, and insisting on their leaving off this mode of life, if tliey wished to enter into engagements of friendship with the British Government ; Hassan bin Gaith replied they were anxious to be on the best of terms with the British Government, whose good-will they should study h-reafter to deserve and that we might rest assured any engagements that might be entered into with us would never be infringed; that if they respected our flag ard subjects and did all they could to promote our wishes, what more could we desire of them, and that therefore hoped w e would not insist on them leaving off cruizing against those States who were at enmity with them; as according to the Law of Nations amongst the Arabs blood could only be repaid by blood ; that if they were not to follow this kind of warfare they would lo&gt;e their rank amongst the Arab States; and not only that but that those tribes w r ho were at enmity uith them would come to their very houses to attack them ; besides this they were compelled by the Wahabee Chief to wage war against the Mahomedan States of the Gulph to bring them under the yoke and religion of Wahabee and to respect the British flag and subjects to whom they were directed to be attentive an! to afford every assistance in their power and cultivate their alliance; that if we would guarantee on their leaving off this mode of proceeding that none of the Arab States would molest them or their vessels, and that if they did so we would chastize them for it and restore their property back, as also guarantee their safety from the vengeance of the Wahabee Chief, for not obeying his commands they could then leave off this way of life, but otherwise their natural situation in the Gulph was such that they were compelled to be enemies to the greatest portion of it; as there was a great deal of truth in what Hassan bin Gaith said regarding tlie peculiar situation and the system among the Arabs as also their peculiar religion so different from the other Mahomedan sects which of itself makes them enemy of all other Llam sects, as also a 1 ! other Islam sects to be their enemies, and as Hassan bio Gaith says his Chief and relation Hassan bin Rehma intend deputing this season to the Presidency a vakeel fully authorised to ratify and enter into more full and firm engage ments with the British Government; I have therefore after mature deliberation entered into few preliminary articles with Hassan bin Gaifch, agreeing to drop all claim and forget what has past upon certaiu conditions ; 1 have been indmed to this from the circumstance of our not having proof that the boats taken by them last year off Scind had either passes or colours, at the same time I have stipulated that all property as may have been taken from the Island of Khen belonging to the Ahmed Shah shall be restored and that the port of the Joassemees shall be open to all British subjects; they are also in future to hoist colours different from the ether Arab States which are simple red. The articles entered into have duly signed and sealed to three copies by Hassan bin Gaith and myself, one of which I have delivered to him to be kept by Hassan bin Rehma, another I have now the honour to enclose for the considera tion for the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, and the third I have retained here and hope it will meet with the approbation and ratification of the Hou'ble Board. Hassan bin Gaith and his attendants I have considered as the guests of the Hon 'ble Company during their stay here and in consequpntly accommodated them in the Facto.y; their expenses with a few presents made to Hassan bin Gaith and some Europe articles sent along with him for Hassan bin Rehma the Joas-emee Chief on the conclusion of the en ir .iiie- ments, I trust will be authorised by the Hon'ble Board, as the whole amount does not exceed 1,200 rupees.j56 Part II—Chap.

You mention that our vessels go towards Sind which is verv right, but we have scarce brought anything from that quarter merely a little coarse, red rice, small quantity of wheat, a little cotton and some iron ; but other tribes also visit this quarter, the Joassemes who are subject to Seyad Saide of Muscat and others who take property and then charge with having done it; you know very well that we have a great many enemies who strive to foment matters between—that we mav be on bad terms and this because they are old enemies of ours, but it must be well known to you that we have no wish for vou or your subjects being losers. The treaty between us is very full and firm and which we wish to cement ^till stronger, any that y u can prove against us—by the grace of God shall be fulfilled and returned to you; but do not give ear to bad people such as those or Muscat reo-arding us. Your messenger came U ^ur country, ask him if he saw any property belonoin'- to your people, boats or anything else. I have now deputed Hassan been Gaith to vou whatever he says consider as from me, and if you wish to renew the engagement between us he is fully authorised by me to do so, and I have hopes that you will not be too severe m scrutinizing-the past, and request you will point out the extent of your possessions towards Scind and 0 those who are your subjects to me. I have always understood that your people go about in ships and not in dun^ees, etc , these belong to Scind, Dewelle and Crotchee, nor do we wish to molest your people or break our engagements.

We have seen in the Selections from the State Papers regarding Persia and the Persian Gulf, 1600-1800, the important role played by Sheikh Nasir I of Bushire in our Persian Gulf affairs. This Sheikh belonged to the family of Matarisch, as told us by JSiebuhr in Chapter GUI of his Travels in Arabia. The first Sheikh Nasir died in 1801, and was succeeded by his son Sheikh Nasir the Second. At the commencement of the period of this Precis, he was an important figure at Bushire, and displayed much anxiety to please the British, while doing all to utilize their friendship to till his pockets. (For a Geneological table of this family see page 248). 140. His son Sheikh Abdul Rasul was an alter ego of Sheikh Nasir and was no less active than his father. As a specimen of Sheikh Nasir's friendly communications to our Agents, we shall give the translation of one of March Secret and Poll. 1801, addressed to Mehdi Ali Khan, Resident at Bushire : — Eept.DiaryNo.106 of 1801, p. 1183. Bombay Castle, 27th March 1801. After in vain attempting to .express to you the regret I feel on being deprived of your agreeable society, I have the honour to inform you that on my arrival at Cbsihoatah, I was favoured with the receipt of your kin i letter, which, as far as a letter would go, compensated for the mortifications I have experienced in leaving you. The accounts it contains of your health hive afforded me the most sincere satisfaction. I swear to Your Honor by the most hi^h Uod that nothing can surpass my regard for your friendship and esteem, that I shall be ever anxious to hear from you, and to learn how I may have an opportunity of fulfilling any of your commands. The increase {sic)^ you have been so good as to send me has arrived safe ; I trust I shall be ever found to be desirinif of a continuance of your favour. I now send you back my brother Mahammed and my son, Hajy Suleman, which is the occasion of my writing you these few lines requesting you to take my house, my country, and my Government, under superintendence, look upon my brother as your son, and upon my son as your servant; and as your own protect and take care of them. I have given them the most precise instructions to be indefatigable in their attentions towards you : Hajy Suleman in parti cular I have desired to attend to the building of your house, and to furnish stones and lime, and, in short, everything else you are in want of; this duty therefore being expressly assigned to him no person else can interfere in it. I trust you will ever preserve the favourable disposi tions you have manifested towards me; and continue to gratify me with a constant communi cation of your commands. I beg my compliments and best wishes to your son Mirza Mohammed Khan. I hope he is in health. P.S. I have given the most particular orders to my brother Mohammed and Hajy Suleman to do nothing without your advice and permission; whatever you approve of they may then execute. J 141. In 1807 the Bombay Government sanctioned the payment of R3,000 to Sheikh Nasir for his assistance in a piracy against a British boat and in com pensation for the loss of his boat sustained by him in an attack made by Lieutenant Cox. 142. The same year Sheikh Nasir left for Mekkah leaving his son Sheikh Abdul Hassul in charge of the Government of Bushirej and who on taking the charge addressed a letter dated 10th February 1807 to the Governor of Bombay :— Translation of a letter from Vbdool Rusool, son of Sheikh Nusser Khan, to the Honourable Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay, dated the 14th Zilkaad or 24th Janmry, and received the 10th February 1807. v ^ w ^. 0 m y f^her having, a short time ago, forwarded a friendly letter to you, by Secret and Poll. &amp;m\) boohman Shahee, and having himself, under the auspices of the Almighty, and to ^ 0 - 2C3 o &gt;tain the blessings of the salvation, commenced her journey to Mekka under date the 23rd PP 2077- of the last month,or the 2nd January leaving me at this port, with an injunction that, in w *02 Part III.—Chap. XVIII attention to the dictates of the long established connexion with the Hon^ble Company's Government, I should always recall myself to your kind remembrance; by not allowing our correspondence to drop, and the Hon'ble Company's Cruizer Mercury being now bound to the Presidency, I have presumed by means of the epistle to do so, in order that in a friendly way you may always keep open the door of kindness, and continue to me the pleasure and happiness of hearing cf your welfare ; and command my services on all suitable occasions, as tending to demonstrate your favors and to encourage my hopes, and in view to the relations of amity my father has despatched the ship Sooliman Shahee to the Presidency, for the purpose of undergoing repair, in pursuance of your intimated God-willing : she will by the aid of Government be very nicely repaired. I have further to trouble you by requesting that she may be expeditiously despatched to tliis quarter, which may the Almighty cause her to reach in safety. Order of the Governor in Council dated 10th April 1807. In acknowledging the receipt of the above letter the Secretary was on the 9th instant instructed to advise the Resident at Bushire that th^ Sooliman Shahee would be repaired as speedily as possible and in preference to any other than the vessels of war of His Majesty, of which there were at present several here, but it was nevertheless hoped to be able to get the Sheikh's ship repaired in time to return before the monsoon. Secret and Poll. 142 A. The Sheikh's son made a further application for being paid the ^1807 iary 2990charges of reparing and coppering his vessels in the dock. The following 0 /,P ' order, dated 21st April 1807, was passed by the Bombay Government on this application :— With respect to the further claim or urgent application now made by the son of Sheikh Nusser to have the charge defrayed of repairing and coppering his father's vessels now in dock, it need scarcely be remarked that his plea by which he aims at inducing one act of liberality because another has been extended, is not. founded on solid or very liberal principles on his part; the previous generosity, requiring on the contrary that he should desist from additional expectations of the same description. Notwithstanding which. Government will, in consideration to our established connection, bear some part of the expense of the refitment of the vessel in question, but as it will amount (according to present estimate) to about twelve thousand rupees, his agent here must in reason defray the greater part of that expense, it beinc deemed quite sufficient that this Government should make him a present, as they are disposed to do, of one-fourth proportion thereof. 143. In his letter dated 26th October 1808, Mr. Bruce reported that Sheikh Abdul Rasul was seized on 26th October 1808 by the orders of Mahomed Hussein Khan, Shiraz Minister Nasurallah Khan's Basbi, who had been sent down to Bushire from Shiraz with a force to compel the Sheikh to pay some large outstanding demands against him. 144. In consequence of the above circumstance the Resident prepared a statement of the Company's demands against Sheikh Abdul Rasul Khan himself, as also against his late father's estate with the demands of private individuals, under the protection oL the British, Statement of pullic and private demands against the late Governor of Bushire, Sheikh Abdul Basul Khan.

The downfall of Sheikh Abdul Rasul was brought about by the intrigues of Mahomed Nabi Khan, who had lately gone to India as Persian Envoy, and who now stepped into the shoes of the family who had held the Government of Bushire for nearly half a century. Mahomed Jaffar Khan acted as his Deputy at Bushire. 146. Captain Pasley, who was attached to the Staff of General Malcolm, appointed to proceed on his third Mission to Persia (see Chapter IV above), arrived in advance at Bushire on 1st December 1809. His Report dated 2nd December about Mahomed Nabi Khan's having proceeded to Shiraz, the fall of the Minister Nasurallah Khan, and the reception he had at the hands of the acting Governor Mahomed Jaffar Khan, is interesting and is quoted below :— I have the honour to report to you for the information of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-Geaeral in Council that we reached this place yesterday after a very long and tedious voyage. 2. We had unavoidably incurred a delay of about a week by joining the expedition * under Captain Wainwright and continuing with it until the reduction of Ras-ool-Khima—he could not, previously, to the execution of that service, spare us an additional cruiser for a convoy up the Gulph, and it did not appear advisable to proceed without one, whilst we continued destitute ot information, with regard to the piratical force \^hich might then be at S ' j a. We parted from Captain Wain Wright 's Quardroon off Linga on the 16th ultimo and from that period to the day of our arrival we had uniformly to contend with an adverse wind. 3. Lieutenant Bruce the Acting Resident at this place came off as soon as we bad anchored and I learnt from hiui that Mahomed Nabbee Khan had been suddenly summoned to Shiraz about 10 days ago ; that immediately upon his arrival Nasroolah Khan the Vizier to the Prince Ferman lurma of Fars had been divested of his official situation and now with his son Alidoola Khaun placed in a state of confinement in their own houses. 4. The ostensible motives for the adoption of this measure are numerous complaints of extortion from the renters of the different districts of Pars, and it is said that they are supposed to have received £150,000 more than has yet been accounted for to the public treasury. I have not yet been able to obtain any current information on this subject as to ascertain how far Mahomed Nabbee Khan may by his intrigues have been instrumental in producing their disgrace, but it appears most probable that he has been active in promoting its accomplish ment. as he has long been on bad terms with Nasroolah Khan and was immediately invested with the office of \ izier to what 1 understand he had been previously appointed by a Royal Firmaun. 5. Aga Mahomed Jaffur, brother to Mahomed Nabbee Khan and acting Governor of Bushire came off to me at noon attended by the officers of Government and principal merchants of the place. I congratulated him on the late elevation of his relation and he was most profuse in the expression of his delight and satisfaction at my arrival which I could observe he considered aa a certain indication that General Malcolm would very shortly make his appearance in this quarter; I allowed him to understand that such was not an improbable event, but I avoided any particular declarations at the moment by informing him that I should in a day or two prepare letters for the Ministers and Mahomed Nabbee Khan descriptive of the future view and intentions of the British Government in India on this and all other points. 6. It appears neceseary here to state that the dispatches which I had addressed to the Persian Ministers notifying my appointment and the ratification by His Lordship in Council of tire preliminary treaty have not yet been forwarded to their destination as I found then * (Se« paragraph 130 above.)(34 Part III.—Chap. XVIII. upon mv arrival at Muskat to be still on board H. M. S. Chifonne and brought them up with myself. These will now perhaps require some slight alterations, but I shall, 1 trust, be able to forward them to-morrow or next day. 7. It would at present appear probable that my personal attendance at Court may be advisable, and I am at any rate of opinion that I shaU be much more in wrong of collecting information and ascertaining the grounds upon which we stand in the country, it 1 fax my residence at Sheraz. if I continue settled at Rushire some time may also be saved by my proceeding at once to Sheraz as all business in this country is much more easily transacted by personal intercourse than by letter, and I shall in all probability be able to make a more satisfactory and speedy report concerning the real inclination of this Government on the subject of General Malcolm's projected Mission than I possibly could under other circum- gtftllCGS* 8. My conversation with Aga Mahomed Jaffur and his party was general and com plimentary, but I cannot omit to report the warm and eager anxiety with which he and the whole party listened to the account of our success at Rassool Khima. In this affair all appeared to be individually interested and their surprize which we effected our objects against the principal town of this powerful tribe was extreme and will I am .confident produce a much greater sensation among the people at large than the details of an important victory achieved in any distant quarter could have effected. 9 A&lt;ra Jaffur Khan departed after a visit of two towns having previously expressed much 'anxfety that we should land on the same evening. I readily complied with his wishes in this respect and proceeded to the shore an hour before sunset without state and without any stipulation with regard to the manner of my reception. This however was igh y honourable and I was received on the beach by the Acting Governor, the merchants, etc., etc etc., under repeated discharges of artillery and with every other mark of respect which they possibly could hasten after the ceremony of culleans and coffee, at his house we proceeded to the Besidency of Mr. Bruce without the town. 147 Sheikh Abdul Rasul was released and reappointed Governor of Mo 4M BnsWre' in 1809 on the downfall of Mahomed Nnbi Khan When tW eo7 - Bombay Government learnt this news, they ordered that should Sheikh Abdul Rasul remain in his situation for a considerable time, Mr. Brace should keep in view the recovery of the amount due by him to the Company, whenever he might be capable of discharging it. #Part III—Chap. XIX. 65 % CHAPTER XIX. PMJXDER OF THE HECTOR AND BY SHEIKH OF JVAHHELII AND THE MEASVHES TAKEN FOU OBTAIN ING REPARATION, 1803-1807. 148 Our records from 1803 to 1807 are burdened with considerable correspondence about the plunder of the British ships the Hector and the Alert by the Sheikh of Nakhelu and his people, anil espeoiallythefoJer! Ihe case of the Hector is typical of the enormous difficulties the British Government has had to contend with in obtaining redress from the Persian authorities for the most atrocious breaches of international laws. No apolo^v is therefore needed for a somewhat lengthy prdois of the correspondence. 149. tn May 1803, the vessel (the Sector) which had been laden with q t at ,,, the Company s goods to the number of 850 bales passed into the Gulf on her ^pt'Ka' Ho. us voyage to Basrah and Bushire and when off of the port of Naklieln whioh of 1803, pp - 4462 ' a part on the main land of the Persian Coast, she in aground Wh !reuJon 4465 - tne Captam having fired guns, as a signal for small boats to come off to ass°st h .s getting into deep water the Sheikh of the port of the Nakhelu. Sheikh eima, a subject of the King of Persia, came to the place with a laree number of boats and boarded the ship and putting the ship's Captain and the crew out of their vessel, he made himself master thereof. The ship's crew and commander succeeded in reaching Maskat where they were kindlv treated and were despatched in the first vessel. y treated had left' Bufhireloi^J^mlfnv ' he Company's packets called the Alert which Secret and p„.i. a le t Jiusnire tor Bombay was driven by bad weather upon the Inland of ^ Di8r yNo.i47 Eusheab near Nakhelu. Shortly after she had struck, about five hundred S523 1803 ' PP ' ^ of the islanders came down and plundered her of tne treasure which she had on freight belonging 1o Bushire and Bussorah. The Captain in vain remon trated wilh them upon this conduct, adding that as the English and Persian On^rT ments were upon terms of such intimate friendship, he should make no rLS' ance that they were therefore at liberty to do whatever they pleased.

Letter from Khoja Fereedoodeen at Shiraz, date dt he 4th and received the 11th November 1803. You desired me in a former letter to mention the affairs of Naqueloo to Cheragh Alle Khan and at the same time you wrote upon that subject to Shaik Abdoor Russool. He was much distressed and hurt at the perusal of your letter. I have never yet had an opportunity of representing the business to the Khan m consequence of hi&amp; indisposition. I have since been favoured with another dispatch, giving cover to a note in your own handwriting declaring that you wished to conciliate and please the Shaikh s son, and that you had no cause of complaint against him. But if the father does not wish to proceed to Naqueloo do you think the son will consent to an application for positive orders to that effect ? In my opinion the Naqueloo business has been much injured by being made over to the Shaikh and its final settlement now appears most difficult. This conjecture is confirmed by a letter from the Shaikh to his son which arrived on the evening of the 31st October. Itf contents were nearly as followsFourteen French men of war have set out for the Persian Gulph of which number, six large ones have arrived and anchored at Muscat. The Raheemsha owed her safety to having got there a little before them, otherwise she would have fallen in their hands. One of these six which contains 400 Europeans and some officers of rank is destined for Bushire. In her are letters from the Chiefs of the French nation for th« King, the Prince and Cheragh Alle Khan, and perhaps also an Ambassador. You must shew this letter to Cheragh Alle Khan and explain all these particulars fully to him that he may furnish me with orders for the guidance of my conduct upon their arrival. There was likewise an arzee for Cheragh Alle Khau, which was probably to the same purport. The Shaikh's son first shewed this letter to the Ambassador, and Mohummed Hoossain Khan, who afterwards presented it to Cheragh Alee Khan, who after perusal returned a verbal answer upon its contents. By the Shaikh's playing these kind of tricks it appears that he does not wish to go down to Naqueloo. I shall act in this affair as you may dnect, I shall be permitted to depart to-morrow or next day, and make due haste to rejoin you. On the 2nd November a letter arriving for the Ambassador, we learn that a French frigate of 83 o-uns had come to Muscat to plunder as usual, and that the Raheemshah had by the blessing of God remained in safety and has most probably ere this pursued her voyage. All other affairs here are in their ordinary state. 152. The broker at Bushire was sent to the Sheikh of Nakhelu, with a letter of the Resident demanding restitution for the plunder of the vessels. s *«ret tad Poll. 153. He returned to Bushire on the 12th June 1804. From the tenor Dept No. 159 o£ 0 f his report and the evasive letter which he brought back from Sheikh iso^pp.^i-ysos. Resident at Bushire (Mr. Lovett) felt the necessity of pursuing coercive measures. The Sheikh proposed to restore half the goods, but even supposing he was sincere, his offer was considered totally unworthy of consi deration. 3 To accept it, the Resident thought would have been to compromise on very low terms with a man, whose conduct fell little short of piracy; who had taken advantage of the severe visitations of Providence to aggravate, instead of relieving, the pitiable distresses of his fellow creatures and whose exemplary punishment was in consequence an object no less desirable than any other species of reparation. 154. The Shiraz Government deputed one Aga Reza to enquire into the affair and exact reparation from Sheikh Rehma, and Sheikh Nasir of Bushire, and other Sheikhs on the coast were instructed by the Shiraz Government to co -operate. Aga Reza, who arrived at Bushire on the 13th June 1804, was given a ^rand reception by the Resident. No office of attention and respect that was due to his personal character and the dignity of the Prince from whom he was deputed was in the first place omitted. The Resident sent out tents for his reception at one stage from Bushire and a party as usual on such occasions to meet him on his entry into the town. He returned his first visit on the 15th June, and was on the 16th entertained at a party, at which some of the principal inhabitants, amongst the rest the son of the late Ambassador, werePart III—Chap. XIX, 67 loS. Sheikh Rehwia veiled much fov the secure enjoymeut of his plunder upon the venality of the person, who might he deputed to enforce its restitution. xbe Hesident endeavoured, however, without making any particular stipula tion, to convince Aga Reza of the superior advantages which he must obtain by pursuing an honourable course of conduct on the present occasion. It was pointed out to him the increased lustre which his reputation would acquire by the successful execution of the task now committed to him by seizing the opportunity which now presented itself and by vindicating the right of human* ity of laying two powerful Governments under an obligation to him. 156. The presents which the Resident made Aga Heza amounting to about R5,000 scarcely exceeded those of form upon such an occasion. The Resident proposed to divide a certain portion, say, 10 or 15 percent, of the plundered property, after deducting this and all other expenses, amongst those who might be concerned in its recovery. The charge was to be then entered in the lactory Books under the head of salvasre to which it would most probably belong. ^ 157. Sheikh Rehma, on being called to account for his conduct by the Shiraa Government, asserted the right of every country to the property which might he shipiorecked on its coasts, and Aga Reza thought that the principle might perhaps be recognized, had it not been for a regard to the persons who were sufferers on the present occasion, and the friendship which it was the desire of the Persian Government to preserve between the two nations inviolate. 158. On the coast of Guzerat and Konkan, though contrary to the law of nations and repugnant to the first principles of civilized society, the Resident believed the attempts hitherto made to repress such a barbarous practice had been without avail. The question was how far we could make the same attempts on the Persian Coast. Between the cases of the Alert and Sector, there might, in what could be called the refinement of barbarity, be some difference. One was wrecked beyond the power of recovery, the other, as far could be ascertained, had merely touched, and was very inconsiderably damaged, when she was taken possession of by Sheikh Rehnaa. 169. As httl^was done for many months to obtain reparation for the plunder ot the Hector, representations were duly made to the Shah by Mr. Manesty, wbo had gone to Teheran in 1804, on a self-imposed * task of • i lr l® i ssue( l a firman to the Prince of Shiraz, translation of wnich is given below:— Translation of Royal Firmaun to the Prince of Shiraz directing an immediate settlement of the affairs, Naquiloo, July 1804.

In the most vulner- ' a e P ar ts of that island he built two lofty towers which were constantly guarded by a well appointed garrison. He had entered into the strictest union M l * r of th0 Wahabi S0ct » eYer since the murder of the Imam of MasKat. it was reported Mahomed Zukki Khan, nephew of Abdula # Vide paragraph 22 ante. JL 168 Part III—Chap. XIX. Khan Sarri, was directed to hold himself in readiness for proceeding against Sheik Rehma, and that Zukki Khan declared his intention of avail- ino- himself of the assistance of another tribe of Arabs near Nakhelu, who were upon bad terms with Sheikh Rehmi and whom he expected to make subservient to his designs upon that Chieftain. On the other hand, it was rumoured that Zukkee Khan was unwilling to undertake this expedition and that he had spread abroad the above report merely to conceal his real senti ments. 161. Concprnins? the plundered property, our agent at Shiraz learnt that a person of the name of Mirza Banker, then at Gombmn, meeting Sheikh Rehma purchased from him goods to the amount of 6,000 lomans at a Ion* credit, 800 Tomans worth of which he immediately made over to a person at Yezd on account of an old debt due by him to Ilaji Ibrahim Shirazi (Oheragh Ali Khan's Agent), but that after the aDoyementioaed appropriation, Mirza Banker was unable to make a fanat agreement with Sheikh Rehma for the whole quantity originally purchased and returned hack the rest of the goods. None of the Shiraz merchants appeared to have made any purchases, but some Hyderabadis (Scindians) bought 23 bales and disposed of them again to a person of the name of Ilaji Mulla H ussi-id at two years' credit. Some other fezd merchants had also purchased small quantities from the Sheikh, but a considerable part still remained in the Sheikh's own possession, but was, as reported, deposited at the Island ot Ormus and Kumeize. 162 The following memorandum submitted by Captain Seton, Eesident at Dept*Diary ' ' Maskat, on July 1801, contains a description of the island of Busheab and its No. 158 of 1804, fortifications, when occupied by the Sheikh ot Nakhelu and his proposals for sending an expedition against Bnsheab The Island ot Bosheab to which Shaik Rehmeh haa retired is opposite to Nukheeloo, distant from the main abont 10 nr 12 miles, the water ronnd it is deep with good anchorage except at the northern end, where lies a reef with rocky bottom. The number of men on the island are few; but Shaikh Rehmeh's family when collected amount to 1,000 musquets, and he is connected with the Shaikh of Kas&gt;ul K iimeh and Izabara on the Arab main and those of Charek Usselao and Congoon on the Persian mam. The island has no fortifications but a mud wall round the houses. Should he find a larger force comin? against him than he could well resist, he would withdraw with his family and property to the Arab main. It is therefore requisite that more vessels than one should be employed as one must remove outside to prevent the communication with the Arab C )ast and one within the ibland to prevent it with the Persian main and also to prevent his running away. It is also requisite that the expedition should be such as would ensure success, as an unsuccessful one in the present disturbed state of the Gulf would be the sign for a genera plunder on the English trade. Should the Mormngton and Teignmouth with one gun-boat be the vessels employed, they could carry over and above their complement of marines amount- ins on the three vessels to about one hundred 30 artillery and 30 mfantry with two fie d pieces and their ammunition, forming a force of 600 musquets and two iruns. To w.uc i cou be added six hundred Sindi and Arab sepoys to be hired at Muscat, the monthly expense of which would be 6,000 rupees. The small boats and transports for which to be furnished by the Emam. The time required from leaving Muscat would be two months. The Emam's presence with his vessels and the 500 men who generally accompany him would be efficacious in ensuring success, but our own force should be sufficient to admit ot his remainino- inactive as I am fully convinced he would never proceed to extremities against Shaikh Kehmeh but lose time in negotiating, disperse his people and allow Shaikh Rehmch o effect his escape, be assisted with such a force as it would be dangerous to attempt. Should an expedition on the above plan not be adopted and a single vessel sent, it must confine itself entirely to negotiations or remain at Busheab, cruizing against those that approach the island and by destroying their boats and shipping reduce them to distress, but there is little chance of any good resulting from this plan, as a single vessel could do u itt e from the proximity of Shitwar and other island towards blockading the place. 163. The Bombay Government were, however, averse to sending an expedition against a Sheikh, who was a subject of the King of Persia, and wished to rely upon the Persian authorities for making the necessary reparation The persistent representations of our acting Resident at Bashire (Mr. lirucf)Part III—Chap. XIX. gg had at last their effect. Sheikh Nasir proceeded at last with an expedition against Bushaeb. Sheikh Rehma ^ave up at first a portion of the plunder. But as the Resident insisted on the recovery of the whole plunder on proper restitution, Sheikh Nasir by a clever stratagem secured the person of Sheikh Rehma's son and brought him as a hostage to Bushire. This had the desired effect and induced Sheikh Rehma in making substantial res titution for the plunder of the Hector. 164, The Bombay Government having, however, obtained information Secret and Poll, from Bashire that Sheikh Rahman bin TJllak and Sheikh Sief of Aselu had H 6 ? 4, conjointly participated to the amount of 33,750 Rupees in the property illegally p.^eeo. 0 180j obtained by Sheikh Rehma ; and knowing that vessels belonging to each of them were in the Bombay harbour, it was deemed necessary in order to procure indemnity to the Company to direct an embargo to be laid on these vessels, until the persons in charge of them should pay or give security for the value of the cloth which their masters had wrongfully received. This, however, the parlies having declared their inability to comply with from their want of acquaintances at Bombay, and the Government being desirous to proceed into the Company's claims against the Chieftain of Aselu, and Sheikh Abdur Ruhman bin Ullak in a manner the most accommodating to themselves, without abandoning the grounds of our claims, instructed Mr. Bruce to investigate into the alleged charges against the Sheikhs and therefore consented to allow the departure of the vessels in question upon condition that Haji Hussein Abdulla and another, the former for Sheikh Sief and the latter for Sheikh Abdur Rahman bin Ullak, held themselves answerable for a space of nine months until the result of the proposed investigation at Bushir© was known. 165. The Hurrum family were the inhabitants and holders of the port of Aselu, the eldest brother of whom was called Sheikh Sief, the second Sheikh Hulfan, the third Sheikh Ahmud, all three sons of Sheikh Saghar and Governor and deputies of that port. Sheikh Abdur Rahman bin Ullak was not of the Hurrum family but distinct and is the Governor of the nort of Gauvedi. Sheikh Sief having made a representation to the Shiraz Govern ment on the proceedings of the British authorities, the Prince of Shiraz wrote to the Governor of Bombay as follows :— Translation of a Firmaun from His Highness Hussan Alee, Prince of Shiraz, to the Hon'ble Jonathan Duncan, Governor of Bombay, without date, and received the 10th February 1807. Hie very respectable Shyk Syf of the Hurrum family has conveyed a representation to the Presence stating that several of his vessels having been dispatched to that quarter in the bye past year, the ofticer of your Government under doubt with regard to them and suspecting Shykh Syf to have participated in the property plundered from the Hector, with Shykh Rehma had laid an embargo on them, but the case is as follows. Shykh Syf is a faithfnl servant of this durable (lovernment and is of the numbers to whom is assigned the duty of furnishing and chastizing Shaikh Rehma, and thus the occurrence of this circumstance is inconsistent with the^ friendly line of conduct mutually observed by both States and at variance with His Majesty s intentions, it is therefore commanded and desired upon becoming apprized of the proceeding that you give the directions that wherever the ships or people of the respectable aioresaid may repair to that quarter, such conduct as this shall be put a stop to in regard to them and that they may experience every friendly attention, and support allowing no excess or obstacles being exercised towards them, and in this respect considering the Royal favours and kindnesses extended towards them. Address yourself to His Majesty with regard to your wishes and solicitations which will be duly attended to, ^ 166. A similar firman was received from Cherag Khan, Minister of the Prince of Shiraz. Up 011 furtber investigation it was found that there was not sufficient Swrct «nd Pdi. evidence of participation of the two tribes in the property of the Rector S 0pt .

In transmitting the accompanying copy of a letter from Mr. Williams of the Civil Service for the information of the Hobble Board, I have the honour to acquaint you that on Mr. Williams leaving this for Sheras, I officially acquainted that Government of the drcum- stances advising that he proceeded for change of climate and requested that the Zabuts and chiefs of the village he might reside at should be instructed to be civil and kind to him and supply him with such necessaries as he might require, paying for the same. He was also living at this time in one of the Prince's gardens by the permission of His Royal Highness ; consequently was to be considered as more immediately under the Prince s protection, notwith standing which he has been insulted in such a disgraceful and shameful manner that even decency forbids mentioning ; the three officers who are the aggressors are in the immediate employ of the Prince and consequently about his person. 1 shall take an early opportunity of addressing His Royal Highness in terms showing him the abhorrence we entertain of such proceedings and expressing my surprise that he should have foregone punishing the offenders that could be guilty of such conduct, notwithstanding Mr. Williams should have expressed himself satisBed, which it was natural he should do out of respect for His Royal Highness. As the culprits were brought into his presence for punish ment, I conceive the more necessary as His Ko&gt;al Highness restored these officers to avour immediately after Mr. Williams' departure from Sheras. The venality and duplicity of tins Government is quite distressing to any person who has business to transact with them ; tor no dependence is to be placed on anything they say or firmauns that they issue. I shall also bring this affair to the notice of H. M/s Minister at Teheran, and I trust the Right Hon ble the Governor in Council will approve of my intentions. Dated Bushire, the 29th September 1816. From— M b, J ohn W illiams , of the Bombay Civil Service, To— M b. W illiam B bcob , Resident at Bushire. It is with much regret I have to complain to you of the infamous and brutal conduct Po'!. Dept.

On the 30th of August last when at the Prince's garden two servants came to inform me that Feridoon Khan and two others wished to call on me; being in a bad state of health I declined seeing them, notwithstanding which they forced themselves into my presence and remained half an hour walking about the room abusing me and beating my servants; they then left me and an hour afterwards eight of their servants came to tell me they were coming ao-ain and I again declined seeing them and endeavoured to escape down stairs, but was prevented and forcibly brought back into the room. They remained insulting me most infamously for upwards of an hour till at last their conduct became so brutal, I was compelled to make my escape by a rope out of the window at the risk of my life. On my departure from this in May last I carried an official letter from you to one of the Prince's officers reporting my arrival at Sheraz, consequently I felt myself under the Prince's protection and applied to him to punish the officers which was with difficulty acceded to. feridoon Khan was not brought forward but the other two were disgraced and expressed myself satisfied, so it is not my wish that a further punishment should be enforced on them, but it will I hope appear to you advisable to represent it to the Persian Government in the strongest terms and also to the Envoy at Teheran.Part III—Chap.

The result of Mr. Bruce's representations, on which he had to persist for a long time, was that the Prince of Shiraz ordered that the culprits should undergo bastinadoing in the presence of a British officer. Richard Sharpe, Assistant Surgeon, was especially deputed to Shiraz to witness the punishment 169. His Royal Highness immediately ordered the three men, viz., Aga Mahomed Bakher, Faridun Khan, and Manachie Bey to be brought forward and delivered them to the Ferashes to be bound to the Tullank, where in Mr. Sharpe's presence were severely bastinadoed (Mr Sharpe's letter dated i7th July 1818 to Mr Bruce).72 Part III—Chap.

Dept. Diary the melancholy fate of the Bombay Marine Cruizer Ariel comm^ from Basrah p p 0 '2G 8 o3°26 1 o 8 6 20, to Bushire, about 13 miles to the S. E. of Karrak. At 3 a.m . on the morning of the 18th she was taken in a most severe squall, and she foundered with all hands on board except five, who although drawn down by the suction of the vessel came up again, and fortunately got hold of a canoe, which had floated off her decks, and which they managed by pulling with their hands and legs to reach Karrak at night about 9 o'clock in the most wretched state, perfectly naked, as the few clothes they had on at the time they were obliged to tear up to tie two sweeps to the canoe which were adrift to prevent her turning over. Here the Sheikh received them in the most humane manner, and took care of them, providing them with victuals, the best he could afford, and sent them over to Bushire on the 22nd March in a boat. 171. The persons saved from the Ariel were Assistant Surgeon Clare, Johnson, boatsman, Thomas Brown, seaman, James Wall, Marine boy, and a Bunderickman. She had on board in all eighty-three souls, seventy-eight of which have perished in her, amongst them a Karrak Patil with his son. Johnson the boatsman reported that the whole of the night of Friday had been cloudy and became squally after midnight, when the squall came on suddenly and most furiously with severe thunder and lightning, which forced the vessel under water laying down in her broad side, bows foremast almost instantaneously before a soul could get up the hatchways. 172. The Ariel had left Basrah on the 12th March and had on board some bundles of Europe newspapers for Government ; they experienced nothing but southerly winds which made her so long in getting down; they passed the Vestal and H. M. S. Eden at the entrance of the river. 173. The Resident advanced the men saved a few rupees to provide themselves with clothes and took an early opportunity of sending the Sheikh of Karrak a small present of about E500 (five hundred) for his kind and humane conduct towards those unfortunate persons. 174. The Governor in Council expressed great satisfaction at the humane treatment experienced by the survivors from the Sheikh of Karrak and entirely approved of the Resident's having forwarded a present to that Chief to the extent reported (Letter dated 18th April 1820). • See an interesting account of this shipwreck in Low's History of the Indian Navy, Chapter XI.Part IY.

Mehdi Ali Khan, a Persian gentleman of rank, and a wealthy Mehdi au Khan, merchant, who had attracted in India the attention of Mr. Duncan bv his indent, Bushire, abilities and influence, and attachment to the British, was rewarded with the 1798 ' 1803 - latter's friendship and ultimately with the appointment of Resident at Bushire in 1798. The Persian amply justified the appointment by inducing the Imam of IMaskat to sign in 1798 the Koulnama, the first of our treaties with that chief, by his successful mission to the Court of Persia and increase of our trade in Persia. One defect in his character was what Malcolm calls his ' mendacity,' which he however employed as much in the interests of the British Sarkar as in his ow r n. 176. In 1801, while Malcolm was still at the Court of the Shah, Mehdi Secret and Poll. Ali Khan was employed by the Bombay Government on a mission to Mocha, S ept ]0 - iar f v ls1l and during his absence the following arrangements were made by him for p. 0 i283. 0 managing the Besidency affairs:— He appointed Omdutettejaur, Aka Mahomed Jafar, Zabattetet'jar Aka Mahomed llossein, and Khoja Aratoon, to take care of and protect the property of the Company, with instructions to pay the utmost and most unremitted attention to the details of their service. Omdutettejaur being to exercise the duties of Neabut or of Deputyship and Zubdutettejaur those of Wuzarut of Stewardship, and Khoja Aratoon those of Tehveel dauree, i.e., to hold the immediate charge and custody of all the articles, whether of money or goods. It was incumbent on tbem to exert themselves in the sales of the latter, as soon as the alarm about the plague was dissipated, considering the prices the same as those of the previous year and not liable to the variation of a single deenar. It would greatly redound to their credit if they should be able to procure the vend of a considerable quantity of the goods previous to his return; and in the event of the plague reaching Bushire they were to transport the Company's goods to wherever the property and families of Mullukettejaur, Haji Kheleel and of Haji Ismail might be removed to, and remain deposited. With respect to the delivery of the goods that should hav^e been sold, it was necessary that the authority and order for all issues of this kind be given conjointly to the sepoys, from all the three persons above named; and all receipts from the merchants of the prices of the ^oods which were to be carefully recovered as they fall due— must be immediately lodged under the charge of Khoja Aratoon in the Treasury, over which the Company's sepoys must day and night remain constantly stationed as sentinels, and each of the three persons above named were to keep accounts of the receipt of all sums of money on account of the Sarkar; as lon2: as Captain Malcolm remained in Persia, whatever requisition he might make, or order he might issue, were to be considered as those of Government itself, and every attention paid that not a hair's breadth of deviation take place in the execution of any of his commands; every Sunday from sun rise to sun set the flag was to remain hoisted and whenever any ship appeared in the offing, dis playing the English colours, it was to be immediately answered by the hoisting of the Residency, and on the three festival days, viz., Christmas, IS'ew Year's day and His Majesty the King of Great Britain's Birthday, the usual ceremonies were to be observed and the accustomed gratuities be bestowed on the sepoys, etc. 177. The following order was passed by the Bombay Government in regard to the above arrangements on April 1801 : — The Nawaub is by my orders now setting out for Mokha where he will be absent two or three months; you will continue, until his return, to act exactly according to the written instructions he has left with you, and use every endeavour to dispose of the greatest quantity possible of the Honourable Company ; s goods, a circumstance that will redound much to your credit and reputation hereafter.

Lovett, a gentleman of rank and position, as Resident at Bushire. 179. With regard to the assignment of a provision for Mehdi Ali Khan and his family, the Government of India stated in their letter dated 28th April 1803, that although the conduct of Mehdi Ali Khan had on some occasions been indiscreet and improper, His Excellency entertained a favourable opinion of his general zeal and exertions for the promotion of the British interests, and His Excellency in Council was happy to acknowledge that the public service had occasionally derived considerable benefit from the energy and ability of Mehdi Ali Khan in the discharge of the duties which had been assigned to him. The Governor-General in Council therefore resolved to grant to Mehdi Ali Khan a stipend of R800 per mensem during his life and five hundred Rupees per mensem to his two sons or the survivors of them. 180. Mirza Mehdi Ali Khan died at Bombay on 25th July 1801 leaving two sons and several females of his family, who had no other prospect of support (as he was said to have left little or no fortune) than the pension settled on them by the Government of India. Writing about a request made by him on his last moments, Mr. Duncan wrote the Govern or-General on 25th July 1804 :— It was this old servant of this Hon'ble Company's request to me three days a^o that his body might be transported for burial to Nijeff, and as I could not refuse what he was so earnest in entreating- and the assurance of which made his last moments easy to him, I trust Your Excellency will approve of my carrying the engagement thus contracted into effect. It will not, it is understood, involve an expense of above twenty thousand rupees at the utmost, which considering the deceased's services will not I hope be objected to either by the Supreme Govern ment or the Court of Directors, who are well apprized of his meritorious exertions in the year 1798-1799 as appears by the very honourable mention made thereof in the letter of that period from the Secret Committee to the .Resident at Bagdad which has long been before Your Excellency. 181. Mr. Duncan recorded the following minute in regard to the proposed funeral of Mehdi Ali Khan and his services to the Company ;— In my letter to His Excellency the Governor-General of the 25th of last month, I have advised him of the demise of Mirza Mehedy Ali fcChan, and of the intention I entertained, in compliance with his dying entreaty, to have his body transported to Nadjiff, in pursuance cf which it has been already suitably embarked on board the Crevla, and I have since accepted of the offer of Mr. Henshaw Junior lately returned from several months' residence at Bushire to proceed with the corpse to the place of his interment, on the sole condition of that gentle man's expenses being defrayed, which he has faithfully promised to keep within as narrow limits as possible, with only such small additional remuneration as the experienced merit of his services may, after the conclusion of the undertaking, appears entitled to. Mr. Henshaw's superintendence on this occasion will tend materially to ensure the regular orderly decorous attainment of the object, and probably promote, instead of counter-acting the keeping of the whole expense within the sum allowed to, in my address to the Governor-General, viz., from 15 to 20,000 rupees; which if neither the Supreme Government nor the Court of Directors shall be pleased to sanction, I hereby engage to hold myself responsible to them, to the amount of, as a mark of attention, which I can never regret, to have shewn to the last solicitations of an extraordinary man whose uncommon talents have during a period of about eighteen years been in various instances ably applied to the promotions of the British interests in that quarter of A^ia, extending from the Ganges river to the Caspian and Red Seas, of which the Company at home have more than once expressed their sense ; accompanying their latest mention of the subject in relation more pai*ticularly to the beneficial operation of bis great proceedings in that quarter and to the increased vend he had made such progress in introducing, and was so likely to establish, for our British woollens, with the expression of the desire, that some complimentary token of their approbation might be bestowed on him by this Government; and as no good opportunity occurred of carrying this part of their orders into effect, they may perhaps be pleased to consider it the more allowable to be put to some experiences in procuring for him a coveted grave. The pensions settled on him and his family by the Supreme Government was in con sideration to his important political services in Persia, at the period of our last glorious struggle with Tippoo Sultan by which it is ascertained, and has been repeatedly acknowledged by every authority that he turned off the aims of lemaun Shaw the Abdalle King of Cabool from co-operating with Tippoo, at that critical period of the British fortunes in India after that monarch had advanced with that decided and avowed intention beyond Lahore; for which the deceased's rewards have after all fallen, I am sorry to find, short of his expectations consisting of a now lapsed pension to himself of S800 per month (combining also a compensation for the loss of his office of Commercial Resident at Bushire) and of one of R600 that becomes payable sinoa has death to kus two children, for otherwise he never received any salary or other77 Part IV—Chap. XXII. remuneration (saving that his actual outlay was defrayed) for that highly important mission, in the year 1798-1799, to the Court of Persia although the good effects flowing from his own sug- getted interposition at that crisis can scarcely be too highly appreciated, 182. Mr. Lovett, who had heen appointed Resident at Bushire in 1803, ^ fell ill soon after his arrival at the place, and as Mr. Mmesty, Resident at at £*1^, mi! Basrah, was anxious to distinguish himself in Persia, he offered to relieve Mr Lovett, and arrangements were made for this purpose without obtaining the orders of Government. This was in February 1804.. Soon after taking charge, from Mr. Lovett, Mr. Manesty proceeded on a mission to the Court of the Kinf. He was peremptorily recalled and ordered to go back to Basrah by the Government of India, as they entirely disapproved of Mr. Manesty's unauthor ized and uncalled for proceedings. It was not known whether Mr. Lovett's health and other circumstances Selections No. 63 of mi^ht admit of his returning to Bushire and there was no certainty that isoi-isu. Mr! Manesty would repair again to Basrah by the way of Bushire; the probability bein' 1 rather that be could take his route by Baghdad (in the same manner as Mehdi Ali Khan, and after him Major Malcolm had done on their respective returns from the Court of Persia), as likewise, that he might well consider himself exonerated from all further charge of the affairs of Bushire which, bv the spirit and plain operation of the late determination of the Governor-General, he might now in fact be justly construed to stand excluded from, and restricted as before to his established functions at Bassora. 183 Under these circumstances, the Bombay Government decided that Lieutenant William Bruce, then Assistant to the Factory at Bushire, be vested Retident with thp PTfolusive authoritv over the commercial interests of that Residency, 1804. pending the aWce o£ Mr. Lovett or till fnrther orders (Proeeedings. dated 2nd August 1804.) 184.

Bombay Government's orders wrote as follows to the latter on 23rd November ^ 1 go5 f 1804i:— PP' 592 * 594 - As I deem it advisable in consideration of the situation of the public interest connected with the unfortunate Busheabee basiness that Lieutenant Bruce should still continue to act at Bushire as my ostensible Deputy and Representative, I have furnished him vrith a copy ot vour duplicate commands in question, and made an official communication to which 1 have the honour to enclose a copy in the hope that it may meet your approbation. 2 The only recovery which I had it in my power to make from Alcah Mahomed Nebee Khan 'in Persia on account of his Bushire debt to the Hon'ble Company was a sum of Piastris Raiee 14,250 for which credit has been given in the accounts of the Mission j but in the event of arrival here, on his way to Bushire or of his return to that place by the w ay 0 * Teheran and Shiraz, I shall either personally or by letter strenuously urge bun to put that laro-e debt into an immediate train of liquidation, although I have any reason to suppose from the circumstance of my having found it absolutely necessa^ to afford h,m peenmary a.d m Persia in order to meet him the immense expense to which he was unavoidably exposed by the lonff delay of the Mission at Bushire and by his consequent recall from ^hiraz to Court m the month of April last, that he entertains very warm hopes of obtaining from Government a further extension of credit. 8. I had the pleasure to effect at Shiraz the recovery of all the Hon'ble Company 's outstanding demands on individuals residing there and I shall unit ormly give Lieutenan Bruce every advice and assistance which he may officially require. 185. Mr. Bruce, the Acting Resident at Bushire, was in March 1807 Persian honors honored with the present of a Khelat from the Prince of Fars, probably with Bmce, 1807. a view to disarm suspicions that would be roused by the arrival of a French embassy at the Persian Capital, and the friendly reception given to it. Ihe following letter of Mr. Bruce, dated 29th March 1807, describes the event I have the honour to inform you that on the 18th instant I received a lettei from 1807. Muhammad Howaire Khan Keishtie, informing me that he bad been ordered by His Royal Secret and roll.

I of course was not a little astonished at the contents of the letter, a circumstance of the kind never having occurred here before ; and I accordingly sent a message to the Shaik to know if he was aware of the reason of this intended honor, which the Prince meant to confer on me ; he said he was as much at a loss as mvself, but requested I would be prepared to receive it, as it would arrive on the 241 h and that he bad received orders himself to attend with all the principal inhabitants of the town and his Musqueturs at the investiture ; and that it would be proper for me to pitch a tent at some distance from the town to receive it in, as I must riae into town in state upon tLe m 1Part IV—Chap.

He also said that the Prince and Nassur Ulla Khan requested that I would keep up a regular friendly correspondence with them and begged I would communicate these particulars to your Hon'ble Board, as also mention m ray answer to Nassur Ulla Khan the particular of what he had said, that this Minister nught b e certain of his having fulfilled his instructions ; I told him I of course should acquaint your Hon ble Board of these particulars and agreeable to his request would mention them in my letter to Nassur Ulla Khan ; and that I could safely say on the part of the British Government, that the good understanding which now existed would never be infrino-ed bv them, thac whenever we formed connexions with other Governments it was always pure and disinterested on our part; he also told the Shaikh in my presence that he was ordered to miorm him ihat he was to attend t') every requisition made by the British Resident here upon pain of meeting the severest displeasure of His Majesty in case of not doing it. ' I shall write answers to the firmaun and letters 1 have received to-morrow or next dav and hope by the next despatch to forward copies of the firmaun and different letters with their translations for the information of the Hon'ble Board. It will be requisite to make a handsome present to Toral Beg and Muhammad Hossain Khawn on the.r leaving this, with a few small ones to these Mirzas, etc., and of course shall be guided m this agreeable to the etiquette of the country and the credit of the British Gov- eminent.

As far as it is possible for me to form a judgment upon the probable conduct of the Persian Ministry, I do not think it at all likely that they will after the departure of the mission continue to entertain those unwarrantable designs against yourself and the small party remaining with you, which I had such just reason for supposing to have been in contemplation against this mission for the escort and Indian attendants attached to it being thus removed, you will I hope no longer appear to them as fit objects of that jealousy which however ridicu lous and unfounded certainly existed in a great degree in their minds while the troops and followers attached to General Malcolm's suite continued still at Bushire. Should you however have just reason to apprehend any thing of the kind, or should the conduct of the Persian Government in any way render such a measure in your eyes necessary, you will without hesitation withdraw the factory and join me at Bussora without delay. That you may always possess the means of a speedy retreat it will be necessary that a cruizer should constantly be established at Bushire and I shall concert measures with the Resident of Bussora for that purpose. You will constantly keep me advised of all occurrences and give me the earliest intelligence of every political event that may take place transmitting copies of your reports to me on those points to the Secretary to Government in the Political Department at Fort William by every opportunity with such additional information as may in the interval have come to your knowledge, you will also transmit copies of all your despatches to the Hon'ble the Governor in Council at Bombay and to Brigadier-General Malcolm. You will of course be prepared to make over to me the office of Political Resident and to place all things on the same footing on which |they were left by General Malcolm, should circumstances hereafter induce me to return to Bushire at any future period,Part IV—Chap.

We have seen in the Selections from the Bombay Records, 1600—1800, Consolidation of that the treaty concluded by General Malcolm in 1800 with the Imam 0 f the Residencies Maskat provided for the appointment of an agent at that place. Mr, Bogle Bush^ was the first Agent appointed, but he died by the end of the year. Captain David Seton took his place, but was appointed to some other agency in the Bombay Presidency in 1804. In 1805 he was sent again to Maskat in pursuance of the instructions of the Government of India (see paragraph 86 above). Lieutenant Watts was appointed to act for Captain Seton in 1808, but died on September the same year. 190.^ A malignant fever carried off Captain Seton in August 1809 Dept. to the sincere regret of Government and all who knew his worth. There ^o^and No^i arrived at Maskat soon after His Majesty's ship The Caroline^ and. on Captain of 1809, p. 9108. Gordon being apprized of the sad event by the broker and consulted with respect to the Company's property, he appointed one of the officers of the ship Isaac Boherts to take temporary charge of the Residency. Mr. Bunce was appointed by the Bombay Government to succeed the late Captain Seton. 191. Mr. Bunce died at Maskat, in December 1809. It was thought that Diary English constitutions were unequal to withstand the baneful effects of the climate at Maskat, and Government had to decide to stop sending any more British officers as Residents at that place and to place Maskat under the supervision of the Resident at Bushire, Mr. Hankey Smith. The following letter, dated 13th January 1810, to the address of Lord Minto expresses the views of the Bombay Government (Mr. Duncan, etc.) on the matter and the arrangements they made for reconstructing the Bushire Residency:— 'We have the honour to transrnit, for the decision of Your Ijordship, the accotnpanyin&lt;^ copy of a letter addressed to us by Brigadier-General Malcolm, under diite the 7fcli instant, stating the circumstances that render it, in his opinion, highly expedient, under the present and prospective state of the Gulph of Persia, to consolidate the Residencies of Bnshire and Muscat in the person of Mr. N. H. Smith, inclusive of the considerations that make it desir able that Mr. Smith should in this capacity proceed immediately to join the armament, and conduct the negotiations that may be expected to be entered into with the piratical Chief tains, on the termination of the present service in that quarter. 2. Having no reason to doubt that the view, which Brigadier-General Malcolm has taken of the local circumstances of the Residencies of Muscat and Bushire, will meet with the entire concurrence and approbation of Your Lordship, that officer has t&gt;een accordingly informed that this (lovernment will have no objection to his authorizing Mr. Smith to extend his political superintendence as Resident to the affairs of Muscat, pending the final arrangement which may be, in that respect, deemed advisable, after the return of the armament, now in the Gulph, with the information thereon expected from the Commander?, in pursuance of *the 1.4th paragraph of their instructions dated the 7th of September 1809, as to any situation more salubrious than Muscat, for the permanent or occasional abode of a British Resident, or of an assistant as such, in the probable event of the Generals' suggestions on that head being sanctioned by Your Lordship. 3. It is our intention, under an anticipation of Your Lordship^s sanction and in further immediate prosecution of the plan, to furnish Mr. Smith with two Civil Servants, as assistants, to be stationed where he may think fit and with such allowances as shall be deemed suitable to their stations ; and we shall also consult with our Superintendent of the Marine as to the most available means of placing a cruizcr at the disposal of the Resident, as frequently as the general exigencies of the service may admit. 4. In the event of Your Lordship in Council adopting the arrangement recommended by Brigadier-General Malcolm, we beg leave to request that the line may be distinctly drawn with respect to the degree of subordination in which Mr. Smith (as the Hon'ble Companv's General Agent in the Gulph of Persia) may stand in relation to the Presidency, both in his Folitical Commercial capacities, we offer this suggestion from the experience we have had • Vide paragraph 125 of this Pr ^cii above.Part IV—Chap. XXIII. of the inefficiency of our occasionally reserved and qualified authority over eithei single officers or bodies, acting at the same time under a superior power, and as from the nature of things similar consequences must we apprehend be always more or less contemplatea; we feel so far an interest that the arrangements now to be determined should be calculated, as far as possible, to avoid a prejudicial collision of authorities, in whichever channel it may be thought most beneficial for the public service that it should be exercised. 192. In March 1810 Mr. N. H. Smith, Resident at Bushire, who was about to proceed to Maskat on duty, appointed Lieutenant William Bruce his assistant pp 2290 and 2i33. to take charge of the duties o£ Eesident during his absence. Soon after, however. Lieutenant Bruce was ordered by General Malcolm to proceed up country, with the Persian mission, and left Mr. S. Babington in charge of the Bushire Residency. 193. In his letter dated 1st May 1810, Mr. Smith informed the Bombay im, p. 2334. Government, that the pernicious effect of the climate of Maskat obliged him to resign all further charge of the duties of that station. In these circumstances the following Resolution was recorded by the Bombay Government on 9th May 1810:— In consequence of Mr. Smith's relinquishment of the station of Muscat, the appointment of Messrs. Babington and Williams as assistants to the latter in the Political Department at Bushire and Muscat must of course be dissolved; and as Mr. Bruce who has so long acted as assistant to the Commercial Resident at Bushire, from which he cannot be removed without undue hardship or some fault on his part, constituted an establishment quite equal to all the purposes of the existing or even the prospective views of the Hon'ble Company, as to any extent of trade that can be carried on in the Gulph on their account; it appears under these circumstances necessary to revert to that part of the original instructions to Captain Wam- wrioht and to Colonel Smith, which had for object to provide a more healthy station for the residence of the person or persons who might be destined to have the future superintendence ot the Company's concerns at Muscat, in which view these officers are now to be requested by the Secretary to report the result of their enquiries and observations. Meanwhile, it should be communicated to Mr. Babington and Mr. Williams that although thev are no longer to consider themselves as Assistants at Bushire than to the end of April last, vet they might remain there and the former perform the duties of that Residency as committed to him by General Malcolm and Mr. Bruce, till further orders. It is in the meanwhile to be earnestly enjoined to these gentlemen to qualify themselves fully during their abode at Bushire for future employment in the Gulph by acquiring a thorough and practical knowledge both of Persian and Arabic.Part IV—Chap. XXIV. g2 CHAPTER XXIV. MR. SMITH'S RESIGNATION—RECONSTITIJTIO^ OF THE BLSHIRE RESIDENCY, 1811-1813. 194. In March 1811, Mr. H. Smith resigned his appointment of Resident in the Persian Gulf. In consequence of this resignation and the small prohahility of that station leiug filled by any renewed nomination to it, pending the subsistence of a national Embassy a f the Court of Persia, it was resolved by the Bombay Government on 29th March 1811 that the sepoy guard at that station as originally formed on its existing augmentation, at the instance of General Malcolm, for the purposes of Mr. Smith's Political Residency, be reduced to its former standard—for the use and protection of our Commercial Residency only. 1 he Commanding officer of the Forces and Lieutenant Bruce were advised and instructed to cause the surplus men and officers to be returned by the earliest opportunity that might offer to the Presidency. 195. C)n 22nd May 1811 the Bombay Government ordered that Lieutenant Poll. Dept. Diary Bruce be informed that as the Political Residency at Bushire had been No - 374 , 0 V 811 ' abolished from the 29th of March, it was not probably expected by the pp ' 284,5— 846 ' Supreme Government that he should continue his correspondence in that channel. 196. We have seen above how the Bombay Government resolved on 29th March 1811 to reduce the sepoy guard at Bushire, as there was little prospect after Mr. Smith's resignation of any renewed nomination to the Residency there, pending the subsistence of the mission to the Court of Persia. On the 22nd May they informed Lieutenant Bruce that as the Political Residency at Bushire had been abolished from the 29th March, he was not probably expected by the Supreme Government that he should continue his correspondence in that channel. 197. General Malcolm returned from his mission to Persia in July 1811 (vide para. 49 ante), as the Home Government had determined to depute Sir Gore Ousley as an envoy of His Majesty the King, and thus to entirely take the manage ment of the Persian affairs in their own hands, the Bombay Government in the circumstances considered that there was no necessity to maintain a full paid Resident at Bushire. As it was however thought necessary to maintain a representative at that post for the preservation of the East India Company's political privileges inclusive of the right to hoist the British flaij and for the eventual purpose of making occasional purchases of the products of Persia, Mr. Bruce was ordered to remain in temporary charge of the station on his personal allowance (Bombay Government Resolution dated 2nd July 1811). 198. The correspondence and discussion that follows is so interesting and important that it is brought out in extenso below :— No. 385, dated Fort William, the 3rd April 1812. From— Lord Minto , Governor-General and Council, To—The Hon'ble Geceqe Beown , Esq., President and Governor in Council, Bombay. Having taken into our consideration the question relative to the Residency at Bushire which formed a subject of correspondence between the two Presidencies in the months of May, June and July last year and the decision of which was suspended on account of the absence of the Governor-General from the Presidency, we have now the honour to communicate to you the result of our deliberation on that subject. 2. Adverting to the Resolutions adopted by Your Hon'ble Board on the 2nd July 1811, a copy of which was transmitted to this Presidency in a letter from your Chief Secretary' dated the 15th of that month, with an intimation that those Resolutions' of course lay open to such amendment as the supreme authority in India might prescribp, we have the honour to state that we entirely concur in the principle of the arrangement therein described intending Poll. Dept Diary No. H85 of 1812, pp. 852-858.83 Part IV—Chap. XXIV. merely on the l^asis of that arrangement, to suggest a modification of the condition of the Residency relative to the two Presidencies and of the channel of the correspondence of the Resident on subjects of a political nature and an alteration of the scale of his allowances fixed by the Resolutions of your Board above referred to. 8. Although the management of our political concerns in Persia has been transferred to the Crown, there yet remains some objects and duties of a political nature which appear to us to require the presence of a British Resident at Bushire. His Agency must occasionally be of material utility to His Majesty's Ambassador at the Court of Tehran, especially in provid ing funds by negotiating the Ambassadors Bills and with reference to immediate interests of the Company's Government. We consider it of importance to maintain that degree of politi cal representation which exists on the part of Government in the office of Resident at Bushire primarily because (contrary to the express intention and orders of His Majesty's Government) the removal of the Resident would have a tendency to countenance the impression of a distinc tion of interest between the Crown and the Company which a concurrence of circumstances had unfortunately produced in Persia, whilst the opposite belief of their real union and identity will be supported by the concert and co-operation with His Majesty's Ambassador which it is the duty of the Resident to maintain in all transactions in which the former may have occasion to command the Agency of the latter. 4. His presence is further useful in conveying intelligence of affairs in Persia as far as they may properly fall within the limits of his observation, and especially in attending to the public interests as connected with the conduct and proceedings of the piratical and other States bordering on the Gulph. 5. Your Hon'ble Board has also very justly suggested the additional inducement to maintain the Residency at Bushire, arising from the propriety of preserving the privilege, hoisting the British flag as well ag for the eventual purpose of making such occasional purchases of the products of Persia as may hereafter happen to be required under the rules that may be prescribed for the guidance of the Resident. To which may be added the facilities and advantages which may be afforded by his presence to the intercourse of the trade of the Gulph as thrown open by your Resolution of the 2nd July. 6. We are however of opinion that the political duties which under present circumstances the Resident may have occasion to discharge are not of a nature to require that he should continue with respect to concerns of that description under the immediate orders of the Supreme Government or maintain a direct correspondence with the Presidency, and we there fore propose that the Kesidency of Bushire should revert to its original relation towards the Government of Bombay by being placed on the same footing with respect to that Government as the Residency of Bagdad, your Hon'ble Board conveying such of the communication which you may receive from the Resident as you may deem interesting and referring to us such points as may appear to you to require our deliberation and decision, and we shall accordingly direct the necessary information regarding this arrangement to be conveyed to the Resident at Bushire, and we request that you will be pleased to transmit to him corresponding instructions on your part. 7. With reference to the scale of the Resident's allowances (the second point to which we have proposed to advert) we transmit enclosed a copy of a letter from Lieutenant Bruce to our Chief Secretary under date the 17th December, soliciting permission to charge in addition to his salary the monthly sutn of SI,200 granted to Mr. N. H. Smith for his establishment and in the anticipation of our concurrence stating his intention of changing that amount in his accounts with the Supreme Government for the date on which Mr. Smith ceased to draw it. 8. We cannot entirely approve of Mr. Brace's having thus anticipated a decision upon his application, but being of opinion that the Resident at Bushire possess a just claim to an allowance which may be adequate to the permanent and contingent expenses incident to the nature and duties of his situation, we shall take advantage of the present change of arrange ment with regard to that Residency this subject to your attention. 9. The political grounds on which the expediency of continuing the Residency is founded equally suggest the propriety enabling the Resident to maintain the respectability of his situa tion in the eyes of the people of Persia which together with the duties now to be assigned to him appears to us to require a scale of expense for which the limited income of the Commer cial Resident amounting to not more than 600 rupees per mensem is not in our judgment adequate to provide, and we are further of opinion that consistently with the general principle of the Company's service and with the reasonable expectations of those in this distant country hope to acquire in that service the means of a future independency and especially in a situation subject to so many privation, discomforts and disadvantages as that of Bushire, the Resident ehould have the means of accumulating a portion of his allowances. We have the less hesita tion in proposing this improvement in the situation of the Resident because the utmost extent of allowances which it may be judged proper to grant to him will still have a considerable saving to the public in consequence of the cessation of the allowances enjoyed by Mr. Smith. We do not however consider ourselves competent to judge of the precise amount which should be granted to the Resident in addition to the salary for the expenses of a proper establish ment and other charges incident to this situation, and we therefore beg leave to refer this point to the suggestion of your superior knowledge of these local circumstances on which it may be considered to depend, referring if you should deem it necessary the amount which you propose on the grounds above stated to your confirmation.Part IV—Chap. XXIV. 84 It is superfluous to add that under the charge of arrangement now proposed the charges of the Residency of Bushire with the exception of such as may be incurred on account of the Embassy in Persia will revert to the debit of your Presidency. In laying the accompanying extracts from the Hon'ble Bombay Government Commands to me under date the 2nd July last before the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in'Conncil, I shall presume to state for His Lordship's liberal consideration the long period which I have been at the Residency (upwards of 12 years), the major part of which I have in general been in charge of this station and have given satisfaction to those under whom I have had the honour of being employed, particularly Brigadier-General Malcolm in the Mission he has filled in the quarter and who recommended me to the favourable notice of His Lordship in the address under date 80th June 1810 from Sultania for a remuneration for the service I had rendered this mission. His Excellency Sir Gore Ousley has also mentioned my services in favourable terms to His Lordship; under these circumstances I have to hope my temerity will not be thought extravagant or unreasonable in requesting to be allowed in addition to my present salary to charge from the period that Mr. Smith may have ceased to- draw them, that allowanceB granted by His Lordship for this Residency of Rupees sicca 1,200 per month in lieu of all charges as this amount is not more than sufficient to cover the expenses of the establishment on the most reduced scale, and shall therefore from that period presume to charge this amount in my accounts with the Supreme Government under the full hope of its meeting the liberal notice and sanction of His Lordship in Council. We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's despatch under date the 3rd of April last as also that from Chief Secretary under the same date both on the subject of the Bushire Residency. 2. The motives which have weighed with Your Lordship in Council for maintaining the Residency of Bushire on a more respectable footing are so fully detailed on that despatch that it only remains with this Government to give effect to Your Lordship's instructions. 3. We cannot, however refrain from offering our respectful concurrence in the policy and expediency particularly under the recent conclusion of the definitive Treaty with the King of Persia, combined with the prospects of negotiating a commercial engagement with that State, of establishing the representative of the Honorable the East India Company in the Persian Dominions, upon a basis of equal efficiency and respectability with the several Political Resi dencies in India. 4. Independently, however, of the Hon'ble Company's interests in Persia, the control of the Resident at Bushire may extend over the Port at Muscat, at which place we are authorized by the Hon'ble Court to appoint a resident with a personal salary of Rupees (1.500) one thousand five hundred per mensem; but have been deterred from nominating a successor to the late Captain Seton in consequence of the insalubrity of the climate, a more immediate control, however, over that State and over the conduct of the Hon'ble Company's Native Agent at Muscat cannot fail of guarding against the eventual supersession of our influence and it preventing the difficulties of re -establishing that influence on the occurrence of any political emergency of an adverse nature, against which we cannot be considered to be at all times entirely secured. 5. The just and liberal principles by which we have been instructed to be guided in fixing a permanent scale of allowances for the Residency of Bushire we observe to be in accordance with those prescribed in the orders from the Supreme Government as .conveyed in their despatch from the Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council dated the 6th of April 1798, founded upon the suggestions of the late Marquis Cornwallis as offered in His Lordship's Minute dated the Slst January 1788 for fixing the salaries of the Hon'ble Company's servants; they were the result of the matured reflections of that respected nobleman : their justness was recognized by His Lordship's successor the Marquis Wellesley and has been again presciibed for our guidance in Your Lordship's instructions now before us. In this quoting the sentiments of authorities so distinguished, we are actuated by a desire of recording a respectful acquiescence in the wisdom and policy of those principles which impose upon public servants, by a fair and just remuneration, the obligations of discharging the duties with fidelity and honor by removing every plea, for deriving emoluments of an objectionable nature, the effects of which tend to lower the dignity of the Government, the character of their servants and to prove prejudicial to the best interest of the Hon'ble Company. 6. By these impressions we have been actuated in determining on the allowances, for the Residency of Bushire and as the most applicable precedent have taken for our guidance the Poll. Dept.

It may be proper on this occasion to compare this permanent Establishment for the maintenance of a Resident to superintend the affairs of the Company in the Gulph of Persia and at Muscat with what Mr. Smith enjoyed and what is fised for the latter by the orders of the Hon'ble Court of which the following is the result:— Es.

It is particularly necessary that we should express our sentiment regarding that arrangement, because it originates in a proposition of our own, and is professedly founded on principles which we have laid down. 3. Having transferred the authority over the Residency at Bushire to your Government, we consider the footing upon which that Residency shall be placed to be one of those points of internal arrangement which are usually and properly left to the decision and responsibility of your Hon'ble Board. But as you have supposed the allowances and establishment which you have proposed for the Residency, and Ihe appointment of a Civil servant to that office, to be in exact conformity to the principles suggested in our letter of the 3rd April, it is incumbent upon us to point out the error of this supposition. 4. W T e have to observe, in the first place, that it was by no means in our contemplation to suggest, that the Residency of Bushire should be established upon a basis of equal efficiency and respectability with the several political Residencies in India. We do not conceive that under the system of representation on the part of His Majesty's Government which now exists in Persia, there is any analogy between the Residency of the subordinate and provincial town of Bushire and the Residency at a Foreign Court such as that of Bagdad, which you have assumed as the basis of the present arrangement. At the latter, the Residency is regularly l 1Part IV—3hap. XXIV. 86 r accredited as the Representative of the British Government, and exercises his functions in direct communication with the supreme local Government of the country. At Bushire, the Resident although vested with the charge of some political duties and therefore in as far those duties are concerned he may be considered to represent the Government to which he belongs, yet he cannot be deemed to hold in his own person that full and regular representation which is the characteristic of the office of Resident at Bagdad and at the Foreign Courts of India. His situation approximates rather to that of a Consul with the superadded authority of occasionally exercising some political duties connected either with our interests and concerns in Persia or those at Muscat and in the Gulph. • m • 5. Adverting therefore to the subordinate character of the Residency at Bushire, and to the very limited duties attached to it compared with those which are attached to the Residencies at Foreign Courts, we were far from extending to suggest either the selection of an officer for that situation of a superior to that of the actual incumbent, or the grant of allowances so considerable as those which you propose to assign to the Resident. 6. The observations contained in our letter of the 3rd of April had especial reference to the continuance of Lieutenant Bruce in the discharge of the duties of Resident at Bushire because we neither contemplate such an elevation of the character and functions of that Residency as would require the selection of an officer from the higher rank of the service, nor had any reason to consider Lieutenant Bruce unqualitied for duties even of a much superior stamp to those which under present circumstances appeared to us to belong to the office. On the contrary., so long as Lieutenant Bruce has been subject to the direct authority of this Government, he has manifested not only the qualities of distinguished zeal, integrity and assiduity, but a considerable degree of ability and address during those periods of time in . which the duties of the Residency have devolved upon him in the absence of the Resident and occasionally under circumstances of much difficulty, delicacy and responsibility. He possesses moreover the peculiar advantages of long local experience and of intimate acquaintance with v the language, habits and temper of the people among whom he has for so many years resided and by whom we understand he is greatly esteemed and respected. 7. We contemplated as a peculiar advantage of Mr. Bruce's confirmation in the office, that it conceded with those maxims of economy which we are anxious to observe on all occasions since the appointment of an officer of the rank of a Civil Servant would require that, according to the principles suggested in our letter, a scale of allowances should be fixed, far superior to that which under the operation of the same principles would otherwise be necessary. You will have observed indeed that even Lieutenant Bruce's solicitation extended no further than to an addition of 1,200 rapees per mensem for establishment and table expenses, making with the salary of Resident on its original footing, the monthly sum of 1,600 rupees, whereas the allowances proposed on the plan of appointing a Civil Servant to the Residency of Bushire amounts to 3,450 rupees. 8. For the reasons already mentioned we further deem it our duty to express some observ ations on the comparative statement contained in the 8th paragraph of your despatch which exhibits a difference in favour of 1,720 rupees per mensem. 9. We are disposed to think that the establishment both of Bushire and Muscat, the former on the scale of the allowances granted to Mr. Smith, and the latter on that which was authorized by the Hon^ble Court of Directors, cannot be considered to be the charges superseded by the proposed arrangement. In point of fact neither of those charges has existed for a long period of time, and by the arrangement last formed by the authority of this Government the duties of the Residency at Muscat were transferred to the Residency at Bushire without any intention of reverting the former. The true point of comparison therefore appear to us to be, between the scale of allowances granted to Mr. Smith and that which you propose to assign to the Civil Servant who may be appointed Resident at Bushire, and it will be found on this comparison that the latter exceeds the former in the sUm of 250 rupees per mensem— Rs.

We may be permitted to refer to the view which we took of this branch of the subject in order to shew that we could not have contemplated an application of our priuciples so extensive as that which you have ascribed to them. We observe that the utmost extent of the allowances which it might be judged proposed to grant to the Resident, would still leave a considerable saving to the public in consequence of the cessation of the allowances enjoyed by Mr. Smith. This observation would have been totally groundless if we had contemplated an arrangement for the Residency of Bushire such as you have proposed. But as we suppose the extension of the allowances beyond what Mr. Bruce himself solicited, to be scarcely a subject of deliberation that observation was consistent with the principles by which we desired that the allowances of the Resident should be regulated ; since according to that view of the case the smallest amount of saving would be 900 rupees per mensem.r 87 Part IV— Chap.

On referring to the proceedings which had taken place connected with those arrange ments, Mr. Brown delivered in a minute explaining the grounds on wliich the conduct of the late Government had been regulated in respect to the scale of establishment on which the \bushire Residency was proposed to be placed, and in expressing our regret at the misconception entertained of the intentions of Your Lordship in Council, we have deemed it necessary to transmit a copy of Mr. Brown's minute, and to intimate to Your Lordship, that disposed as we are, to assume the entire responsibility of regulating the internal arrangement of that or of any other Residency that may be immediately dependent on this Government with the view of relieving Your Lordship from the consideration of details which are more immediately connected with'this Presidency, we feel at the same time the indispensable necessity of observing the strictest economy in the public expenditure on all occasions, but particularly during the present exigency. 8. Under the influence of this conviction, combined with a consideration of the expediency of affordino- to the British Resident at Abushire the means of maintaining the respectability of his representative character, as so essential to the promotion of the credit and interests of the Hon'ble Company in the dominions of the King of Persia, we conceive the sum of eighteen hundred rupees a month was the lowest that cuuld be allotted for salary and establishment and every other charge with the exception of presents, which will be confined within the narrowest scale and not toexceed the amount to which the Resident has hitherto been limited ; under this 'arrangement it will appear that the actual receipt of the Resident after providing for the expenses oi the establishment, necessary to the due execution of the duties of this station would not exceed the sum of (1,690) one thousand six hundred and ninety rupees per month. 4. In reference to the 6th and 17th paragraphs of Your Lordship's despatch we have the honour to inform you that Mr. Flower of the A, will appear by the following statement- Civil Service on this establishment having been appointed to the situation on the 10th ot July and B ushiee . R s . subsequently consenting to proceed on the reduced Linguist 30 a ]i owance 0 f Rs. (1,800) one thousand and eight Broker . . . • • , * .

XXIV. 88 5. In reference to the remarks eontaiced in the 9th and subsequent paragraphs of Your Lordship's despatch, we be^ leave to observe that 1810, from the correspondence with the Supreme Govern- lOth January. ment under the dates mentioned in the margin I3th „ it will appear that the scale of allowances on 23rd February. which the Residencies of Abushire and of Muscat 28th ^ Larcl1 * have been placed have not yet been accurately detailed. 6. From the documents to which we have had reference, it will be found that General Malcolm in his letter of the 7th of January 1810 recommended the abolition of the Establish ment at Muscat as a separate Residency, and that the Resident at Abushire should be vested with general powers as the Agent of Government to maintain the intercourse with the Imaum of Muscat and all the petty Arab Chiefs with the Gulph and suggested a suitable establishment in assistants, etc., calculating upon a saving being effected by that arrangement on a comparison with the expense of maintaining a separate Residency at Muscat. 7. The Right Hon'ble the Governor-General then at Fort Saint George approved of the arrangement proposed by the General 'as a permanent system for the conduct of political affairs in the Gulph founded on a conviction of its expediency ' and. called upon this Government for its opinion in regard to the additional allowance which it might be expedient and practicable to grant to Mr. Smith on the principle of confining the whole of the increase of expense attending the proposed arrangement within the amount to be saved by the abolition of the distinct office at Muscat. 8. Mr. Smith's salary as Resident at Abushire, as fixed by the Supreme Government instructions of the 11th of December 1806 was Rs. (1,500) one thousand five hundred and (1,200) one thousand two hundred a month in lieu of all the charges. The Acting Accountant- General in in his report of the 17th of March 1812 suggested the additional Establishment of the united Repidcncies at Abushire and Muscat as far as related to Mr. Smith's personal remu neration alune 10 lis. (1,300) one thousand three hundred per mensem. 9. This Government deemed the proposed additional allowance to be made to Mr. Smith as too considerable, and fixed the sum of Rs. (500) five hundred instead of the (1,300) one thousand three hundred above mentioned making together the sum of (2.000) two thousand rupees per month; this arrangement was referred to Y our Lordship then at Fort Saint George in a letter, dated the 20th of March 1810, but no reply was made to that, 10. Mr. Smith in consequence of what had been arranged by this Government drew up to the date of his resignation of that appointment on the 29th of March 1H11 as his personal allowances Rs. (3,200) three thousand two hundred per month instead of Rs. (2,700) two thousand seven hundred as mentioned in the 9th paragraph of the despatch now under reply. 11. The permanent system therefore for the maintenance of a political control in the Gulph was then placed on the following scale:— lis. The Kesident's salary ...••••• 2,000 For all other charges ......»• 1,200 Two Political Assistants . . . . • • • .850 Commercial Assistant . _ • • • • • • 400 Commercial Establishment at the United Station . . . 460-2-08 By the plan proposfd bj the Government of this Presidency the permanent system for the maintenance of our control in the Gulph was fixed at . . . . • ... 3,450 Difference ....••••• 1»400 and on comparing it with Mr. Smith's personal receipt the result will be as follows Rs. Mr. Smith's salary .... 2,000 , „ Allowances for other charges . . . 1,200 Mr, Smith's receipts .... 3,200 0 Linguist and Broker .... 100 — 3,200 Mr Flower i.too Proposed to be granted to the Resident . 2,950 1 ' 510 Difference in favour of the proposed plan 250 and if we assume as a standard of comparison the sum at which the personal receipts of the Resident including the Linguist and Broker's salaries are now to be fixed, the saving will be Rs. (1,510) one thousand five hundred and ten which will admit of a salary of Rs. (500) five hundred for an assistant and yet realized a saving of Rs. (1,010) one thousand and ten per Mr. Flower's allowances • . mensem, being rupees one hundred and ten more Broker at Muscat *. *. ioo than that contemplated by Your Lordship, whilst • the whole of the expense of maintaining a political 2,400 control in the Gulph will aggregate Rs. (2,400) two thousand four hundred per mensem.89 Part IV—Chap. ^XIV. 12. It is only necessary further to remarlv that from the date of the resolution giving effect to the suggestions conveyed in the despatch from \out Lordship in Council, dated tlie ord of April, being 0 the 10th of July, the expense of the Residency at Abushire under the present arrangement will be debited to this Presidency.

I am directed to inform you that the Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council has been pleased to fix the future establishment for the Residency at Bushire at Rs.

This arrangement is to have effect from the 4th of July, from which date the expenses of the Residency at Bushire and ail the correspondence are to be charged to and carried on with this Government as formerly, the charges prior to that date being debited to the Supreme Government.Part V. British policy in regard to Maskat and Maritime Arab Tribes—Vigorous measures taken for the suppression of piracies and for security of peace in the Gulf, 1818-1823.Part V— Chap. XXV. 93 CHAPTER XXV. EXPEDITION PROPOSED AGAINST THE PIRATICAL STRONGHOLDS IN THE PERSIAN GtLF. CAPTAIN SADLEIR S MISSION TO IBRAHIM PASHA OF EGYPT, THE LINE OF POLICY LAID DOWN, 1819. 199 The piratical enterprises of the Joasmi tribes and other Arab tribes in the Gulf had become so extensive and attended by so many atrocities on peaceful traders, that the Government of India at last determined that ^ n nn a much larger and comprehensive scale than ever done beloic, should be undertaken for the destruction of the maritime force of these piratical tribes on the Gulf and that a new policy of bringing the tribes undei British +™l ^hrnild be inaugurated. A. squadron of ships was accordingly placed und^th^o^ers of CapSl^Collier ami a military force of about 8 ,000 men un er the command of Major-General Sir William Grant Keir to proceed to the Gulf iu order to carry out the object of extirpating piracies and taking the necessary measures for preventing their recurrence. 200 An Important part of the scheme was that the British forces should co-operate with the forces of Ibrahim Co-operation of Ibrahim Pasha sought. Pasha of Egypt, who had been carrying on 4- Wolnbis and had captured Deriah. It was supposed that Tlirahfm^aslmh^^oonquered the tnbes on the coast of El Hasa would Ibrahim ^ a ^ ia fn oonouer the tribes on the Pirate Coast. With welcome 11 ° .P neces8ar y arrangements for this purpose Captain G. F. SadTeTr was deputed with despatches of the Governor -General and the Governor of Bombav (Sir E. Nepean) to Ibrahim Pasha. 201 It was even contemplated to place Bas-ul-Khima and other places , p. f p nnti 4- under the Turkish Government when conquered, as appeals Captain Sadleir, dated 13th April 1819. 'Tf as most probably will be the case, His Excellency IbraMm Pasha should be desirous 'If, as most proDaD^ Government, he will of course communicate freely of availing himself of tne aid of the Bntisn uov authorized to assure His With r 0 \t t t nS 8 o:n ma aLr V he uSit of the'losoon as ma y be favourable for Excellency that as soon a ^ ^ prepared to send an adequate naval and embarking operations fromV , for the purpose of co-operating with His Excellency in military force to the .

Captain Sadleir visited the Imam it Maskat to sound him in the matter. But Seyyid Said was found to be at MasKat to sou opposed to have anything to do with Captain Sadleir s letter, dated 15th May ibw. Ibrallim p as ha, he evidently apprehended that the Egvptian occupation of the Pirate Coast would be menace to his own independence His Highness said that he had occasion to write to Ibrahim Pasha respecting Bahrein; but that as he had not received an answer, he nrpinmed that it was as necessary in all cases to await a reply from a reference to Mahomed All Pasha, as Ibrahim Pasha could not act in those matters without orders • that the delay would certainly exceed the period fixed for the sailino- of the expedition. The Imam further made it clear that be could not alloio^his troops to associate on shore in concert with the Turkish army. e assured Captain Sadleir that be would accompany the expedition ^d embark 3 000 troops to act in conjunction with the British force, but on condition that they should not be called upon to act in the interior in conjunction vrithJTurks,94. Part V—Chap. XXV. 203. It was believed that the Arab Sheikhs of the ports of the Persian „ . Coast, Lingah, Mogu, Oharrak and Cherro, Persian eutceptiOtlmet. i j v • t i. j • j.i ^ • . had been implicated in the recent piracies. The expedition was directed therefore also against these piratical strongholds, as they were supposed to be. Dr. Jukes was sent ahead to the Gulf with despatches from the Governor of Bombay to the Prince of Pars, and the Governor of Bushire explaining the objects of the Mission. To the Prince of Pars it was pointed out that it was by no means the design of the British Government in India to adopt any course of the proceeding inconsistent with the preservation of the friendly relations existing between England and Persia, and the Governor invited the Prince to take part in the operations by land against the Persian ports, whereby the Persian authorities might be re-established on a footing which would enable them to curb the licentious disposition of the inhabitants. 204. The Bombay Government issued very careful instructions to Sir Instructions to Sir William Grant Kiev. William Grant Keir on the various points Volume 52—i9 of 1820-1821, page i. connected with the expedition, which he was to command, in their letter, dated 27th October 1819, which may be read:— 4. You will be pleased to understand that the Joassmee tribe who have been most actively engaged in the atrocitieB which have called for the opemtions now about to be undertaken, occupy the port of Rus-ul-Khima on the western shore of the Gulph of Persia, from whenoe the greatest part of the piratical cruisers have been equipped, and where they may probably be now assembled. 6. For some years past until within the last, they appear to have been under the influence of the Wahabee sect, but since the fall of Deriah (the seat of Government) and the rest of the territories of that State to the Turkish troops nnder tlie command of Ibrahim Pacha, they have been subjected to no control, and have continued their depredations without regard to the nation to which the vessels or craft might belong, which they have felt themselves compe tent to subdue. 6. Abdoolla-bin Saood, the late chieftain of the Wahabees, who was made a prisoner at Deriah, was, it appears, sent to Constantinople, and has since been put to death. 7. It would be difficult to recapitulate the means and desariptions of the vessels and craft which have fallen into the hands of the pirates; but among them the Honourable Com pany's Pattamar, the Deria Dowlat and another belonging to this placa with a detachment of the Honourable Company's Native troops are to be included, the crews of which, as well as the troops on board the latter, were inhumanly murdered. 8. The inhabitants of Ras-ul-Khima appear to the Governor in Council to be deserving the moit exemplary punishment&gt; and it would therefore be desirable, should circumstances be favourable for effecting the objects in view, that your operations should, in the first instance, be directed against them ; but though the property they have found on board the trading vessels they have captured is of great extent, it is to be feared that it has already been disposed of at Bahrein and other places, and that none of it will be likely to be recoverable. 9. The pain of Ras-ul-Khima which accompanies this, though perhaps not very accurately described, will afford a tolerably correct idea of its situation and defences; and, considering the extent of the force which has been placed at your disposal, it is to be hoped that at no distant period, after the commencement of your operations, it will fall into your hands, the first object of your attention should be directed to the destruction of the 'piratical vessels and craft of every description with every article of naval or military store that may he found there, and you will not fail to hear in mind that excepting in cases of particular emergency neither the troops or the crews of the ships of tear or ihe Honourable Company's cruisers are meant to he emploi/ed at any distance from thence, or from any other place, to which your operations may he directed, against any military forces of the piratical States, unless their heing s* employed should he found essentially requisite for the demolition of the piratical vessels and craft which may he in their ports % 10. The despatch of His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General to Ibrahim Pacha and the instructions which have been given to Captain Sadlier to whom the delivery of that despatch has been confided, will put you in possession of the measures proposed to be concerted with His Excellency, for placing the port of Rasselkhima under the authority of the Turkish Government; and it is to be regretted that, by the unexpected departure of His Excellency from that part of the coast before the arrival of Captain Sadlier, the arrangements consequent to such a measure could not be concluded. 11. The letters which have been received from that officer which are inclosed for your information will apprize you that he has followed His Excellency into the interior, and until some reply shall have been received from him to the overture thus made, it will be necessary the town of Ras-ul-Khima should be occupied by such a portion of the force under your orders as may be necessary for its security,Part V—Chap. XXV. 95 12. To prevent any delay in tbe communication of the decision of His Excellency Ibrahim Panha that can be avoided, Captain Sadlier has been directed, in the event of his being enabled to do so, to join you on your arrival in the Gulph and deliver to you any despatches he may have received from His Excellency to the address of this Government, and also to communicate to you such information of His Excellency's designs as he may have obtained for the regulation of your conduct. 18, You will perceive that, under the views of the Supreme Government, the possession of any other places than Ras-ul-Khima by the Turkish force, has not been contempluted, nor are you, without further instructions, to facilitate tbe placing any other of the piratical ports under His Excellenoy^s authority. 14. Until some decision be foimed respecting the disposal of Ras -ul-Khima, it would not appear advisable to demolish the town, nor even its defences, beyond what may be the effect of your operations to reduce it, 15. In the communications which passed between Captain Sadlier and the Imam of Muscat you will perceive that His Highness expressed some degree of reluctance in co-operating toith the Turkish force in the reduction of Rasselkhima ; but whatever may be the wishes of the Turkish Government with respect to the ultimate possession of that place, or the motives by which tbe Imam was disposed to withhold bis co-operation with those troops, there seems no probability that any portion of them will be brought into contact with those of His Highness, which consequently will remove all the objections to a hearty co-operation with you, which his inclination would, the Governor in Council is disposed to believe, other wise most readily leads him to undertake. 16. Besides the principal port of Rassul-Khima, there are several ports contiguous to it from Rumysto Abbo Heyle as laid down in the chart, now transmitted t ) you, tbe maritime force of which, as appertaining to the same piratical state, or by acting in concert with it, may be considered equally objects for consideration. If therefore after securing the possession of Ras-ul-Khima you shall learn that any piratical vessels are at eitiier of those places, you will proceed to each of them respectively, and exert your best endeavours to burn or other wise destroy them, 17. It has not been distinctly ascert lined whether either of th^se places have recently submitted to the authority of Ibrahim Pacha, but should any of thern at tbe time of your arrival be in possession of the Turkish troops, any operations agdnst them should of courgs be avoided, unless any of tbe piratical vessels may have taken shelter within theui and are without the reach of such troops. 18. In addition to the ports above described on the Arabian Coast, it is understood that the inhabitants of the port of Lingua and other places on the Persian shore have in a certain degree identified themselves with the Joassmee and have committed depredations on the trade, 19. The instructions to Mr. Jukes, who, as you are already apprized, has proceeded to the Gulph, and the letters with which he has beeu charged, copies of which accompany this, will explain to you the proceedings which have been adopted in respect to those places, and though from the date they bear no reply can yet be expected from the Prince of Sherans to the invitation transmitted to His Highness, it is hoped that the explanations afforded to him of the real objects of our solicitude, even should His Highness hesitate in co-operating with the force under your commands in their destruction, will obviate any inclination he might otherwise feel to oppose your operations against the piratical force that may be found within them. 20. The reply of His Highness to the letter addressed to him on this subject will probably reach you before you shall be prepared to proceed to the Persian shore, and you will in a certain degree be regulated by it in yoor intended o\)Q\-&amp;i\on9, butin any case yon must not hesitate in proceeding to the destruction of the pirates on that side of the Gulph wherever you may ascertain them to exist, taking care to proceed in all such eases with the utmost practicable respect towards the undisputed rights of His Persian Majesty, the ally of our august Sovereign, and to cause it to be fully explained to such of the officers of the Persian Government with whom, in the course of events, you may be brought in communication that the British Government has no other object than to protect the commercial intercourse toith the coast of Persia and other ports of the Gulph, and to free it from the obstructions and losses to which it has too long been exposed from tbe predatory acts of the piratical tribes, without the slightest intention of occupying any part of the territory, or to molest or annoy any one of His Persian Majesty's loyal subjects, who in consideration of the friendly relations existing between the two countries, it is our earnest desire to cherish and protect. 21. The ports to which the pirates resort in addition to Lingua are specified in the margin, 22. You will receive herewith a triplicate of a letter from tbe President to the Prince of Sherans, which it is left to you to forward, or to make such other use of, as circumstances may reader expedient. A translation of that letter forms an enclosure to the instructions to Mr, Jukes and a Persian copy is enclosed, the possession of which will enable you to make such communication to the local authorities as may preclude the possibility of any mi*- conetructions of tbe views entertained by the British Government in the course of your proceedings against tbe piratical force in question.96 Part V—Chap. XXV. 23. The Resident at Bagdad has been instructed to communicate to that Government the objects contemplated by the present expedition, so that no interference wUh your operations may be expected from His Highness, the Turkish possessions under that Pachalic being too remote from the scene of action to be likely to be brought into contact \ntli you. 24-. You will perceive by the instructions to Mr. Jukes and the letter therein referred to, the desire expressed to the Imam of Muscat of His Highness's co-operation in effecting the reduction of the piratical force, and the Governor in Council does not entertain a doubt that His Highness will most cordially afford his aid, not only by means of the naval and military force at his disposal, but in the supply of the armament with such provisions and refreshments as may be necessary to facilitate your operations. 25. By the communication made to this Government by the Hon'ble Company s broker at Muscat, you will perceive that His Highness has recently been engaged m negotiation with the people of Rassulkhima, with a view of endeavouring to extinguish the power ot the present chieftain and of restoring Sooltan-bin Saggar, the legitimate chieftain, to his authority ; but that deserted by this chieftain on his arrival off that place, and, with toe exception of Rahmat-bin-Jauber, all the petty chieftains who had promised to aid him in his operations in the event of a failure in his negotiation he had been obliged to return to Muscat. 26. 'Whatever may have been the claims of Sooltan-bin Saggar, it is by no means desirable, after such conduct, that his cause should be espoused by the British Government, and in any arrangements which may appear to you to be necessary, in reference to the temporary occupation of Rassulkhima previourly to your having the determination of His Excellency Ibrahim Pacha or receiving further instructions from hence, care should be taken to avoid bis being placed in authority. 27. With respect to Rahmat-hin Jauber, formerly the chieftain of Khore Husson, it would appear from the late communications received from the Gulph that he has identified himself with the Imam, and will in all probability be ready to aid your operations, and, should that disposition be expressed, it will be desirable you should avail yourself of his services, under the impression, that, whatever may have been his predatory habit formerly, he is disposed to unite in destroying the power of the Joassmees, and those associated with them, who have been so actively employed in disturbing the tranquillity of the Gulph. 28. It is probable that Rahmat-bin Jauber will join you in company with the Imam, but whether he has any force of his own, or is employed in the Imam s service, appears to be somewhat doubtful. 29. Although it might be convenient with a view to the intended operations that the armament should call at Muscat previously to its entering the Gulph, for the purpose of being joined by such part of the force of the Imam as may be assigned to the purposes of the expedition, yet from the unhealthiness of the place and in the difficulty in obtaining some of the necessary supplies, particularly water, but more especially with the view of occupying a more convenient position for pursuing your future operations, it would appear to be far preferable that you should proceed at once to the islands of Kishmee, which Island ia represented to be capable not only of affording a safe anchorage, but of furnishing a certain portion of water and other refreshments which cannot so readily be obtained at Muscat, and no doubt can be entertained of permission being granted for your occupying any part of that island that may be necessary for the temporary accommodation of the armament, 30. You will, therefore, after leaving this place proceed direct to Kishm, where you will probably find Captain Theriff of the Commissariat Department, who has been employed in collecting such supplies, and after obtaining what may be required for the refreshments of the troops and such information as you may conceive to be necessary regarding the proceed ings of the piratical force, you will lose no time in carrying your instructions into execution. 31. It may probably happen that previously to your arrival in the Gulph, the chieftain of Rassulkhima under the dread of the effect of your intended operations may have ordered their maritime force to leave that place and proceed to sea, or to take some more secure position this, and other local circumstances which may have occurred since the last advices were received, may render it necessary that you should change the proposed plan of operations, and understanding that their destruction is the primary object of consideration, much will be left to your discretion. 32. The Governor in Council has so much reliance in your zeal and ability, that whatever opinions he may have given as applicable to the immediate attack of Rassulkhima, he is willing to leave the course of proceeding entirely in your hands under a full persuasion that it will be regulated under the exercise of a sound judgment, and that any difficulties which may present themselves that can be effected by skill and gallantry will be surmounted. 33. The objection contemplated is of no slight importance, and it is to be hoped that by your exertions the commerce of this part of India will be freed from the further ravages of those barbarians, who under circumstances that could not be prevented, have so long continued to practise them with so much success. 34). Lieutenants Searight and Brucks have been appointed agents for the transport service and have been directed to place themselves under the orders of Captain Collier, who will be charged with the conduct of the maritime part of the expedition, and the Governor in Council relies with the fullest confidence that all your proceedings will be conducted withPart V- Chap. XXV. 97 that cordiality and good humour which are so esential to the public iutereits and the success of your operations. 35. The Governor in Council has authorized some articles to be supplied to you to be disposed of as presents to the Imam or such other persons, to whom it may be proper to pay these marks of attention, and leaves their distribution entirely to your discretion. The rank and station of His Highness will, he is persuaded, not to be lost sight of by you and that you will endeavour to cultivate the good opinion and confidence of His Highness, so essential in the present moment to the common interests. 8^. As Government must be anxious to learn the actual state of the enemy's force in the different piratical ports and the prospect you have of destroying it, it will be very desirable that you should allow no opportunity to escape you of giving him the fullest information you may be able to collect on these subjects, and of the course you may mean to pursue under the circumstances that may present themselves after your arrival at your rendezvous, the better to enable him to decide on the nature of the further instructions which may hereafter be necessary to be transmitted to you for your guidance in the execution of the service confided to you. 37. Mr. Jukes has been directed to furnish you with a copy of his proceedings and to consider himself under your orders on your arrival in the Gulph. 205. In a letter, dated 27th November 1819, to the address of Major- Genoral Keir, Bombay Government modified the instructions contained in the letter of the 27 th October so as to vest him with a discretionary authority to make over Ras-ul-Khima, after its capture, to Sultan-bin-Saggar, if he should find that the Chief had sufficient weight with the tribe to render it probable that he would be able to retain it. But should Sultan-bin-Saggar be found not to have that degree of influence, the Government desired that the place should be transferred to any person whom the tribe may elect as their Chief, provided he was unconnected with the Wahabis and unlikely to resume the piratical habits which had led to the British interference. 206. The Bombay Government now presided over by Sir Monstuart Elphinstone addressed the following important despatch to the Government of Marquis of Hastings at Port William, dated 15th December 1819, indicating the line of policy which they proposed should be followed in Persian Gulf matters :— We have postponed a reply to Your Lordship's despatch of the 28th of August last, on the subiect of the intended expedition to the Gulf of Persia under an expectation that the information subsequently transmitted to Your Lordship would have led to our being furnished with ppecific instructions in respect to the line of policy which it might be deemed expedient to pursue for the suppression of piracy in that quarter, a review however of the documents which hive been furnished to Your Lordship affording us reason to conclude that it may be considered to be our duty to submit a specific plan in respect to the extent of our interposition for the attainment of that object, we proceed under that impression to offer what appears to us to be an arrangement the best adapted to* the attainment of our views, without pledging, in any serious responsibility, the guarantee of the British Government to its observance. 2. Referring in the first instance to the propositions contained in the despatch from the late Government of the 21st of July we are of opinion that wt should abstain from all interference in the pretensions which are advanced to the occupation of Bahrein, under a distinct explanation to the Sheikh of that island, that so long as he restrains his tribe from the prosecution of acts of aggression on the high seas, and carries on those commercial pursuits in which they would appear to have been formerly engaged, the ports of India shall be open to his vessels, and that he may rely in experiencing from the British Govern ment every degree of encouragement and of friendly intercourse, but that, on the contrary, if any indications of a piratical spirit should manifest themselves, we shall be compelled to adopt those measures of coercion which we are prosecuting against the Joassmese. An engagement similar to that negotiated by Mr. Bruce in the year 1816 would probably tend to convince the Uttoobi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions. 3. The transference then of the island of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat being abandonedy the proposition with which it was coupled, of His Highness's subsidizing a British force, should be relinquished, as tinder any circumstances impolitic and objectionable. 4. With respect to the Joassmese, the reduction of the Port of Rassul-Jchima and » ■ * * ,7 - . ^ those contiguous to it from Kuiny to Abbo Heyle, Sw'w^OrAt tU&lt;0 -nd the anaihilition of tbat influence under which it would appear to have engaged, in so extensive a degree in piratical pursuits, will operate no doubt as an immediate check upon the habits of the tribe. Its subsequent disposal, however, is an important object of consideration, 5. Your Lordship will observe from our Chief Secretary's letter, dated the 4th of this month, that we have moiified that part of the instructions to Major-General Sir William98 Part V- Chap. XXV. Grant Keir, which imposed a positive prohibition asainst the restoration of Sultan-bin-Sugg-ar to Ms hereditary possessions ; leaving it optional with his tribe either to reinvest him in authority, or to elect another Chief as their ruler—our conquest of that port will enable us to demand conditions from the Chief under whose control it may be placed, which may restrain and reform the habits of the tribe. 6. Every vessel of a warlike character will no doubt be destroyed by the armament, and only those to be employed in commerce should in future he allowed to navigate from that port, and the port be dismantleil. For the purpose of enforcing these conditions we should insist on a Native Agent residing at Rassul-khima to guard against any boats quitting the port offensively armed—our cruizers should be allowed tree ingress into the port, and by stationing one or more armed Pattawars at its entrance, or in a secure harbour in its vicinity, with liberty to visit Rassul-khima, whenever we might deem it expedient, a salutary check would probably be imposed upon their future conduct. The ports of India should also be open to the Joassmes#, our intercourse with which would not fail of civilizing the habits, and gradually reviving in tham a spirit for commercial pursuits. 7. Should our anticipation in these respects not be realized, the project of placing th# principality of Seer under the control and Government of the Imam of Muscat mi^ht be resorted to. The maritime resources which His Highness commands, if well directed, might, supported by our co-operation, effectually control every port in the province of Oman. 8. In regard to the Imam of Mutcat, we should hope that little difficulty would be expeiienced in convincing him of the policy of consolidating and strengthening the posses sions and resources which he commands, instead of weakening them by an extension of his territories. We might derive very material aid from the co-operation of His Highnesses vessels and boats, in the future protection of the Gulph, and if for the purpose of rendering . , c „ them more efficient. His Highness should still be de-ous o£ the assistance .of .„ m o Europeaa gunners, or even ot a Marine officer, to exercise a general control in improving the efficiency of his marine, it would tend, in our opinion, to render the Imam's vessels fully competent to aid us in securing the future tranquillity of the navigation of the Gulph, acting in conjunction with our own cruizera. 9. The interest of Persia would as it appears to us be materially promoted, by our interposition in restoring' the Gulph its former state of security. The petty States on the Persian side which were tributary to her, prior to the ascendancy of the Wahabees, might be restored to her allegiance, inclusive of such islands, the Chiefs of which may be disposed to acknowledge the supremacy of the Persian Government, either through our aid or through the influence of her own power, which would not be difficult of accomplishment, probably, if a Persian force were detached for that purpose whilst any part of our armament continued in the Gulph. 10. The snggestion of forming an establishment in the Persian Oulf in a more central situation, which would enable us to exercise a more immediate and commanding control over its navigation, than we can possibly do, either from Bushire, or Bussora, will engage our attention on the receipt of the reply to our Chief Secretary's letter of the 2l8t L&lt; «. Bengal on the 31, t of Octoher. ^ Ottol, « r , Major-General Sir William Grant Keir; anticipate, however, some opposition on the part of the Persian Government to that measure, since it would be difficult we apprehend to satisfy that power that our views were limited to the professed object of our policy, the more especially as the Persian Government has manifested some degree of alarm at our contemplating the occupation of the Island of Bahrein, 11. With the view of allaying these alarms and of enabling the British Envoy at Tehran to afford to the Persian Government an explicit and candid exposition of the objects to which the expedition is exclusively directed, and of the ultimate plan which we contemplate for the permanent suppression of piracy, our President has addressed a letter to Mr. Willock of which the enclosed is a copy, which we trust will produce the effect of conciliating the Government of Persia to the arrangements which we have submitted to your consideration or to any other which Your Lordship may be pleased to prescribe, and in particular to our permanent occupation of Kishm. It would be premature in us to offer any opinion on the prospect of our being capable of maintaining an establishment on that island, without exposing the public to any additional expense, heyond what is at present incurred in the Gulf ; whatever expense, however, may be incurred on the occasion will, we should hope, be more than compensated by the security which the valuable trade to that quarter will derive from the measure, and which will admit of reduction, as our influence becomes consolidated, and the piratical tribes abandon their predatory pursuits. 12. It is our intention to station as large a marine force in the Gulph as we can spare, with some armed boats for the purpose of visiting the different ports, and guarding against any vessels being- equipped of a warlike character. The presence of this force, combined with the salutary effects, which cannot but be produced by |the reduction of Rassul-khima, and the rigid observance of a prohibition, which should in our opinion be imposed on the export of timber, adapted to shipbuilding, to the Gulf of Persia and Arabia, from any of the ports of India, are the measures which appear the best calculated for the gradual suppression of piracy.Part V—Chap. XXV. 99 13. We have directed Major-General Sir William Grant Keir to reduce the force under his command and to return it to the Presidency at as early a period as practicable retaining^ until further orders, a battalion of Native Infantry at Kiebm, or at any other eligible island under a strict injunction not to admit of the troops occupying any position on the main. 14. The presence of this force will in our opinion produce a very salutary impression m overavring any disposition in the Joassmes or any other tribe, atter the reduction of their port, to prosecute piracy, by manifesting to the different petty States that our views are not limited to the mere reduction of Rassul-khima and the destruction of the piratical boats; but extend to the prosecution of arrangements of a more permanent nature. We have the honour to be, etc,, M, ELPHINSTONE, CHARLES COLVILLE, ALEXANDER BELL, G. L. PRENDERGAST. Bombay Castle; The 15th December 1819. 207. The following is the despatch sent to His Majesty's Charg6 d* Affaires at Tehran (Henry Willock) on 15th December 1819, which is referred to it in the despatch to the Marquis of Page 70 of Volume o2-49 of 1820-1821. Hastings (paragraph 11) :— 1. The Rio-bt Hon'ble Sir Evan Nepean communicated to you in his letter, dated the Qfb of October last, the necessity which has impelled the British Government to equip a force for the reduction of the piratical powers in the Gulph of Persia ; aud having entered into a consideration of the measures which it may be expedient to adopt for the purpose of rendering the result of this second armament permanently promotive of the security of its navigation, T have the honour of transmitting to you, as affording the best view of the nature of the arraneements which we contemplate for that purpose, the copy of a despatch from this Government to His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council on the * 3 2 I anticipate the difficulties which you may experience in satisfying the Persian Government that our object is limited exclusively to the suppression of piracy, particularly nnder the reports which have been propagated as alluded to in seme of your despatches to Hit Excellency the Governor-General, that we were desirous of obtaining possession of the Island of Bahrein. * * j - 8. You cannot afford the Persian Government a more satisfactory proof of the ais' inlerestedness of our intentions than by an appeal to the nature and result of the last expedi tion On which occasion the most positive orders were issued for confining its operations to tbp destruction of the piratical craft and on no account to extend tbem to the interior of the country. These instructions having been fulfilled, the armament returned to Bombay, 4 The expectations however which had been formed of the beneficial effect that hp nroduced by that expedition soon proved fallacious j the Joassmee Arabs succeeded in obtaining- other boats and vessels, and renewed their depredations with increased audacity; artoonvnanied by acts of savage cruelty and of murder, committed indiscriminately on vessels and subjects belonging to the British as well as on those of other powers ; even in the Indian seas. 5 The British Government remained passive under these multiplied aggressions during tbr last five years under a hope that they might be checked by the constant presence of a marine force in the Gulf of Persia, and that some attention would be paid to the repeated remonstrances which have been made to the Arab Chiefs who have been the most conspicuous in the prosecution of piracy as well on the Persian as the Arabian side of the Gulf. 6 You must be fully aware (notwithstanding a recent application has been n»de by the Government of Shiraz for the restoration of a Botella captured by His Majesty s Ship Curleuf on the plea of her being the property of a Chieftain subject to Persia) that fie influence of that Government on the various tribes inhabiting the ports on the skoret and islands of t c Gulf of Persia has been completely annihilated since the ascendancy of the Wahabee power, and that it has not commanded the means oj controlling those pirntteal habits whtch have been tncouraged and protected by the Sheikh of that tribe. 7. Under these circumstances the British Government was ai full liberty to pursiu whatever measure it might consider necessary for the protection of tU own subjects and 9 «nsral trade of India against jut we annoyance. A desire however of avoiding any aet.100 Part V—Chap XXV. which could possibly be strained into a disregard of these bappy relations which have so long subsisted between the two States has led the British Government to abstain from the adoption of any final arrangements for the future tranquillity of the Gulf without a previous and unreserved exposition to the Government of Persia of the line of policy which we have been unavoidably compelled to pursue. This policy is explained in the despatch to the supremo Government, and will be found, I trust, to maintain a just regard for the interests of Persia in particular, and generally of the different Arab tribes whose pretensions to an independent authority it would seem to be tha wisest policy to recognise, so long as they shull refrain from applying their power to disturb the arrangements in contemplation. 8. The Imaum of Muscat having asserted a positive claim to the sovereignty of the Island of Kishma, this Government has not hesitated in fixing upon that station as a rende- vous for the expedition. The occupation by the Britnh Government of a more commanding itation in the Gulf, being considered to be indispensable, to enable us to exerase a more immediate and efficient control over it than can be done either from Bus hire or Bussora, the possession of that island would he an important object either permanent!y in full sovereignty, or temporarily until under the beneficial effects which the presence of a British force in the vicinity of the piratical ports may be expected to produce, in reforming their habits, may enable us to relinquish the possession. The latter expedient should in my opinion be preferred only on a failure of obtaining the cessions of Kishma in perpetuity. 9. I entertain no doubt that the cession of Kish&gt;na might be obtained from the Imaum of Muscat provided His Hiyhness's pretensions to it be indisputable, but I believe that the sovereignty of the island was at one time claimed by Persia, and under any circumstances I am satisfied that the Supreme Government would not unless on extreme emergency be inclined to take any measure regarding the occupation of that island, which you might conceive to be permanently injurious to our general interests at the Court of Tehran. 10. You must be the best judge whether we are required either by justice or policy to negotiate the previous consent of Persia, or whether we may content ourselves with the simple explanation of our views and intention^, in either case after the above exposition of the motives which impel us to depart from the principles which governed our interposition in the expedition of 1810; and which its entire failure in eradicating piracy has imposed upon us, I must leave to your experience, judgment anil address to adopt the line of conduct which may most effectually reconcile t ie important object of eradicating piracy, which the maintenance of the good understanding that so happily subsists between His Majesty's Government and the Court of Persia. 11. You will perceive by our despatch to the Supreme Government that we mean to avoid all interference in respect to the Island of Bahrein, in the event however of the force which has been despatched by the Government of Persia failing to obtain possession of it; there is however reason to believe that provided the Persian (government will consent to the Uttoobees continuing in the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein, the Sheikh would readily agree to pay the tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government would be gladly afforded, provided it can be employed in such a manner as to avoid any thing tiiat might in any shape involve us iu the transactions of the parties after the conclusion of the negotia tion immediately referred to. Our entire repugnance to involve ourselves in the politics of the Gulf on this as on all other occasions may contribute to satisfy the Persians of the absence of every design to extend our power or inHuence in that direction. 12. The complete restoration of the influence of the Persian Government over every port on the Persian side of the can be easily effected., I take the liberty however of recommending to your consideration the urgent expediency that exists of some arrangements being made by the Persian Government for the purpose of establishing the most effectual control over the different Sheikhs who may be placed in authority at those places and of giving effect to those maritime regulations which it is proposed to establish, prohibitory of the outfit of armed vessels or boats, and for exercising a general control over those ports. 13. The Resident at Bushire will forward to you a report of the contumacious conduct of the Sheikh of Currack and containing the most decisive evidence of his having engaged in acts of piracy. I make no doubt that you will be able to obtain the orders for the removal of the chieftain of that island, which if the Persian Government should prove incapable of effecting, the force now in the Gulf may be employed in reducing him to subjection. 14. It is not improbable that the Officers Commanding the Expedition may attack some island or ports on the main which may acknowledge allegiance to the Persian Government, and that false reports of our motives may reach the Court of Tehran. It is scarcely necessary to state that no offensive operations will be carried on against any place which shall not have engaged in piracy, and there can be no question of our right to attack such as have been eo concerned after proving for so long a period the inability of their own Government to restrain their depredations, should therefore any act of aggression be committed against any territory which may belong to Persia, you will no doubt be able s itisiaotorily to explain the grounds on which it has been made, 15. I have also the honour of transmitting to you copies of the several instructions which have been issued to Major-General Sir William Grant Keir, K.M.T., Commanding the Troops, employed in this expedition. Possessed of the documents which form the enclosures to this jleepatch you will be fully apprized of the extent and nature of the arrangements which it i?Part V—Chap. XXV. 101 thought desirable to introduce into the Persian Gulf, I should feel obliged by your communis eating the result of any conferences you may hold wilhthe Persian Government, and promotiv# of the objects detailed in this despatch, to that officer, who will readily attend to any sugges tions you may have to offer, connected with the formation of those ulterior arrangements for the extirpation of piracy, in which the acquiescence of the Persian Government may be necessary. 207A. A copy of the above despatch was also sent to Major-General Sir W. G. Keir, K.M.T., with the following FoW « 0/1820.1821, 85. iQs t ra otionS 2. You will be pleased to avail yourself of a fit opportunity of making a communication to the Sheikh of Bahrein, in the event of the island not having been reduced by the Persians, to the effect of the suggestions contained in the paragraph of the despatch in question. 3. The 4th and 7th paragraphs inclusive of that despatch have reference to the arrange ments to be formed for the future oontrol of the port of Rassulkhima in the efficiency of which the Governor in Council chiefly relies for putting an immediate check to piracy and in compelling the other tribes which have directly or indirectly followed or promoted it to abandon the further prosecution of it. You will require from the chieftain who may be placed in authority in the principality of Seir our obligation to the effect of the suggesstions contained in those paragraphs. 4. By the 8th paragraph you will perceive the nature of the relations which it appears to the Governor in Council to be expedient that we should form with the Imaum of Muscat, and you will tender to His Highness whatever assistance he may require for the purpose of rendering his maritime force more efficient to be employed in co-operation with our ships of war and cruisers for maintaining the future tranquillity of the Gulf, on which the security and prosperity of His Highness's extensive commercial concerns so much depends. 6. The 9th and 11th paragraphs relate to the interests of Persia, and you will be guided in the prosecution of your operations or your negotiations with the ports and islands which may be disposed to acknowledge its allegiance by the communications you may receive from the Envoy of Tehran. 6. Should you however have been compelled to prosecute hostilities against any ports on the Persian side of the Gulf or any islands which may have thrown off their dependance on Persia since the ascendancy of the Wahabee's power, you will transfer such as you may reduce, or may voluntarily surrender their boats and consent to acknowledge the supremacy of Persia to the Sheikh of Bushire as dependencies on that Government. 7. You will observe from the 13th paragraph that it is the intention of the Governor in Council to reduce the force under your command and to return it to the Presidency at as early a period as practicable after the main objects of your instructions shall have been accomplished, leaving, as you are authorized to do, one battalion of Native infantry and a detail of artillery should you judge it necessary at Kishma or any other eligible island until further orders with the view of overawing the Arab tribes and enforcing by the presence of such a body of troops in the Gulf those arrangements which are to be formed for its future tranquillity. 8.

Captain Sadleir had to travel all the way across Arabia towards Diary of Journey across Arabia, etc., by Medina to find Ibiahim 3 asba , and Captain Sadleir. when he met the Egyptian Commander, after a short complimentary conversation. His Excellency directed the attendants to withdraw and read the despatches which Captain Sadleir bad the honour to present. During the confidential communication which ensued, Ibrahim Pasha informed him that the policy of the expedition had been entrusted to his father's guidance by the Ottoman Court. His instructions had limited his operations to Deriah, but that he was not aware of the ultimate views which bad actuated that court to set on foot the expedition. On the fall of Deriah he awaited further instructions, which arrived from Constanti nople, directing the total destruction of Deriah and eventually the evacuation of the whole country, the revenues of which were reported insufficient to defray the expenses of the troops required for its protection during his stay at Deriah. Awaiting these orders he had pushed a post as far as Hasa and Katif, to procure supplies, his army being in the greatest distress, and that at that period a friendly intercourse with the British would have proved of the first importance. 209. Ibrahim Pasha expressed his regret at the altered state of affairs, which would preclude the possihility of his meeting the wishes of the Governor- General, in whose views he would have been most happy to have coincided at an earlier period, had he been acquainted with the intentions of the British authorities; he however considered the communication to be of such import ance as to require a reference to His Highness Mahomed Ali Pasha, without whose instructions he was averse to form a reply to the des patches. Whatever were the instructions Ibrahim Pasha received, Captain Sadleir was treated with much discourtesy later on and had to return to Maskat by way of Mocha without having effected any of the objects of bis mission. • Printed in 1866 at the Education Society's His Diary of* a journey across Arabia Press, Byculla. however, been a gain to the geogra phical knowledge of Central Arabia, the value of which more than compen sates for the failure of the expedition. 209A. It is interesting to contract the British line of policy pursued in 1819 with that adopted in 1838-1841, when they exerted their utmost to check the progress of the Viceroy of Egypt towards the Persian Gulf {vide paragraphs 366 et seq. hereafter).Part V —Chap. XXVI. 103 (II) CAPTURE OF RAS-CL-KHIMA. 210. The British fleet proceeded to the rendezvous at Kishm, while the Low's History of Indian Navy, Volume l, Liverpool sailed to Maskat, which she page 352. reached on the 13th of November 1819, and on the 7th the military and naval chiefs had an interview with the Imam, who promised to co-operate with four thousand men and three vessels of war. As it was a matter of importance that a reconnaissance should be made of the defences of Ras-ul-Khima, Sir W. Grant Keir proceeded thither on the 25th of December in the Lioerpoot, leaving the convoy to water at Kishm, and, on the same day, met the Hon'ble Company's Cruiser Benares, having on board Dr. .lukes, who had been sent on in advance of the expedition on a special mission to arrange for the Imam's co-operation, and a Commissariat Officer, who was to make arrangements for the provisioning of the large force on their arrival at Kishm. Sir W. Grant Keir communicated with Dr. Jukes, and learnt from him that the letter of the Governor of Bombay to the Prince of Shiraz had been forwarded from Bunder Abbass direct to Shiraz on the 16th of Nov ember, and that a duplicate had been transmitted by the Ilon'ble Company's cruiser Teignmouth on the 4th of the same month to Mr. Bruce, the Political Resident at Bushire, also to be forwarded to Shiraz. As it was desirable that Bas -ul-Khima should be blockaded. Captain Collier ordered the Benares io accompany him to assist in the operation, and on the same day the two ships arrived off the place. The Military Commander, accompanied by his staff and the Commanding Engineer, reconnoitred the town during the 26th and 27th November, and, after careful consideration, arrived at the conclusion that the troops now at Kishm would be sufficient for the reduction of Ilas-ul-Khima, without waiting for the arrival from Bombay of the four remaining transports. The Benares was, accordingly, despatched to summon the fleet, and, upon its arrival on the 2nd of December, immediate arrangements were made lor disembarking the troops and camp followers from the;transports.^ During the afternoon the remaining four transports from Bombay came in sight; on the same day the Imam arrived with two frigates and about six hundred men, considerably less than he had promised, but his zeal appeared unabated and his co-operation was of no little value. 211. On the following day the disembarkation was conducted, under coyer of the gunboats and armed launches of the squadron, with surprising celerity and good order considering the great distance the ships were obliged to anchor from the town, and the lack of a sufficient of means for transporting so large a force with all the guns, supplies, and stores necessary for seige operations. The place was immediately invested and battered in breach, after an active resist ance of six days; the town was taken possession by the British force on 9th December. 212. Some days previous to the British getting possession of Ras-ul-Khima a ^ . j * j cti paper had been conveyed into that place Sir William Grant Keir s report, dated 6th r r PViiaf TToooon Kin- January 1820, Volume 52-49 of 1820-1821, offering quarter to the Chief, Hassan- bin - page 147. Rachma, and the whole or any part ot the garrison who should come out and surrendered themselves prisoners; this summons was not, however, complied with, but after the evacuation of the town a Chieftain, named Kazib, who, with his followers had formed part of the garrison, came in and surrendered himself upon assurances of safety. He represented that his great desire was to be at peace, and to obtain a written protection from Sir William Grant for himself and followers. AVhilst they should conduct themselves in a peaceable manner Kazib was accordingly dismissed with the letter of protection which he was desirous of obtaining. 213. The next day the principal Chieftain, Hassan-bin- Rachma, intimated by a note that he likewise would gladly come in, and an answer was sent offering him security expressed by the Arabic word Amdu : he accordingly came into camp with four attendants, and was placed in confinement until some distinct information could be procured on which to form a judgment of what course it would be most advisable to pursue, 214. At the end of a few days it was discovered that considerable agitation prevailed amongst the Arabs, occasioned by the confinement of this Chieftain,104 Part V- Chap. XXVI. and the disappointment of the expectations which had in all probability been excited by the previous treatment of Kazib. This confinement was likewise represented as one of the principal obstacles to the establishment of confidence and amicable relations with the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. It was therefore resolved to liberate him, which was done accordingly. This act was followed by an immediate demonstration of confidence on the part ot' the Arabs, who came readily and in numbers to purchase the rice and dates left in Ras-ul-Khima after the precipitate retreat of its garrison. 215. Having received information that the town of llumz had been abandoned and that its inhabitants had retired to a hill fort, within cannon shot of the creek on which Ruraz is situated, Sir AVilliam Grant resolved to attack it, and made the necessary preparations accordingly. 216. Hassan-bin-Ali, the Chieftain of the above-mentioned fort, the name of which is Zayah, was a man of very considerable influence throughout this part of the country, and his fort was reckoned the key to Ras-ul-Khima on the northj as effectually commanding the passes and the mountains and along the shore leading to that place. It was strong in the estimation ol the Arabs from being situated on a rugged and steep hill, and the belief was current that the British guns could not be sufficiently elevated to destroy its defences. The capture of this fort under such prevailing ideas and circumstances was there fore likely to produce a considerable sensation throughout the Gulf, and amongst other advantages to cause the surrender of many places of conse quence to the general progress of the operations, by which a great saving of time and means, as well as of the lives and labour of our valuable troops would be effected. 217. On the 18th December, the detachment destined for the above mentioned service proceeded to Zayah under the immediate command of Major Warren of His Majesty's 65th Regiment, and being desirous of personally inspecting the progress of the operations, Sir William accompanied Captain Collier in the Liverpool to Rumz, off which place he anchored on the same morning that the detachment left Ras-ul-Khima. 218. When the British troops approached Zayah, a messenger was despatched with a paper intimating that in the event of Hassan-bin-Ali and his followers surrendering the fort without resistance, they should not be put into confinement, but this summons not having been attended to, and the fort having opened a fire on one column, measures were immediately taken to commence the attack, which was followed by the surrender and occupation of the fort on the 22nd instant. 219. The conditions on which Zayah surrendered were that the lives of the garrison should be spared, they giving up their arms and property, the whole of the men were accordingly marched out of the place with the view of their being immediately embarked on board of transports off Rumz, but this arrangement could not be completed till the morning of the 23rd, The women and children remained at Zayah, and even of course treated with every possible degree of humanity. It may not be necessary to add that several acts of kindness very creditable to the feelings of the British gallant troops were performed on this occasion. 220. A consideration of the extreme state of helplessness and misery to which upwards of four hundred women and children were reduced by the captivity of their husbands, induced Sir William on the information of Captain Bruce, the Resident of Bushire, to reland from the transports so many of the prisoners as were found to be cultivators of the ground or date trees ; to these were added some old men and children ; indeed, the only persons retained consisted of such as were believed to be immediately attached to the service of the Chief together with a few men belonging to tribes and places which it appeared probable might be visited hereafter by the expedition. 221. As the usual occupations of the men released were of a peaceable nature, this act of lenity left a lasting impression of the magnanimity of the British character. When the families had been joined by the men that were relanded, the whole proceeded to a village called Shemmel where they were peaceably settled.Part V-Chap. XXVI. 105 222. The prisoners consisting of the Chief Hassan-bin-Ali and one hundred and sixty-nine followers proceeded in the transports to Has-ul-Ivhima \\here they were lodged in a place of security. This mode of disposing of all prisoners was adopted as it combined a more perfect degree of security, with the most becomino pledge to the world that these prisoners would be treated with due humanity until they could, from an improving state of society, be with safety set at large. Considerable political advantages would, on Sir William Keir's opinion/likewise arise out of the British Government holding in its immediate power, instead of delivering over to an ally, however devoted, or even placing in our commercial factory at Bushire in a foreign territory, so many individuals belonging to an unsettled country over which the influence arising out of the numerous and povveriul tie of kindred may be exerted to introduce order and civilization, when it became known that the release of those individuals still kept on this spot surrounded by the sympathies and even enjoying the good offices of their relations and triends, depended entirely upon an abandonment of evil pursuits which the British Government had evinced, so decided a determination to abolish for ever. 223-224. The capture of Ras-ul-Khima placed the British troops in posses sion of all the vessels and craft at that time in the creek, and it appeared to Sir William that their immediate destruction under present circumstances would not be absolutely necessary, as it was probably with a different view of the subject from that which had now been opened, that the Government had directed the demolition of the piratical vessels and craft' in the Gulf. 225. The employment of those kept in the service of Government, or in any other legitimate manner, would. Sir William thought, equally with their destruction deprive the pirates of their use, and he considered this deprivation to be the object and spirit of the command to destroy them. Under this view of the subject he retained the whole of the vessels, until he should recei\ e the further instructions of the Governor in Council. 226. In consequence of the great scarcity of good water which involved the necessity of bringing it from a distance for the use of the^ troops, and the general want of supplies that would arise when the fleet might leave this, as well as from a contemplation of the necessity of occasionally moving to various places on the coast apart of the garrison of Ras-ul-Khima, or any other troops that might be left in the Gulf, it was resolved to employ nine of the captured boats best adapted to the purpose of relieving the above-mentioned wants. (Ill) DESIGNS OF PERSIA AND MASRAT ON BAHREIN. 227. After reporting the facts detailed above. Sir William Grant Keir Volume 52-49 of 1820-1821, page 159. added :— 27. I am inclined to believe that the Persian Government have long been desirous of obtaining 1 possession of the Island of Bahrein under an impression of its gieat nches and resources, which are considered to arise principally from the pearl fishery. 28. His Highness the Imam of Maskat informs me that he had repeatedly urged that Government to undertake a joint expedition for the purpose of placing him in possession of this island, and that he had agreed to supplv ships and vessels for the purpose of transporting their united armies across the Gulf. His Highness was solicited about two months ago by the Prince of Shiraz to prepare his ships, but he replied that he was then engaged with the British Government in the suppression of piracy, and that his ships consequently could not be spared. The Imam might have given his reply from having been disappointed by the Persian Government for the two last seasons when the promised army had not been equipped, yet I still think that the army now said to be marching towards the coast ^ has been movec under an expectation that the Imam will be induced to transport it to Bahiein; at all events this will be the ostensible and alleged reason of the movement, although the real causes of it may be the jealousy excited by the knowledge of His Highness's desire to repossess himself of this island, and the proximity of a British army with which His Highness is in strict co-operation. 29. By the messenger above mentioned the Imam has received a second application for his ships ; to this he has replied that if the Prince of Shiraz would pledge on oath not again to deceive him respecting the promised army, and likewise to reimburse his expenses, be wiK proceed accordingly to wherever the army may be assembled.106 Part V -Chap. XXVI. 30. The Imam lias begged to know whether I see any objections to the employment oE his ships in the conveyance of the Persian army, but I have declined to give any direct reply to this question, under the plea that my instructions do not relate to this point. 31. It may possibly have occurred to His Highness the Imam that the present is % favourable moment for making an independent attack on Bahrein, aa although he might not be able to induce the British Grovernment to join with him in this undertaking, he would at least enjoy the advantages arising from a British force being in the Gulf, a circumstance that would prevent the Bahreinese from being joined by allies who might otherwise assist them, although now overawed by the intimate alliance known to subsist betwixt His Highness and the British Government. 32. In the 8th paragraph of your letter of the 27th of October the Island of Bahrein is mentioned as one of the places where property obtained piractically was disposed of. Subse quent information on this head has tended to contirm the belief that it was even the principal channel through which the pirates were unable to convert into money the valuable merchandize which they captured. 33. Information having reached Captain Bruce that ten piratical vessels had taken refuge at this island, His Maje-ty's ships Eden and Cuibia and the Honourable Company's cruiser vessel were despatched by Captain Collier three days ago for the purpose of demanding the surrender of these boats. 34. The Army of His Highness the Imamud of Maskat alluded to in my despatch of the 10th ultimo, arrived two days after the tall o c Ras-ul-Khima, but as its presence had become unnecessary from thp termination of our military operations before this place previous to its arrival, and as the strongest religious and other prejudices existed betwixt it and the inha bitants of this neighbourhood which precluded all hope of the mmds of the people becoming settled and reconciled to what had occurred, whilst this Army should remain, I requested that His Highness would direct its return to his own territories beyond the mountains, a ehort distance from hence, and this movement was made accordingly. (IV) OCCUPATION OF RAS-UL-KHMl BY A BRITISH DETACHMENT. 228. No reply having as yet reached Sir William from Ibrahim Pacha respecting the offer made to him by the Supreme Government of placing the port of Kas-ul-Khima under the authorty of the Turkish Government, it become necessary to make arrangements for its occupation. Measures were accordingly taken for placing this fortress in such a state of defence as to render its garrison secure against any sudden attack. 229. The gnrrison left was composed of a detachment of artillery and the 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment, Native Infantry. A strong detached work (one of the principal defences of Eas-ul-Khima) having been most materially injured during the recent operations and rendered useless and even incon venient for our purposes, it was directed that it should be completely destroyed. The other defences were in conformity to the 14th paragraph of Government letter of the 27th October (paragraph 204 above) retained entire. (\) PACIFICATION OF THE PIRATE COAST. 230. The success of the British operations on this coast were followed by proofs of a strong and general effect. Hassan-bin-Ali, the late Chieftain of Lava and Humz, was a prisoner in our hands, and Hassan-bin Rachma, the late Chieftain of Ras-ul-Khima, again come into camp, for the purpose of sub scribing to terms calculated to give permanency to the tranquillity which had been established. Kazib, the Chieftain of lazerat-ul-Hamra, also came to the Camp, and the Chieftain of Shargha arrived soon after to confirm his previous offers of unconditional submission. All the Chieftains evinced their readiness to enter, for themselves and followers, into any arrangements that might be prescribed for the effectual pacification of the Gulf. The Chieftain of Debai having died recently, his widow, who was in possession of the Government, sent her son, a boy of about nine years of age, expressed her desire to enter into gimilar arrangements.Part V-Chap. XAVII. 107 CHAPTER XXVII. THE PRELIMINARY TREATIES AND THE GENERAL TREATY OF PEACE, 1820. 231. On the 8th January 1820 a General Treaty * of peace was concluded . ? m * tt t -.r in Eas-ul-Khima between Maior-General AUchson . Treaties, T olum, X. Keir&gt; on the ^ of the British Govern . ment, and nearly all the Chiefs of the Maritime Arabs on the Gulf of Persia, t Ibid. h ? whom it was subsequently signed at different times and places. A separate Preliminary t Treaty was concluded on the same date with Hassan-bin-Ali stipulating for the surrender of all his vessels (excepting the fishing boats), the release of all Indian prisoners and the occupation of the towns of Ras-ul-Khima j j- hid and Mahari by the British Government. A treaty J was entered into with Sheikh Sultan-bin*Saggar of Shargah for the surrender of the towers, guns and vessels of Shargah, Ejman and Amm-ul-Gavine and their dependencies; stipulat ing, however, that the British troops were not to enter the towns or lay them w T aste. Major-General Keir in forwarding to the Government copies of these treaties entered into a full elucidation of Tolum ' : ' tlie principles under each of the clauses of the treaties (letter, dated 16th January 1820) 4. Article Ist of the General Treaty provides for a cessation of all plunder and piracy on the part of the contracting' Arabs, this being the principle upon which those who have been guilty are admitted to a reconciliation with the British Government. 5. Article 2nd points out the punishments that will be incurred by such individuals as may 'practise^ plunder and piracy, and attempts to define what constitutes these crimes as contrasted with legitimate war. 6. Article 3rd describes the flag 1 that is to be in use amongst the tribes that are parties to the General Treaty. In discussing this point with different Arabs I found that the proposed flag would be the most agreeable to the inclinations as connecting the sacred flag which they have hitherto borne, with the white ensign, the universally recognized symbol of peace, they are likewise aware that the red flag is usually considered by European nations to belong to pirates; and that their safety would consequently be greatly promoted by the adoption of that now proposed. 7. Article 4th declares that the relations now subsisting betwixt the tribes continues unaltered with the exception of being at peace with each other and also with the British Government. This article is intended to keep manifest the broad principles on which we have proceeded, and to prevent any idea arising that we wish to alter the existing relations either of Chiefs or States; as well as to demonstrate our determination not to interfere in the petty feuds of the subscribing powers, whilst they continue duly to observe the stipulations of this treaty. 8. The 5th article provides for vessels being furnished with certain papers similar to our ' Registers ' and 'Port clearances/' Considerable difficulties are likely to arise in obtain ing the introduction of these papers, with such attention to forms as to secure them from being liable to legal objections on the part of the commanders of different ships of war, exercising the right of search, and I ought here to observe that it may be necessary to call for a considerable degree of forbearance on these points for some time on the part of all vesgel* cruising in these seas, 9. I anticipate other important advantages from the introduction of these papers, as well from the beneficial effects common to all parts of the world, as from the tendency they have to introduce order, and more correct ideas of property than have hitherto existed in the Gulpb. It is to the observance of this article that I took principally as the means of preventing the equipment of any vessels for warlike purposes, and I consider it better to introduce restrictions under such forms, than to impose others that might not be so effectual, although more direct interfering as they must with the freedom necessary to commerce.108 Parf V-Chap. XXVII. An additional reason for adopting 1 this line of policy is tbat it afford-? an opportunity for admitting to the General Treaty a number of tribes against whom no direct charge of piracy has been advanced, and on whom consequently there would be no place for imposing more severe restrictions, the nature of which are superseded in effect; by others that are conciliatory. 10. Article the sixth points out the means by which a ready an l friendly intercourse may be maintained at the convenience of the contracting Powers, and provides for the free admission of a functionary, whose establishment would go a considerable way towards the due introduc tion of the required papers. 11. Article the seventh is designed to entitle us to call upon the different tribes to join with us in putting down all who in defiance of the present compact may continue a system we have shewn ourselves determined to abolish ; and it will make apparent that the falling off from their engagement of tribes, or individuals, does not interfere with, or annul in any manner the obligations of the General Treaty with respect to all others. 12. Article the eighth places in its due light the horrible custom of inflicting death on such as may become prisoners of war; and announces that a general coalition will take plaoa against all who may persist in so inhuman a practice. 13. Article the ninth abolishes the slave trade of the subscribing Powers, and must shew distinctly the abhorrence in which it is held by the British Government. This even as a measure of policy cannot fail to be followed by beneficial effects, as a considerable portion of the men lately opposed to us have consisted of slaves, and I cannot withhold from observ ing that no persuasion was necessary to induce the acceptance of this stipulation. 14. Article the tenth holds out to the Arabs the prospect of an equitable and secure commercial intercourse, and it is to the due consideration of this, but we must look for any permanent conquest over the lawless habits which have so long interrupred the friendly relations that naturally arise out of it, and which lead so immediately to the introduction of civilization, with all its attendant blessings. 15. The eleventh article makes the treaty common to all tribes and parsons who may at any future time sign an abhorrence to it. 16. I shall now proceed to notice the preliminary treaties to which I have be fee adverted. 17. Article the first in the accompanying treaty with Hussan-biu-liahma, the Chief of Rassulkima, Mahara, and their dependencies, provides for the cession of Rassulkhima and Mahara, in demanding this it has been explained that the British Gover nnent is fully at liberty to dispose of these places in any manner, that it may think fit. On the three remain ing articles I do not deem it necessary to offer any remarks. 18. Sultan-bin-Sagger, the Chief of Shargah, soon after the fall of Rassulkhima, sent Vakeels with offers of submission to whatever terms might be dictated, he afterwards sent his brother with the same proposals, and next came himself into camp where he sisriied the pre liminary treaty of which the aeoompanying is a copy. The anxiety on the part of this Chief evidently arose from his desire to avoid the consequences of any actual hostilities on our part against him, and was the cause of the 3rd article being inserted. 19. Mahomed-bin-Huza-bin-Zaal, a minor Chief of Deebey (noticed in the conclusion of the 38th paragraph of my despatch of the 6th instant), was sent to me by His Highness the Imaum of Maskat who, I am led to understand, is desirous that some exceptions should be made in favour of him, and the people of Deebey being of the same tribe with His Highness, and not generally involved in the acts of piracy committed in the Gulphs, I hive in conse quence of my desire to meet the Imaum's wishes made the exception in the end of the 3rd article of the accompanying preliminary treaty. 20. It will be observed that the remaining articles are similar to what were entered into with Sultan-bin-Sagger, and Mahomed-bin-Haza-bin-Zaal will be admitted along with him to subscribe the General Treaty; when the whole of the stipulations which are preliminary ehall have been fulfilled. 21. Where a political state of society exists similar to that which obtains in the Gulph of Persia, the basis of any approach to general pacification mast have its rise in forgiveness for past offences, and it is well when that forgiveness can be bestowed without the exaction of great sacrifices from the guilty, who, where the punishment inflicted is more severe than is absolutely necessary, might prefer to indulge feelings of revenge, rather than to cultivate peaceable habits of industry which it is so desirable to introduce here; reasoning thus, 1 should have confined to the compass into which they now stand, my demands upon the former practices of piracy, but the tenor of my instructions being in perfect unison with this reasoning decided me not to require more from them in negotiation, than I could have obtained by proceeding to the utmost acts of hostility contemplated in my orders, and it is gratifying to know that the full extent of what was desired has been conceded without exciting feelingl that would have interfered greatly with our views for the suppression of piracy, and the introduction of a secure commercial intercourse. 22. Referring to Arab Chiefs, who had not been engaged in piracies but signed the treaty. Sir William Keir writes ; it gives me great satisfaction to announce that a new class of Chiefs and tribes, whose conduct has not been tainted with past crimes, are likely to come forward, anxiously wishing to be admitted to the General Treaty; this will be a proof that itPart V-Chap. XXVII. 109 is efficient in their estimation ; and that they are consequently desirous of uniting with ua lo inforce its observance by others who have subscribed to it. 23. Sheikhbooth the Chief of Boothabee arrived in my camp on the 11th instant, and expressed a great desire to enter into friendly and strict relations with the British Govern ment. I have accordingly made with him the accompanying preliminary engagement and admitted him to subscribe the General Treaty. ****** 25. It will be apparent to the Honourable the Governor in Council that I have eagerly seized what I considered a most favourable moment for the conclusion of these engagements lest in the fluctuations of human affairs, and in the time required for previous sanction, it should have been lost for ever. These were indeed opportunities not to be overlooked for confirming and perpetuating the effects of our previous military operations, and for executing the spirit and letter of my instructions to suppress piracy. The state of affairs on this coast called for some decided demonstration of what was likely to be our future wishes, since we had shewn our power to accomplish them, and all who had been made sensible of this, awaited with much anxiety, a pledge that would set at rest all their apprehensions, and I humbly conceive that any delay in granting this would not have been becoming, particu larly as the annulment of all that has been executed under these ideas could not occasion greater perplexity than before existed. 26. Then as to the omission of any mention of British allies in the treaty. Sir W. Grant observes : The distinct introduction into the General Treaty of any of out former allies has been avoided from the belief that their religious and personal animosities added to their habits of indecision and procrastination, mi^ht prove a bar to the conclusion, and afterwards the due observance of any compact with which they might be directly connected with us, and these reasons for their omission will probably appear stranger; when it is recollected, how liable their interests are to fluctuation, and that a change in the views of any one Power, would interfere with the operation of the whole system, and consequently thwart the inten tions of the British Government in entering into such arrangements j at the same time it is apparent that all the advantages which the allies could derive from the introduction of their names into the General Treaty might be secured to them by their entering through the mediation of the British Government into special treaties, generally, or individually, with the Arab tribes, recognising at the same time that which has now been concluded. This wouM leave the British Government perfectly unembarrassed in the pursuit of its own views, an object which must be at all times desirable. 27. Under this conviction I have transmitted to Muscat to His Highness the Imaum who had proceeded towards that place previous to the conclusion of the General Treaty, a communication intimating my belief that the British Government would most readily recognise by a special treaty, that acts of piracy committed against His Highness, or his subjects, should be looked upon in the same light as committed against its own, and would guarantee free admission of His Highnesses subjects and vessels into the port of the Arabs, understanding that a reciprocal admission shall be given to them into the ports of His Highness. 28. I have likewise intimated that His Highness's formal recognition to Bombay of the treaty now entered into would probably be very acceptable to the Britibh Government, as would an offer on his part to act against the Arabs, in the event of their committing any breach of it. To prevent mistakes or misrepresentations I have transmitted for His Highness's information copies of all the engagements into which I have entered with the Arabs, from the conviction that such public proceedings which must be matters of notoriety, although not yet ratified by the Governor in Council would be transmitted with great advantage in a complete form. 29. His Highness had been made acquainted previous to his leaving Rassul-Khima, that these treaties were in progress, and should have been put in possession of the whole, had it been possible to complete them before his departure, the day previous to which Captain Thompson, my interpreter, waited upon His Highness to communicate the substance of the foregoing proposals, which seemed to be received with great satisfaction. 80. Shortly after the transmission of my despatch of the 6th instant the Imaum intimated during an interview with me his desire to return to Muekat, and directly avowed that his intention in proceeding there was to make preparations for an independent attack on Bahrein, as adverted to in the Slst paragraph of my despatch of the 6th. His Highness at the same time begged to know whether I had any objections to his doing so now, as he considered the service in which he had been engaged with us to be at an end, and pressed me to inform him whether his proceeding to Bahrein would be disagreeable to the British Government. I replied that His Highness being an independent Prince must at all times be at liberty to act in con formity to his ideas of what was safe; with regard to his proceeding to Bahrein, it was impossible. I could give him any opinion, and as my instructions did not relate to that point, I could not form any judgment of what the views of my Government might be, but if the Imaum would commit to writing any proposals he had to make or questions he wished to ask in the event of my not being able to give an immediate reply, I should forthwith forward his communication to Bombay. His Highness intimated that this should be done in the evening, and statjed that he should proceed to Maskat next day. In the evening I received a message from His Highness, stating that he did not intend writing to me on the subject that he had ? \110 Part V- Chap. X'SVIt. agitated, until he should reach Maskat; as he wished for time to consider whether it would be necessary to trouble the Government with such a reference. His Highness proceeded to Maskat the next day and has left me impressed with tlie belief that he means to make an attack upon Bahrein without permitting the Government of Shiraz to share in the success ho anticipates, from the impression made by his having: been admitted to a strict co-operation with a British force still in the Gulph. That the Prince of Shiraz dreads a proceeding of this kind on the part of the Imaum, and is likewise uneasy, respecting the future movements of this force, is apparently from the great desire he has shewn to possess himself of the Imaum's ships ; and his having given the pledge required by His Highness as well as the promise that his expenses shall be reimbursed, this policy on the part of the Prince will probably embarrass the Imaum considerably. 31. The letter from the Prince of Shiraz, of which the accompanying is a translation, reached me on the 9th instant, and a translation of my reply to it is now forwarded ; it is hardly to be supposed the Prince could have expected ; that his request to have four or five ships for the purpose of conveying his army to Bahrein would be comp ied with, it wai probably urged with the view of calling forth some reply from which he could form a judg ment of what the views of the British Government were respecting that island, or conjecture the future operations of this force, 32. It will be observed that the Prince abstains entirely from alluding in any manner to the,determination announced in Sir Evan Nepean's letter that the expedition should visit certain places on the Persian Coast for the purpose of destroying the piratical vessels that might be in them, but the Envoy Mirza Mahomed Banker made many enquiries respectiug my intentions when I should proceed, there. To these enquiries I replied by a reference to Sir Evan Nepean's letter above alluded to. 33. I take this opportunity of noticing that T have understood from Captain Bruce, the Resident of Bushire, that there is an article in the last treaty betwixt the Persian and the British Governments which precludes the latter from holding possession of any of the islands in the Gulphs ; Captain Bruce spoke from recollection not having a copy of the treaty along with him, 34. Being 1 anxious to reduce the expenses of the armament as much as possible, I have availed, myself of the opportunity arising from the appointment of a garrison to Rasbulkhima to effect a new distribution of the troops and stores by which I have found myself enabled to dispense with fifteen hundred and four tons of the most expensive vessels which are as follows :— The Pascoa of 732 tons that sailed on the 6th instant having on board, the wounded of the force on which account she was directed to touch at Maskat. The Angelica of 356 tons that will be ready to sail about the 17th instant, she likewise will touch at Maskat, and the Orpheus of 416 tons that conveys this despatch direct to Bombay. 35. On the two last mentioned ship will proceed all the sick of the forces who are not likely to become effective during the remainder of the service. 36. When these ships shall have arrived at Bombay, Government will be able to determine whether or not it will be expedient to discharge them, but even in the event of the Honourable Board deciding to retain them, they are more serviceable under their present destination than if they had remained here where their services can be dispensed with. 37. The general re-establishment of confidence and tranquillity has afforded a favourable opportunity to the prisoners taken at Zayah, and I feel considerable gratification in being at so early a period enabled to give effect to a measure which was called for by every considera tion of policy and humanity. 3S. The important change which has taken place in our relations with the Arab Chief since the fall of Zayah has entirely superseded the necessity of continuing these people any longer under restraint. Even their enmity can be productive of no bad consequences at th« present period, whilst the conciliation of the Chief which appears the most probable effect of placing him on a footing with the other Sheikhs, who by a timely submission alone escaped the humiliation he had suffered will tend materially to consolidate the arrangements which have so happily been effected, 39. I am confident therefore, in taking this step for which Government will be prepared by the 15th paragraph of my last despatch, I shall only anticipate its pleasure, and it is fortunate that the policy and humanity of this measure coincide even with the convenience of the service, a due regard to which might have compelled me to adopt the expedient of releasing the prisoners to prevent the risk of contagion to the garrison, arising from sickness amongst them, which in the opinion of the medical gentleman in charge was to be apprehended. Hussan bin Ali and his followers were accordingly liberated, and returned to their families at Shammel yesterday ; the Chieftain came back and after signing the accompanying preliminary engagement, was permitted to become a party to the General Treaty, The operation of this document may therefore now be considered as extending to the whole of the Arabian Coast from Rumzes to Bothabee, which includes all that has of late been reckoned piratical. 40. The General Treaty has been executed in Triplicate, and so soon as the expected signatures have been affixed, an original shall be transmitted to the Honourable the Governor- iq Council.(U Part V—Chap. XXVII. Ill 41. The important sfrvices which hare been rendered by my interpreter Captmn Thompson, I shall have occasion to bring forward hereafter, when the final arrangemen ooneequent to my visit to the remaining ports are concluded, 42. The works at Rassnlkhima adverted to in the 35th paragraph of my last despatch, having been brought to the required state, and the embarkations being ^^^ ^im narv I expect to be able to proceed this afternoon to accomplish the fulfilment of the prehmin y treaties, after which 1 purpose crossing over to the Persian shore. 43. I expect in about three weeks to return to Rassulkhima, where I hope to he favoio by the recept of instructions from the Governor in Council that will enable me to torm a iudgment respecting the time when the expedition may return to Bombay. 44. 1 have entrusted this despatch to my Aid-de-Camp Lieutenant Marriott, to whom I beg leave to refer for any further information which may be required respecting the subjects mentioned in it. 232. The Bombay Government was not entirely satisfied with the terms of the treaty, and made the following Volume 52—49 of 1820-1821,page 260, ^ sagg estionS for future guidance in case alteration was possible or similar treaties had to be made with other Chiefs (letter No. 37, dated 16th February 1320) : — 4. The Governor in Council would be disposed to introduce certain additions, which will be hereafter noticed, into the treaty, but sensible that wiih a people so rnde as the natives of Arabia, any alteration made here in the ratified treaty, a though oiTored again toi leu confirmation or rejection, might be considered as a breach of an engagement alieady con cluded ; he therefore directs me to request that in case there should still be any of the pna ica porti not admitted into the general treaty, or if from your opportunities of observation you should conceive that those already admitted might be led to concur in any of these additions, you will be pleased to procure the consent of all the different Chiefs to them, but it } Ou e on conceive that any doubts of our faith wdl be excited by an attempt at such an alteration, it is by no means the wish of the Governor in Council that the subject should be mentioned. 5. The additions desirable will be best communicated by pointing out the objects which it was thought expedient to attain, the degree to which they have been compensated by othei advantages acquired in the present treaty, and the alterati ms which should be neeessaiy o improve such parts of that treaty as were not anticipated in the former instmctions. 6. After destroying all vessels of war and dismantling all forts belonging to Piratical Chiefs which the Governor in Council concludes has actually b^en accomplished, it would have been desirable to remove all Chiefs concerned in piracy or likely to afford any countenance to the practice of that enormity; to detain in custody all such Chiefs aa had rendered themae ves particularly obnoxious by their practice or countenance of piracy, and had fallen into our hanas in the course of our operations, together with all their piratical adherents and to set up in then stead such Chiefs as could be depended on for their discouraging piracy, or it no such could e found to make over the country to the Imam. 7. To prohibit the fitting out of armed vessels of every description at ports that have been accustomed to practice piracy, to limit the eize of those allowed for commercial purposes, so a* to render them easily resisted if applied to piracy, and to stipulate for the right of search anil of capturing all such as should be found to transgress this prohibition. 8. To restrain the exportation from India of timber for building iarge ships. 9. In the event of the Imaum's refusal to accept of the piratical porta rendering it necessary to allow the same Chiefs to remain, the Governor in Council conceives that it would have been expedient to restrain their known disposition to piracy by additional restrictions such as prohibiting thpir rebuilding th^ir forts and stipulating lor the right ot landing am destroying any works that they might attempt to raise and others of the same nature. J ie Governor in Council is aware that these engagements would have been occasionally eva e , but he conceives that they were better calculated than any others, attainable to answer tne^ai in view, and that aided by the executions of the Otlicer Commanding at our station in the uu t they would scarcely have failed in suppressing piracy. 10. The principal advantages gained by the present treaty appear to be tha promise of the Arab Chiefs to abandon piracy, and to renounce the slave trade, and the practice of murdering their prisoners. The two last stipulations appear to the Governor in Council to do honor to your humanity and have his highest approbation j while the first, if acted up to, comprehends all the objects of the expedition. The security, however, for the performance o those conditions appears to the Governor in Council to be unsatisfactory. 1 he promise even of a civilised nation to abstain from practices recommended by their habits, their interests, and their religion could not of itself be relied on j and the only means of securing its per formance provided by the treaty are the institution of registers and port clearances together with the adoption of a particular flag ; to which may be added the promise of the Arab to co-operate against any of their number who may renew the practice of piracy, v it i regar to the use of registers and port clearances the Governor in Council is compelled to avow is distrust of their efficacy. If our cruizers were authorised to seize any vessels belonging to piratical p )rts which eithei in the size or in the number had arms of their own exceeded the extent necessary foi commeu ;al purposes, the register would then be useful to enable our cruizors to distinguish thj ■^12 Part V—Chap. XXVIl. those ports from those of the other ports of Arabia, but if all are allowed to send oat such vessels the advantage of ascertaining the port to which each belongs is tot apparent. It was not from ignorance of the ports from whence piratical vessels issued that we have so lonf been subjected to their attacks. There appears ground to apprehend that any vessels disposed to renew the practice of piracy will sail with all their papers ready to show to any ship of superior strength, and under the colors of the friendly Arabs, those means will at firgt enable them more easily to deceive our vessels, and when they are detect-d and their Chief declared our enemy, his breach of the present tieaty exposes him to no consequences which would not have resu ted from lus piracy had that agreement never been entered into, unless the other Arabs shouli adhere to their engagement to act against the t), which cannot be generally expected except m eases where those chiefs have themselves a suffnient interest to induce them to afford their eo-oppiation. To give efficacy to tiiis stipulation for registers and port clearances, it is neoefsary that some penalty should be annexed to its non-fulfilment, as it is probable the Arab Unlets dD not conceive that by promising to furnish the r vessels with such papers they have subjected them to capture or even detention if they should sail without being so provided. ru- } l [ 11 would als o ,,e expedient, paiticularly in the event of the consent of the piratical Chiefs being procured, to limit the size and crews of their vessels, to insert a stipulation that a ^,V h, ! ts false papers should subject his own boats to seizure, the principal obiect ot this Stipulation IS to prevent piratical ports from sending out armed vessels under the name ot uhiets not ad acted to piraoy. The possession of armed ship^ by Chiefs not so addicted is an advantage to the Bruish Government from the means it affords for resisting predatory al lacks* 12. I am now directed to communicate the Goveraor in Council's general approval of the preliminary treaty. The Grovernpr in Council, however, dir-ots me to remark on the stipula tion for the surrender of all armed vessels at places to which the expedition might proceed he conceives that the end would have been better answered by demanding the surrender of^ all such vessels whenever they might be, although the result will probably' be the same, as the expedition will no doubt proceed to every port where there may be armed vessels belono-iac to tribes engaged m piracy, ^ 0 13. The Governor in Council is desirous of further explanation of the prohibition in some oases against the Chiefs sending boats to sea which he observes is not applie i to Hu^suu bin Kahma and Hussun Bin Allee, although the most likely to employ their boats in disturbing the tranquillity of the Gulph. 3 1^' The exemption in favor of the Chief of Deebyi at the recommendation of the Imam of Maskat is cntueiy approved. The agreement with Sheik Boothe the Chief of Boothabee has the full approbation of the Governor in Council ; it appears to be higlilv expedient to o-ive every encouragement to Chiefs like him who have never been engaged in piracy. 15. The general stipulation against all piraey appears to the Governor in Council to be a suthcxent security to His Highness the Imaum and our other allies from the future attacks of communications as are, however, b-en perfectly judicious, 16 Your communications to the Imaum and to the Prince at Sheorawa recardint^ their proposed att ick on Bahrein were expresse I with great prudence and are highly 'approved on this subject; I beg to refer you to my letter of the 26th of January. 0 . .I?. I n re f erer, ce to the statement of Captain Bruce alluded to in paragraph 83 that the British Government is precluded by a treaty with Persia from holding possession of anv island m the Gulph, I am directed to observe that no such article has been communicated to this Government. Tue arrangements for reducing the tonnage as reported in pira^raoh 34 ar&lt;» approved. r &amp; r 18-19. You will have anticipated from the preceding part of this letter as well as from mv former despatches, that the Governor in Council is unable to concur in the iustice of the opinion conveyed in paragraphs 37, 38 and 39 regarding the release of Hussein Bin Allee- 1 am however, directed to observe that on this and all other points in which he is compelled to withhold his full concurrence in the policy you have adopted, he is well aware that from the necessity which in your ]ulament existed for you acting without instruction? you were placed ,n a situation of much difficulty and delicacy ; and although his own sentiments are decided as to the course which could have been expedient, he is fully sensible that you have been guided in that which you pursued no less by a liberal view of the advantages of your own Crovernment, than by a laudable regard to the interests of humanity. 20. I have now to add the instructions of the Governor in Council in the manner in which Bas-ool-Khyma is to be disposed of; and on the nature aud extent of the force to be permanently stationed in the Persian Gulph. 2h The Governor in Council continues to be of opinion that Ras-ool-Khyma is by no means an eligible place lor the establishment above alluded to, independently of the risk of eucb a possession involving us in the disputes of the continent, the number of troops required to guard it would frustrate the object of its institution, by preventing its sendin- out s ifficient detachments either to attack piratical vessels at sea or to burn them in their 'port^ It may be absolutely necessary to retain possession of it, if it should clearly appear that we are precluded irom holding any island in the Gulph, aud unless you receive satisfactory proof of the existence of an agreement tp that effect, you will be pleased to make over Kas-ool- J^hyma to the Imaum of Mascat, if His Highness should consent to accept it, aud if youPart V-Chap. XXVII. 118 should be of opinion that he will be able to hold it. Should he refuse to receive or be in year judgment unable to defend it, the Governor ia Council is pleased to authorize you to make it over to any of the local Chiefs making use of such a transfer to obtain the consent of as raauy as possible to the modifications in the general treaty which have been suggested in this letter including the prohibition against repairing the forLifications. 22. With regard to the establishment itself the Governor in Council is of opinion that it will perhaps be expedient in the actual state of affairs to frame it on a scale somewhat more extensive than was originally contemplated, so as to enable it to send out numerous armed vessels with strong parties of sepoys to act agiinst piratical vessels as well to render it capable of making occasional descents on any parts of the coasts that may be disposed to recur to piracy ; with this view the Governor in Council has called on the Supenntendeut of Marine to state the number and the nature of the vessels he conceives necessary for this purpose, on which subject also he could be gratified by a communication of your sentiments and those ot Captain Collier. 23. He is also pleased to authorise you to leave such a force as you think necepgary for the above purposes (even if it should exceed the strength originally prescribed of one battalion), and he directs me to suggest, for your consideration, whether the advantage that would result from attaching two or more companies of Europeans to the detachment to be left in the Gu p would be sufficient to compensate for tne difficulty of supplying them and the expense they would occasion. # • i j 24. The arrangements now alluded to, with the impression left by the distinguished ability and success of your military operations, will, the Governor in Council is confident afford the strongest ground for relying on the attainment of the objects contemplated by Government in the suppression of piracy and the restoration of the commerce and tranquillity of the Persian and Arabian shores. 233. The following reply of Major-General Sir 'VV. G. Keir (dated the 11th April 1820) explains 'his view of the points at issue : — lhave the honor to acknowledge the receipt iu Bombay on the 4th instant of your despatches dated the 16th of February. _ f2^ The verv liberal and gratifying manner which has been adopted in expressing t e W LixQ ver y llDer ' u &amp; ^ 5 O p inion of the Governor in Council on the subjects Volume 31-47 of 1820-1826. discussed in my despatch of the 16th January, renders me doubly anxious to offer every elucidation of the line of policy which I pursued when entering into engagements with the Arab tribes in the Gait ot rersia. (6) The leading idea under which I acted in framing both the General and Preliminary Treaties, was found on the knowledge that our future relations with the Gulf of Petsici were to be supported by the presence of an efficient military force, calculated to act in a prompt and vigorous manner on the first manifestation of any attempt to return to pical practices. (4) The next prominent feature in the policy I pursued rested on a distinct understanding that Government wished to abstain as much as possible, consistent with the attainment of the desired object, from interfering with the affairs of the Arabian Continent, (5} In these two ideas the policy I pursued had its origin, and I endeavoured to maintam it as consistently as possible. Whilst I shall ever regret that some of the details of its aypon tion have not met with approbation of the Governor in Council, I feel highly gratified at his most handsome recognition of the motives which induced me to incur a responsibility that a sense of duty called upon me to encounter. ^ (Q) I have already expressed belief that long confirmed habits of cruelty and depredation * u bv a single effort of power nor have my expectations ever been so saa°uine as to Tild^oe me ^ think that p/raey m th e Quit of Persia eould be perma- nenllv suppressed without a watchful care t) destroy the hrst syrnptoms of any return to it I contemplated that the power of doing this was to remain with the British authorities in the Gulf the Governor in Council will therefore perceive that I was not influenced by any ^tract or'theoretical belief in the faith of treaties, or of promises to attain trom practices j i i Viahif- interest and religfion, and that I was not by any means disposed to beyond where^We couU be an afieiant control over them. Whilst I • 1 fW anu measure calculated to secure their reform must have its foundation in power, ^reckoned it legitimate and good policy to betray as little as possible to tn iJ. t faith I therefore suppressed all outward signs of disbelief, nor did I think that our aZllll'JlthcoJi be di,'lushed, or that Mantial benefit could be lost by my do,n 9 m To maintain the suppression of plunder and piracy has been throughout our avowed ^tm Liuation and this is perfectly understood in the GuU, nor does there appear to me any- f^cTin the treaties which have been made that would subject Government to an allegation f \ pi M i of faith or undue interference, were it to make use of its power, in saying to one Thipf we shall not admit of any vessels equipped offensively for war, leaving your poits, or ti tumtTier we forbid you u coLtrnct any fortifieatioa e^eepting snch as may be absolutely „ foT vour proietion against your neighbours. In saymg this, we should o course to support our wmonstrances Itbey wL not attended to ; uotb.ng more conld have Uen done, had articles to this effect been inserted in tba treaties, nor would our intention ofIll Part V-Chap. XXVII acting 1 in this manner been more deeply impressed upon the minds of all concerned than it is at this moment. (8) I state with graat deference that I still conceive the general omission of articles that would be occasionally evaded, whilst the means of maintaining cur will remains, is likely to have a better effect than stipulating for what we were not to demand on all occasions; ai the latter would in some measure impose obligation on ourselves, as well as line of conduct that might at times prove inconvenient and embarrassing. (9) I shall now proceed to a consideration of the additions which the Q-overnor in Council is disposed to introduce into the ' General Treaty.' (10) The capture of the war vessels and dismantling of the forts of the piratical Chiefs has already been reported, but it will be observed that a considerable number of the former were given up, and some of the latter destroyed under the preliminary treaties ; I take the liberty of recurring to these considerations as they are not mentioned a-? ' principal' advantages gained by the present treaty, whilst the promise of the Arab Chiefs to abandon piracy is first pointed out as one of them. The latter stipulation it is true belongs to the General T^'eaty ; ' , , whilst the former is in those that were preliminary, but I have ever reckoned that a consideration of both together was necessary tu the appreciation of the advan tages other of the general or preliminary treaties. (11) The Governor in Council conceives that it would have been desirable to remove all Chiefs concerned in piracv, or likely to afford any countenance to the practice of that enormity; to detain in custody all -such Chiefs as have rendered themselves particularly obnoxiou-' by their practice or countenance of piracy, and had fallen into our hands in the course of our operations together with their piratical adherents, and to set up in their stead inch Chiefs as could be depended on for their discouraging piracy, if no such could be found, to make over the country to the Imaum, to prohibit the tilling out of armed vessels of every description at ports that have been accustomed to practice piracy ; to limit the size of those allowed for commercial purjwses so as to render them easily resisted if applied to piracy; and to stipulate for the right of search and of capturiny all such as should be found to transgress this prohibition. To restrain the exportation from India of timber for building large ships. Prohibiting their (the Arabs) rebuilding their forts and stipulating for the right of landing and destroying any works that they might attempt to raise and others of the same nature. (12) To remove all Chiefs concerned in piracy or likely to afford any countenance to the practice of that enormity must have involved the contingency of my leaving the sea coast iu the event of any chieftain moving into the country as Sultan-bin-Su^ger actually did previous to his signing any treaty. I was restrained from pursuing the contingency mentioned by many considerations, the most immediate, of cours', was the following paragraph in my ins tructions dated the 2/th of October ; ' And you will not fail to bear in mind that excepting in cases of particular emergency neither the troops nor the crews of the ships of war, nor of the Hon^ble Company's cruizers, are meant to be employed at any distance from thence (Russulkbimah) or any other place to which your operations may be directed against any military forces of the piratical States unless their being 1 so employed should be found essentially requisite for the demolition of the piractical vessels and craft which may be in their ports. Sharga Sultan-bin-Sug'ger's chief port, as well as other places, might have been destroyed without entering into any treaty whatever, but it is n t to be supposed that tins chieftain would have voluntarily placed himself in my power and consented to any treaty oi stipulations confirming his own disposition whilst he was at the head of his people, and the desert of Arabia was open to him. I had not any other means to resort to under my positive instructions not to quit the coast, except in that of entering' into recognitions, which I accordinirly did with the view of obtaininfj what must have appeared to the world a strong manifestation of the effects of our previous military operations. 1 had resolved on the destruc tion of the fortifications as well as of the vessels, and I conceived thit greater advantage would be derived from accomplishing this on the footing it is placed by the treaties than by cutting oIt all the friendly communication, and annulling thereby all hopes of future improvement, ncTr did 1 believe that any benefit could arise from the display of our military power in the capture and destruction of fortifications and vessels, whilst we should in all probability have re- embarked under the firj of the very enemy we had beaten, and who must have g-athered confidence from our departure under such circumstances. By treating men and time were saved, and our military power was acknowledged by a peaceable surrender of the maritime loroe ol t id Joasmes, which my ingtructions pointed out to be the object of the expedition, (13) With regard to retaining such Chiefs and their followers as might fall into our hands in the course of our operations, and setting other Chiefs up in their stead, I shall offer the following- considerations. The Hon'ble the Governor in Couneii has pleased to express is approbation of the terms granted to Hassan-bin-Rahma whose case is viewed under peculiai circumstances. The only chieftain and people therefore who may be considered as having fallen into our hands in the course of our operations are Hassan-bin-Ali and his followers. Knowing the peculiar character of this Chieftain, I at first felt disposed to prevent his re-establishment at Zaya although it had been completely destroyed; t lat place and the territory belonging to it was accordingly offered to His Highness nvf- f rn . aam, w ^ 0 declined to accept of it. Here then remained in my possession a^sinirle f am and one hundred and seventy-seven followers. I am not aware of the existence - any Chief that could be depended on to set up in Hassan-bin-Ali's stead; the alternative suggested of offering the territory iu question to the Imaum had been resorted to withoutPart V-Chap. XXVII. 115 success; I consequently followed what appeared to me to be the best course, and released hun and his followers. Had Hassan-bin-Ali been retained, and another person set up in his stead by the British authority, the Chief so created would naturally have looked to us for support and protection ; we should have put him up for our own benefit; but as that advantage would have been immediately lost had any Chief in whom we had no trut-t been pleased to remove him, we should have felt it incumbent upon us to support the person who was in our own interests; any person set up in the room of Hassan-bin-Ali would have been a solitary instance of our interference in the internal affairs of the Arab tribes. If the influence of the person so situ ated had been powerful, he would still have looked to our countenance, if it had been weak he would have required our active support, he would have been our man, and our character would have been committed had we abandoned hira, nor could we have had any further security from him than his promises, but that is of little consequence, as the security remains with ourselves. Hassan-bin-Ali hud promised not to practice plunder and piracy, but he is aware that there is a British force in the Gulfc' for maintaining- this promise in its fullest extent. Our own Chief wmld have promised the same things, but 1 submit that we could not on that account have diminished the force to retain one man. As affairs now stand when our garrison shall be withdrawn from Russulkhiyma^ our political connection with Arabia may cease from that moment, and this I have ever considered to be very great advantage. (14) Had I known any person, or had there been any person in Hassan-bin-Ali's tribe nearly equal in power to that Chieftain and who in the natural course of eveut had succeeded to the Government of the tribe, from Hassan-bin-\li'8 cotifinement, advantage might have been desired from permitting the person who had thus succeeded without our interference, to remain in power, but as far as my information goes no such person appeared. I had one other political inducement to release Hassan-bin-Ali, which was that at the time this measure was carried into effect, he was the person most able as well as willing to maintain some balance in the authority on the coast agains-t Sultan-bin-Sugger. (15) Hassan bin All's followers wore released as I have before observed, under the idea that even their enmity can be productive of no bad consequences at this period, they were suffering much from disease, audi verily believe that we should not have been long burthened with the care of many of them, their deaths whilst under confinement by us would not have created a favourable political impression, which 1 trust their release has. I did not look to their deserts, but I looked to placing the British character in the most advantageous point of view ; this of course not to be done without some sacrificei, if not in reality, at least of opinionj I cannot regret any that 1 have incurred, excepting being deprived of the approbation of the Governor in Council to a measure which appeared to me one that could be pursued with the greatest advantage. (16) I did not prohibit the fitting out of armed vessels of every description at ports that have been accustomed to the practice of piracy as we considered that we always maintain the power of doing so ; which I did not conceive that it was the desire or policy of the British Government to prohibit the use, but only the abuse of such vessels. In disarming a people or in preventing them from defending their persons and property whether hy sea or land, toe may fairly I think be said to charge ourselves with their protection against all who shall attack them unjustly. We are not the sole p &gt;wer in the Gulf of Persia and oar entire repugnance to involve ourselves in the politics of the Gulf is, I believe, maintained, and made still more apparent by our not interfering directly with the quarrels and wars that may arise in it • it was this idea that caused me to discourage the Imaum only by arguments and remonstrances against his attack on Bahrein. I did not mean to interfere actively in this or any other acknowledged war, which was defined in the General Treaty to he that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government. (17) I felt disinclined to limit the size of vessels allowed for commercial purposes as understood that the largest were not by any means the most frequently used piratically ; and as the introduction of commercial habits and ideas much to be desired I was willing to impose as few impediments to their ad-.ption as a sense of safety would permit whilst I hav« everv confidence in the efficacy and practicabiluy of a strict maritime superintendence. The Gulf of Persia is a very small and confined sea, through which information will circulate ranidlv and no act of piracy can in future be committed without early intelligence being received at the British settlement, of where, and by whom, it may have been perpetrated, when immediate steps may be taken to inflict the necessary punishment on such as may offend. # &gt; . (18) The right of search I conceive to be recognized in the obligation to have particular papers. , i. i i • qqx A g any restraint on the exportation from India of timber for building large ships could not be imposed by me, I do not trouble the Government with any observations on that head. • ,i (20) For the reasons given in the 7th paragraph of this letter I conceive that we have everv rieht to prohibit the Arabs from rebuilding their forts, as well as of landing an., destroying any works they may attempt to raise for the purpose of enabling them to carry on ^ (21) The Hon'ble the Governor in Council conceives that a breach of the present freatv exposes him (any Arab Chief) to no consequences which would not have resulted from his niracv had that agreement (the General Treaty) never been entered into. The commis- gion of an act of piracy would place the persons committing it beyond the pale of any treaty, 8 ' Q116 Part V—Chap. XXVII. it is probably therefore of little cousequence in such a case, during what existing treaty such an act may be committed as the punishment of the loss of life and goods mentioned in the general treaty might with every justice be inflicted, and this appears to be the highest punish ment that could be stipulated for in any treaty. (22) The Governor in Council further conceives that it would also be expedient particularly in the event of the consent of the piratical Chiefs being procured to limit the size and crews of their vessels. As I have been led to believe that the mischief to be apprehended from these vessels is not to be estimated in proportion to their size, I am doubt ful whether this stipulation would be productive of a good effect. (23) The Governor-General in Council is desirous of further explanation of the prohi bition in some cases, against the Chiefs sending boats to sea, which he observes is not applied to Hassan bin Rachma and Hassan bin Ali, althouefh the most likely to employ their boats in disturbing the tranquillity of the Gulf. It will be obseived that the preliminary treaties in which this article is inserted were all concluded at Rassulkhima, the object of this article being inserted was to secure to us any vessels that might sail from the piratical forts and take shelter elsewhere before we bad visited them. This stipulation was not in force after we had visited the different places, and destroyed or taken away the vessels given up. It may be right to observe that I am not aware of any vessel having attempted to get away. It was not necessary to interdict the sailing of Hassan bin Rachma and Hassan bin All's vessels, as they had not at that time any in their possession ; such as belonged to the former were captured in Rassnlkhima, but there were not any found in Ramz belonging to the latter. (2!) The Honourable the Governor in Council's cordial approval of the insertion m the general treaty of the article respectiny the renunciation of the slave trade by the Arab tribes induces me to mention an idea which prevails, that a traffic of this nature to a consider able extent is carried on by the subjects of His Highness the Itnaum of Maskat, 234 The Bombay Government (995, dated 7th June 1820) made the following observations on Major Keir's reply :— (2) On the 2nd and 6th paragraphs of your letter, I am instructed to remark that our Page 227 of Volume 31-47 of 1820'1821. power to destroy the first symptoms of any return i , - . » to piracy is limited by our treaty ; since nothing 8 icrt of an infraction of one of its articles would justify our using it, and the Governor in Council cannot but consider such a limitation as a diminution of our actual strength as applicable to the suppression of piracy. 0 (3) It may be inferred from the 7th paragraph of your letter that you conceive us still • ) I- 61 ?'? ^ ri ®i attacking any Chiefs who may be equipping vessels for war, or construct m fortifications beyond what may be absolutely necessary for their protection against their neighbours, but this opinion is not supported by the tenor of our engagements ; beyond breach ^f faith 0 exercise pov v er without subjecting ourselves to the imputation of a (+) On the 8th paragraph of your letter I am directed to remark that the Governor than'f h 'm as . sent 11 t0 J he P^ion that it is better an article should never be enforced than it should occasionally be evaded.

We have an undoubted right to disarm the freebooter whose arms are always used against us, and we are not bound to extend our protection to him even though it were required, which does not in this case appear necessary, the tribes against whom this prohibition was directed being the only ones who practised piracy in the Gulf of Persia. (11) On the 17th paragraph I am directed to observe that though small vessels might be as frequently used for piracy as large ones, they could not be so formidable for our trade, or so able to resist our cruizers. (12) On the 18th and 19th paragraphs the Governor in Council has directed me to remark that it is nowhere explained that the right of search is recognized in the obligation to have particular papers ; and that no restraint can now be imposed on the import of timber consistently with the treaty.118 Part V—Chap.

REMOVAL OF THE BRITISH DETACHMENT FROM RAS-IIL- KHIMA TO THE ISLAND OF KISHM, 1820. (i) (1) QUESTION OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR MAINTAINING SECURITY IN THE GULF (2) QUESTION OF REMOVING OUR RESIDENCY FROM BUSIIIRE AND PROPOSED BRITISH SETTLEMENT IN THE GULF. 235. The attention of the Government having been directed to a consi- Volume 52-49 of 1820'1821. deration of the ultimate arrangements that it might be necessary to make for the purpose of maintaining the security of the navigation of the Persian Gulf on the termination of the expedition, they were desirous of availing themselves of the professional experience of Sir William Keir, and addressed him therefore the following communication on the 28th October 1819 :— f&lt; Thfl attention of the Ri»ht Honourable the Governor in Council having been directed to a consideration of the ulterior arrangement which it may be necessary to form for the purpose of maintaining the security of the navigation of the Gulf, on the termination of the present expedition, is desirous of availing himself of your professional experience in the decision of the important question. The Governor in Council is satisfied that the object thus contemplated cannot, from the distracted state in which the Gulf has so long continued, arising out of the decline of the influence of those authorities which formerly exercised a control over it and of the ascendancy of the Power whose avowed views have been the prosecution of piracy be attained without the interposition of the British Government in a more active degree than it has hitherto been our policy to adopt. As a measure the most effectually conducive to the permanent suppression of piracy on the Persian Gulf, the occupation by the British Government of a central and commanding situation appears to be indispensable; nor is the Governor in Council aware of a more eligible station than the Island of Kishm for that purpose, upon which, however, your oninion is desired. ^ The next object for consideration is the formation of an establishment in the most economical scale, under a prospect of deriving from the customs of the port a revenue Bumcient for its support, which under the arrangement the trade would experience from the British protection might be expected. The transfer of the Residency from Bushire to the new station would supply all that appears to be essential to the political branch of the establishment, and the maintenance of the same number of cruizers and the presence of one of His Majesty's ships of war as have been for some time back kept in the Gulf, would furnish a maritime force without any enhancement of the expense, which has been hitherto increased for the security of its navi gation. Tlie factory was originally established at Bushire to promote the vend of British o-oods in the interior of Persia by large consignments from Bombay. The more successful mode how ever in which the vend has been promoted within these few years back by periodical sale at the Kesuieney nas entirely superseded the necessity for continuing a commercial factory at Bushire • *if whatever advantages may be connected with our possessing an establishment m the lersian dominions, independently of that which is maintained by His Maiestv's Government at Tehran for the protection of the commercial interest of this country and for preserving the political relations which have for so long a period subsisted between the Indian and tlie Persian Governments, could he secured more effectually probably at such an Island at Ktshm as at Bushire. The only additional expense there to which the British Government would be exposed by the transfer of the Bushire Residency to a more commanding situation in the Gulf would arise only of the military establishment which it would be necessary to maintain either at Kishm or any other station which you may prefer. Your opinion is therefore desired on the extent of torce it may be necessary to keep in the Gulf, in the formation of which you will not fail to hear in mind that our security will principally depend, the more especially if an JiJaiia be selected for the new establishment upon our maritime force.Part V-Chap. XXVIII. 119 The Governor in Council is also desirous ofr^oeivlnsf your opinions upon the practicability of increasing the requisite control in the Gulf of Persia hy the establishment merely of * factory in the Island of Kishm or any other more central station upon the same scale ai exists at Bushire and under the participation of such privileges in the imports and exports of merchandize in British bottoms and of a share of the customs as may be necessary to compen sate us in some degree for the expense we shall incur in the maintenance of a maritime force in the Gulf, in preference to the occupation of the whole of that or of any other island in full sovereignty. The Governor in Council if also anxious to receive such suggestions as you may have to offer for the promulgation of a code of maritime regulations to be observed by the different tribes in the Gulf to enable the British cruizers to discriminate the one from the other, imposing restrictions in the equipment of their boats, and an obligation in them to admit our cruizers into their different ports and to search all vessels for the purpose of guarding against any of them being equipped for warlike purposes; and how far in your opinion the different petty States may be induced to acquiesce in such an arrangement under a clear under standing that our object is limited to the suppression of piracy and to re-establishment of a force and secure commercial intercourse between the different parts in the Gulf and those of India. It is understood that the Island of Kishm, as well as Angar which is contiguous to it, belongs in full sovereignty to the Imam of Maskat and should the reports that may be received from you and the other persons to whom the consideration of thi-? important subject has been confided be favourable to the measure now sugijestel, the necessary negotiation will be opened for obtaining possession of the spot that may be fixed upon for forming the establishment.' 235 A. The report of Sir William Grant Keir, dated 1st April 1820, on the points raised by the Bombay Government Volume 31—47 of 1820-1821, page 91. is a very interesting one and is quoted at length below :— The intention of removing the British factory from Bushire expected in your letter of the 28th of October last, induces me most respectfully to submit to the Honorable the Governor in Council a few considerations which have occurred to me after visiting that place. 2. It appears that on the removal of the British factory from Gomberoon to Bushire in the year 1762, the last mentioned place was an insignificant fishing village, and that it commenced to rise rapidly to its present state of prosperity from the period of that removal; it may, therefore, be fairly presumed that the presence of the British Factory hy affording protection } and inspiring cQnfidence, is the sole occasion of the flourishing condi tion of Bushire; for we may look in vain for any other adequate cause either in its internal Government, or in the Government of Persia to which it owns allegiance. 3. The British Government has, I understand, derived important advantages from the establishment of a considerable import and export trade to and from Bushire; in deriving these advantages it has induced many respectable merchants to settle at the place, and to remove to it property to a considerable amount, which occasioned the opening of an extensive trade with the interior of Persia by a new route. All this evinces a most gratifying faith in British protection, and a confidence has doubtless arisen that it will not be withdrawn without warning, and affording time for securing or removing without any considerable loss, valuable propertv that is risked under a pledge which may reasonably be implied, where benefits are reciprocal between a Government and individuals, who, by certain circumstances, controlled by that Government, have been induced to hazard their persons and effects in the territory of a State that is little aware of the advantages to be derived from affording protection to commerce, and security to property of all descriptions. 4. The Government are, I presume, possessed of the means of ascertaining readily whether the views now taken be correct; if they be, we may infer that much advantage would be derived, by affording time and opportunity for a trade established under British auspices, to take a new and natural course before removing the protection of a factory under which it grew up. The establishment of a British settlement in the Gulf of Persia will naturally attract this trade, whilst that of Bushire will in probability decline, from the removal of affluent individuals with their property to our more enlightened Government, which will be calculated to diffuse commercial benefits by many new sources. 5. These considerations induce me respectfully to recommend that the factory at Bushire may not be removed before the general trade to that place shall have fallen naturally into the course it will in all probability take, soon after the establishment of a British settle- ment in the Gulf of Persia. 6. Having received an intimation from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at the Court of Persia that he conceived addresses from me ' to the Shah, and Sudr Azam, would be productive of a good effect.' I trust that the Governor in Council will approve of my having transmitted through Mr, Willock the communications of which the accompanying are drafts, I forward likewise a copy of my letter to Mr, Willock on this occasion. 7. Whilst at Bushire I received from His Royal Highness the Prince of Sliiraz a communication of which I forward a translation as well as a draft of my reply. As connected with these letters I also transmit the translation of a communication from Rama bin Jauber: «. to this I have not made any reply as I have not been favoured by the receipt of any instructions since the reference made respecting that person in the l4th paragraph of my despatch of the 25th of February,120 Part V—Chap. XXVIII. 8. The accompanying is a translation of a letter from His Highness the Imam of Maekat; a translation of his proposed agreement with the Utubis of Bahrein alluded to in his letter is also transmitted, as well as a copy of my reply to His Highness. 9. I now beg to refer to the letter from the Imam which accompanied ray despatch of the 24th of February as well as to the remarks in the 15th, 16th and 17th paragraphs of that despatch. The difference in the tone of His Highness's communication now forwarded, and the profession of his great desire 'to act in strict conformity to my wishes' was probably occasioned by his distrusting, not without reason certainly, the professions of the Prince of Shiraz respecting His Royal Highness's army being about to aid in the Bahrein expedition. The preparations for this ezpediiion have, for these last two or three years, been made use of by the Prince of Shiraz, as an excuse for levying exactions of a most oppressive nature from many of the Sheikhs and other inhabitants of the Persian coast of the Gulf, by which much distress has been occasioned and the minds of all kept in a most harassing state of alarm and doubt; this has interrupted all the industrious pursuits that under due encouragement would tend materially to maintain the peace of the Gulf. It is, therefore, much to be desired that some decided steps should be taken to set the conflicting claims against the Utubis of Bahrein permanently at rest, 10. By the latest accounts received the day before I left Busbire, the Prince of Shiraz had left the sea coast, and was on his return to Shiraz, having, I understood, intimated that he had abandoned all intention of proceeding this year against Bahrein. The Imam of Maskat, who had reached the Island of Kism with his ships and boats, in conformity to his agreement with the Prince, will thus again have been deceived by His Royal Highness, who appears to have a mean opinion of the Imam's penetration and judgment, and 1 understand that the Shiraz Government calculates upon deceiving the Imam at all times when it may be convenient for it to do so. The Imam will probably return to Maskat without being able to effect anythinsr decisive against the Bahrein Government; this will, I trust, afford time for urging the mediation contemplated in the Honourable the Governor's letter of the 15th of December to Mr. Willock. 11. As connected with this subject I transmit a translation of a communication made to the Sheikhs of Bahrein according to the spirit of the despatch of the Governor iu Council to the Governor-General, dated the 15th of December, and I beg leave to state that the ratification of these Sheikhs has been received to the preliminary treaty mentioned in the 14th paragraph of my despatch of the 7th of February, as having been entered iuto by their Vakil. Their ratification of the ' General Treaty with the Arab tribes' extended to them at the same time has also been received. 12. I now transmit one of the original copies of the ' General Treaty ' having the autograph signatures of the different Chieftains. As the Chieftains of Imam and Am-ul- Gywyn appeared to enjoy a certain degree of independence of Sultan bin Sagger, I conceived that advantage might be derived from associating them by name in the General Treaty, and this was done accordingly. 13. His Majesty's ship Liverpool was at Ras-ul-khima for a few hours on the 25th ultimo, and I then received a report of which the accompanying is a copy from Captain Thompson, The Governor in Council will derive satisfaction from the favourable accounts it contains of the state of that garrison, although the difficulty of procuring good water may be reckoned a serious evil. li. The very voluminous proceedings of a Committee assembled by Captain Thompson are before me, and from them the following inferences may be drawn. No good water is pro curable within the Fort of Ras-ul-khima, and the nearest that is drinkable is at the distance of 2 miles, but even that water becomes putrid and unfit for use at the end of fifteen days. In the event of the country becoming hostile extreme inconvenience must naturally arise from this want of water, the only mode of remedying which is to have a considerable supply stored up iu proper vessels. It will be observed from the accompanyin? copy of a letter that the Commandant is particularly urgent on this point, and is very anxious that a stock sufficient for three months should be laid in, as this is the period calculated in which relief might be obtained from Bombay in case of the wells being occupied by an enemy with an overpowering force, but I cannot consider so large a supply to be absolutely necessary, as it appears to me that water could, so long as our cruizers are maintained in the Gulf, be procured at any time of the year from Kishm, the Persian Coast, or Maskat, in a period not exceeding one month, and much sooner unless in cases of extreme bad or calm weather, yet as it must ever be advisable that a garrison should be prepared against emergencies, I most strongly recommend that immediate steps be taken for affording the garrison of Ras-ul- khima the means of keeping in store either in tanks or casks, a sufficiency of water for one month. The accompanying sketch of a calculation shews the quantity of water that the garrison have now vessels to contain, as well as the balance to complete one month's supply for which tanks or casks are required ; with these vessels our establishment of the cruizers should be sent, and I conceive that great advantage in point of time, the saving of which is certainly a great object, would be derived by sending the tanks or casks from Bombay full of water, as considerable difficulty, as well as delay, would be experienced in filling so large a quantity of water in the Gulf of Persia, 15, With the view of placing the troops at Ras-sul-khima beyond all immediate chance of being distressed for water, Captain Thompson, it will be perceived, has requested Captain Bruce, the Resident at Bushire, to send from that place a supply of about threep art V-Chap. XXVIII. 121 hundred tons, but I do not think that this can he done, with advantage, or even that it can be done at all ; from the want of means of containing' so larg-e a quantity. 16. I am aware of the great comfort and consolation that the sepoys at Ras-ul-khima would derive from the presence of their families, an indulgence whioli I am convinced the Government feel disposed to grant, but under the conceived possible want of water, I am induced, however unwilling, to recommend that the families may not yet be permitted to proceed, unless Government should be pleased to send a further supply of water for their eventual use. 17. The Government will perceive that these recommendations and remarks are offered under the idea that Rus-ul-khima will not immediately be given up, but it is right for me to state that I do not perceive any advantages sufficiently strong to induce me to wish that it should be retained longer than the period which Government may determine as fitting for the removal of our troops to some other place in the Gulf. I have already most strongly recommended that the eventual removal should he to the Island of Kishm, all that I have learnt since offering that recommendation, has tended to confirm my opinion of that island being the most favourable situation in every respect, and if no other considerations existed than those of political expediency, I should be disposed to urge that the removal should take place immediately. 18. Not the smallest doubt need be entertained respecting the result of my attack that the Arabs can make on Ras-ul-khima, yet the possibility of such an occurrence ought not altogether to be lost sight of. The chief consideration that would induce me to deprecate such an event is the necessity that would consequently be imposed upon us of retaining that place until the impression that would be made by any attack should be worn off, that we might avoid the imputation of being driven out which the Arabs would naturally conceive had been the case, did we retire before due time had elapsed. 19. Captain Thompson 's report mentions particularly the growing ascendancy of Sultan- bin-Sagger; the result of this will probably be the establishment of that Chieftain's power over a considerable portion of the Arabian Coast. There is one direct inference to be drawn from this ascendancy which is that the Chieftains on the portion of the const alluded to have lost much of their religious feature, for Sultan has abjured Wahabism although many who willingly acknowledge his superiority still profess that faith, which appears to be geverally on the decline, and is now hardly acknowledged on the Versian side of the Gulf. On the Arabian Coast Hussen-bin-Ali of Zyak, is, 1 believe, the only Chieftain who still professes W ahabism j although old he preserves his enthusiasm, and may certainly be considered a man of penetration and even of some talent which occasioned him to be appointed by the Imam of the Wababis to receive from the Joasmi tribe the tribute payable to the general treasury by the followers of Wahab. Until lately it apptared probable that Hussen- bin -Ali would have been able to maintain himself as a powerful rival to Sultan-bin-Sagger, but that expectation must now, I conceive, be abandoned, as none of the Chieftains seem to coalesce with Hussen-bin-Ali with the exception of Cuzuk-bin-Ahmed, a person of little political consideration. We may, therefore, I think calculate upon the ascendancy of Sultan- bin-Sagger, and it is with him that we shall in all probability have to negociate the transfer of Kas-ul-khima, for its former Chieftain Hussen-bin-Rackma appears to have rendered himself entirely subservient to Sultan, 20. The expression made throughout the Gulf by the complete success of the expedi tion is palpably very great, and must, whilst it is maintained, produce the most beneficial consequences; such decidedly favourable opportunities for manifesting our superiority are not likely to occur again ; we should therefore be careful not to run the risk of weakening the ascendancy we have acquired ; this consideration points particularly to the advisableness of abstaining generally from any active interference with the transactions on the Arabian Continent, 21. It has hitherto been usual for both cruisers and merchant ships proceeding up or down the Gulf to sail along the Persian Coast only; this practice may now be abandoned whenever it may be convenient to do so. But to enable our vessels to approach the Arabian Coast with safety, a circumstance absolutely necessary to secure the permanent suppression of piracy, a minute and accurate survey of that coast should be immediately undertaken. Our knowledge of many parts of the Gulf is extremely imperfect, and even the number of the islands adjacent to the Arabian Coast is unknown. 22. It is extremely advisable at this particular crisis whilst the minds of many in the Gulf still remain unsettled, that as many of out cruisers as can be spared, should be seen frequently both on the Arabian and Persian shores, we should approach them in as friendly and conciliatory a manner as possible, prepared of course at all times to put down the very first manifestations of any return to piratical pursuits, but as treaties now exist with all the independent tribes on the coast, and there is a British settlement at an inconsiderable distance from every part of the Gulf, it is particularly desirable that all vessels captured iu the actual commission, under an allegation, or detained from suspicion of piracy, should, unless ily cases of extreme necessity, be sent into a British port to be condemned, previous to being destroyed.122 Part V-Chap. XXVIII. (II) REMOVAL OF THE DETACHMENT TO THE ISLAND OF RISHM WITH THB EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION OF THE IMAM OF MASK AT. 236 The Governor in Council having determined on the removal of the garrison from llas-ul-Khitna, Captain Volume 26-51 of 1821. Thopmson, commanding at that place, was directed to make over the place to Sultaa -bm-Saggar or to whatever chieftain ho should think best calculated to fulfil the wishes of Government T is marks were to be destroyed previously to the place being made over to the Arabs. The garrison was to be removed to the Island of Kishm to the occupa tion of which the consent of the Imam of Maskat was to be obtained, if not already conceded (letter, dated 17th April 1820). With this letter was enclosed a letter to the Imam from the Governor. 237 On the 15th May 1820, Captain Thompson reported that he had des patched 'the Mercury with the Governor's letter to the Imam and also his own letter to His Highness for the purpose of obtaining his consent to the occupa tion of the Island of Kishm. In his letter, dated the 29th May, Captain Thompson reported that the Mercury had returned on that date from Maskat hearinq the Ml consent of the Imam to the removal of the troops to Kishm and an open letter to the Sheikh of that island directing him every assistance to the enibarhation and conveyance of the troops. 238. The following is translation of the Imam's letter to the Governor Volume 10-18 of 1821. ^ om bay : With regard to the observations made by you, connected with the removal of the troops from Ras-ul-Khima to Kishm, God knows that the island in question and all other territories appertaining to me, and subject to my authority, appertain also to the Honourable Companv, and that I do not reckon these dominions as appertaining to me, but as appertaining to the Honourable Company. On the receipt a short time ago of an application from the respectable Captain Thompson, I immediately despatched two of my vessels, that is the Caroline and to him, and they are at present in his employ. I also sent the most positive orders to the port of Kishm, that he should be furnished with such supplies and boats as might be necessary so as to obviate all delay in the embarkation and removal of the troops, and God willing, I shall never be back ward in any service which I can render Government. You may also rest assured that I am steadfast in my friendship, and that my attachment is unshaken. As to your observations in relation to Ras-ul-Khima, can I say otherwise than that your determination is founded upon the best policy, and with regard to any services that can be rendered you in my possession, which appertain to the Honourable Company, I look for wan! to notice from you to that effect for there is no distinction or separation between us. I continue steadily to pursue, under the existing close connection, that friendly line of conduct which befits allies. I trust in God that the same will be maintained in all time to come,' 239. In leaving Ras -ul-Khima, Captain Thompson tried to obtain the con sent of Sultan -bin-Saggar to a modification of Sir W', Grant Keir's treaty on the lines suggested in the Bombay Government's letter, dated 16th February 1820, above quoted as a quid pro quo for the restoration of the place to the Chief, but to this Sultan -bin-Saggar would not assent. The Sheikh would not also agree to receive back the place if its fortifications were demolished. The instructions of the Government of India were however positive on the point and almost all the buildings of the place, which were in a greater or less degree fortifications, were destroyed and the place entirely evacuted by the British troops on 18th July 1820. The detachment arrived in the town of Kishm on the 20th or the 239A. In reporting these proceedings in his letter, dated 9th August 1820, Captain Thompson proposed the early removal of the detachment to Deristan opposite the Island of Henjam, as being a more healthy station and also more conveniently situated for watching the Pirate Coast. Preparations were therefore made for the reception of the troops at Deristan and particularly for the accommodation of the sick. These proceedings were approved by the Government of Bombay in their letter No. 1389, dated 12tb September 1820.^z] Part V—Chap. XXVIII. 123 (iii) PERSIAN PROTESTS TO THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF THE ISLAND OF KISim. 240. The Persian Government were not very much pleased with the British proceedings in the Persian Gulf and by no nf Str i&lt;Sn nry v Y 111 ™}. fofi' 1 10th means welcomed the idea of the British May 1S20. 1 olume ol-i7 oj n -,r- -x occupation or Kisnm or any other island on the Gulf. His Persian Majesty would not even give an audience to the British Charge d.'Affaires, Sir Henry Willock, and communicated his instructions in the matter of the British proposal to ocoupy an island on the Persian Gulf and other proposals, mentioned in the Bombay Government despatch quoted above, through his ministers, 241. On the 6th May 1820, Sir Henry Willock was called to a conference and was informed that Uis Persian Majesty having learnt the nature of the proposals laid before his ministers, had instructed them to reply that with regard to the cession of an island in the Persian Gulf, a similar wish had been advanced many * years before, and His Majesty had not listened to the propo sition; it was the point of tlie utmost importance, and it such a request was made, it ought to originate either from His Britannic Majesty, the Honour able East India Company, or His Excellency the Governor-General of India. His Persian Majesty was not aware that ISir Henry was invested with powers to treat on such weighty matters; he had been accredited to His Persian Majesty's court as His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, and as such only His Persian Majesty recognised him. 242. His Persian Majesty's Ambassador at London had announced the intention of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent to send an Ambassador to the court of Persia, and it seemed advisable on all accounts that the discussion of this subject should be deferred until the arrival of the expected minister. His Majesty was surprised that the Imam of Maskat should claim the sovereignty of the Island of Kishm. It was contended that the Imam held the Government of Gambrum and of its dependencies, of which Kism was one under the supreme authority of the sovereign of Persia, and the records of the Empire would establish this fact. 243. As His Majesty derived all information regarding the province of Pars and the Islands of the Gulf from the Prince Governor and undertook no political measure without previously consulting His Royal Highness, he wished that advices must be received from Shiraz, before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein tributary to Persia, could be accepted. As it was the earnest desire of His Persian Majesty that tranquillity and security should be permanently established in the Gulf of Persia, His Majesty w r as ready to adopt any measure conducive to the attainment of that desired object, and orders would be issued to His Eoyal Highness the Prince of Ears to establish regulations at the Persian ports similar to those which had been acceded to by the Arabian Chiefs, and to establish a distinguishing flag to be carried by all vessels belonging to His Persian Majesty's subjects. 244. The Shah did not approve of the Persian coast being visited by English boats for the purpose of checking the outfit of armed vessels, or any control being exercised by foreign officers over the parts subject to His Majesty; but with a view of effecting the former object, His Royal Highness Hussein Ali Mirza would be instructed to appoint a Darogha or inspecting officer of ports, whose duty would be to pay a monthly visit to the different Persian ports, and who will be invested with authority to put a stop to all preparations or measures which betray a tendency to the pursuit of piracy. His Boyal Highness the Prince Governor of Ears would also be instructed to remove from his Government the Sheikh of the port of Charrak in compliance with the wishes of the British Government. 245. Such were the only points of concession Sir Henry was able to obtain. It was the fixed determination of the Shah not to cede the possession of an island, either permanently or temporarily, and Sir Henry thought that to have urged the subject would at once have been unproductive of any benefit, and • Note.'—This was when Captain Malcolm went on his first mission to Persia in 1800-1801.124 Part V—Chap. XXVIII might have closed the door to future negotiation, which could he _ renewed with better prospect of success by the expected minister to the Persian court, particularly if he was authorized to grant any favour to His Persian Majesty, 246. The great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His Majesty not immediately accepting the Hritish mediation to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which be so ardently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be ditlicult ol attainment, fiom the already advanced state of the negotiations between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Maskat: His Majesty appears to have declined accepting the mediation of the British Government from the dread that such good offices would only be exerted under the expectation of obtaining the cession of an island. In their despatch to Sir Henry Willock, No. 1485, dated 3rd October ^ r100n 1820, the Bombay Government stated - Volume 31-47 of 1820. 5 ^ (2) You will no doubt have been made acquainted with the evacuation of Bas-ual-Khima hy the British detachment on the 18th of July, and o/ the establishment of the British dttach- ment at Deristan oi Kislim, a measure which the Briiish (-ioverument would gladly have avoided if the revival of piracy could have been checked by any other means. (3) I have already had the honour of inf Tming you that any claims which Persia might possess to the sovereignty of the Island of Kishm, would receive the most candid consideratioa from the Government, but I do not conceive it politic on our part to renew the discussion ; should any proofs of its claim be produced by the Government &lt;?/ I would suggest your referring them to this Government, and should hope tliat duiing the period that must be occupied by Ihe requisite investigation the King of Hernia will have leisure to observe the good effects arising Irom our occupation of this land ; and be induced to consent to our retain- ino- it, even if he should establish his ri^ht to demand its evacuation. (4) You will be pleased to avail yourself of the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government that as our views are exclusively limited to ihe extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, ' in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation wt formerly offered between His Majesty and the Utubis of Bahrein. (5) Permit me to offer you the acknowledgments of this Government for the ready and cordial disposition which you have manifested in promoting its views in the prosecution of the expedition against the Joasmi Pirates. I was fully sensible of the inveterate jealoupy of the Government to which you are accredited, and o£ the consequent difficulty of the office which, you were requested to undertake, and I entertain every hope that as no circumstance has yet arisen from our occupation of Kishm, calculated in any degice toaffoid grounds of just alarm to the Persian Government, you may be able to allay any feelings of jealousy which may display themselves until they gradually subside in a confidence in the moderation of our views. (6) I avail myself of this opportunity of informing you with the views of guarding against any misrepreseiitation that may be circulated on the occasion, that measures are in progress for conveying a battalion of Native Infantry of 800 rank and file for the pur pose of relieving the troops in the Gulf. The transports which convey the foimer will imme diately return with the latter. 247. In his despatch, dated 20th December 1820, Sir Henry Willock reported to the Government of India that several of the principal officers of Pars had reached the Capital, the occasion of their mission being to report on the occupation of a part of the Island of Volume 31-47 of 1820-1821. Kishm by the British detachment from Ras-ul-Khima; and this event had been represented so pregnant with mischief and dangerous consequences that the Prince Governor of Pars availing him self of the timid character of the Snah strongly urged the necessity of strength ening the frontier on the coast, and of conciliating the people of the Dashis- tan by a remission of a considerable part of the tribute they have been accus tomed to pay. 248. These representations were attended with the effect desired by the Shiraz Government, and the Persian Ministers demanded in the strongest terms the immediate departure of the British detachment ftom Kishm, which island was claimed by the Persian Government. The Persian Minister pre sented to Sir Henry a note, dated 9th December 1820, strongly remonstrating against the British proceedings. In consequence of an opinion which prevailed that only by their own Agency everything was to be effected, the Shah'sPart V—Chap. XXVIII. 1.25 Goreriiment had at first determined to send a person to Kishm to order the troops away; and an Agent to India to remonstrate against the occupation of that island. Sir Henry succeeded in averting both these designs ; the tirst, m bis opinion! could not have been productive of the end contemplated by the Persian Government, and the second would have embarrassed the Hon ble Governor of Bombay. 249 A prominent feature in the note of the Persian Ministers was a desire to interpret the stipulations of the llth Article of the Treaty of 1814 to a general prohibition against British ships of war entering Persian ports without express permission. Sir Henry opposed this intent, but the Persian Government persisted in their contention. The following is a translation of the note presented by the Persian Ministers on 9th December 18-0 ; At a former period when His Majesty's Charged' Affaires and the Hoa'ble East India Company's A-ent^ in consequence of an article of the Treaty which provides that British ships of war shall not enter Persian ports without permission oi the Persian Government, asked this favour for the purpose of punishing the Joasrais j as these people have molested tha gubjects of both States, and particularly persons couoerned in the trade with India, tais per- miision was granted. . . r His Maiesty's Charge d' Affaires likewise stated that after punishment of the Joasmis, if rcnnId be necesearv still to keep some British troops in the Persian buU to prevent a recurrence of piracy, and that the Imam of Maskat (who on that part of Pers.a is the Governor of Bander Abbas and its dependencies) was willing to allow of a B r i tish Settlement on the V- Island of Kishm or Henjarn; to this was answered, that first Maskat is a dependency of ^ Per a and as the Imam has not the power of permitting the residence of British troops at Mask at? much less can he grant a permission at Kishm and Henjam which are dependencies of Bandar Abbas. If any further steps are necessary to check piracy in the Peisian Gulf, thcan effectually be taken by the Prince of Fars and no foreign aid is requisite. And at thfa time when the friendship between our States is so perfect, if any assistance should be Taonired to preserve the tranquillity on the seas so desirable to both States, no dou )t the British Government will readily afford it, when by the co-operation of the Prmce of b nraz e obiects will be readily effected. Atthis time we have heard that a British force has landed at Kishm Although our o tatps are as one, and no differences exist between us, yet, as has been before observed the ct-ifp of affairs does not require the presence of British troops, and now that the Joasmis are nWlnpd His Boval Highness the Prince of Fars will use his utmost endeavours in preserving the security of the Persian Gulf, and if ships of war are necessary for this purpose, orders will be given for their outfit. We do not know on what account the troops from India have settled i 11 ^ 10 Persian Gulf. In short orders will be issued by His Majesty to His Royal Highness the Prince of l^ars to (»nd a person to the troops on Kishm desiring them immediately to leave it, and we now TPnnest His Maiesty's Char-e d J Affaires to direct the officer Commanding at Kishm to return ^ to India with his troops and to write to the Hon 'ble the Governor of Bombay or to w! , te er it m-vv be necessary, in future to avoid such acts whioh are contrary to the spiut of the Tieaty between our two States. He has even offended against the interests of his own Government, f„r although Mr. Bruce was acquainted that at the request of the Imam an expedition had been fitted out for the punishment of the people of Bahrein, and that His Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz had undertaken this scheme, he went to Bahrein. 250-266. The following minute was recorded by Sir Monstuart Elphinstone on this correspondence The Kino- of Persia's claim to Kishm does not nppear to be strengthened by his present arguments, hut on the contrary to be weakened by His Majesty's Minister making it in part depend on his sovereignty over Maskat, a pretension which seems to be entirely untenable. The Kinsr of Persia's alarm at our occupation of Kishm appears however, to be seiiong and unfeigned, and on this ground the Hon'hle the Governor would be disposed to give up the measure if it were not one of urgent necessity. It is believed also that the British Government has in some measure countenanced the ^ Maim of the Kin^ of Persia to Kislim by requesting fi.om His Majesty m the year 1799 the tllnofthat hland. The application seems n..t to have origmated ... an erroneous notion rf Hi' Majesty's rights, but it ought to make this Government more delieate in its conduct ^ ^oTthe other hand, all the officers.

XXVIII. the King of Persia as Kis/im : the question therefore is, whether we are to submit to the evils formerly suffered irom the Joasmis, or to give offence to the Kiug of Persia. Judging the question on its own merits the Hon'ble the Governor would not hesitate to decide against permitting a renewal of piracy. The effects of His Majesty's displeasure are very unlikely to lead to open war, and it is understood to be the recorded opinion of Sir John Malcolm, the best authority on euch a sub ject, that the possession of an island near the shore of Persia would be more likely to fix the King in the British interests than to drive hitn into hostilities. But this is perhaps a confined view of the case, and it may probably be the policy of His Majesty's Ministers to avoid giving any umbrage to Persia in any case where it can possibly be avoided, it will rest with His Excellency the Governor-General to decide that question, and, in the meantime. General Smith should be requested to give his ojtinion whether any place on the Arabian Coast would answer for checking piracy in the manner designed from Kishm, without being exposed to the risk of attacks from the neighbouring Arabs, and with out necessarily involving the British Government in the transactions of those tribes. With regard to the charges against Captain Bruce, it is almost impossible to reply to them without documents to refer to, but the following are the observations that occur to the Hon'ble the Governor. The object of the British Government was to preserve the peace of the Gulf, as it was owing to the wars among the Powers who inhabit in its shores that the growth of piracy was encouraged. It therefore applied its whole attention to bring about a reconciliation between the Imam of Maakat and the Utubis of Bahrein ; at the same time it offered its mediation to prevent hostilities against Bahrein on the part of the King of Persia, and even to procure the latter a tribute rather than allow of war. The proceedings were so far from inconsistent with each other that they sprang naturally from the same source, a desire to preserve the peace of the Gulf: at all events, the mediation between the Imam and the Utubis was the avowed act of the Government of Bombay, and is in no respect imputable to Captain Bruce. The capture of the Linga boats was the act of the officers of His Majesty's Navy, even whom Captain Bruce had not the least control. Tue destruction of them was however the consequence of their osvn imprudent intercourse with the Joasmis. The Hon'ble the Governor thinks he formerly proposed that the people of Linga should be indemnified for their losses and that orders were issued accordingly, if such was not the case it would be advisable to ascertain where the discussion stopped. The Hon'ble the Governor has no recollection of the affair of Charrack, but he does not remember any transaction in which blame was imputable to Captain Bruce. It is hoped that these facts and such additional ones as the records may furnish, will enable Captain Willock to convince the King of Persia of Captain Bruce's perfect freedom from all offence against His Majesty ; should His Majesty obstinately insist on his removal, Captain Willock can inform this Government and await a further reply. In such an event as is above alluded to, the Hon'ble the Governor would not hesitate to recall Captain Bruce, as it is evident that nothing is more likely to prevent harmony and confidence, than the employment of an obnoxious Agent; but Government would, in his opinion, be bound to prevent that gentleman suffering the smallest loss, either of money or credit by his recall. If he be permitted to be . . . . .in any respect a loser, no British Agent will venture to assert the interests, or even obey the orders of his own Government, when his doing so is likely to draw on himself the enmity of the Court to which he is accredited. The Hon'ble the Governor recommends that these remarks be communicated to the Supreme Government, and Captain Willock, in the meantime, might be acquainted for the purpose of informing the King of Persia, that His Majesty's message had been transmitted to His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council, who will not fail to give the fullest consideration to any just claims of His Majesty. Captain Willock will no doubt, with his usual zeal for all branches of the public interest, seize every opportunity of impressing on the Court of Tehran the absolute necessity of a station such as Kishm to keep down piracy and its perfect harmlessness in reference to the dominions of Persia. Action was taken by the Bombay Government accordingly. % &lt;iv) ORIGIN OF MASKAT'S TITLE TO THE KISHM AND OIUIUZ ISLANDS AND BUNDER ABBAS, ETC. 257. The following report, dated 14th August 1821, of Dr. Jukes, Political Agent, Kishm, as to the origin of the Volume 26-61 rage m. connection of the Imams of Maskat with Kishm, Ormuz, Bunder Abbas, and other parts of the Persian Coast near that place, will be read with interest:— The Persian Ministers having expressed their dissatisfaction at the small detachment of British troops being stationed on the Island of Kishm, and considering that it was likely toPart V—Chap. XXVIII. 127 become a subject of future discussion between myself and the Persian Government^ I have lost no opportunity of obtaining every information I could collect from the best authorities, as to the sovereignty of the island, both at Maskat and Kishno, and although the informa tion I have obtained is not so complete and satisfactory as I could wish, I beg leave respect fully to submit it to the consideration of the Honourable the Governor in Council, 2. The Bini Maainee tribe orginallv resided at Koong on the Persian Coast, and it is now about 70 or 80 years since Shaik Abdulla Maainee took the Island of Kishm from Mulla Aly Shah, who was then Chief of the Island, on behalf of the Persian Government j and Shaikh Abdulla afterwards farmed Bunder Abassee and its dependencies from Nadir Shah, 3. The Bini Maainee tribe remained in possession of the island for many years, and after Nadir Shah's death, continued to pay tribute to the present reigning family of Persia, for Bunder Abassee and its dependencies which they still retained. 4. About 26 or 27 years ago the inhabitants of Kishm, being dissatisfied with the tyrannical system adopted towards them by Mulla Hussan Maainee, their Chief and Governor, solicited His Highness Syed Sultan, the Imam of Maskat, to take the Islands under his government and control; the Imam proceeded accordingly with an army, and by torce of arms took possession of the Islands of Kishm, Bunder Abassee and Ormuz, from Mul!a Hussein, and it has ever since remained under the general control of the Imam of Maskat. 5. Syed Sultan, notwithstanding he had taken these places by force of arms from Mulla Hussein Maainee, continued to farm Bunder Abassee, and its dependencies from the Persian Government, as the Bini Maainee tribe had done before him, and his son Syed Saeed, the present Imam of Maskat, continues to do the same ; he pays four thousand Tomans annually for the town and dependencies of Bunder Abassee, including Meena Humeel and Khumeer. Syfe bin Mubhaun, an Arab Cbieftain, is at present Governor of Bunder Abassee on the part of His Highness the Imam, and his younger brother is the Governor of Ormuz. Shaikh Abdul Rahman Maainee, the Governor of Kishm, is related to His Highness by marriage, so that the Government of all the principal places farmed by the Imam of Maskat is entirely in the hands of the Arabs at present, and I do not know whether the Persian Government would venture to risk the attempt of taking these places forcibly from them, under any circumstances, but as the Imam has several ships, and could command the sources of a great number of buggalas and boats belonging to the different Arab tribes in the Gulf, it is almost certain, I think, that the Imam would be able to retain the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak, in spite of every exertion of the Persian Government. 6. The whole of the Persian shore of the Gulf is in the possession of different Arab tribes ; and though they may have little differences and quarrels among themselves, they would cordially unite to repel any attack the Persians might make to accept or subdue any one of them. 7. It is quite impossible that the Arab tribes and the Persians can ever cordially blend their interests and act in concert together. The habits of the people are very different, the independence of an Arab Shaikh submits reluctantly to the Persian yoke, and the difference of religious feeling effectually prevents anything like a cordial co-operation between them. 8. I regret extremely that neither at Maskat nor at Kishm, have I been able to obtain a sight of one of the old Persian Furmauns by which His Highness the Imam farm* Bunder Abassee from the sovereign of Persia, in order to ascertain what places are particularly specified, as constituting its dependencies. I think it unlikely that such an important document as the g&gt;ant, or Furmaun of the King of Persia, by which His Highness the Imam, farms so large a portion of territory and for which he pays 4,000 Tomauns annually should not be in existence; it is possible it might have been mislaid at the time I was at Maskat or it might have been intentionally withhehl, but I was expressly informed by Syed Abdul Kahir, His Highness's confidential Secretary, that neither Kishm, Ormuz, nor Larak are specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian Government for the stipulated sum paid to them ; and in reply to a series of questions which I wrote out to be answered at Maskat, and which I know were carried by Syed Abdul Kahir to His Highness the Imam himself, it was expressly declared that the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak. belonged exclusively to the Imam. 9. It appears to me extreme presumption in the Persian Government to declare that even Maskat itself is a dependency of Persia, and the information I have obtained satis fies me that Maskat never was tributary to that State ; perhaps the pretensions of Persia may be grounded on the following circumstances, which I obtained in detail from what must be considered the highest authority, the Imam himself. 10. About 78 years ago, Sultan bin Syfe Gaarubi was Imam of Maskit and the Province of Omaun; he made himself very unpopular by his tyranny, and was removed from the Government by the general voice of the people ; he went and sought the aid of Nadir Shah, then sovereign of Persia, to reinstate him in his Government; Nadir Shah complied with his request, and sent an army back with him to restore him to influence and to power. This army landed at Ras-sul-Khima, and after much hard fighting they succeeded in marching through the country as far as Maskat which place alone seems then to have been retained by the adherents of Sultan bin Syfe, while all the Province of Omaun remained unsubdued.128 Part V—Chap. XXVIH The independent Arabs now advanced and surrounded Maskat, and the Persian Army was reduced to considerable difficulties. About this time intelligence of the death of Nadir Shah reached tbem, the Persians made certain proposals to the Arabs, which were finally agrreed tn, and the Persian Army returned back to Bunder Abassee without effecting the object of their coming. 11. In this state of affairs Ahmed bin Saed, the grandfather of the present Imam of Maskat, and then a Chieftain Commanding at Sohar, assumed the (jovernment of Omaun and was proclaimed Imam. 1^. The claims of Persia therefore to the Islands of Kishm, Or muz, etc., seem to rest * entirely upon their heing considered as dependencies of Bunder Abassee. This point I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is quite evident that the Imam is not disposed to acknowledge the rijjht of Persia to the islands in question, and it is, I believe, the universal law of nations to claim as a right that which they have obtained by the sword. Persia with equal presumption claims the Island of Bahrein because it was once tributaiy to it, thouirh it has thrown off the yoke, and paid no tribute for these 30 vears. Persia may with equal justice lay claim to Dehli at the present day because Nadir Shah once conquered and plundered it. 13. In my discussions therefore with the Persian Ministers, I think I shall be able, in point of right, to support all the measures the British (Government have adopted in occupy ing the Island of Kishm, when I consider, however, the very heavy expense of supporting the establishment, the impossibility of employing the troops on any active service in the Gulf, for four months in the ye ir on account of the excessive heats, the sickness that hai prevailed there ever since the hot weather commenced, and the inefficiency of the force arising from that cause alone, I confess, I feel more doubts than I have heretofore done, as to the expediency and utility of the measure; but as I am aware that different sentiments have ^ been and probably still are, entertained by those who are far more competent to decide than I am, I be? to offer such a hint with extreme diffidence and with the most perfect conviction of the fallibility of my own judgment. (v) QUESTION OF CONTROLLING PIR iTICAL PORTS EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH 1 MARINE FORCE. 258. The Bombay Government bein? desirous of ascertaining the practi cability of controlling the piratical ports Volume 26—51 of 1821, page 480. J q ^| ie Gulf of Persia exclusively through the medium of a marine force, which might render the maintenance of a military one in that quarter for that purpose unnecessary, requested Henry Meriton, Superintendent of Marine, to submit his opinion on the subject with a plan for maintaining a watch and cruize during the period which is favourable to the prosecution of piracies. Mr. Meriton submitted in his letter No. 336, dated 26th November 1821, the following observations and suggestions :— ^ I beg to state that after a careful examination of the charts of the Gulf of Persia, and repeated conferences with Lieutenants Hardy, Grubb, and Robinson, officers wlio have a perfect knowledge of that navigation, and who have recently returned from that station, it appears that the principal ports from which piratical vessels are most likely to be fitted out, and from which they can most readily get to sea, are the following on the Arabian Coast, namely. Rump, Ras-ul-kima, Sharga and Deboy. S. The above four ports extending from the 25th to 26th degrees of latitude and occupy a range of coast of about 70 miles, and as they are all easy of access, I think they might be guarded in the following manner. That there should be three cruisers (one of each class) constantly cruising in the face of these ports, and visiting them all from time to time, when it would be seen if any preparations were going on in the equipment of vessels, and, if so, that it should be unequivocally ascertained, on what service they were meant to be employed. One of the three cruisers might as occasion require proceed to the Island of Khen for water and refreshment, leaving the other two on the watch and cruising as before stated. I say the Island of Khen as a station from which the cruiser could return immediately to her ^ consorts if wanted on emergency, as the prevailing winds (north-westerly) would enable the cruisers to navigate to and from the Island of Klien to the piratical ports at all seasons of the year, and if a small depot of stores with the gun-boats under the care of a marine officer (present master attendant at Kishm) and a detail of sepoys (say 20) could be kept at Khen for the refit and supply of those cruisers, they would be able to keep their cruising ground during the whole of these months in which the pirates would put to sea, were they to fit out vessels for that purpose. I therefore conceive that the distribution of the Honourable Company's cruisers in the Persian Gulf might be as follows :— Ihree {one of each class) to cruise y and watch, in face of the piratical ports before mentioned. Iwo, for the purpose of navigating and giving convoy if required hettoeen Maskat and Bushire and Bussorah, and with despatches or for other purposes. One, to run to Bombay with packets, etc., as occasion may require.■ ' y Part V—Chap. XXVIII. X-9 4. It is understood that there are doubta as to the right (according to the late treatri of demanding to know for what purposes Nepals are building m the ports before mentioned, as also the right to destroy them on the stocks in the event of it appearing they are meant to be piratically employed. In such case it will scarcely be practicable to prevent their escaping to sea in the night, when no remedy can be applied, but by capture w h en the y may be found at sea without the authorized papers and wearing the proper flag, in which case there should be four cruisers in front of the ports before mentioned instead ot three, and it might be advisable to make trial of this measure for one season before the garrison wa^ withdrawn. . . 5 As connected with this subject, I beg to state that it has been brought to my notice by Officers Commanding the E. 1. Co.'s cruisers in the Gulf, that several instances have occ ^ ie of Nepals belonging to the ports before stated, having been found navigating without ei the flag or documents as provided for in the 3rd and 5th articles of the Treaty concluded by Sir William Grant Keir, and that on said Nepals having been taken to Kishm, the Commandi g officer did not feel himself authorized to detain them. I therefore respectfully 8U =S®® the Chiefs of the aforesaid ports be cautioned not to suffer vessels to depart there without the proper flag and documents before mentioned or otherwise vessels may be at wa whose aim may be piracy when opportunity offers. 258A. In Bombay Government letter No. 1703, dated 10th December 1821 Mr. Meriton was directed to issue the necessary orders to give effect to the arrangements suggested in his letter above quoted, and as regards the troops he was told the necessary orders would be passed on receipt ot Dr. Juke s tinal reports. (vi) REMOVAL OF THE DETACHMEXT TO SALAK AND THEM TO BASSIDORB. 9f&gt;q In Eebruarv 1822, the detachment was removed from the town of in jjeoruaiy o , Kislim * to th e village of Salak. The cir- Volume 91 Of 1822, page 16, cumstances under which the removal •was decided upon are explained in Captain Kennet's letter, dated 23th Janu ary 1822:— I beo leave to state to you, for the information of the Hon'ble the Governor in Council, that 1 am under the necessity of removing the cantonnent to the south side of the Island for the following cogent reasons which I now beg to enumerate. 1 The rainy season which commences in November or early in December at latest in most years has not yet set in, and from the present appearance of the atmosphere there is little bability of any falling for some time; this circumstance alone I consider would be sufficient ^use for the removal of the troops as a great deficiency if not a total failure of the annual ^ ply 0 f that indispensable article is to be expected. The water here is now so bad that many are complaining of slight bowel complaints. 2 I have received a letter written by the Assistant Surgeons at this station marked A which I have the honour to enclose detailing the sufferings of the sick which, although it givei mP i a ncholy picture of our situation, I do not think it too highly coloured and they also re commend a change of situation in the hopes of finding a more healthy spot on the south or windward bide of the island. 3 In consequence of Government having directed Mr. Assistant Surgeon Tod in conjuno- t' with Mr. Assistant Surgeon Nimmo to make a tour of the island to see if there wag ^nore eligible spot for a cantonment, it was evidently the wish of Government that the pre sent cantonment should be removed before the next (fast approaching) hot season. I made a tour round the island in the beginning of this month, and visited every plact \ pre I heard o-ood water was to be found attended by the Master Attendant and Mr. Assist- * s ar o-eon Reach. The former for reporting on the roads and anchorage for shipping marked 'b and the latter for tne purpose of ascertaining the best situations and healthfulnes® of the different stations for a cantonment marked C. I first visited Deristan where the water was good in many of the wells, but they were \ out 2 miles from the beach, and I believe the failure of the water wds the 'principal came for the troops quitting that cantonment formerly and sea breeze coming over a burning sand (though for so short a distance) does not promise much benefit. Tnext visited a place called Salak (by the natives) but which in Maior-General Smith's renort to Government, 23rd April 1S21, is the same place which he calls Zullah. It is about 15 miles west of Deristan ; there are several wells of excellent water, and as no ram has t a [ l en thiR vear it is evident it must be a natural supply and as they occupy a spacf5 of 400 or o00 vards in length there is every probability of having an abundance by digging intermediate nnPR • on inqliiry amongst the few cultivators who now reside there they informed me that there was fresh water to be had in every part, and that the hot weather during the summer mouths was not so intense as on the northern side of the island. The site for a cantonment being within 500 yards of the beach which is covered with a vegetation that renders the reflection and heat still less and being entirely open to seaward * Th« garrison was again removed from Deristan (Bee paragraph 239 above) to Kishm.\ I 130 Part V-Chap. XXVIII promises a cool healthy spot. The prevailing winds during the hot season are north-west, but as they always take the direction of the land they become here south-west which will be a sea breeze. The elevated or table land is at a little distance, but as the wind only comes over it in the cold season there is every reason to suppose it will prevent inconvenience. The anchorage is also good as represented in the Master Attendant's report marked B. The next place I visited was a small island called the great Tnmb about 30 or 40 miles south-west from Salak ; it is about 3 miles in length and 3 in breadth ; there is a large place in it open to the westward which would be a most eligible spot for a cantonment, but the want of good water will never allow it to be made a permanent station, there was only one well which was very bad and brackish. ^ I next went to Basidoo or Bassadore, an old Portuguese town in ruins on north-west point of Kishm. There are 10 or l i tanks, but 2 only were full of rain water which was excellent, the remainder were quite dry ; perhaps for want of the channels for conveying the rain into them not beiny kept clear and open f jO which I am the more inclined as the inhabit ants are only a few fishermen aud the 2 tanks from which they, promise the water is in all probability sufficient for them. In other respects this would be an excellent spot for troops, it being a peninsula sur rounded on 3 sides by the sea and the hills so far distant that it is open to every wind, The ground tolerably level and elevated on two sides about 30 feet from the sea by abrupt rocks which might easily be depended, and the plain is sufficiently large for almost any number of men and the tanks when filled would be sufficient for 5,000 men for 12 months, as there are a number of wells which though the water is not good would answer for culinary purposes. The anchorage is not safe as represented in the Master Attendant's report. Under all these circumstances I have decided in favour of Salak, it is true as a strong military position, it does not possess any advantages, but by placing the guns in com manding situations and it stopping up, some of the small roads through the ravines.I think it may be rendered as secure as circumstances at pre-ent require. As it is probable T could not receive an answer to this communication in a month or perhaps 40 days, and as the season at that time will be too'far advanced to get the barracks and other buildings erected before the intense hot weather commences and the probable total failure of water before that time, 1 have written to His Highuess the Imam for permission to remove there, and not doubting but I shall receive his consent. I have made arrangements for commencing the movement of the troops and stores on the 1st proximo and all circum stances considered, I trust the Hon'ble the Governor in Council will approve of the measures I have adopted. As the Ordnance stores have increased considerably since the removal from Deristan and as it will be more advantageous to remove all the materials of the Hospitals, Barracks and Public Buildings than to buy new and pay for the freight from Menow to Salak, being double the distance of our present cantonment, I have engaged with the Commanders of the Georgiana (Bengal country ship) and Malabar for the service of their vessels at the rate of half a rupee per ton per diem, being fi,2ll per diem for the former so long as I shall require her services and the latter for one month certain at the rate R181 per diem or R5,430 for the month of 30 days. I have therefore every reason to think I shall be able to remove the stores, etc., to Salak for the sum of K,15 or R16,000 including boat hire, but as this will depend on the ^ favourable state of the weather by which the ships can make a greater number of trips during the month, no exact calculation can be made, but as 1 have taken up the ships at so «mall a rate, and when it is considered that the troops were moved from Deristan to this station at an expense of near 5,35,000 for 2 ships alone, I look forward with confidence to the sanction of the Hon'ble the Governor in Council for the expenses which must be unavoidably incurred, particularly as t did not decide on the measure without consulting with Captain Maitland the Senior Officer of the Cruisers, as to the practicability of doing without them. 260. The proposal of Lieutenant Kennet was approved by the Bombay Gov ernment, and as to Bassidore, instructions were issued to the Superintendent of the Marine to have the anchorage of that place fully examined (Proceedings of the Bombay Government, dated 18th February 1822.) On the 17th February 1822, Captain Lieutenant Kennet reported the removal of the cantonment to Salak. 260A. A few days afterwards, however, the troops were removed to * BassidorCt the anchorage being too much exposed for the shipping.Part V—Chap. XXIX. 131 CHAPTER XXIX. EXPEDITIONS AGAINST THE BENI-BIJ-ALI TRIBE, 1820, AND BUITIS11 POLICY IN THE GULF. 261. The question as to the limitation to be observed in using British forces 77 7 JA noomooi for the P u rpose of putting down wars Volume 44 of 1820-1821. a m 4.1 -n • ry ic among tribes on the rersian Gulf came in for discussion in connection with the unfortunate expedition against the Benu- Hasan and Beni-bu-Ali, two affiliated tribes settled not far from the coast of Jaalan in Oman. It appears that Mahomed-bin-Ali, their Chief, had abjured the creed of Ibadhiegah and adopted Wahabi tenets and refused to recognize the authority of the Sultan of Maskat. Moreover some of these tribes at Al- Ashkharah, a village on the coast, were reported to have plundered English ships which were wrecked in their neighbourhood. To punish these outrages, Captain Thompson, the Political Agent at Kishm, was directed in the event of the conduct of those pirates appearing piratical to act against them under an injunction, however, that great pains be first taken to ascertain that what we took for piracy was not lawful one; and to address a letter to the Sheikh previously to any hostile attack being made, explaining our intentions and calling on them to desist from those pursuits. 262. A letter was accordingly written by Captain Thompson to the Sheikh of the Beni-bu-Ali, and given in charge to Lieutenant Collinson of the Mercury cruizer, with direction to call at Maskat for the purpose of obtaining a pilot. A person of some consequence, under the Imam's Government, and Sheikh of the town of Has-al-Had was obtained, and having proceeded to Al-Ashkharah, he landed and after some consideration with a native, was returning to the boat, when he was attacked by a number of armed men, who rushed from behind a sand hill and murdered. 263. Though Captain Thompson viewed this act as not referable to the Chiefs of the Beni-bu-Ali from their distance from the place where it occurred, he yet considered it as a proof that their tribe was out of the limits of peaceable relations, prepared a force to attack the tribe, returned to Maskat, and after having concerted measures with the Imam proceeded from thence to Sur, a port near Bas-al-Had; the Imam having marched to the same place with a body of his troops. Captain Thompson having determined to co-operate with the views of His Highness, in case this should be found practicable without risking the detachment. 264. It would appear that the Imam had in two former instances detached a force against the Beni-bu-Ali tribe, on both of which occasions they came to terms, which were broken as soon as the force was withdrawn ; and that His Highness's object was limited to the demolition of their walls, and to the build ing of a fort upon their wells, and another at Al-Ashkarah, leaving to the inhabitants the option of remaining or of removing. The Arabs destroyed Al- Ashkarah and most of their boats on our troops landing at Sur and retired. 265. On the 8th November the combined forces arrived within 3 miles of Balad-Beni-bu-Ali, the residence of the hostile tribe, and a demand was forth with made for the surrender of their fortifications and arms together with the persons who had murdered the messenger at Al-Ashkarah. The tribe agreed to comply with the terms proposed except as to the one stipulating for sur render of their arms. This modification was not acceded to; and the next morning the combined forces attacked the enemy's position, but were utterly routed. Nearly the whole of the British detachment was cut up. The Sultan and the English were obliged to return to Maskat. In reporting the details of this disaster (letter 18th November 1820), the Political Agent, Kishm, stated that the Sultan was anxious to return to the attack, and that he (Poli tical Agent) had assured him of every assistance of troops. In a second letter,132 Part V—Chap. XXIX. dated 3rd December 1820, Captain Thompson supported his action in marching with British Indian troops into the interior on the ground that the haunts of the pirates were in the interior, not on the coast side. 266. The Bombay Government addressed (letter No. 49, dated 9th March 1820) Colonel Thompson severely condemning his proceedings:— (2) Your conduct in marching into the interior against the residence of the tribe of Beni- bu-Ali has been considered highly blameable. It was at variance with the letter of the instructions to Major-General Sir William Grant Keir, and it not only endangered the safety of the troops, but was calculated to injure the interests of the British Government, even in the event of complete success, by the false impression which it must have given of its policy. (3) What policy has repeatedly and expressly been declared to be, to confine our views strictly to the control and suppression of piracy when it actually subsists, and to abstain from taking part in disputes of the States in the Gulf, even when within the reach of our maritime power, further than was absolutely necessary for the accomplishment of that object. (4) Your co-operation with the Imam, on the other hand, was calculated to persuade the Arab powers that we were inclined to pursue our enemies into the interior, and to interfere in their internal disputes for the professed purpose of guarding against prospective dangers at sea. The natural consequences of such an opinion would be to generate distrust and suspicion of our ultimate objects, and to draw into confederacies against us, even the tribes and powers who are least entrusted in protecting pirates. (5) The arguments you have brought forward on a supposed system of piracy, to be carried only in land towns, do not appear to justify your conclusions; if it be not sufficient for us to destroy all vessels, and seaports belonging to pirates, the Hon'ble the Governor-in- Council sees no point at which we are to stop, short of pursuing such tribes as far as they may choose to retreat into the interior, and attacking all the inland possessions of those, a portion of whom may have engaged in maritime depredations. (6) The course of your negotiation with the Beni-bu-Ali was equally inconsistent with the policy of confining our objects to the suppression of piracy. The measure of sending to Maskat for an Agent to be employed as a messenger of the British Government in the first instance, seems to have been likely to confound our designs with those of the Arabs of the continent; he was evidently an unfit person to ascertain the real views of a tribe in rebellion against that Prince, as he was neither likely to be well received nor to report fairly. (7) From the commencement of the negotiation at Belad Beni Hussain.the object of sup pressing piracy seems to have been entirely lost sight of, the point on which you advised the Imam to break off all treaty, had no reference to it, nor does a compliance with that demand even if it could reasonably have been expected, appears at all requisite to the accomplishment either of our plans, or of those of the Imam; but considering the reluctance of the Arabs to part with their arms as well as the possibility of their apprehending certain to defeat all nco- tiation by bringing on suspicion that no sincere wish for accommodation was entertained. (8) Your assurance to the Imam that the resources of the British Government would be everywhere at his disposal was a still greater departure from the principle of our policy in the Gulf of Persia, and must have led the Imam to suppose that our late misfortune had turned our occasional co-operation against the pirates, into a general defensive alliance or a guarantee of his dominions. 267. In order to retrieve the British honour a second expedition was despatched under the command of General Smith. The objects of the expedition were — Izt—to obtain the surrender and public execution of the murderers of the British messenger; 2nd —to put the Imam in possession of the territory occupied by the Beni-bu-Ali; 3rd —to obtain the release of all prisoners and restoration of all arms captured in the late action; and 4th —to obtain effectual security against the renewal of piracy by the Beni-bu-Ali, in case they should possess any part independent of the Imam and to procure the release of all Indian prisoners taken in former piratical expeditions. 268. The expedition met with a complete success. The details of the move ment of the troops and their proceedings belong to the history of Maskat and we treated in the history of Maskat in the Bombay Selections Ko. XXIV.Part V—Chap. XXX. 133 4 CHAPTER XXX. persian complaints against mr. bruce. 269. Mr. Bruce, Eesident in the Persian Gulf, was now a persona ingrata to the Persian Government, especially the Volume 33 9 of 18 , page . Prince of Fars. Repeated complaints were addressed by them to the Bombay Government and to the Envoy at Tehran. The charges against Mr. Bruce and his rejoinder to each are printed below :— Charges. Mr. Bruce the British B-esidentat Bushire, who so long has resided in Persia, and who is well aware of the existing relations between the two Empires, has always experienced on one part every consideration connected with his official capacity. He ought in consequence to have been arduous in the support of the existing amity; on the contrary, he had committed acts which ill accord with the intimacy of the connection between the two States; he has ever offended against the interests of his own Govern ment. Mr. Bruce was acquainted that at the request of the Imam an expedition had been fitted out for the punishment of the people of Bahrein, and that His Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz had undertaken this scheme; he went to Bahrein, and was the mediator of a peace between the Imam and Uttabi Shaikhs and stipulated fur the motion of a standard on that island. 2nd. —The ships of the people of Lin gua who were obedient and faithful in the service of tributary to the Persian Government were sailing with merchandize from Bussora. Mr. Bruce ordered the arms of 300 of their men to be seized and took fourteen of these boats, as storm happened and cut their masts and they were lost. 3rd. —At the Port of Charak, of which the inhabitants if they had committed any fault were amenable to the Prince of Shirar, be burnt ships ; these acts he has certainly Observations and reply, I can offer no specific reply to an accusation so general as that by which the charges against me are introduced, but I appeal with confidence to the Government whose records afford ample means of defending me against this calumny. It is well known that His Highness the Imam of Maskat has fitted out several expedi tions with the view of accomplishing in conjunc tion with Persia the reduction of Bahrein, but these expeditions invariably failed in consequence of His Highness the Prince of Shuar not per forming his part of the engagement in regard to the quota of troops to be furnished. The Imam in consequence was constrained to make the best terms he could with the Shaikh of Bahrein before British squadron left the Gulf, but whilst I was at Bahrein I was so far from acting as mediator that the time was exclu sively occupied in demanding that some pira tical boats should be given up. If by the motion of a standard it is meant that a British flag was ever hoisted on the Island of Bahrein, the Government is well aware that nothing of the kind ever took place. It is true that the Shaikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Maskat wished Sir W. G. Keir and myself to guarantee the treaty between them, but the request was not complied with. 2nd. —It might be sufficient to state that when the occurrence alluded to in the charge Mr. Bruce was residing at Bushire. He happens however to know that Captain Loch seized the boats referred to, many of which belonged to piratical ports on the Arabian side of the Gulf. The Port of Lingua with several others on the Persian side of the Gulf were so well known to be in league with the pirates, that Sir W. G. Keir was instructed by Government to visit it and destroy its boats. The boats which Captain Loch captured were taken as far as Khen, and Captain Looh then withdrew his men from them and directed them to follow him to Ras-ul-khima, being anxious himself to join the expedition, instead, however, of following his instructions, they steered for the ports they belonged to respectively, but now lost in a gale before they could reach their destination. 5^.—In reply to this charge it might be sufficient to state that I have never been at the Port of Charak. The Shaikh of which however had committed a most violent act of piracy on s I134 Part V-Ch&amp;p. XYX. eommitted without the permission of the British Government. The Persian Govern ment will not therefore be satisfied with his continued residence in Persia, we therefore request that you will write to the British Minister in India to appoint another person to the situation of Resident and to dismiss Mr. Bruce from the employ, as his continued residence in Persia will not be productive of advantage to either State, and it is necessary Mr. Bruce should restore the amount of the loss he has occasioned to Persian subjects. a British ship (Ahmed Shah), sometime in 1814 which was duly reported to Government. This ship grounded near the island and might easily have been got off and saved with the cargoes, most of which belonged to the Honourable Company, if assistance had been rendered from the shore. On the contrary, the Shaikh seized the vessel and property and after taking what he pleased he set fire to the ship. A gentleman was sent down from Bushire to remonstrate with the Shaikh Abdulla-bin-Ahmed and suc ceeded in recovering a small portion of the property, consisting of treasure belonging to the merchants of Bushire, and of a few, I believe, mares belonging to Government. The seizure of this vessel was reported to M. Morier, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, who promised a firman from the Shah on His Royal High ness the Prince of Shuar to enforce restitution from the Shaikh of Charak ; this firmaun like all orders of this nature in Persia, which are not specially enforced, was never attended to, al though the subject was repeatedly urged from the Residency, this port was also one of those pointed out in Sir W. G. Keir's instructions to be visited as they are now notoriously in league with the pirates, and had been for some years. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires made some observations in defence of Mr, Bruce, but as he has acknowledged the destruction of the Lingua and Charak boats, he will certainly not disavow Mr. Bruce's mission to Bahrein, and his mediating to effect the views of the Shaik of Bahrein, the excul pation of Mr. Bruce*'s conduct is that the Lingua and Charak boats were destroyed by the Captains of the British ships, according to the representation of the Shuar Govern ment. Mr. Bruce superintended the destruc tion of these vessels ; if this duty was affected by other as the officers from India were not acquainted that the people of those ports were subjects of His Persian Majesty, but acted from the information which Mr. Bruce gave them. He must repair the loss occa sioned to Persian subjects. His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires has noticed his former statements relat ing to this affair. True, but in this manner ' that the ships of the people of Lingua and Charak in retaliation for the offences committed and for their disobedience to the orders of the Prince of Fars and their connexion with the Joasmis will be des troyed, the answer to this communication was that the Arabs of these ports are the subjects of Persia, and if they have officers they are amenable to the Persian Govern ment, the punishment of the Joasmis is the province of the British, f the officers of the Arabs of the Persian Coasts must be stated to the Prince of Fars who will punish any that have offended against British subjects. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires construed the Firmaun addressed to the Officer Com manding the Force and the mark of the Prince's favour to Mr. Bruce to an approba tion of the services of the expedition, yes, the Officer Commanding before the trans- actsons ascribed to Mr. Brace, in a letter to Mr. Bruce as before stated never went on any mission to Bahrein, excepting for the purpose of destroying boats. The boats alluded to were destroyed by 'the squadron under command of Captain Loch of His Majesty's Ship Eden. Mr. Bruce stated to what ports the boats belonged, and the senior officer considered it his duty to destroy them. The Persian Minister appears particularly anxious that restitution should be made to the subjects of Persia for the trifling losses they would wish to substantiate, but they never hint at restitution to British subjects and the Honourable Com pany for the very heavy losses which the inhabit ants of the ports they wish to protect have subjected them to. Applications on this head were made to the Prince of Fars, as the corre spondence from the Residency with His Royal Highness and His Ministers will shew : if His Royal Highness or his Suntam have mislaid these communications, copies can be furnished from the Residency records. Mr. Bruce's present did not reach His Royal Highness for a very considerable time after it had been honoured with the Prince's mark of favour, and it was in consequence of this mark of attention on the part of His Royal Higbnes» that Mr. Bruce made a present in return.Part V-Chap. XXX. 135 the Shah detailed his services iu destroyiug the Joasmis which were worthy the appro bation of His Persian Majesty, and as Mr. Bruce had made a present to the Prince, His Royal Highness was obliged to give something in return. As Mr. Bruce to forward his own views has furnished the people of Lingua and Charak without the knowledge of his Government and has been guilty of other acts unbecoming an English Resident con formably with the obligations resulting from the alliance, it is requested that he may be removed from the office and be replaced by another Persian, lest from his example although trifling more offences may be committed, and lest acts unbecoming the friendship of the two States may be practised by the authorities on the frontier. It would ill become Mr. Bruce to offer any opinion on the propriety or otherwise of com plying with the request that he should be removed from his official situation, he resigns himself entirely to the disposal of his own Government, in the confidence that justice will be rendered to him, and that he will be firmly supported unless he shall be found to have forfeited the confidence with which he has hither to been honoured. Wm. BRUCE. B ombay ; The IStk May 1821. 270. The observations of Captain Bruce having been forwarded to the Supreme Government, they observed that his conduct appeared to have^ been perfectly correct, and that his removal from Bushire could only be considered as an unworthy compliance with a most unreasonable requisition (letter, dated SOth June 1820). 271. In a subsequent communication the Government of India explained that their remark as to Mr. Bruce's removal had reference only to the inexpe diency of yielding to an unreasonable demand on the part of the Persian Gov ernment, but was not intended to imply any objection to his removal from Bushire should such a measure be deemed advisable and the change be agreeable to that officer himself. The Bombay Government had in view early opportunity being taken of transferring Mr. Bruce to Bombay, when an opening might offer. This proposal was approved by the Government of India (letter, dated 1st September 1821).136 Part V—Chap. XXXI. CHAPTER XXXI. DEPUTATIOX OF D r. JVKES 0\ A MISSION TO THE PERSIAN GULF—HIS DEATH AT SHIItAZ. 272. In May 1821 Dr. Andrew Jukes was deputed to the Persian Gulf Volume 20 of 1820 -21, page 592. with . a vieW to alla y the Suspicions of the Persian Government roused by detention of the British force in the Island of Kishm. The points which Dr. Jukes had to bear in mind in his mission were explained in the following letter of the Bombay Government, dated iGth May lb21 :— No. 98 of 182 To Andrew J ukes, E sq ., etc., etc. Sir, . 1. You are already informed of the doubts which have been entertained in regard to the sovereignty over the Island of Kishma to which the Goveruraents of Persia and Maskat assert pretensions. The former having recently betrayed the strongest apprenhensions at our occupation of it, and preferred a formal demand for the removal of the detachment, as you will perceive from the accompanying despatch, dated the 20th of December, from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, to the address of His Excellency the Most Noble the Governor- General in Council, and the Honourable the Governor in Council having determined to des patch you on a mission to the Persian Gulf with the view of allaying these unfounded claims or of adopting such measures as the exigencies of the case may render expedient, I have the honour to furnish you with these instructions for the regulation of your conduct in this important duty. 2. The Governor in Council anticipating these alarms adopted at the earliest period on the despatch of the expedition against Rassukhima, precautions in fnrniphin^ Mr. Willock with the fullest exposition of our policy in the occupation of the island in question ; a perusal of that correspondence will shew the anxious, though unavailing, efforts that have been made to satisfy the Persian Government of the integrity of our views as limited exclusively to the suppression of piracy in the Persian Gulf. 3. Equally solicitous has the Governor in Council been to ascertain the justness of the claim which the Imam of Maskat advanced to the sovereignty of Kishma,, the result of Captain Sadleir's enquiries leading the Government to believe those claims to be well founded. The detachment was transferred from Rasool Khinaa to that island with the sanction of the'lmam. This document will enable you to draw from the Court of Persia a statement of the grounds on which her pretensions to Kishma may be founded and which may be as untenable as her claim to tribute from Maskat which the Imam has refused to pay and Persia been unable to exact, since the death of Shah Abbas. 4. By despatches recently received from the Officer Commanding at Kishm^, it appears that a Vakeel from the Prince of Shiraz had arrived there, bearing a written message from the Prince regarding our occupation of that Island and of Angar, explaining that he had learnt we were building forts ; that he had written to the Presidency and sent his Vakeel to prohibit such proceedings. The Officer Commanding pointed out to the Vakeel the necessity of reference to this Government, and the Vakeel stated that he intended to write to the Prince, that the report of our constructing forts was erroneous, and that we were there solely for the purpose of checking piracy. 5. Captain Deschamps had been informed by the Vakeel that the mission had arisen from a representation of Sultan bin Suggur of Sharga to the Shaik of Bentush by whom it was forwarded on to Shiraz, purporting that we contemplated the subjugation of the power of the different Chiefs in the Gulf, and toe lessening the authority of the Persian Government. Information has been received also of a force having been ordered by the Prince to be prepared in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas, and other parts of the coast to the extent of 16,000 men. 6. In consequence of these advices the Governor in Council deems it proper that you should proceed with the least practicable delay to Kishme, and eventually, if you think it necessary, to the Prince's camp. If you consider it probable that the Prince will attack Kishmfc, you will explain to His Highness that the King of Persia's representations had been referred to the Governor-General, who will give them every consideration, who alonePart V—Chap. XXXI. 137 can decide on them and whose answer may be soon expected. You should also point out the power the British Government possesses of avenging on Persia any unprovoked attack which may be made on our troops in the Gulf. 7. Should it appear impossible to avoid hostilities by other means, a contingency which the Governor in Council considers highly improbable, you are empowered to propose to the Prince that the detachment should be withdrawn from Kishme to Maskat, or, adverting to its onhealthiness, to any place within the Imam's territories in which His Highness may concur, pending the negotiation regarding the ultimate fate of it. You will explain that this conces sion orlginatesln the reluctance of this Government to disturb the friendship subsisting between'the British and Persian nations, especially on a point which has not been decided by the Governor -General in Council; that the removal of the troops is not to be interpreted into a recognition of the Kins of Persia, title to Kishm^, nor to act as a restraint on our reoccupy- ing the position, if the decision of the Supreme Government, or any other cause should render such a measure expedient, 8. The accompanying instructions to the Commanding Officer of the station will enable you to* cany this measure into effect. . But it is left to your discretion to deliver or withhold the letter according 1 to circumstances. You will of course be careful to conceal from the Persians the knowledge of the powers you possess. Your caution throughout must be to com mit the Government as little as possible, until instructions be received from Bengal. 9. The necessity of obperving the strictest secrecy on this point is obvious since should any rumour of it reach Persia it will doubtless produce the very crisis it is the wish of Govern ment to avoid. 10. These instructions are given that the British officers in the Persian Gulf may be pre pared for all exigencies, but the Honourable the Governor in Council is of opinion that the assembly of troops reported by Captain Deschamps has been occasioned by alarm at the report of the expedition under Major-General Smith. In that event your duty will be confined to removing the Prince's apprehensions. 11. You are further vested with a discretionary power to proceed to Tehran, should that course be expedient and especially if it should appear that no hostile act be likely to be com mitted by the Government of Shiraz, in which case your communications might be confined, as already observed, to such assurances as may dispel the fears of His Highness. 12. It is at that court alone that any final adjustment of the present discussions can take place, and it is obvious that the chief obstacles to the removal of the King of Persia's fears have been the exaggerations of the Government of Shiraz, through whom the British Govern ment would now be obliged to correspond, were you to limit your personal communications to His Highness and his officers. 13. You will however correspond with Mr. Willock and be entirelv guided by that officer's suggestions and by his directions in bringing forward or withholding any subject which 'Mr. Willock may think likely to affect the general interests of the Mission. 14. I enclose letters from the Governor to the King of Persia and the Sudder Auzim, as well as to the Prince at Shiraz, the last being so worded as to admit of your entering or not on the details of negotiation with the latter, as you judge proper; but any communication that compels you to enter into negotiations at Shiraz might- detain you at that place to the great detriment of the affairs entrusted to you. 15. In the accompaniment No. 1, you will perceive there are various charges preferred by the Persian Government against Captain Bruce, the Resident at Bushire, an explanation of which is necessary to enable you to remove them either by a personal communication with the Persian Government, or through His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, as may appear to him to be most advisable. 16. The object of the British Government in its operations in the Gulf having in view the preserving of its tranquillity, as it Was owing to the wars among the Powers who inhabit its shores that the growth of piracy was encouraged, it applied its whole attention to bring about a reconciliation between the Imam of Maskat and the Utubis of Bahrein—at the same time that it offered its mediation to prevent hostilities against Bahrein on the part of the King of Persia, and even to procure the latter a tribute rather than allow of war. 17. These proceedings were so far from inconsistent with each other that they sprung naturally from the same source, a desire to preserve the peace of the Gulf. At all events the mediation between the Imam and the TJtubis was the avowed act of the Government of Bombay, and is in no respect imputable to Captain Bruce. 18. The capture of the Linga boats was the act of the officers of His Majesty's Navy, over whom Captain Bruce had not the least control. The destruction of them was however the consequence of their own imprudent intercourse with the Joassmees. 273. Dr. Jukes proceeded to Maskat and then to Kishm, where he learnt that Mirza Mahomed Banker had left for Bombay, having been deputed by the Shiraz Goyernment on a mission to the Bombay Government on the subject on question. Dr. Jukes decided to proceed at once to Shiraz. He reported to the Bombay Government that cholera was raging in Arabia, in Kishm and in Persia (letter dated 20th July 1831). On arrival at Sbiraz he1S8 Part V-Chap. XXXI. had several interviews with the Prince Governor. In his letter dated 25th October, he wrote that His Eoyal Highness made some observations respecting the island of Kishm, being one of the dependencies of Ears, and that the Imam was only a subject of his, but that as the British detachment there appeared from Dr. Jukes' explanation to have only the peace and tranquillity of the Gulf for its objects, so far as he was concerned, he had not the least objection to their continuing there, and that he would write his sentiments to the King and the Ministers at Tehran. 274. Dr. Jukes fell a victim on 10th November 1821 to the epidemic of cholera, which had been committing ravages in Southern Persia. 275. As Dr. Jukes appeared to have allayed the alarms felt in Persia about the British proceedings in the Gulf, it was thought not necessary to appoint a saccessor to him, and Sir Henry Willock was asked to try to adjust all the points referred to in the instructions to Dr. Jukes. Sir Henry was also requested to obtain the consent of the Persian Government to the transfer of the detachment at Kishmti to Kenn, on account of the cholera raging at the former place (letter to Sir Henry AYillock, dated 26th December 1821).Part V—Chap. XXXII. 139 CHAPTER XXXII. (I) QUESTION OF REMOVAL OF THE DET VCIIMEflT PROM HIS1IM DISCUSSED; (II) RUI'TURE WITH PERSIA IMMINENT; (III) DETERMINATION TO SEND REIN FORCEMENTS TO RISIIM; (IV) REMOVAL FROM RISHM DETERMINED. 276 The question of withdrawing our detaehment from Kishtn soon foreed Somlay Government to the Gcver„ m ent of itself upon Government It was found India, dated 9th March 1822, No. 469, Vol. 91 from despatches received from ills Majes- of 1822, page 93. ty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran that after every argument in favour of our retaining Kishm had been urged on the Persian Government with the utmost force and ability, the King of Persia struck to his resolution not to acquiesce in the measure. He had, however, made a reference to England and was determined to wait the result. In these circumstances the Bombay Government presented the following considerations for orders of the Government of India. All the officers who had been in the Gulf and consulted by the Bombay Government agreed that a station there was absolutely necessary to prevent the revival of piracy. The Superintendent of Marine considered it possible to protect our trade by means of a sufficient number of cruizers even if there were pirates in existence, but as this bad not yet been tried, no success could be counted on. It might therefore be calculated on that if we withdrew from the Gulph, we shall at the end of a few years be obliged to send another expedition. 277. But however desirable it might be to retain Kishm, we could not overlook considerations of justice and policy towards Persia: the King of Persia had not yet shown any proof of his title whatever to Kishm except its alleged authority, on which ground he had also claimed Mask at and the whole province of Oman. Even the argument mentioned by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires do not establish the claims of Persia. Sir John Malcolm on his first mission solicited a grant of Kishm from Persia, which was refused. If it had since appeared that Persia had no title to the territory so solicited, what should prevent our applying to the right owner. Still less did a casual expression of one of the Imam's officers destroy his master's right if he ever had one. The Governor of Bombay in Council was not acquainted with the nature of the Imam's rights either to Bunder Abass or Kishm, but supposing them equal there seemed abundant reason why he should waive his claim to Bunder Abass, an integral part of Persia and within reach of Agha Mahomed Khan's army ; and retain it to Kishm, which was probably beyond the reach of that monarch's power. A claim, however, to which His Majesty's Minister at 1 eheran attached importance ought not to be hastily set aside, and supposing the King of Persia to possess any reasonable ground of pretension to the island, it would be un friendly, at least, to oppose it by military occupation. It seemed incumbent on us to avoid giving the Shah this ground of disquiet, if we could do so without a very serious sacrifice of our own interests. It may be a question whether this alarm would ever gradually be removed without leaving any bad impressions. The Bombay Government, however, inferred that His Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires was of opinion that it would not; and the Governor in Council certainly thought the experiment ought not to be tried. 278. On balancing therefore the possible loss and expense by allowing piracy to revive against the certainty of giving umbrage and alarm to Persia, the Governor in Council was induced to attach most importance to the latter evil as affecting our general politics; while the other was more partial in its operation. As far as regards ourselves the Governor in Council was of opinion that it was expedient to withdraw the station. He does not advert to the uses140 Part V-Chap. XXXII. of such a station in the event of disputes with Persia or disturbances in that country, because in such an event we could at once occupy any island we chose in the Gulph. 279. It remained to be considered how far our withdrawing would affect the Imam, to whose interests his zeal and fidelity to the alliance required that we should pay every attention. His great anxiety that we should remain sufficiently evinces the danger he apprehended from an opposite measure; but it would only be from the revival of the piratical tribes that he entertained apprehensions; against them we should still be obliged to afford him occasional assistance, and he could scarcely complain of the inconvenience arising from the long intervals at which that aid would be afforded, when he saw that our own interests suffered almost as much as his from the necessity of such a course of action: our retreat would probably contribute to remove any dissatisfaction between him and Persia, which State it seemed likely that he would conciliate by a removal of the confederacy against Bahrein, which formerly dropt at our interposition. His doing so would no doubt hasten the commencement of the disorders that might be expected in the Gulph ; but we should not be entitled, when we had withdrawn our own support to require of the Imam any measure that might injure him with the most powerful State in his immediate neighbourhood. 279-A. The (iovernment of Bombay's opinion was therefore that we should ultimately retire from Kishm; if we were to retire we should, however, they thought, take advantage of the time allowed by the King of Persia's own proposal, and in the interim apprise the Imam of the probability of our with drawing from the Persian Gulf. To Persia we might say that the time the Shah had allowed for a refer ence to England would probably be sufficient for purpose as our occupation was only to be temporary ; and that at all events the decision of His Majesty's Government would of course be binding on the authorities in India; but in this and in all other communications, the utmost care should b9 taken to avoid pronouncing an opinion on any claim which the Imam of Maskat might possess to Kishm. Whenever the troops should be withdrawn, it seemed necessary that it should be to India, a* our stationing them on the continent either of Persia or Arabia could not fail sooner or later to involve us in the politics of those countries. The Government of India approved of the views of the Bombay Gov ernment (letter dated 4th May 1892). 280. Prom news however that soon after reached Bushire, it appeared that Captain Willock, His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires at Teheran, apprehended the necessity of quitting the Persian Court, and that in all probability war with that Government would ensue. There were rumours also that the King of Persia had communicated to the Imam of Maskat that he required 12,000 Tomans as rent for the Island of Kishm with the Town of Bunder Abbas, Menow, Kumir and some other places, but that the Imam would not pay more than the present rent, which was 4,000 Tomans. A large force was also said to have assembled near Bunder Abbass, to enforce the King of Persia's demand or resume his territory and there was also a report that the Imam was daily expected at Kishm. 281. The news from Persia were yet indistinct. Captain Willock had Bombay Government letter dated 20th May I'GCGivcd letters flOm Loid -Londoildery 1823 with Government of India, Vol. 91 of 1822, discouraging the Persian Mission to Great P a 9 e u6 ' Britain till the accomplishment of which the Persians had agreed to suspend their proceedings regarding Kishm. It was also understood from private accounts that groat offence had been given to Persia by our Minister's refusal to pay the arrears of subsidy in consequence of the conduct of Persia towards the Porte. On th* 21st of March the Charge d'Affaires had no expectation of a rupture, and on the 29th he found it necessary to demand his passports. Further, two cossids charged with dispatches had returned from within two stages of Teheran in consequence of orders sent by the Charge d'Affaire^Part V—Chap. XXXII. 141 281 A. The Bombay Government now thought scarcely any worse situation could be imagined in which our abandoning Kishm after the step our Minister had taken would net be highly injurious. On the other hand, there was some danger in reinforcing Kishm, because the Minister might not have actually quitted Persia and a step of this nature in the middle of a negotiation might be very embarrassing to the Minister. Of the two, however, reinforcing the detachment was less likely to hurt our negotiations than withdrawing it and to leave it in its present state in the event of a rupture would be highly impru dent. The breadth of the channel between Kishm and the mainland would prevent the immediate passage of a great army, but it was not a sufficient security for so small a detachment unprotected by works and likely at this season to be greatly weakened by sickness. 282. The Bombay Government decided in these circumstances to take * the following measures:— To send 400 Europeans to reinforce Lieutenant-Colonel Kennett's detachment. To have the Brnaad cleared of her cargo and to take up another ship to complete the tonnage required. To put the whole of the cruizers in the Gulph at the disposal of Lieute nant-Colonel Kennett. To authorize his incurring any necessary expense in procuring intelli gence from the mainland of Persia. To authorize his engaging any vessels required for securing a supply of provisions to his detachment and (if such precaution should seem necessary) for eventually removing his detachment. To authorize his eventually fortifying his position either at Bassadore or wherever he might think best and to send an able Engineer officer. To send any stores and supplies that might be required for this. To send any cruizers that were large enough for the purpose, and that are disposable, to the Gulph. The Admiral to be apprized of the state of affairs and requested to send a frigate to the Gulph. Lieutenant-Colonel Kennett to be made acquainted with our determina tion to retain Kislim and with all the steps that had been taken, requested to keep a watch on the proceedings of the Persians, to resist any attacks they might make as far as possible, or if threatened by an overwhelming force, to withdraw to the Imam of Maskat's territories. The Imam of Maskat to be informed that we heard our Minister had demanded his passports, that we know no more and could say no more at present; but that if there was a war we should of course defend Kishm. 283. The Governor of Ears had thought it fit to depute an Envoy Mirea Bangar to the Governor of Bombay with a roiume 36-131 of 18S2. v i ew to clear misunderstandings which had lately arisen between the Persian and Indian Governments. He was received at Bombay with every mark of respect and consideration. 284. When the despatch of the Bombay Government dated 20th May .o. * 1822, announcing their orders for des- Voiume 36—131 of 1823, page 6. patching reinforcements for Kishm, Mr. George Willock, Secretary in charge of Bis Majesty's Mission at Teheran, addressed the Prime Minister the following letter dated Ist September 1822:— Dated Tabriz, the 1st September 1822. From— George Willock, Esq., To—His Excellency Abdulla Khan Umen-ed-Dowlut , etc., etc. I bave the honor to mform Your Excellency that eeverai letters have been receired by me from the Government of Bombay.142 Part V-Chap. XXXII. His Persian Majesty's Ministers are informed of the distinguished reception of Mirza Bangur, Envoy on the part of the Governor-General of Fars, to the Governor of Bombay, and the favourable results attending his mission must have been learnt with every satisfaction. The British Government in India has always been solicitous to demonstrate the high estimation it places on the friendship of His Persian Majesty, and consequently the Honour able the Governor of Bombay has received Mirza Bangur with every mark of respect and kindness. It has been deemed expedient to augment the detachment stationed on the Island of Kishm by a reinforcement of 400 European Infantry, some Artillery and Pioneers, and some ships of war have been sent to cruize in the Persian Gulph. The late discussions between the Persian Ministers and His Hrittanic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires have created a slight degree of sensation that His Majesty's regard and friendship for the British nation has diminished. This measure is mainly temporary and precautionary, to ensure the safety of the detach ment. The additional troops will return to Bombay, when it is understood that the Persian Court is still guided by those principles, which to the present moment have tended to unite so intimately the two nations. The state of the Gulph gives reason to hope that the continua tion of the original detachment will not be much longer required. I have to request that Your Excellency will explain these circumstances to His Majesty in a manner to prevent the excitement of any unfavourable impressions. Your Excellency must be aware that if a supposition should prevail that the Persian Court had in contemplation a change in its policy towards the British nation, the situation of the troops on the Island of Kishm from the nature of their position, would immediately become highly precarious. 285. The following is the translation of a letter from His Excellency the Umin-ed-Dawlat to Mr. George Willock :— Your letter arrived at a favourable moment and I have derived gratification from the perusal of its contents. You give me information of the various attentions and the distinguished reception afforded by the Governor of Bombay towards Mirza Bangur, the Envoy of His Royal High ness the Governor-General of Fars. It is evident that that personage is actuated by those friendly sentiments, which must exist between the members of two States united by the happiest alliance. Regarding the Island of Kishm, you notice to me that the late discussions between the Ministers of this State and His Brittanic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires have created a supposition in the mind of the Honourable Governor of Bombay that this Government purposed to make some alteration in the friendship between the two States, and arising from this conjecture had despatched soldiers and ships of war to ensure the safety of the troops stationed on the Island of Kishm, lest the Arab tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf should be induced to act towards them in a manner contrarv to the existing relations. You also mention that when that Honourable personage should be convinced that such a system was not meditated by the Persian Government, the reinforcement would be ordered to return. His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires according to his own attestation, and to your knowledge, quitted this Court pleased and satisfied. He promised to return on the comple tion of his endeavours to confirm the friendly union between the two States. Since his departure (thank God) no event has occurred to disturb the amicable position of our affairs, aud which can have excited distrustful suppositions. Although the Governor-General of Fars had sent information regarding the Island of Kishm and had solicited permission to act agreeably to his duties, as superintendent of the frontiers and to the principles of dominion, yet from the seat of Royalty instructions have been issued to prohibit the adoption of measures, contrary to the good faith and friendship of the two States: similar orders have been sent for the Arab Sheiks and Governors of the Ports. These directions will be strictly attended to, and if the Honourable Governor should have received in a different light the departure of the Charge d' Affaires and has consequently entertained apprehensions, undoubtedly in this you have depicted to him in a clear and appropriate way the state of our relations, and the troops have left the Island of Kishm. It is proper that you should display, more than ever, your judgment in affairs and duly inform the Honourable Governor of the happy state of our relations. That the friendship is firm, is every day on the increase. Amicable professions should corroborate the alliance, and dispel every cause of apprehension and distrust. The appearance of further suspicion may contribute to the occurrence of events contrary to good policy. 286. The Governor of Bombay bad, however, meanwhile received in June 1822 news of the amicable adjustment Volume 36—131 of is22. differences between the British Envoy and the Persian Court, which was considered sufficient to justify to countermand the orders for the despatch of reinforceraents for Kishm (Bombay Government's letter dated 19th June 1822 to Major Willock). It was now decided to act upon the original resolution to remove the detachment from Kishm.Part V—Chap. XXXIII. 143 CHAPTER XXXIII. UNAUTHORIZED AGREEMENT CONCLUDED BY MR.

We discussed the subject, when certain stipulations were no-rped to and which the Minister informed me His Koyal Highness had the permission of ?hP Shah to say would he approved of and confirmed a Court when made known, and he reauested I would therefore transmit them for your Hon'ble Boards consideration and approval as tending to cement the ties of amity and good understanding. 2 That he would in a few days draw them out in writing and have two copies trane- nribpd' each of which we were to sign with the translation annexed : one Mirza Banker wag to take up to Tehran to be laid before the Shah for his confirmation and approval, and the other I was to transmit to your Honourable Board. 8 The copies were finished and signed by each of us on the 30th ultimo, and last night Mirya* Bauker Auhie set off for Teheran with one of them ; the other I have now the honour to transmit for the information of your Honourable Board, and shall be happy to learn it may meet their approbation. ^ n j t. u i.^ 4 With regard to a cruizer being furnished from the station at Bassadore suould the Pprsian Government require it, the stipulations I have made for her to be supplied with pro- visions and necessaries if detained beyond 40 days nearly amounts to the same as if she was I *. f u r n i 8 hed for the imbecility and tardiness of this Government in all their measures, with the very limited means they possess of meeting an expense of the kiud, will always operate so as to forego the service of a vessel rather than incur the charge. 5 His Roval Highness has, I believe, made up his mind to fit out an expedition this • against Bahrein, and if he should not meet with many obstacles in procuring tonnage Tor the embarkation of the troops, I have little doubt but what he will put it to the test; and • pypnt of his doing so, I think it more than probable he will take the island without 'l b opposition The JLe.kh of Bushire has pledged himself to furnish h.s ships and buggalows for this service, ivbich, if he performs, the other ports will readily supply such vessels as they possess. _ , t , , 6 But His Royal Highness builds more upon carrying his wishes about Bahrein m /wprtu'res which be thinks the Beni Attabee Sheikhs will make to him after he gets down on the eoa«t, and which he will readily accept if they tend at all to place the island a s s „bor^ dinate to bis authority, however limited that may be, rather than risk the attempt by f ' jree 7 The ostensible reason of the Prince being more urgent for the expedition taking place Qr , ' i8 , 0 a void being called up to Conrt this winter, which he certainly will be, unless he can occupy himself ou some expedition of the kind that will require his personal attention Wkb the principal officers of his Court j while at the same time the charges attendmg an avmament necessary for a service of the kind will be a State charge, and afford reasons sufficient foranv default tbat may ariee in the regular remittances to the Royal Treasury ; whereas, if he should proceed to Court, his expenses and the necessary presents required would amount to something' very considerable, and he entirely out of hia own privy purse. o Tu e Island o£ Bahrein reverting again under the authority of Persia will tend mor« to thetranqnillity of the Arabian side of the Gulf than almost any other act and wil. at once do away the constant petty act. of aggression and retalmbon eiieting jKtween the different branches of the Beni Attabee Arabs, particularly so between Abdella bin Ahmed and lUbma b O Jauba bcth of whom the Honourable Board would learn from Colonel Kennett had lately144 Part V-Chap. XXXIII. been with him, and who found it nearly impossible to make up the difference existing between them; indeed, so much so, that Rabma bin Jauba had gone down to Maskat to lay his case before the Imaum and Abdella bin Ahmed had returned to Bahrein. 9. His Royal Highness, after the signing of the engagements now transmitted for the consideration of Government, sent me, as a mark of honour and respect, a horse, sword, shawl jubba; at the same time sent me word that an officer would attend me down to Bassadore charg-ed with a similar mark of respect for Colonel Kennett, that the tribes in the lower part of the Gulf may know the amicable footing existing and the respect His Royal Highness entertains for the British force. 10. The Minister, Zikee Khan, and his son, Kair-oollah Khan, have also sent a horse each in a present, and previous to my leaving this I shall make suitable returns to whoever it may be necessary, and shall send His Royal Highness an appropriate present on my return to Bushire, not having any articles by me just now that will answer for that purpose. 11. The Prince having gone out to the Chemisafah on a hunting excursion for some time, I deemed it a mark of respect due to wait on him there, and accordingly did so on the 31st ultimo, accompanied by Lieutenant Hart of the Pioneers, to pay my respects and take my leave previous to my quitting this city. He was much gratified at the attention, and very politely asked us to stay a few clays in his camp, from which I excused myself as being anxious to arrange matters for proceeding down to Bassadore. He informed me he had directed Saduck Khan, Failee, to attend me on the way down and until I should arrive at Bushire, but desired I would not leave Shiraz for eight or ten days, to allow the weather to become a little cooler, which would check the epidemic cholera, which prevailed in the route of the southern ports. 12. I returned here from His Royal Highness's camp yesterday, and purpose leaving this on my way to Bassadore about the 15th instant, and hope to be there by the end of the month, when I shall have the honour to forward plan of my route down, which Lieutenant Hart, who accompanies me, has undertaken to keep and draw out. 13. I shall be most happy to learn that my compliance with His Royal Highness's wishes in coming up to Shiraz and my conduct during my stay here may meet the appro bation of Government, who, I trust, will sanction and approve of the presents I must necessarily make, and to which every due attention to economy shall be paid. 14. The horses which I have received shall be disposed of on my arrival at Bassadore, as it would have a bad appearance if I was to do so here, and the sword and shawl jubba I shall retain at the disposal of Government. 288. The following letter was addressed by the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, to Captain W. Bruce, Resident at Bushire, No. 1491, dated the 1st November 1822 :— You have been already apprised by my letters dated the 8th August and 23rd of September of the Governor in Council's disapprobation of your journey to Shiraz. 2. I am now directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated September 8rd, and to communicate to you the observations and instructions which it has suggested. 3. The Governor in Council directs me to express his surprise that you should have entered on a negotiation with the Prince at l^hiraz which was never contemplated by Gov ernment, and for which you were neither furnished with instructions nor with powers. He observes that the treaty which has been the result of those negotiations is not only unauthorized, but entirely inconsistent with the views of Government and with the obligations of the public faith. 4. The treaty grounds your supposed mission on errors of the British Government, which have never been admitted, and on which the Governor in Council is still unconscious. 5. It admits the claim of the King of Persia to Kishm contrary to aH history, to the protections of His Highness the Imaum of Maskat, and to the repeated declarations of this Government. It thereby admits the occupation of that island without the King of Persia's consent to have been an unjust aggression, and it agrees to admit a Persian force into Kishm, and to make over to the Persians the island which we received from the Imaum. 6. It acknowledges the King of Persia's title to Bahrein, of which there is not the least proof and which the British Government cannot assert without injuring the pretensions of the Imaum and the Attabees. It promises our aid against every power possessed of an island in the Gulf, and expressly against the Attabees, to whom we are bound by a treaty of friendship, and with whose conduct we have every reason to be satisBed. 7. It cancels, as an encroachment on Persia, the part of Sir W. Keir'g treaty, by which the Attabees are bound to carry the flag of friendly Arabs ; it places our voluntary payment to the sufferers at Linga on the footing of a concession to Persia ; and it makes the appoint ment of a Resident at Bushire a point of negotiation with the Prince of Shiraz. 8. The effect of this treaty would be to compromise the dignity of the British Gov ernment, and to overturn every part of the policy which it has adopted in relation to the power of the Persian Gulf. 9. The Governor in Council has, therefore, heen obliged to disavow the treaty in the post explicit terms ; and the more dearly to mark his disapprobation of the whole proceedingpart V-Chap. XXXIII. 145 \e has been pleased to remove you from your appointment of Resident at Bushire and to direct you to return to Bombay, delivering overcharge of the factory at Bushire to the Surgeon at the Residency, and of all instructions relating to the general politics of the Gulf to Lieutenant-Colonel Kennett. 289. The following is the draft of a letter, a Persian translation of which was signed and addressed by the Governor of Bombay to Ilis Hoyal Ilighness Hossein Ali Mirza, the Prince Regent of Pars :— I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Royal Highnepe's letter, and am most sensible of the friendly feelings and grateful for the sentiments of regard with which you are pleased to honour me. The allusions in your Royal Highness s letter to negotiation* with Captain Bruce have since been explained by a treaty forwarded by that gentleman. It is a subject of much concern to this Government to find that Captain Bruce has thui exceeded his powers, and I, therefore, lose no time in apprising Your Royal Highness of tht mistake into which that gentleman has fallen. It is proper to explain clearly to your Royal Highness that Captain Bruce had been merely directed to return to his duty at Bushire, and had received no authority to proceed to Shiraz, and no powers or credentials to enter on any negotiation whatever with your Royal Highness; the treaty which he has concluded is, therefore, his own act, and not that of this Government. I accordingly disavow it, and desire it to be considered exactly as if it had never been written. After this declaration it is unnecessary to discuss the articles of the treaty. 1 appears necessary, however, for me to remark that it is not the intention of this Government to take any part in the claims of the several powers and States of the Persian Gulf further than may be necessary to prevent a renewal of piracy. With respect to the flag said to have been granted to the Attabees, the fact is, that by the treaty concluded by Sir W. G. Keit with all the Arab Chiefs in the Gulf, it is agreed that, for the purpose of distinguishing the pirates from those who abstain from piracy, the latter should carry a white square within % red flag ; this being the case, there can be nothing in the flag to give offence to Persia, as there is not the smallest connection between it and the British flag, nor the smallest pretension to superiority on the part of the British Government. With regard to Kishm, I had long since applied to the Most Noble the Governor- General for his consent for the recall of the detachment, and having now obtained it, the troops have already been ordered to return, and the island to be made over to the Imaum of Maskat,from whom it was received by the British Government; but in doing so, this Gov ernment is actuated by considerations of its own convenience ; and with respect to the claime of the Government of Persia on that island, they have not as yet been proved. The embarrassment Captain Bruce's mistake must lead to is much regretted by thii Government, but I beg leave to assure you that my respect for your Royal Highness and my wish to preserve the friendly relations between the British and Persian Governments undiminished. I trust, therefore, that Your Royal Highness will not allow any distrust to enter your mind on account of this unauthorized and unforeseen proceeding of Captain Bruce. I beg leave to apprize Your Royal Highness that that officer has been recalled to India, and that another gentleman will be appointed to succeed him, who will make it his businesg to cultivate and improve the existing friendship. Your Royal Highness's correspondence will at all times be a source of much gratification and any commissions you may have in the quarter shall be promptly executed. 290. Translation of an Agreement proposed by Sis R oyal H iqeness M ussei# A li M irza through his Minister Z eki K san and discussed between him and W illiam B ruce, Esq., Resident of Bushire, on 8th August 1832, Preamble. As the arrangement and settlement of the affairs of subjects are entrusted to Kings and their Governors, and the prosperity of the States depends upon, the unanimity and friendship existing between Governors of ad joining Provinces for this purpose, the States of Great Britain and Persia entered into terms of amity and good understanding, that the subjects of each and their forces might enjoy tranquillity and prosperity, the Governors of Provinces adjacent had maintained this appearance and had rested satisfied without actually fulfilling them. Two years previous to this it became necessary to suppress the piratical acts committed by the Joasmis (?) for which purpose troops arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and a few acts were committed by them erroneously which did not accord with the good understanding existing with this State, in consequence of which His Royal Highness Hussein Ali Mirza deemed it advisable for the good of his Government to make known146 Part V-Chap. XXXIII. these acts of misunderstanding to the Government appertaining nearest to his own that they might he aware of what had occurred, that some explana tion might be offered for His Royal Highness to act upon, and for this reason deputed Mirza Bunghir, Military Secretary, to proceed to Bombay at the time that the Hon'ble Mount Stuart Elphinstone was Governor of it and of its dependencies, and he came to an explanation with the Ilon'ble the Governor who showed every wish and inclination to preserve the good understanding and for which purpose deputed Captain Bruce as the Hon'ble Campaing's Resident to Bushire as the Government Agent. After his arrival. His Royal Highness directed his attendance and on the 8th of August 1822 or 20th Zilkad, 1237 Hijree, at Shiraz, came to an amicable decision and under standing with Mahomed Zaki Khan, Sirdar and Minister of Ears, the following engagements being agreed upon :— lit.—That the Vakils of the two States enter into friendly discussions and explanations tending to cement the ties of amity and good understanding between the Governors of the adjacent countries. Znd.—The Island of Bahrein which has always been subordinate to the Province of Fars and its possessors, the Beni Attabi Arabs who have of late been unruly and disobedient and had applied to the Commanding Officer of the British forces of a distinguish ing flag. This flag, if it has been granted to be withdrawn, and no assistance to be rendered to be Beni Attabi Arabs, hereafter. Srd.—That such losses as the inhabitants of Linkay and Charrack may have suffered by mistake in the destruction of their vessels, to be restored in kind, if forthcoming, if not, made good in money by the Government Vakil. 4fh t —With regard to Captain Bruce's residing at Bushire, as the Government of Persia had applied for his removal and another officer to be appointed, supposing him to have committed acts contrary to the good understanding between the States, which he having cleared up to the satisfaction of his own Govern ment while Mirza Bunghie was present and shown every inclination to forward the interests of the two Sirkars, the Government deemed it advisable to re-nominate him to his former duties, and His Royal Highness, being equally con vinced, has preferred him being re-appointed to any other officer, and requested it accordingly. The British forces who had taken a position-in an island on the coast of Persia and who had been requested to withdraw. As the Hon'ble the Governor of Bombay has expressed a wish for their being allowed to remain for a time for the sake of appearances and benefit derived thereby. In consequence His Royal Highness deemed it advisable for the safety and tranquillity of the Gulf, and to preserve the intercourse free and uninterrupted, has complied for the term of five years and until a naval equipment sufficient for the purpose can be gradually collected on the following conditions :— —That if previous to the five years His Royal Highness should have collected a naval force sufficient to ensure the tranquillity of the Gulf and will pledge himself to that effect, the British forces to withdraw on the assurance and pledge being given. That if the British forces should be considered too great, with a view to economy, they are to be reduced and an equivalent force to be furnished by His Royal Highness under the orders of an officer to encamp on the island and to attend to their wishes and desires. 3 r( j. The British and Persian forces to take positions on any island on the coast of Persia, the climate of which(m Part V-Chap. XXXIII. 147 may be found to be the best and which His Royal Highness may nominate and deem advisable. 4t/i.—Should His Royal Highness during the period the British troops are stationed in the Gulf require the services of one or two cruizers from the station to proceed to any of the islands or ports of Persia, they are to be furnished, and particularly so on the present occasions when an expedition is in contemplation against Bahrein to reduce it to obedience, His E.oyal Highness promising after the service may be over to dismiss the vessels with proper honour and respect. Should the vessels be required beyond the period of 40 days, provisions and necessaries to be supplied by His RiOyal Highness, in failure of which the vessels are at liberty to return. oth. —Such vessels and stores as His Royal Highness may require, to be at liberty to purchase them in any of the ports of India without molestation from the Govercment. The Vakils of the two Governments who now exchange engagements agree to present them to their respective Governments for their consideration and approbation, and for the guidance of each other in case of change of Governors. 17 %148 Part 7— Chap. XXXVI. CHAPTER XXXIV. REMOVAL OF Mr. BIllJCE AXD APPOINTMENT OF LIEU TENANT M AC LEOD AS RESIDENT AT BLSHIRE. INS TRUCTIONS TO THE NEW RESIDENT AS TO THE BRITISH POLICY IN THE GULF-NOVEMBER 1823. 291. After the recent unathorized proceedings of Mr. Bruce, especially in Volume 91 Of 1822,page 358. connection with the treaty concluded by him with the Shiraz Government, Gov ernment had, as we have seen, to remove him from the Residency and appointed in his place Lieutenant John McLeod, who had been employed in various capacities in the recent expeditions on the Gulf. The instructions issued to him by the Bombay Government as to the line of policy to be followed by him on their letter No. 1584, dated 12th November 1822, is an important document and printed therefore at length below :— The Honourable the Governor in Council having been under the necessity of removing Captain Bruce from the situation of Resident at Bushire, for the reasons stated in the enclosed copy of a correspondence with that officer, has been pleased to select you to succeed Captain Bruce under the designation of Resident in the Gulf of Persia. 2. In furnishing you with the necessary instructions for the regulation of your conduct, it is necessary to premise that they embrace two objects ; one, immediate, arising out of the effect to be apprehended from Captain Brace's unauthorized proceedings, and the other of a permanent nature connected with your office of Resident and the maintenance of the policy which it has been determined to pursue with the view of keeping down piracy in the Persian Gulf. 3. The powers whose reliance on our good faith are likely to be shaken and their alarms excited, by the agreement entered into by Captain Bruce, are the Imam of Maskat and the Uttubi tribe of Arabs in general, and especially the Shaik of Bahrein, an island which it has been an object equally with Persia and the State of Maskat to reduce and annex to its sovereignty, whilst a considerable degree of jealousy in establishing an ascendency over the Persian Gulf has long subsisted between those two Powers. 4. The effect of Captain Bruce's proceedings is calculated to impress the Imam of Maskat and the Shaik of Bahrein with an apprehension that, instead of observing a jjerfect neutrality in the Gulf, and limiting our interference to a control of all measures likely to lead to a renewal of piracy founded on Major-General Sir William Kier's treaties, we have thrown our whole influence in the scale in tavor of Persia in support of its general views of supremacy over every island and possession in the Gulf of Persia. 5. The enclosed letters from the Honourable the Governor to the Imam of Maskat and the Shaikh of Bahrein are intended to remove any doubts or apprehensions which the conduct of Captain Bruce may have excited in that respect, it will be your duty to enforce on the conviction of those Chiefs the assurances contained in those letters j and of the determination of the British Government strictly to adhere to the line of policy it has observed in its relations towards the different powers in the Gulf, unaffected, in the slighest decree, by Captain Bruce's agreement which having been unauthorized and disavowed lias of course' no existence. Yon W\\\ to them that our views are not at all changed by withdrawinq our troops from Kishm which is to he restored to the Imam of Maskat as the power with whose permission we occupied it, 7. The Governor in Council anticipates your experiencing a greater degree of difficulty in removing the dissatisfaction of the Prince of Sepiraz in the disavowal of an agreement so decidedly favourable to Persia than you will meet with in reconciling the Imam of Maskat and the Shaik of Bahrein to the integrity of our views. 8. Should you find His Royal Highness at all disappointed at our disavowal of Captain Bruce's agency on this occasion, you will express your regret that His Royal Highness did not demand from that officer his authority for proposing an agreement so much at variance with our policy before he directed his minister to enter into the negotiation. You will refer to the whole tenor of our communications to the Persian Government and of our conduct since the occupation of Kishm and our negotiations with the Arab States for proof that the permanent suppression of piracy, and the conservation of the peace of the Gulf by the friendly interposition of our power and influencey has been alone the ruling principle of thatPart V—Chap. XXXIV. 149 policy. You will explain that it is our determination to persevere in that policy notwith standing the removal of our troops from Kishm, which has been restored to the Imam of Maskat under whose sanction we occupied it ; and that the pretensions to its sovereignty remain precisely in the same state as at the period when that sanction was granted. 9. The enclosed copy of a Minute by the Honourable the Governor and of the letters addressed to His Majesty's Envoy at Tehran and to Captain Bruce will make you fully acquainted with the circumstances connected with the claim to the value of some boats belonging to the Persian ports of Linga and Charrack which were captured by His Majesty's Navy in the last expedition on the ground of their being connected with the Joassmee pirates. 10. You will perceive the determination of the Governor in Council long since formed to compensate the owners ; you will proceed to give effect to that determination in the mode already prescribed without any reference to the stipulation contained in Captain Bruce's agreement for that purpose, and in direct communication with the sufferers : should you experience any difficulty on the subject which a reference to the Envoy at Tehran may not remove, you will apply for further instructions to the Governor in Council. 11. With respect to the nature of your permanent local functions at Bushire they are exclusively of a commercial character to protect the British trade against the exaction of higher rates of duty than have been fixed by the Government of Persia, and all merchant ships belonging to subjects of the British Government trading to the port of Bushire and all British subjects residing or trading under the protection of the British jiag in the lawful prosecution of their commercial dealings, 12. Our relations with the Imam of Maskat, viVzxq we have a native Agent, are best explained by the enclosed copy of an agreement negotiated with that State in 1798 by the late Mahomed Ali Khan and subfequently confirmed with Sir John Malcolm in 1800. It is also necessary to put you in possession of the correspondence between the Imam of Maskat and the Bombay Government and recently between His Highness and Captain Morseby of His Majesty's Ship Mendi respecting the abolition of the slave trade carried on by foreign European Powers. 13. 1 also enclose the copy of a correspondence with the Imam regarding the terms oil which the Chiefs of the Beni Boo Ali Arabs have been permitted to return to Arabia, as the British Government is in some respect answerable for their personal safety. 14!. There is nothing in onr relations with M[askat that requires any special instruction^ except the renewal on your part of an assurance that His Highness will continue to observe that friendly connection with the British Government which has hitherto proved reciprocally advantageous to the two States. It will, however, be essential that you should advise the Imam of Maskat, in whatever countenance or protection he may afford to Ram ah bin Jauber, who was formerly Chief of Khore Hussen and notorious for his former depredations, if not on the British at least on other traders, to guard against his renewing his former courses or disturbing the tranquillity of the Gulf. Sugsan bin Eahmah, Chief of Hatt and Faleii, late of Russul-Khyma, Razib bin Ahmed, Chief of Jezirat at Hannah. Shakhout, Chief of Ahou Dhabyu, Hussan bin AH, Chief of Zyah, Mahomed bin Raza bin Jaal, Sheik of Dubey-Zaud bin Seyf, uncle of Sheik Mahomed Sultan bin Saggur, Chief of Shargah. Seid Abdul J alii bin Seid Yas-vakeel of Sheik Solymann bin Ahmed and Sheik Abdullah bin Ahmed, of the family of Khalifa Sheiks of Bahrein Rashid btn Hamid, Chief of Eimar. Abdullah bin Rashid, Chief of Uman-ttl- Kowyn. 16, It is necessary that you should have a personal interview with those Chiefs with thef view of conciliating and confirming them in the disposition they have hitherto manifested to conform to their engagements: you will explain to them that a confidence in the continuance of that disposition has led us to withdraw our troops from Kishm which was from the first a temporary arrangement, that a squadron of cruizers will still be maintained in the Gulf to preserve its tranquillity, which will occasionally visit their posts to uphold the friendly intercourse that has been carried on since the conclusion of those treaties, and that you will yourself occasionally visit them with similar views. 17. You will hereafter be furnished with copy of the instructions under which the maritime control over the piratical ports is to be conducted on the removal of the force from Kishm. They will be sufficiently full and explicit and supersede the necessity for any further orders on this branch of your duty; you will, however, concert with Lieutenant-Colonel Kennett the best means of furnishing the Arab vessels with the flags and papers prescribed by the general treaty, and communicate the result to the Arab Chiefs concerned in their observance. They should be granted or renewed either by yourself or under your authority by the Officer Commanding the squadron whichever may prove the most convenient to the Arab traders : you will in fact consider and suggest the most effectual mode for enforcing thef provisions of those treaties now that the control has been transferred from Kishm to Bushirt.- Should it be necessary to carry on offensive operations against any Chief who may show » ir i 15. With the Petty Arab States enumerated in the margin Major General Sir William Keir entered into Treaties for the abandonment of piracy in the last expedition, to which they have hitherto satisfactorily adhered. You will receive from Lieu tenant Colonel Kenuet the records of our proceed ings with those States, from which, with the result of a personal communication with that officer, you will ascertain the nature of our intercourse with those principalities and the prospect there is of effecting a complete reformation in the piratical habits of the Chiefs.150 Part V-Chap. XXXIV. disposition to recur to piracy, they must be confined to the destruction o£ the boats and on no account be carried on on shore. 18. Those treaties you will observe are limited to the petty States in the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. As the Government of Persia has pledged itself to be answerable for the conduct of the Chiefs on the Persian side, your vigilance and those of the Commanding Officers of cruizers must therefore be constantly exercised in observing their proceedings anJ should any piratical acts be committed by any boats or vessels belonging or resorting to those ports or should they adopt any measures directly tending to the revival of piracy, you will, on the fact, being fully established, represent the circumstance to the Government of Fars (to which all the possessions of Persia, including Bushire in the Persian Gulf, are imme diately subordinate) and demand reparation, and should your representation lead to no satis factory result, you will forward your proceedings to the British Envoy at Tehran and to the Governor in Council. 19. It is desirable that you should suggest a plan for securing authentic intelligence of the proceedings of the several Chiefs on the coast and a ready communication with them should they appear of a questionable character. You will adopt the plan at once if not attended with much expense. The mode in which the piratical Chiefs purchase their boats or materials for constructing them and the sources whence they are supplied with arms and ammunition for their equipment, it is also desirable to ascertain. 20. With the political affairs of Persia, with its disputes with the Imam of Mash at or the different Powers in the Gulf, or the hostilities of these with each other unconnected with piracy, the Resident has no concern whatever, you will therefore maintain on the occurrence of any such disputes or national warfare the strictest neutrality, 21. The Governor in Council is desirous that you should make yourself fully acquainted with the constitution of the different petty States into which both sides of the Persian Gulf are divided, the nature of their relation to each other or their subordination to any higher authority, either as tributaries or dependent branches of the sovereign State including ^the several islands in the Gulf, ascertaining and reporting any changes that may occur in the Chiefs either by death or otherwise, and the characters of their successors or any principality affecting its original relation with or dependence on another State; affording in fact a succinct history of each as events may arise. 23. Your personal salary has been fixed at rupees twelve hundred per mensem. S,600 per mensem for a table and 8600 for office establishment and house-rent including boats, crews and fil5U contingencies exclusive of presents, the average amount of which for the last four or five years you will ascertain and limit your expenditure on that account accordingly. On your quitting your station to visit the different ports in the Gulf or proceeding on duty to Shiraz which may be necessary with the view of executing those instructions, you will draw rupees five hundred (31500) per mensem as additional salary until your return. Your expenses by land or to the Commander of cruizers on which you may embark, being a separate charge. Should you have occasion to proceed to Shiraz in the execution of these instructions, you will report the circumstance to the Envoy at Tehran and be guided by any suggestions he may offer on the occasion. 23. The Superintendent of the Marine has been directed to furnish you with a suitable accommodation in my vessel under orders for the Gulf. You should proceed direct to Kishm or to Maskat in the first instance and regulate your measures according as you may ascertain to be the effect of Captain Bruce's negotiations, should they not have been promul gated nor any alarm been excited in the Gulf by a knowledge of the terms, it would be advisable that you should repair to Bushire and receive charofe of the Residency and after entering into the prescribed explanation with the Prince of Shiraz in disavowing the ao-ree- ment, carry into effect the other part of these instructions having relation to Maskat, Bahrein and the Arab States which are parties to Sir William Keir^s treaty.Part V-Chap.

REXDEZVOtS OF THE NAVY $ AT MOGOO BAY SHIFTED TO BASSIDORE- 1833-1833. 292 The following instructions were issued on 20th Jsovemher 1 ; 22 to the Senior Officer, Honourable Company's Vol.91 of 1822,p. 321. Marine in the Persian Gulph, tor the arrangement and distribution of the force under his orders for guarding against piracies and being watchful of the vessels navigating those seas :— It being intended to bring down the garrison, and the whole of the llritish EstahHsh- ment from the Island of Kishm to Bombay, as also to withdraw We Honourable Company's cruisers from that station, it has been deemed expedient to make the port of Muscat the general rendezvous for the Honourable Company's cruizers accordingly. As when the military force shall have left Kishm it will become douV)ly incumbent on the Honourable Company's marine not only to be watchful of those ports from which pira tical vessels were formerly fitted but to be vigilantly alert in keeping down piracies in every part of the Persian Gulph, and in order more effectually to obtain this desirable end, it will be necessary to make such a division of the cruisers as may be best calculated for the purpose. I therefore recommend the following arrangement as the most efficacious manner of employing the force under your orders. Contemplating tliat you will have six of the Honourable Company's cruisers for the service of the Persian Gulph {exclusive of the two surveying vessels). I conceive the e should be three of the cruisers (one of each class) constantly cruizing off the Ports of Rumps, Kasselkyma, Shaqra and Dubay, and that a fourth should be frequently out and in the Port of Muscat during those mouths that the pirates (if any) would put to sea. That a fifth cruiser be passing from Muscat to Bushire and Bussorah in order to give convoy or convey despatches from the one port to the other. And that the sixth vessel be sent to Bombay with despatches or other emergent occasion or for refit as might be required. As the successfully guarding the Gulph and preventing piracies in that navigation will oreatly depend and watchful observation of the movements of the inhabitants in the ports on the Arabian shore. The Commanders of Cruisers should frequently repair to the ports of the Arabs who are parties to the Treaty negotiated by Sir William Keir, and land for the purpose of ascertaining how they conform to its stipulations and be careful to conduct themselves with the utmost decree of cordiality and conciliation towards the Chiefs. If any appearance of the renewal of piracy should manifest itself, he should in the first instance remonstrate with the Chief and require its discontinuance, failing in which, measures must be adopted for destroying any armed boats that may be found at the port, but no operation is under any circumstances to be carried on shore. Should the Commander in his visits to the ports beforementioned observe any vessels building, or equipping which he may conceive of a suspicious description, he will report the circumstances to you and it must be your care to have a watchful eye over such port and prevent such vessel making her escape to sea maintaining a constant communication on all subjects of importance with the Political Agent in the Gulph. On all occasions of examining vessels at sea to avoid delay or unnecessary interruption to the fair and licensed trader, and in cases where suspicion attaches, the crews should be treated with mildness and moderation unless by violence on their part they induce severity in part of the cruizers. Should any vessel be detained on the grounds of her being piratically employed, imme diate notice of the case with all its attendant circumstances should be communicated to the Political Agent in the &lt;iulph and his sentiments obtained as to the disposal of such vessel, and you are yourself and all the Commanders of the Honourable Company's cruisers in the Gulph to attend to all instructions from the Resident in the Persian Gulph. As it is most desirable that the marine force should be kept at all times as efficient as practicable, it is recommended that not more than one cruiser be sent to Bombay at the same time (unless on a case of emergency) and at the return to the Gulph of such cruiser the next in order of refit be sent when occasion may requirp. You will be careful to keep me informed of your proceedings and those of the Honourable Company's cruizers under your orders from time as occasions may offer.152 Part V—Chap. XXXV. 293. The correspondence printed below slio^s the measures taken in fur therance of the instructions of Government given above in their letter to the Resident, No. 1584, dated 12th November 1822, and the Instructions of 20th November 1822:— Dated BnsMre, the 13th February 1823. From— M b . F. F aithfuli ,, Commander, Senior Marine Officer, Persian Gnlph, To—H bnbt M beiton , Esq., Superintendent of Marine. I have the honour to enclose for your information a copy of a letter received from the Resident in the Gulph^ which, with the instructions received from you, have been my ^uide in Iraming- the orders to the cruizers stationed off the piratical ports, copy of which orders I also inclose. The Resident in the Gulph being- ready to embark from Bas«adore on the 12th of January he was received on board the Ternate and sailed for the piratical ports accompanied by the Juror a and Antelope. On leaving Sharga the Resident wished to proceed between the Islands to Bidda and to communicate with the surveying vessels and then proceed to Bahrain, as this passage was quite unknown. I deemed it expedient to take a pilot at Sharga and discharge liim at Hahrain. It having become necessary to fit on some port where the xenior officer might be found not only to carry on the detail, hut also to communicate readily with the Resident in the Gulph, 1 have chosen Mogoo Bay, as affording good anchorage, being near the piratical ports and directly in the track for ships passing up and down the Gulph : should this arrangement be approved it will enable me to conduct with some certainty the movements of the cruisers 00 ^ ie Gulph station. At present I am subject to some inconvenience from not knowing where 1 may meet vessels coming from Bombay. The cruisers are at present disposed of in the following manner : Aurora on cruise off nump Rasalkhima, Zezerett U1 Humra and Amulgaween ; Antelope on cruise off Aymaun Sharga, and Debai; ^Aercury I hope before this off Boothabee and adjacent Islands. Teign' mouth disposed of by Captain French of His Majesty's sloopin Bussora River. I shall remain at Bushire to water and refresh the crew of the Ternate until the 18th instant when I shall proceed first to Magoo to establish a native agent there for the Resident in the Gulph and then join the vessels off the piratical coast and look particulary after Suadin Bin Zal. When these services shall have been performed I intend proceeding to Muscat to give the vessels and water casks a repair and to refit the rigging. T have the pleasure to submit such observations as I have made on my late visit to the piratical ports accompanied by Lieutenant Macleod, Resident in the Gulph. Dated Bassadore, the 10th January 1823. % From I. M acleod , Resident, Persian Gulph, To Ihe Senior Officer Commanding the Honourable Company's vessels in the Gulph of Persia. As you are now about to carry into effect the instructions of Government for cruizing on the pirate coast, it becomes necessary that measures should be immediately adopted for revising and renewing the registers to be carried by the vessels of the Maritime Arabs who are parties to the treaty negotiated by'Sir W. G. Keir. 2. You will in the first instance have the goodness to specify what size and description of vessels you consider it necessary and practicable to register, and it will be intimated to the 'lifferent Chiefs that the registers of all such,vessels must be immediately renewed, but that smaller boats are not required to be registered. ^ . wou ^ ^commend that the officers stationed to cruise off the pirate ports should each be intrusted with the particular charge of a certain number of adjoining ports, so that the three cruisers should together embrace the whole of the pirate coast. 4. A list will be furnished by each Chief describing all his boats which require registry, ^ nether he may wish for a register to enable them to go to sea at that time or not, I would .hen suggest that the registers should be granted in the following manner. 5. The Commander of the cruiser in charge of the particular port should either land himself or send an intelligent officer on shore to inspect the boats in person, and compare them with the Shaik s list, writing a description of each in English according to the usual form of the Register which he will keep for future information and forward a copy to you, the Chief will then furnish separate registers in Arabic, under his own seal, for such vessels as he may wish to send to sea during the year which will be compared and filed up below, and signed by the Commander of the cruiser, but the register shall not be valid uutil they shall have been countersigned either by you or by me, and must therefore be retained until your next visit, or returned to the Chief to be forwarded, as the case may be, for countersignature, 6. You are authorized to grant or refuse at your discretion all registers which may be applied for, in communication with the officer in charge of the particular port to which the boat may belong; and you will send a list or copy of all Registers which you may issue for my information in the event of any urgent case, in which a Chief may desire a register for a ouat, which he wishes to despatch immediately for purposes evidently pacific and where delay would be seriously mconvenieut, the officers, on the cruising stations may bePart V—Chap. XXXV. 153 authorized at their discretion to grant a temporary pass for the present voyage, until a regular register can be procured from you or me. 7. When circumstances require that any of the cruising vessels should leave her station the Commander will take an early opportunity on his return, of landing at each of the ports, or sending on shore to ascertain, what vessels may have sailed or arrived during his absence, and in the event of any having arrived without registers, he will warn the Shaik of the danger of his infraction of the treaty and report the occurrence to you or me, after making particular enquiry as to the circumstance of the case of each vessel. 8. The present registers to be held good until the new registers shall have been issued but no longer, excepting in the case of any vessels returning from trading voyages, on which they had previously sailed under their former passes, the registers will be valid for one year only, and will be renewed annually when the old register mu^t be given up. 9. It is hoped that when the reiristers shall once have been issued as here recommended- no difficulties will occur in renewing them, and that the occasional inspection of the ports will enable every officer to give a pretty correct account at any time of all the boats belonging to each of the ports under his particular charge. 10. I am not yet prepared to furnish you with any more particular instructions on other points, than those which have been issued to you in the Marine Department, but 1 am parti cularly directed by Government to warn you against making any attack on Chiefs not piratical under the operation of the 9th paragraph of the Superintendent's last inetiuctions, and you will therefore be careful to avoid committing hostilities in any case short of piracy. 11. Arrangements will, if possible, be made for providing a native agent at some of the principal ports, who will give you every information, assi -t in procuring occasional supplies, and alt-o act as interpreter when required, in the meantime the officer may be authorized to employ for the time such persons as they may require to enable them to make out the necessary list of boats, the expense of which will be defrayed on their preferring a contingent bill through you. Instructions to the Commanders of Cruisers stationed off the Piratical Ports. You will in the cruiser under your command take under your inspection and watch the ports named in the margin. You will apprise the Shaiks of these ports that it is necessary they should renew the registers of all boats excepting those employed for the purpose of fiahmg ; and you should either land yourself or send an officer on shore, and require of the Shaik to furnish you with a list of all boats belonging to his ports, a copy of which should be kept on board and one sent to me. The Shaiks having furnished their lij-t and an English description &lt; f each boat irom actual inspection written on it he (the Shaik) should then furnish separate registers in Arabic under his own seal for such vessels as he may require to send to sea for the year which you will compare and fill up and siyn ; but these registers are not t&lt;&gt; be valid until counter signed either by the Resident in the Gulph, or the Senior Marine officer, and must therefore be retained until my next visit to the coast; or until you are apprised that 1 am to be found in Ma goo Bay; in the latter case the Shaik must send a boat over \uth the registers for countersignature. In the event of any urgent case in which a chief may desire to send a boat to sea for purposes evidently pacific, and where delay would be seriously inconvenient, you are authorized to grant a register or pass f.&gt;r the particular voyage, which must be expressly stated in the register, and you are also at liberty to refuse a register to any boat that may appear to you suspicious, or likely to be improperly employed and to take the earliest oppor tunity of informing me of it. When circumstances require that you quit your station either by stress of weather oi for supplies, you are to take the earlie&gt;t opportunity of ascertaining what boats have put to sea during your absence and require from the Sliaik an account of all such, and should it appear to you that any boats have left the port for improper purposes, you are to warn the Shaik of the danger of his infraction of tbe treaty, and to report the occurrence to me or to the Resident in the Gulph should the opportunity be more convenient. The present registers to be held good until the new register shall have been issued but no longer excepting in the case of any vessels returning from a trading voyage, on whicn they had previously sailed under their former passes. The registers will be valid for one year only and will be renewed annually w T heD the old registers must be given up. On all occasions of examining vessels at sea delay should be avoided, and where suspicion attaches the crews should be treated with mildness and moderation unless by violence on then part they induce severity on yours, and should you detain any boat on the grounds or hei being piratically employed, immediate notice of the case with all its attendant circumstances should be communicated to me for the information of the Resident in the Gulph, and you are required to attend to any instructions you may receive from him. On your visits to the Chiefs parties to the treaty made by Sir William Grant Keir you are to preserve tbe present friendly footing and to treat them with the greatest degree .&gt;t154 Part V-Chap. XXXV. cordiality and conciliation, and if any appearance of a renewal of piracy should manifest itself, you should remonstrate with the Chief and require its discontinuance, failing in which you are to report the circumstances fully, that measures may be adopted for destroying any armed boats; but no operations under any circumstances are to be carried on on shore. The cruisers employed on this station are to be entirely separate in the control of the several ports entrusted to their charge, and to make their reports direct to the senior officer, and it is hoped that in a short time tlie Commanders will be well acquainted with the number of boats, men, etc., of the ports under their inspection possess and that they will be able to lurnish the senior officer with the best information, as well as suggesting any measures that may appear to them as likely to prevent the occurrence of piracy. W hen a cruiser shall be relieved on her station, she is to deliver over all papers, etc., connected with it, and to furnish the relieving officer with every information, as well as with a copy of these instructions. An arrangement will, if possible, be made by the Resident in the Gulph for providing a native Agent at some of the principal ports who will give } ou every information, and assist in procuring you occasional supplies, and also act as interpreter .when required; in the mean time you are authorised to employ such persons as you may require to enable you to make out the list of boats, and also to have such boats as may be absolutely necessary in visiting the back waters, the expense of which will be defrayed on your preferring a contingent bill on the Resident in the Gulph, through the senior officer. hen the arrives on the station she is to relieve the vessel most in want of provisions (either Antelope or Teignmouth) or in the event of joining the station before the Teignmoufh she is to take charge of the ports named in the margin and to be furnished with a copy of these instructions. In the event of a cruiser being obliged to leave her statioh and go to Muscat for supplies, it is expected there will be as little delay as possible but when regularly relieved greater extent of time will be permitted. The senior officer intends to go to Mogoo immediately after landing the Resident at Bushire, but does not anticipate being there before the end of February, he will jiot make any stay at Magoo but revisit this coast without delay. F. FAITHFULL, Commander, S. M. Officer, Persian Gulph. H. C. C T ebbtatb, Off S habqa; The 19th January 1823. 294. The above correspondence having been submitted by Mr. Meriton to the^Government of Bombay, they entirely approved of the disposition of the cruisers made by Captain Faithfull, as well as the instructions issued to their Commanders. Ihe selection of the Mogoo Say for establishing a native Agent on the part of the Resident in the Persian Oulf and as the place of rendezvous /or erasers, in their joining the senior officer, seemed to the Governor in Council under all circumstances to be judicious, and the Superintendent of the Marine was asked to direct the Commanders of all the cruizers bound to the Gulf from Bombay to proceed thither in the first instance (Bombay letter No. 351, dated 18th March 1823). 295. In forwarding to the Bombay Government certain despatches received Volume 37-132 of 1823. fr( ^ m Sir fleni T Willock, the Eesident pointed out that Sir Henry had expressed his opinion that our rendezvous in Mogoo Bay was likely to he received toith great jealousy hy the Persian Government, which was anxious to construe the 11th article of the Definitive Treaty into a stipulation that none of our ships of war could anchor in any Persian port without the express permission of that Government. A house had been engaged at Mogoo for a Public Store Dep6t, but ihxiy page 476. in tlieir letter No. 1104, dated 10th Sep tember 1823, the Bombay Government directed the Resident to give it up if the Persian Government objected, and to mskv B assidore the rendezvous of the cruisers and obtain there a house for reception of marine stores. 296. In October 1823, in view of the Persian objection to our making Ibid, page 475. Mogoo Bay a rendezvous for our cruisers, the Bombay Government instructed Lieutenant McLeod not to establish the rendezvous of the cruisers again in the Fersian territory without previously consulting His Majesty's representative at Teheran (letter No. 1126, dated 3rd October 1823).Part V—Chap. XXXVI, 155 CHAPTER XXXVI. AFFAIllS OF THE PERSIiX GULF: LIEUTENANT MACLEOD'S KEPOllT, 1833. 297. The following report of Lieutenant Macleod, Political Resident in the Persian Q-ulf, is freqaantly quoted, and is perlups the most exliaustive and interesting account of the state of Arab Tribes about the close of the first quarter of the 19th century (No. 8 ; dated 27th February i823) I have the honour to report my proceedings during my visit to the Arabian ports of the Gulf for which I left Bassadore on the 12th January 1823. 2. On reaching Ramz I found that the Sheikh of that place who signed the treaty with Sir Williams Grant Keir has been deposed S eik o vamz. through the influence of Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur and succeeded by a young man named Mihomed bin Abdul Rahman, whose father had formerly been Sheikh, until superseded by the late Sheikh Hussain bin Ali, who is now at Sharga. The young man excused himself from visiting me on board the ship, but sent his head man to whom I fully explained the purposes of my visit, and the arrangements which were to be made as directed in my instructions. He expressed his master's determination to abide by the treaty, and his readiness to comply with any measures which we might think fit to adopt in fulfilment of its engagement. 3. Ras-ul-Khima is entirely subject to Sultan bin Suggur, whose brother Sheikh . jr.. Mahomed has been placed by him in charge of the Government. The former Sheikh Hossain bin Rama also resides there. The inhabitants, who have returned to the place, have established themselves on the beach, on the east 4de of the black-water, op[K)site to the former town, the whole of which remains in ruins, and deserted. The new town consists of good many huts built of reeds, with only one or two houses of mud. The creek still serves as a harbour for their boats. 4. As the Sheikh's people were very anxious to impress us with the idea that the whole coast from Ramss to Sharga was entirely subject to Sultan bin Suggur, I thought it necessary to explain that although this might be the case, yet that each Chief, whether dependent or otherwise, must hold himself answerable for the vessels belonging to his own port. 5. After visiting the town and receiving every assurance of the most friendly disposition, on the part of Sultan bin Suggur and his brother, I returned on board and proceeded to J ezirat-ul-Humra. 6. Sheikh Quezeeb bin Ahmed or Jezirat-ul-Humra is dead and has been succeeded by 7 • t tt - Sheikh Muhzim bin Abdul Rahman Suggu : the Sheikh himself was absent at Mascat, but his son Mahomed bin Muhzim came on board. He acknowledged most fully the general obligation of the treaty, but seemed very ignorant of its particular conditions, since he admitted that although he had two boats in trading voyages, neither of them had either pass or colours; and he seemed quite unconscious of the impropriety of this neglect, or the danger to which hig vessels were exposed. On my explaining the purpose of my visit, he promised faithfully to abide by his engagements, and furnished both of his vessels for registry. He acknowledged generally the supremacy of Sultan bin Suggur, but declared that he considered himself fully amenable to us for all his actions in respect to his treaty with the English Government. 7. The Sheikh of Umal Guwyun, Abdulla bin Rashed, is the same who signed the treaty. He brought a copy of it with him, and assured me that he would not fail to abide by it ; he acknowledged the supremacy of Sultan bin Suggur, in the same manner as the Sheikh of Jezirat-ul-Humra, and at the same time asserted his own responsibility for the vessels of his port. 8. On approaching Ejman, which is the next port, I received a message from the Sheikh Rashid bin Humid entreating my interference to protect him from the attacks of Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur, who he alleged had collected the tribe of Beniyas to assist in overpowering him. Next day the Sheikh himself came off, and repeated to me in the most earnest manner his complaints of the aggressions of Sultan. He represented that his only offence was his alliance with the Imam of Mascat, who is at enmity with Sultan, that he had never been in any shape subject to that Chief, and never would submit to his authorifcy; that Sultan had committed various acts of aggressions against him even at sea, which his regard for the treaty with us alone prevented him from retaliating upon him. 9. I told him although it was our anxious wish to prevent hostilities, yet that we could not desire any one to refrain from defending himself when attacked, that we had nothin g to do with their quarrel, so long as they did not disturb the peace of the sea, but that sue h156 Part V—Chap. XXXVI was the risk that these disorders would lead to the revival of piracy, that I would enquire into the subject, and endeavour to induce Sultan bin Sugjur to desist, if I found him the aggressor; and that at all events I should use every effort to put a stop to aggressions at sea if possible. The Sheikh promised to abide strictly by all our arrangements in respect to the treaty, and returned to the shore. 10. I was anxious to see as much of Sultan Suggur as possible, and therefore proceeded Sultan bin Suggur. J and ® t . , 0 p n ^ at Sharga, accompanied by Laptain raithfuli and the other Commanders of the cruizers. The Sheikh received us very well, gave us a house and a tent, and supplied us with everything we required during our stay of two days on shore. 11. This Chief is certainly by far the most powerful and ablest of all the Sheikhs from Ramss to Bahrein. He entered at great length on the subject of the treaty, and urged strongly his supremacy over all the other Chiefs of the coast, which he alleged had been confirmed by Sir William Grant Keir by a special agreement which he produced. This paper proved to be the preliminary treaty, by which the Sultan engaged to deliver up the towns, guns and vessels at the port of Sharga, Imam, Umal Guwyn and their dependencies. As the Sheikh quoted this as a confirmation by our Government of his rights over all those ports, and of his obligation of responsibility for their conduct and observance of the treaty, I told him that it did not appear to me to confer or confirm any right whatever, but merely to acknowledge the state of things as it stood at the time of the agreement. 12. He next adduced, in proof of his positive rights over the ports, and particularly in justification of his present proceedings against Rashid bin Humid, a letter from the Chiefs, said to be a duplicate of one addressed by them to the Hon^ble the Governor last year, in answer I presume to a printed circular to the parties to the treaty which was transmitted to Kishm from the office of Country Correspondence on the ^th Julv 1821. I cannot discover whether this letter ever was actually seat to Bombay or not; and ^Colonel Kennett does not seem to have been aware of its contents j but the duplicate which I examined had every appearance of authenticity and bore the seals of the Chiefs. 1 have the honour to enclose a copy and translation of it for the information of Government. 13. I informed him tlia-i we did not in any way deny his right over any one who was himself willing to obey him and would consider him as the superior of all who acknowledged him, that we had nothing to do with his dispute for supremacy, but must in such cases look to every one to answer for himself, and that particularly, as far as regarded the stipulation respecting vessels, it was indispensable that each Sheikh, whether subordinate or not, should himself be held responsible for his own port, since references to him on these points would be most inconvenient, and could not be admitted, although they might be acquiesced, and promised to give instructions accordingly. 14. Sultan bin Suifgur expressed great anxiety to be allowed to erect some defences towards the land side o£ the town to repel the Bedouins, who he said took advantage of the defenceless state of the place to come and attack it during the pearl fishing season, when all the men are at sea, and no one left but the women and children. He said he had no wish to erect any work towards the sea, or within gun shot of the shore, and that although he had surrendered his guns and towers to be destroyed by Sir William Grant Keir, yet he had not bound himself not to erect other defences. I told him that under the orders of Government I did not feel myself at liberty to authorize his erecting any works so near the beach as he desired, but that further inland he might build what he pleased, that it was true there was no express stipulation in the treaty against rebuilding their fortifications, but that it was the evident intention and spirit of our proceedings and agreements to prevent it, and that I believed the Sheikhs had themselves acknowledged this right on our part. I however promised to represent the case to Government and obtain orders. 15. Ihe Sheikh next stated that the Imam of Mascat and he were already at hostilities on land, and asked how he was to act in the event of the Imam's attacking his vessels. I replied that I hoped the Imam would not commit any aggression, that I would advise His Highness not to endanger the tranquillity of the Gulf by such proceedings, and that if the Imam should take any of his vessels which weie peaceably trading under our Register, I would remonstrate with His Highness and endeavour it possible, to procure redress. That although we had no right to interfere in their quairels or wars, or even to prevent them from prosecuting just hostilities at sea,^ and still less to forbid any one to defend himself from aggression, provided those hostilities did not load to piracy, yet that we could not in any way countenance them, and must strongly dissuade all parties from them. I explained that our Registers were granted for purposes of peace, not of war, and would not protect any suspicious vessels, and that as in such oases it was hardly possible for our cruizera to distinguish between vessels intended for iawtul war and those whose intentions were piratical, armed boats would often be inevitably exposed to suspicion and even danger, and at any rate to the risk of trouble and detention. 16. On my enquiring respecting his quarrel with Rashid bin Humid Sultan denied all his accusations and complained loudly against him, that after submitting, and solemnly ack- ih wledging his supremacy, he had now thrown off his allegiance, and was stirring up all his enemies against him in concert with tlie Imam of Mascat; that Rashid had always been most hostile to tne Knglish as well as to himself. He declared that he had no intentions against him further than to bring him back to his former engagements which he had broken, and ^eerted his right to do so according to the paper which I bad seen. Under thisPart V-Chap. XXXVI. 157 circumstance I could only repeat my former interferences to avoid extremities, and compromige the di-put-e, which I tear will be of little avail. 17. During a very 1 mg discussion on the subject of the treaty generally, the Saltan quoted the last clause of the tenth article of the treaty, as binding us to protect vessels sailing under its etipulntion ; and to recover any which might be captured from the parties of the treaty by others. I replied that I did not consider the obligarion as going quite so far, but that 1 would interfere as far as I could, to prevent unlawful molestation from power which were not parties to the treaty, and that I would obtain further instructions from Government for my guidance on this head. 18. The Sheikh concluded by assurance of his friendly disposition towards the British Government, his entire acquiescence in the present arrangements, and his determination to abide by the treaty, and by any directions we might i^ive respecting its fulfilment. 19. I have been rather particular in detailing my cornmunicauoa with this Chief ; because it not only shows the views which he took of the subject, but those which formed the basis of my communication generally with all the other Chiefs, in addition to the points adverted to in my instructions. Sheikh Sultan was, however the only one who seemed capable of entering fully into the subject, the rest are very inferior in every respect. 20. The Chiefs of Dubey and Abuthnbi, who were at a short distance inland from Sharga, both visited me at that place : I did not therefore think it necessary to proceed myself to their ports. 21. These Shaikhs are both of the Beni Yas tribe, of whom Sheikh Thanun of Abuthabi is the superior. Sheikh Zaid bin Seyf of Dubey is the same who signed the treaty, to which both promised entire compliance. Sheikn Thanun has fully established his power to the exclu sion of his father Sheikh Shakbut, and his brother Sheikh Mahomed ; the former is said to have submitted to his son, the latter is with another branch of the tribe in the interior. 22. On my enquiring respecting Sonidan bin Zal. who is particularly mentioned in Colonel Rennett's letter to you of the 6th ultimo, No. 42, &gt;heikh Thanun stated that he was his subject, and was somewhere amongst the islands between that place and Abuthabi ; that he has got no fixed place of abode ; but that he would be answerable for his conduct, and would, if 1 plea-ed, recall him either to Abu habi or Dubey and fix him there under his own eye. 1 thought that this would be a very desirable arrangement under the suspicious circumstances of this person, and a-s the proposal was publicly made in the presence of Julian bin iSu-jgur and the Sheikh of Dubev, I requested ^-heikh Thanun to write to Sonidan, and gave him also at his desire a letter to that Chief desiring him to obey the orders of his Sheikh, in addition to which I took a dup'icate of Thanun^s letter tor Sonidan, in case 1 should fall in with him, but in this hope I was disappointed. 23. At Sharga Captain Faithfull completed his arrangements for the stationing of the cruizing vessels, and the renewal of the registry. As they are entirely consonant to the sug gestions offered in my letter to him of the 10th July, and have d mbtless been reported by him to the Superintendent of Marine, it is not necessary that I should trouble Government with the detail in this place. 1 have however to solicit the sanction of Government for the occas sional hire of native boats by the cruizer, which the senior officer deems necessary for landing at times and places when the shin's boats could not land, and also for avoiding the risk of the ship's boats being left on shore, when the ships themselves are blown to sea. 24. We then proceeded through the islands to Bidaa, which we found is subject to y,., Bahrein, and governed by a Sheikh named Buhur bin Intran of the tribe of Abu-o-ainee, all the other Sheikhs having quitted the place. The people seemed to know very little of the conditions of the treaty, and had neither flag nor register, excepting for one boat, which had been procured tnrough the Sheikh of Bahrein. However, they furnished lists of the rest of tiieir boats for registry, and promised to abide by the treaty, which I explained ; but as they are entirely subject to Bahrein, I did not think it necessary to enter very minutely on the subject. 25. On the 27th of January we reached Bahrein and landed at the town of Manama ; we Bahrein two interviews with Sheikh Abdula bin Ahmed, who, though the younger brother, is the manager of all affairs; we also visited the elder brother Sheikh Suleiman at Kuffa where he resides. We stayed several days and were treated with hospitality. 26. In addition to these points of my instructions which were particularly referred to Bahrein, 1 fully explained to Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmed the arrangements that had been made for cruizing off the pirate ports, that the conduct of himself and his subjects had been such as to render such measures of precaution unnecessary in regard to his ports, but that one ship would occasionally visit the island ; and that an officer would be sent for the purpose of revising the registers, and would bring them to me or the senior officer for signature. 1 called his attention to the necessity of observing the strictest conformity to the orders of the treaty, as well at Bahrein as at his other subordinate ports, and particularly at Bidaa, where its condi tions did not seem to be known. He promised that they should be most carefully obseived, wherever his power extended, adding that Bidaa was the only port from which trading vessels sailed. x 2158 Part V—Chap. XXXVI. 27. My chief difficulty was respecting' the dispute with Rama bin JaMr and I Bama bin Jahir. am , t0 sa y ^at my endeavours to effect an „ . . , , adjustment have hitherto been o£ no avail. This affair however will form the subject of a future letter. 28. The Sheikh informed me that a Battile belonging to one of his subjects hai been captured by His Majesty's shin Sophia in consequence of having seized a boat from Bushire in -Bussora nver, on account of a claim which the owner of the Battile had against the Sheikh of Bushire. He declared his entire disavowal and disapprobation ol: tne act and ju^tined himself by saying that he had expressly warned the owner of the boat not to retaliate on any Bushire vesseis which he might meet with. ^ I informed him that until I was made fully acquainted with the circumstances, I could not judge of the merits of the case, but that every Sheikh must nn, a^weraMe for the acts of his subjects, and that if he could not punish them, we must. Ihe Sheikh assented to this, promised to punish the offenders and expressed much anxiety in endeavouring to excuse himself from blame. It was not until my return to this phice that 1 tound the Battile had been carried to Bombay, under circumstances which I have already explained to Government, 29. The Sheikh made great complaints against the Imaum of Mascat, who he said had not only violated his engagements with him, but had abetted Rama bin laher in his un- provoked aggression on his people, although it was only at the I^iaum's entreaty that he had admitted that Chief, who was the ancient enemy of his family, to terms of peace. He at the same time professed the utmost contempt for the Imaum as well as for the Sheikh of Bushire, and the Persians in general as enemies ; and declared that the Utuhis were both able and willing to revenge themselves on the whole of them, but for their peaceable engagements with us. 30. Observing that the Sheikh seemed to consider the adoption of the pacificated fla^ as implying a nearer and more dependent relation with our Government than it really does, I took occasion toexplain to him that it was the Arab, nol the British flag ; but those tribes who were part es to the treaty with us had agreed to distinguish themselves by wearing round the piracy* 1 ^ al0ne embleinaticof P eace ' in token of tlle i r relinquishment 81. Both the Sheikhs were profuse in their assurances of attachment to our Government and promised to abide by their amicable engagements j indeed, the whole of the Sheikhs of the coasts professed their determination to avoid every act which would be an infringement of their gratified W English. I made small pi esents to them all, with which they seemed 32. On our voyage back to Bushire, 1 took the opportunity of violent and continued contrary winds to visit Congoon, and reached this place on the luth February. 33. Having thus detailed my proceedings in execution of the orders of Government, I beg General state of the Gulf. leave to offer for your consideration some further particulars respecting the state of the Gulf, and the condition of its Chiefs. 34. The most prominent character in the Gulf is Sultan bin Suggur. As this Chief |.a« Sultan bin Suggur. hitherto been generally branded with the stamp of nature, it would be presumption in me on so very short Txperience^to hold out^TnThm™at rwiance w^h the senhments which I bdieveaU the British author,ties in the Gulf have from time to time expressed o h.m Yet from personal enquiry on the spot, and from other sources S tstowaUd' vhrtiZl h f togu *P ect Mat offences against us may have been somewhat exaggerated, whatever his _ conduct in other respects, may have been. He is a turbulent and -rr T n ' wa f . driven t0 desperation, partly by the effects of his own misconduct, and hl /J nem ! eS u A 1 . r . 00ted enrnit y ,1as a1 ^ existed between this flmily and that of the Imaum of Mascat, who himself bears the most rancorous hatred towards hinf 0Pr08ed the Imaura ' s views, both by sea and land and h T s Highness through whose representations our opinion of him may probably have in some measure been found, has naturally depicted his character in the blackst colours. 35 - } am T not P r cp ar ed to offer a history of the life of this Chief, far less to excuse hi 3 a tions, but I may remark generally, that as far as my information goes, I believe that he was ot Zul Kh? • P ?« n nT rr d ,,f th £ e Wahabi aod that although he was the EnffS wSfSfthe T aft f r . w . al ' d J s Resented as the particular friend of the ^nghsh when all the rest of the pirates had joined against ns, that I think his alleged trea- HS. 0 T d ^ ImaUrn / Mas( ' at ' lf tru e,nQay perhaps be palliated by the conduct of His ordfrtemlu him'! 6 'I YT* t0 that th e I^aum only espoused his cause in order to make h.m subservient to his own views in Rassel Khyma; and 1 have heard that some bm W ^ f ptracy on Enghsh vessels which have lately been charged to Sultan ^e jmaum of Mascat probably possesses great wealth, but he is extremely weak rSnlt hln'V^ 4114,1 hl,11 ' and 1138 ^ th^m 6Part V—Chap. XXXVI. 159 87. It is therefore of importance both for the interest of His Highness himself, and for the safety of the Gulf, that he should, if possible, a friend with this Chief, but such are the effects of an ancient feud, inflamed by more recent personal animosities, on both sides that it is not to be expected they will refrain from hostilities; and I fear His Highness was inclined to foment dissension amongst the tribes against the Sultan. 88. Sheikh Rashid bin Humid of Ejman is, as noticed in the 8th paragraph of this letter, at war with Sultan bin Suggur. The ostensible cause is a quarrel between two branches of Beni Nara trii'C, one of which is subject to Rashid bin Humid, and the other disputes his authority, and is supported by Sultan bin Sug^ur and the Jawasmis; while the Imaum assists Rashid. I suspect however that the real cause is that Rashid, who was a notorious pirate, and the friend of Kama bin Jabir, after acknowledging: the supremacy of Sultan bin Niggur, has lately disclaimed it; and is either encouraged, or was originally instigated, by the Imaum of Mascat. 39. Sultan bin Suiigur is, as I have before observed, recognized as the superior from Ramss to Sharga excepdng at Ejman. This supremacy is of a very indefinite description and is in fact little more than nominal, since Sultan bin Suggur has certainly very little direct authority over them, and is unable to control their actions ; indeed I doubt if the power of any Sheikh was absolute even in his own tribe. The Chiefs are elected by their own tribes, but Sulfcan bin Suggur seems to have some power in influencing their choice, although he could not impose a Sheikh upon them against their will; they seem in fact to be independent in respect to their own tribes, but acknowledge a general allegiance to Sultan as the head of a superior tribe. They all declared themselves responsible to us for the observance of the treaty in so far as regarded their own ports, and yet on the paper which I have submitted, they acknowledge an entire dependence on Sultan bin Suggur, who has accordingly been in the habit of procuring all their passes, and in fact of transacting everything for them with Colonel Kennett. 1 cannot doubt the authority of this document because I compared the seal with those affixed to Sir William Keir treaty; but it seemed to be of little avail, since one of the Chiefs had already denied it, and the rest seem to be cnly even nominally bound to it; and I never even heard of its existence until I reached Sharga. 40. Sultan bin Suggur is ambitious of reducing the tribes to complete and absolute sub jection and to be considered answerable for the whole of the coast. It is impossible for us to recognize his authority any further than it is obeyed by the other Chiefs, nor can we lend the influence of our name in any way to aid his views; at the same time we cannot directly interfere to prevent him from recovering that authority which he considers his birthright. 41. Although 1 apprehend much danger to the peace of the Gulf from the effects of Sultan's ambition, yet if his power were firmly established, I don't think it would be a matter of regret to us; since if he were well disposed, he would prevent the rest from molesting us, and if not, it were better to have one head to look to than a number of independent pirates to contend with ; his supremacy would prevent hostilities amongst the dependent tribes, who wou.'d otherwise be quarrelling and committing piracies amonir themselves ; and supposing the worst possible case, that he employed the whole power of the coast in piracy, the evil would be still not greater than the individual piracy of each Chief; and the remedy would be easier, siuce this very power would make him more tangible, give him more to lose, and therefore more to dread from our vengeance; whilst it would enable us more easily, by the punishment of the head, to reduce the members to subjection. In the opposite case the advantages of his power are magnified. 42. I do not think that the Sultan is worse than any of the rest of the Chiefs; as is at all events not worse disposed to us; and I am not without hopes that he may yet by his future conduct prove himself worthy of a better character than he has hitherto borne ; but 1 cannot regard him without considerable anxiety when thinking of the effects which may result from his abilities, his power and ambition. 48. I am at a loss what to suggest in respect to his request to be allowed to erect lines towards the land; it would be certainly better than he should not, but at the same time the reasons he pleads are specious and natural, and I am not certain that the work he proposes would at all strengthen the place, or protect its shipping, against the attacks from the sea which is the quarter from which operations ought to be carried on; a wall on the land side only, open to the town, and so constructed as not to defend by its flanks the approach by the creek, or a long shore, would be much less mischievous than the strong houses of the Sheikh. 44. Sultan bin Suggur possesses a great many fine vessels, probably at least thirty, capable of containing from fifty to one hundred men. He is building a large bughla of about 120 tons, for the purpose, it is said, of trading to India. The other Chiefs have very few boats, beyond those employed for fishing, probably none of them has more than three or four. I shall how ever reserve a more particular account of the naval strength of the Jawassimis, until I shall have received the Registers from the senior officer of the Marine. I may however remark that Sultan bin Suggur must, I think, have contrived to secrete almost all his boats at the time of the last expedition, since it is scarcely possible that so many large vessels could have been built by him in so short a time as three yearg. 46. The next in importance is the Chief of Abnthabi, Sheikh Tahnun. This person y*,. - « appears to be the principal Chief of the Beniyas Chef of Ahuthah,. tribe, and the Chief of Duby is subordinate to160 Part V—Chap. XXXVI. him ; they^ aeJcnoioledge the general svjpremacy of the Imanm of Muscat, but are at present in alliance «ith Sultan bin Su^gur. 46. You are already aware that Sheikh Shakbut, the former Chief of Abuthabi, was ex pelled by the Imaum of Mascat, about two years a&lt;:o, and his son Tahnun set up in his stead. Sheikh Mahomed, the brother ot Tahnun, fled to Bidaa, and engaged the services of a Chief named Sonidan bin Zaal; the struj^le led to disorders which have already been explained by Colonel Kennett, and which through the interference of the Imanui of Mascat been put a stop to. Through his influence it would appear that the parties have so i'ar been reconciled, that Sonidan bin Zaal has desisted from his depredations, and Sheikh Mahomed has left Bidaa and retired to the protection of another branch of the tribe in the interior. 47. Sonidan bin Zaal is Sheikh of the Muhasiba branch of the Beniyas tribe. He is a Sonidan bin Zaal. ^ndering Chief, and has no fixed place of abode, but was considered the subject and friend of the Sheikh of Abuthabi, until the accession of Tahnun, when he espoused the cause of Sheikh Mahomed against that Chief. He gained his livelihood by fisliing and piracy, and latterly resided chiefly at Bidaa. In November 1«23 he proceeded to Mascat, where he received some p esent from the Imaum ; and since his return he has I hear gone to establish himself in the Island of Sur Beni Yas which is the southernmost of the o roups lately discovered, and is described by Captain Grubb in his report of the 19th September 1821. He is accompanied by his friend and relation Sheikh Nuhai man; they have nearly a thousand men at their command and possess one fine batille and about fifty fishing boats. 48 These particulars respecting Sonidan I did not learn till after my arrival at Bidaa and Bahrein ; otherwise I should have made a point of finding him out. I am also informed that it is very doubtful whether he will obey Sheikh Tahnun's order, and that he is a very dangerous unsettled character, ready to join in any ditorders that may occur. It is extremely desirable that a person of this description should either be succeeded {sin) to dependence on his lawful (. hief if indeed h* does own allegiance to any one, or that he should be obliged to fix himself in some tangible place of abode, and leave off his present roving life. 49. I intend to write to Sheikh Tahnun, that if Sonidan submits to his authority, it is well; if not, that we should not object to his reducing him by force, provided he really owes him allegiance, but that if he remains quietly at Sur Beni Yas, and does not disturb the peace of the sea, it is better to allow him to settle there; and that we cannot interfere further than to see that he obeys all the articles of the treaty, to which I consider him in any event a party to a certain degree, since he has been furnished with a Register for his boat by Colonel Kennett • but that if he commits any act of piracy we will assift to destroy h im . 50. I shall at the same time request Captain Faithfull as soon as possible to send a cruiser to find Sonidan, to whom 1 shall write to the same effect as to Tahnun, recommending him at the same time to submit to Tahnun. and warning him ; that in any event his renewal of dis orders at sea will draw down our vengeance on him; that if, on the other hand, he chose to live in peace at Beni Yas we will not molest him; but that if he does not settle somewhere, I shall be under the necessity of withdrawing his Register, since we cannot admit to the lawful rights of the treaty, a Chief who persists in leading a wandering life on the high seas, and ac^ in the suspicious manner which he has done. 51. I have also written to the Imaum of Mascat on the subject, and shall be guided by the answers I receive, whether to admit Sonidan formally as a party to the treaty or not; should he commit any fit disorders I shall be possibly obliged to recommend an attack on him. 52. The Sheikh of Abuthabi and Duby profess to be very well disposed to our Government: they both seem to be more of pastoral and military habits than the other chiefs of the coast; the' former possesses a great many boats, but the latter very few. They were both employed with their people a f^vv miles inland from Sharga, according to their own account, in tending their flocks, and guarding them against the attacks of the Bedouins and others who were instigated by Bashid bin Humid to plunder them ; but I suspect they were actively aiding Sultan bin Suggur against that Chief. 53. I don't think that any danger is to be apprehended from the Uttubi, unless their quarrel with Rama bin Jabir and the wars of the Persians and the Imaum of Mascat on Bah rein should lead to disorders in that quarter. The authority, however, of the Sheikh does not appear to be so absolute as might be expected, and is borne with much reluctance by the in habitants of the islands. In fact 1 am doubtful whether the Sheikh has it in his power to restrain entirely the inclination of his subjects to revenge themselves for the injuries they may receive from their enemies. 54. Sheik Abdulla bin Ahmed and nearly all the Uttubis reside on the smaller island of his brother; Sheikh Suleiman is a very old man and has retired to spend the remainder of his days at a email fort called Kuffa on the Island of Bahrein, about eight miles from the town of Manam, where his son Khallifa exercises the principal control, but there appears to be some divisions of authority amongst several sons and servants of the Sheikh. 55. Persia has renewed its attempts against this island, at least I understand that Mirza Bankir Auhu has proceeded to Mascat to invite Imaum to a conference with Zukee Khan at Bunder Abass, to arrange operations for a joint attack on Bahrein, and also that letters have been forwarded to Sulten bin Suggur, requesting his co-operati m, and offering him the naval com- Oiand of the expedition. It is not probable that a coalition of this description will take place,Part V—Chap. XXXVI. 161 but the Imaum may perhaps consent, and Rama bin Jaii1&gt;ir tosrstVier with tn© SliGikh of Bushire will always be r..ady to co-operate. If the expedition should actually be undertaken it will inevitably lead to a renewal of disorders to a certain extent. 58. The proviiion respecting slaves is the only remaining article of the treaty on which it is necessary to reports and it is with much hesitation t^at I ventuie upon this subject. .Chat the traffic continues to a considerable (ie^ree cannot be doubted, since there is jjn open slave market both at Mas-cat and at Bahrein, and also I believe in the Persian ports, but I was deterred from holdinu any personal communication with the Chiefs on this point by a doubt that has occurred to me in regard to the precise meaning of the article of the treaty, which I cannot find expiaining' in any instructions from Government. 57. The words are the ' carrying off of slaves, men, women and children, from the coast of Africa or elsewhere, and the tran&gt;porting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature,' Now it strikes me that this sentence may be understood to forbid only the carrying off of men, women and children as slaves, and the trans porting them in vessels when *o carried off, although the words will also bear the more com prehensive sense of forbidding the carrying off of slaves and also the transporting of slaves, however procured, in vessels ; but even this most extended acc^ftation cannot be construed in the forbidding the purchase of slaves and the transport of them over-land unless indeed the last clause, which provides that the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature, embraces everything. 58. I am informed that the Arabic sentence bears the same meaning as the English one, and may be interpreted to forbid only the making of slaves and the transporting in vessels of slaves so made, not the purchase or the transport of them if purchased; but that it will also bear the more extended si gnification. 59. I am unable positively to say in what sen^e the words are understood by the parties to this treaty, and my uncertainty of the views of Government prevented me from putting the question diiectly; but when I consider the practice of all Mahomedan nations, the positive refusal of the Tmautn of Muscat to relinquish their traffic, and particularly the tenor of Captain Morseby's negotiations with His Highness, I cannot suppose that the Arab Chiefs hold them selves bound by the treaty not to purclia-e slaves in the market at Mascat or any other place, and to carry to sell them to their neighbours where they see that our ally the Imaum continues to pursue the traffic in spite of our recuonstrances and probably brings them for sale to these ports. 60. But in whatever sense the words of the treaty may be understood by the other party, I am convinced that our utmost endeavours to abolish the slave trade amongst the parties to the treaty will be ineffectual, as long as the other powers of the Gulf persist in it. We may perhaps put a stop to the carrying off of slaves, but their purchase and transport we never can prevent. The slaves will be disguised and concealed in a thousand ways, so that it will be impossible for us to detect them, and I doubt whether more harm than good might not be done to the cause of humanity, by st &gt;ppini; boats and searching them for slaves, because it would in all cases occasion such disgust and offence as would involve a great risk of renewal of hostilities. 61. I do not believe that any of the parties to the treaty do carry off slaves, all those thev possess being purchased at Mascat and other places, but at all events . it would be difficult even in the former case to detect them, in the latter next to impossible, and with all our efforts we shall Hnd it impossible to put a stop to a traffic which is sanctioned by their religion and by immemorable custom, unless it were relinquished by the co:muon consent of the whole of the Chiefs of the Gulf. 62. Convinced as I am of the ineffic icy of this article of the treaty, which has not yefc been acted upon, and cf the dansrer of attempting to carry it into effect, I am compelled with much reluctance to recommend that it should not be enforced except in very glaring cases, or at least that its sense should b« considered as confined to the carrying off of slaves, and uot including their purchase or transport. 63. It is gratifying to humanity to know that slaves are not only extremely well treated and protected by their Arab masters, but that they even enjoy a very considerable degree of power and influence; I remarked that they were everywhere the stoutest and well fed men, and that they seemed happy and comfortable. I must not however omit to mention an exception which occurred at Bahrein, where two slaves sought refuge on board the Sernatt from the cruelty, as they said, of their masters ; they were not however received, and we had no means of ascertaining the merits of the cas- 1 . Much as it is to be desired that this horrid traffic should be abandoned throughout the world, we must I fear confess that the cruel treatment of slaves has been the reproach rather of English than of Eastern nations. tf4. I am not prepared to offer any further suggestions on the execution of the other articles of the treaty, beyond those submitted in my letter of the 10th Januarv. It will be hardly possible to get the Chiefs to be very regular with their papers, but when the'first Registry has been completed, I do not anticipate much difficulty. There is however one point on which I beg leave to solicit the instructions of Government, which is the extent to which we are to interfere to prevent aggression by Chiefs who are not parties to the treaty, on vessels hearing 9ur Registers. You will perceive from the 17th paragraph of my letter that Sultan bin Sugguf construes the latter part of the X article of the Treaty into an engagement of protectlou162 Part V— Chap. XXXVI. on our part. The Sheikh of Bahreia was also anxious to establish a simi'ar meaning. The words are' and if any shall attack them {viz., the vessels of the friendly Arabs engaged in trade) the British Government shall take notice of it.' 65. The undertaking' which I gave of the general spirit of the treaty and of our policy in this point is that it applied to by the parties to the treaty, in respect to any aggressions at sea hy any other Power not authorized by open war, I ought to remonstrate with the aggressor and et deavour to procure redress if possible. In all such matters connected with the Persian side of the Gulf, I must of course conduct the remonstrance through the (Government of Fars as directed in tne 18th paragraph of my instructions. In cases of open war it will be impossible to interfere, but it is of such importance *0 encourage a spirit of traffic against the Arab tribes by all the protection which we can give them that it is very desirable to prevent, as far as we can, any lawless airgression from powers who are not parties to the treaty. 66. It is I think to be feared that the Chiefs on the Persian side of the Gulf will be at least as likely t&lt;&gt; commit piracies as those of the Arahiaa shores, they are nearly independent of Persia, and I do not find that any ot them have yet adopted the flag of that kingdom, although loni; since ordered t3 do so. It will be necessary for our cruiser to pay frequent visits to this side of the Gulf. 67. Rama bin Jabir is said to be strongly inclined to renew his old practices, and to haye made op-n rejoicings when he heard of the removal of our troops from Kishm. He is now old and blind, but retains all the vio ence of his youth, and there is much to fear, from his lawless disposition, and his animosity to the Uttubis in particular. His sons are said fortunately to be of a different temper. 68. I have not been able to make any arrangements for establishing a channel of com munication at the pirate ports; it would however, I think, be very desirable to have a native Agent wil h Sultan bin Suggur j audi shall endeavour to procure a person for the purpose; perhaps our Agent at Kattif might with advantage be transferred to Sharga. In the meantime the man whom I propose sending to Mogu will be very useful, because he will be able to give information of the proceedings of the Arabs, both on this side of the Gulf and also on the pirate coast, through the channel of Lingua, which is near Mogu, and is subject to a near relation of Sultan bin Suggur, who has constant communications with Sharga. 69. It is difficult to say what may be the effect of the removal of the troops from Kishm; their presence was certainly of the utmost use in preserving tranquillity, but the naval arrangements which Government has directed have convinced the Chiefs that we do not mean to withdraw our control, and will 1 hope prove efficacious. The force however is hardly sufficient when the description of vessels is considered. Of five cruizers now in the Gulf three are stationed off the pirate coast, and one is detained at Bussora. The Depot at Mascat is more distant than could be wished, since it requires on an average nearly twenty days for a vessel to proceed thither and return to her post; I am informed none of the vessels carry more than a few weeks' supplies. The scarcity of fresh water and the prevailing winds in the Gulf present such difficulties that I do not believe there is any other port of which we could more conveniently avail ourselves. The only remedy that suggests itself is the employment of a larger vessel which could convey supplies for the cruizers. But these are points on which I am not qualified to judge. 70. The ships employed on the survey have uniformly received the greatest assistance from the whole of the Arab tribes, from Gape Musseldom to Bahrein. I beg leave to suo^o-est that the cruizers employed in the Gulf should be furnished with copies of the survey on 'their leaving Bombay. 71. There are many other points in my instructions on which I am directed to report, but I have not at this early period had it in my power to collect any further information which 1 can venture to submit to the attention of Government. I hope at a future period to be enabled to offer a full account of the piratical tribes. 73. I may in the meantime state that I understand the Jawassmis procure all their materials for building as well as their warlike stores from Mascat, Bahrein and Persian ports in the lower part of the Gulf. The timber is all Indian teak, the arms are chiefly of Persian manufacture, hut of the latter articles their prizes furnish them with an abundant supply from all quarters. They possess no articles of export; since their pearls are generally purchased by merchants on the spot, and the produce of their country is not even sufficient for their main tenance. Their only employment is catching fish, diving for pearls and importing dates and other necessaries of lif« which they purchase with the price of their pearls. These dates are chiefly brought from Bahrein and Bussora ; gum and cloth from Masoat and the Persian ports. They appear to be very poor, and I should fear that they can never find much employ- went in commerce unless in carrying for others, but I believe they at one time pursued a very extensive trade, and it is to be hoppd their resources may again improve. 73. Although there is now no remnant of the Wahabi power on the coast, yet the tenets of that seat are still said to be cherished by a great number of the inhabitants. 74. In conclusion I beg leave to express my opinion that the Arab Chiefs have at present every disposition to respect their relations with us, and although I am not sanguine enough to expect entire tranquillity, yet I think that as long as they are treated with conciliation, theyPart V—Chap. XXXVI. 163 will not molest our vessels, even i£ they should relapse into piracy against the neighbours in tbe Gulf. We ought to encourage them as much as possible to embark in trade, and en deavour to bring them to more peaceful habits by affording them all the protection in our power, and at the same time asserting our right to maintain the peace of the sea. But their poverty, their habits of piracy and the feuds which seem inherent in the Arab tribes, are such obstacles, that we cannot expect any sudden or entire reform, nor can we look to any other motive but the dr^ad of our power for keeping them true to their engagements. 75. Our great object, I think, is to keep down hostilities at sea if possible, and to prevent quarrels amongst themselves from leading to a renewal of disorders; at the same time we must not interfere too far, and must observe great caution to avoid giving offence. Much may be done by persevering in the system of steady control, which Govern ment has adopted. Some directions will however be required to guard against disgusting the Sheikh by too much interference, and we must bear in mind that any incautious or harsh acts on our part, which may tend to exasperate them, will agaiu embroil with these desperate and lawless tribes. 76. The feud between Imaum of Mascat and Sultan bin Sugarur is perhan 5 ! as much to be dreaded as the ambition of the latter Chief or the quarrels amongst the tribes themselves. His Highness is accused of encouraging disorderly characters, besides Hashicl bin Humid, but I hope my suspicion on the head may prove unfounded, and I have the highest opinion of the Imaum's general character and conduct. He mig-ht, I tiling be warned against the danger of involving himself in a war with Sultan bin Suirgur by which he can gain nothing and is almost certain of losing a great deal, besides being the means of involving the Gulf in the renewal of disorders ard piracy. 77. I intend, if possible, to pay a visit to Mu-kat about the month of November next, with the view of communicating with His Highness in person, and afterwards to revisit the whole of the Arabian ports, in order that I may be able to judge of the effects of the present system, and inform myself more fully than I could possibly do on my first visit, regarding every particular connection with the affairs of the Gulf. 78. I have derived much valuable assistance and information from Captain Faithfull, whose opinion entirely coincides with those I have now laid before you. 298. The following observations were made by the Government of Bombay on this report (G. L. No. 393 of 20th March 1823} :— No. 393, dated 20th March 1823. From— W. S. N ewnham , Esq., Chief Secretary, Bombay Castle, Political Department, To—The Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch to the late Chief Secretary, dated the 27th February, and am directed to express to you th&gt;e satisfaction of the Honourable the Governor in Council with the very clear and able view it affords of the states on the Arabian shore of tbe Gulf, and it will no doubt greatly facilitat3 the decisions of Government on all future questions that may arise connected with the piratical states in the Gulf. 2, The 10th Article of the Treaty concluded, by Sir W. G. Keif app?ar» to the Governor in Council to refer to India alone, and to engage that the British Government shall not only admit the friendly Arabs into its own ports, but use its influence to procure their admission into those of its allies, and to protect them from all dis-tnrbance. 8. The Article in regard to the slave trade does certainly not bear the construction that has been hitherto put on it. It evidently only alludes to d'scents made on the coast of Africa for the purpose of making slaves : this is justly declared to be plunder and piracy, terms which it would have been an abuse of language to apply to any trade however detestable as long as it was peacefully conducted. In this sense the article must be underst)od, but every infringement of it when clearly established must be resented exactly as a case of piracy would be. 4. The Governor in Council has little doubt of the accuracy of the opinion communicated by you on the character of Sooltaun bin Suggur and he agrees in the opinion that it is greatly to be wished that he should succeed in fully establishing his authority over the whole of the Joassmee ports; the Governor in Council conceives the views which you have taken of the conduct to be adopted by the British Government in relation to that Chief and his alleged dependants to be perfectly correct, and he further adds that before we directly contribute to the aggrandizement of Sooltaun bin Suggur it should be well ascertained that our doing so will not injure the interests of the Imaum whose fidelity entitles him to the greatest consideration from onr Government. 5. No argument should be omitted to prevent the occurrence of hostilities between that Chief and Sooltaun bin Saggur, an event which mire than almost any other would contribute to unsettle the present tranquillity of the Gulf. 6. Nearly the same observation applies to the projected attack on Bahrein, which however is is hoped the weakness of Persia and the jealousies of her intended auxiliaries may of themselves be sufficient to prevent. T164 Part V—Chap. XXXVI. 7. Sooltaun bin Suggur should he dissuaded from joining in this attack should it ever be seriously intended, and in respect to the Imam of Muscat it seems only necessary to point out to His Highness how repeatedly he has been deceived by Persia in its views on that island to prevent him from again exposing himself to an alliance which will terminate as faithlessly as the others have done. 8. I have the honour to enclose with his letter an open despatch (of which a copy is also forwarded) to the Charge d^Affaires at the Court of Persia to enable him whenever it shall appear expedient to communicate with that Court on the subject of the projected attack on Bahrein, on the general state of the Gulf politics ; as a copy of your despatch now under reply could not be made without considerable detention of the Nautilus, which will convey this letter, you are requested to furnish Major Willock with a copy. 9. With regard to the fortifications which Sooltun bin Suggur wishes to erect at Rasnl Khyma, I am directed to refer you to my despatch of the 20th instant (No. 357), in which you will observe it is stated that the terms of the treaty do not allow of our preventing the building of forts, or the retaliation of tribes, but that if the result of these measures is a renewal of piracy, the 'perpetrators will find that an expedition can be sent from Bombay as easily as from Kishm. 10. My letter of the 17th of this month will put you in full possession of all the corres pondence which has passed regarding the Bahrein Botella seized by the Commander of Hia Majesty's Sloop Sophie, 11. The Governor in Council sanctions the occasional hire of boats by the Commanders of the cruizers as recommended in paragraph 23 whenever it may be fuund necessary as a pre caution for the safety of their own boats under the circumstances there alluded to. 12. Adverting to the 70th paragraph of your letter, the Superintendent of Marine will be directed to cause the Commanders of all cruizers proceeding on the Gulf station to be furnished with copies of the Gulf survey as soon as they can be completed. 299. Copy of the above report of the Resident and the Government's instruc tions was forwarded to Major G. Willock, the Secretary in charge of the British Mission, with the following remarks (letter No. 394, dated 26th March 1823):— No. '94, dated 26th March 1823. From— W. M. N ewnham , Esq., Chief Secretary, Bombay Castle, Political Department, To— M ajob G. W illock , Secretary, in charge of the British Mission at Tabriz. I am directed to acquaint you that the Resident in the Persian Gulf has been requested to furnish you with a copy of his dispatch to this Government of the 27th February for the purpose of putting you in complete possession of the present state of the piratical powers in that quarter, and I am directed also to transmit to you at the same time copy of the reply addressed to Mr. McLeod under this date. 2. The Governor in Council directs me to solicit your particular attention to those parts of this correspondence which relate to the Arab tribes on the Persian Coast, and particularly to the rumour of a combined attack on the Island of Bahrein by the troops of Persia in conjunc tion with the Imam of Muscat and Sultan bin Suggur. 3. It is not at all the wish of this Government that any immediate communication should be made to the Persian Court on the subject of this dispatch, nor that any discussion on the subject of the political state of the Gulf should be renewed, but whenever circumstances shall in your opinion render it expedient to agitate the subject, the possession of this correspondence will enable you to do so with advantage. 4. In such case the Governor in Council would suggest that the Court of Persia should be dissuaded from disturbing the present tranquillity of the Oulf established with so much diffi culty and expense, and that it should at the same time be stated that any renewal of piratical practices will compel the British Government again to keep up a military establishment in the Gulf which, as long as the seas are secure, can be dispensed with %Part V-Chap. XXXVII. 165 CHAPTER XXXVII. QUESTION OF ALLOWING THE PIRATE CHIEFS TO BUILD FORTS-1831-1833. 300. In 1821 Sultan bin Saggar solicited permission to construct a fort for the purpose of keeping the ditferent tribes in subjection. In reply to this application the Chief was informed through Major-General Smith, on his visiting the Gulf in 1821, that the British Government would not oppose Ids building a fort inland in such a situation as might protect him from his enemies, but that no fortification could be erected on any navigable creek or other site by which piratical vessels could be screened. 301. In 1822 the Imam of Maskat having represented through his Agent, Aga Mahomed Shnstry, his alarm at a report which he had received that Sultan bin Saggar was building a fort at Has-ul-Khima by permission of the Resident, Mr. Macleod, and his apprehensions that if the fort were completed Sultan bin Saggar would commence disturbances, for, as His Highness stated, he and his adherents had been on the look-out for opportunities to commit depredations ever since it had been certain that the troops were to be removed from Bassadore. 302. At the time this communication was made, the Bombay Government had not received any report of this circumstance from Captain Macleod, and indeed a letter received from Captain Faithfull on the occasion of his visiting the piratical ports, seemed to discredit it. It was deemed therefore only necessary to notify to His Highness that the terms of the Treaty concluded by Sir William Grant Keir did not allow of our preventing the building of the forts, or the retaliation of tribes ; a circumstance which seemed also to have awakened His Highness's alarm in the idea of its being sanctioned by the Kesident. 303. In 1823 a report was received from the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf, stating that, in consequence of a report he had received from the Commander of the Antelope Cruiser, Sultan bin Saggar had in the absence of the cruiser appointed to watch the port of Ras-ul Khima constructed a square tower of about 30 feet high on the sea face of that town, suited to matchlock defence, he had immediately proceeded with all the cruisers at his command to the Arabian Side of the Gulf, and having obtained from Sultan bin Saggar at Shargah an order, apparently given from the formidable appearance of the squadron consisting of tive cruisers, for the destruction of the fort, he proceeded to Ras-ul-Khima to see it carried into execution. The Bombay Government expressed appreciation of the zeal which led Captain Faithfull to proceed immediately to demolish the tower : but could not omit expressing his regret that he should have adopted such a step, without previously consulting the Resident; that as all instructions of a political nature were addressed to that officer, they could not too strongly impress on Captain Faithfull the necessity of abstaining from every act of a nature affecting our relations to the Arab States, without express authority from the Resident, except in those cases of actual piracy in which promptitude was absolutely necessary and which are pointed out specifically in the instructions formerly issued to the Senior Officer on that station. 304. The Bombay Government regretted that the Treaty made by Sir William Grant Keir did not include dat^AApriUMr 6 ' 1 of In,iia ' No - 4al ' an article specifically guarding against the erection of the sea defences at Ras-ul- Khima and the other piratical ports, and it would be, they thought, advisable if advantage could be taken of any favorable opportunity to obtain such a formal concession from Sultan bin Saggar, against the reconstruction of the y i166 Part V—Chap. XXXVII. sea defences, as might have been considered to have been tacitly admitted when in the first instance he surrendered his guns and towers to be destroyed by Sir William Grant Keir and which he could not have objected to had it been ^ formally demanded of him at the time of the Treaty. But Sultan bin Saggar in his conference with Lieutenant Macleod shewed so great an anxiety to establish his right, under the Treaty, to build forts, that there was little chance of his agreeing to relinquish it, unless in return for some great concession on our part, and if this could not be done in the present disposition of Sultan bin Saggar to aggrandize himself, by establishing his complete authority over the whole of the Joassmi ports, the omission of this and other important points in the Treaty must remain over as they were until the British Government should be called on to send another expedition to the Gulf. 305 - Viewing, however, the omission of the Treaty on this point, the Bombay Government had not thought it becoming the dignity of the Govern ment to press a measure which he could not ultimately enforce under the power of any Treaty. 306. The Government of Bombay informed the Resident in their letter iNo. 997, dated 15th August 1823, that ' there being nothing in the treaties en titling us to object to this measure, they must of course be considered at liberty to re-build their forts without any molestation on the part of the British (jovernment, if they are so disposed to do'Part V-Chap. XXXVIII. 167 CHAPTER XXXVIII. GOVERNOR'S ADVICE TO THE mm OF MASKAT AND THE SHEIKH OF BAHREIN AS REGARDS THE FORMERS CLAIM FOR TRIBUTE—1833. 307. This claim of the Imam of Maskat to tribute from Bahrein was one over which the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf was constantly disturbed. Whatever was the origin of the Imam's claim, it appears from Major-General Sir William Keir's letters of April 1st and May 1st, 1820, that the Uttubis had formally engaged to pay it, and it was their infringement of that agreement that had led to disputes. The policy of the British Government^ at this time was only to put a stop to piracies in the Gulf, and not to interfere with legitimate maritime warfare between the Arab States. 'We therefore confined ourselves to merely advising belligerents to restrain their ardour for war causing disturbance of maritime peace. Such advice was tendered by Mr. Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, to tke Imam of Maskat and the Sheikh of isahrein, and his letters on the subject are quoted below Letter from the Honorable Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, to His Highness the Imauni of Muscat, dated 19th August 1822, It was formerly the intention of this Government that Captain Bruce should endeavour to mediate and accommodate the differences Volume 91 of 1822. regarding the tribute between Your Highnesses and the Ootoobees of Buhrein, but circumstances having prevented that gentleman^s perform ing the duty, I am inducefi to communicate my sentiments to both parties as the common friend of both and as one greatly interested (on account of the British Government) in the preservation of the tranquillity of the Persian Gulf. Mv advice to Your Highness i? this, if the tribute from Bahrein be one which has been paid annually without dispute and without interruption to Your Highness and your ancestors for a long succession of years it is well ; you are entitled to continue to demand it. The Ootoobees will probably not long continue to withhold a tribute which has been always paid, and if they do so, Your Highness is entitled to coerce them and retain your undoubted inheri tance. But if on the other hand the tribute be of recent establishment, or if it has been liable to great interruptions, and be still considered by the Ootoobees as a matter in dispute, I would advise Your Highness to give up tlie pursuit of it, because even if you should succeed in establishing it, you will not do so without a war, and if a war once commence depre dations will be renewed, people will leave commercial pursuits for those of plunder, the old depredations in the Gulf will be renewed, and in addition to the injuries to mankind in general Your Highness will yourself suffer losses more than the tribute will make up for. The effect of a disturbance is to throw things into confusion; many not openly engaged will plunder underhand and the war will soon be not with the Ootoobees but with all the tribes in the Gulf. Such is my advice relating to the Ootoobees. Letter from the Honorable Mountstmrt Elphinstone, Governor of Hombay^ to Abdoolla Bin JJhmud of the race of Khuleefu, the Sheikh of Buhrein, dated 19th August 1822. In my former letter I referred you to Mr. Bruce for a settlement of your disputes with the Imaum of Muskat, but that gentleman not having had an opportunity of enquiring regarding them, I now write to His Highness and to you on the subject. If your tribute to the Imanm be a matter of established right I would by all means recommend your paying it, a sin the first place it is just to give every man his own, and secondly because war is an evil to all people, but especially to those engaged in commerce; because if war begins, confusion increased, fresh powers join from various motives, piracy is renewed and commerce is interrupted. If, on the other hand, the Imaum's claim on you be altogether unjust and unfounded, it is to be hoped that he will listen to reason and be induced to forego it.168 Part V-Chap. XXXIX CHAPTER XXXIX. IXTEXDED SEIZURE BY PERSIAN AUTHORITIES OF BAXDAR ABBAS; THE IMAM'S COMPROMISE OF PERSIAN CLAIMS. 308. From a letter from Gulab Chundar, the Hon'ble Company's Broker at Maskat, to the Hon'ble Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, dated 26th April 1823, it appears that in that year Zuki Khan Muri left Shiraz, professedly for the purpose of effecting some arrangement regarding Bunder Abbas and the ports adjacent, but in fact to get them into his possession, out of the hands of the Imam. The Imam, as soon as he was informed of the real views of Zuki Khan, set sail with his two ships for Bunder Abbas, when he entered into terms of pacification with Zuki Khan, by which it was settled that for each of the two coming years, the Imam should pay 3,000 tomans over and above the stipulated tribute already yielded, and that after the expiration of the two years, the usual amount of tribute only should be required by Persia. The Imam presented Zuki Khan with 500 tomans and he returned after Zuki Khan's departure; Mirza Bakir arrived in a vessel, bringing with him two persons who had formerly been subjects of His Highness, but had cast oft their allegiance and joined with the Persians, and were now desirous to be reconciled to the Imam; there were Hussain xMi Khan Hakim of Bunder Abbas, and Ali Khan Hakim of Menaw. The Imam received them on board his ship with apparent kindness and presented them with killats, after which they, with Mirza Bakir, left the ship in a muchwa, which had not gone far when it sunk, and all in her perished: this was the report the broker heard at first; but on the Imam's return to Maskat, he made careful enquiries, and felt no doubt that these three persons were seized on board His Highness's ship and conveyed to Maskat, where they were now confined without hope of release.Part VL British Policy in regard to Maskat and the Maritime Arab tribes, 1823—1853.Faff VI. 171 PART VI. BRITISH POLICY IX REGARD TO MASRAT AXD THE MARI TIME ARAB TRIBES, 1823-1853. Introductory Remarks. 309. We now enter a period at the commencement of which the Persian Gulf enjoyed peace : we carried into operation our policy of restraining pirati cal warfare. Maritime warfare, which was not of a piratical nature, however, soon became rife on the Gulf. We at first shrunk from interfering on these wars, but we had to alter our attitude called on by the pressing invitations of the Arab chieftains. We became the guarantees of truces between the chieftains in regard to maritime warfare —at first limited to a year and then to twelve years; and ultimately we had the satisfaction of seeing that the tribes concluded a perpetual peace, which practically put a stop to all maritime war among the Arab tribes in the Gulf. In the internal feuds of the Arab tribes on land, the British Government consistently refused to interfere, and they avoided entangling themselves by agreements to protect any chieftains, subject, however, to certain exceptions. The first exception was when in pursuance of Lord Palmerston's policy to check the ambitious projects of Mehemet Ali's Viceroy of Egypt, the Government of India lent its support by advice, with arms and ammunition and money and naval demonstrations, to the tribes in Oman and on the Gulf to save them selves from the yoke of the Egyptians, and to check their progress towards the Persian Gulf and Maskat. The Imam of Maskat moreover received from us an exceptional treatment. The Bombay Government in 1830, as we shall see hereafter, went so far as to authorize the Resident on the Gulf to inform Sultan bin Saggar, Hamid bin Azan and other chieftains, that the British Government would not permit any act, which he might deem calculated to ambihilate or seriously and permanently to weaken the Imam s power. To this pronouncement of policy both the Gov ernment of India and the Court of Directors demurred, but in practice, we shall see, we repeatedly endeavoured to save the Syud Said's power in Maskat from being extinguished or seriously crippled by remonstrances addressed to his enemies and by naval demonstrations.172 Part VI—Chap. XL. CHAPTER XL. BRITISH POLICY IX THE PERSIAJV GULF, 1838-1829. (i) ini'oiM'Avr nsmi rnovs to the resident. 310. The letter of the Bombay Government to the Resident, No. 109JrA., dated 22nd September 1828, printed below, contains important instructions as to the policy to be followed in the Persian Gulf, which was to look upon ourselves as head of a naval confederaoy for the entire suppression of piracy. The letter contains instructions also on other points— To—The Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 1094-A., dated 22nd September 1828. I have had the honor to receive and lay before the Honorable the Governor in Council your dispatch of the ^4th May last, No. 28, reporting the result of your visit to the several stations in the Gulf and am directed to communicate to you the instructions aud sentiments of Government thereon. 2. The conduct observed by you in your recent transactions, both as they relate to the Provincial Government of Shiraz and the Chief local authority at Abushire has been approved; ani you will continue to regulate it by the same principles as you have hitherto done Biercising your discretion on all points not provided for by speuiHc instructions. 3. With respect to any interference in the local disputes or differences, no better ffeneral rule can be given for your guidance, than that suggested by the Envoy at the Court of Teheran who, in answer to a reference upon this subject, observes, '' 1 should feel inclined to suggest the interdiction of the Resident from all interference in the intestine quarrels of the different Chiefs, as well as from affording 'protection to persons obnoxious to Government, provided such interdiction did not compromise the high name, honour and generosity of the British nation'* 4. With respect to the late correspondence relative to vessels trading to Persian Gulf, the Governor in Council directs that the established penalty bonds be taken and their rigid execution enforced. A form of bond accompanies this letter for your informa tion and guidance and you are requested to report any breach of its obligations. Our situation in this quarter, and the expense we incur to protect the trade, entitle Government to require from all English traders a strict observance of these rules, which are necessary for the preservation of that security from which they derive such advantage. 5. The relations between the Commanders and officers of the Marine and the Resident have already been decided on and the Superintendent of Marine has alfo given instructions to those under his authority in conformity with that decision. The line is clear and decided. Ihe Marine in the Gulf of Persia must, while there, be deemed in a situation similar to a portion of our army employed within the sphere, of a Political Resident %n In Ha, and they must consider themselves on all points connected with their communv-a'ion with the inhabit ants with service in the Gulf, subject to the instructions and requisitions of the Political Resident. The plan lately adopted for the distribution and regular relief of the cruizers in the Gulf will, there is every ground to hope, produce in a few years a complete change in the habits of the tribes in that quarter and wean them from their piratical practices. This is a most desirable object and one of equal consequence in an economical and political view. To secure its accomplishment steam vessels appear best calculated in the event of any warfare, to strike a terror amongst the Arabs that would tend greatly to make them abandon all hopes of future success in piracy. 6. With regard to the general affairs of the Fenian Gulf we should look upon ourselves as the head of a Naval confederacy for the entire suppression of piracy and act accordingly. Our superior strength makes us the aibiter to whom others will appeal, and we must take the disadvantages as well as the advantages of such a position— * * * * ***** The laniiuage held by you to the Sheik of Bahrein reported in your despatch of the 3rd May that the Shaikhs will be made responsible for the acts of their subjects or persons who live at or frequent their ports is approved by the Governor in Council and the application of the principle is left to your discretion. 7. It is desirable still to abstain from all interference in any wars not arising from piratical causes ; but as the attainment of our principal object, that of gradually introducing peaceable habits among the various tribes in the Gulf, will greatly depend upon their ceasint; to have recourse to arms upon every occasion, 1 am directed to observe that while you continue most cautious in not giving guarantees or involving Government, you are to take every opportunity of impressing the different Chiefs with eur desire of their remaining tPart VI—Chap. XL. 173- peace with each other. Much ifc is hoped may be gradually effected by your showing favor and consideration to those who evince a disposition to conform to the views of the Government upon this point. 8. It appears necessary however to make one exception to this rule. A protection has been wisely granted to the annual pearl fishery by the presence of our cruizers. It would be to compromise the character of this protection and to forfeit the benefits to be derived from it not to insist that the pearl banks during the reason should not be the theatre of war to any of the Arab Chiefs, and the party infringing this rule by commencing an attack, ehould be treated as a pirate. 9. You are at liberty to proceed to every extremity to punish acts of open piracy, and when there were undoubted proofs of such acts being intended should immediately adopt the measures most expedient to prevent them, any delay of such measures might be attended with the worst effects, and produce a necessity for the employment of much more extended and expensive means than would be necessary to punish crime at the moment or crush incipient danger. 10. With regard to the petty States and tribes of the Persian Gulf, who have not sub' scribed the general treaty such as the people of Grome, Kateef, etc., they may be allowed to sign it or not as they wish, but they are to be distinctly informed that they will not he per mitted to defeat its objects by committing any acts of piracy, ****** 12. In cases where the acts of piracy are airainst Natives of the Islands or shores of the Gulf, the Chief of the tribe committing the piracy must be held responsible to make reparation by the icstoration of the plunder or its value or in cases of murder, by giving up the persons by whom it was committed, to the parties aggrieved. When, however, the latter may be willing (following the usages of their tribes) to compound murder, which is understood to be cften the case, no objection exists to our admitting them to act in a manner which, however, repugnant to our feelings, is conformable to theirs. The principle of our interference is poli tical and appears to be answered when the aggrieved party is satisfied he has obtained what he deems justice from the aggressor. 13. If the piracy is against a ship carrying British colours, you will insist upon the property or its value being restored to the owners, and send such of the pirates as you cau seize, or are delivered to you, prisoners to Bombay. 14. The report of your visit to the different parts of the Gulf with a view of ascertaining where it would be, best to fx the in the event of its ever becoming necessary to remove it from Abushire, establishes two facts beyond future doubt or discussion. First, that Sassadore which has been used for s^me years as the principal station of our cruizers is from its position and other advantagfs one of the most convenient that could have been chosen tor that purpose, but that it is not well situated as a commercial portj and appears for many reasons stated by you not to answer as the place to fix the Residency. Secondly.—That in the event of our being at any period compelled to quit Abushire (and manv circumstances local or general may reduce us to this necessity) that the neighbouring small Island of Khar ruck is beyond all others the most convenient to winch we could^ retire and that could the measure be immediately effected with the consent of the Court of Persia, it would not only be found one of economy but of considerable advantage, both to our commercial and political interests. An insular situation would free us of all that mingling in local disputes and politics which it is quite impossible for the representative to escape from as long as he is stationed at Abushire and which, besides other bad effects, has and will continue to embarrass our general interests in Persia with questions which, however trivial in themselves, acquire importance from being mixed with the claims and privileges of our subjects and agents. Though the present may not appear a time for agitating this point, it is one to which the atten tion of the Supreme Government will be solicited who, if it coincide in this view, and that expressed by you, mav instruct the Envoy at the Court of Tehran to take advantage of a favourable opportunity, if such should ever occur, to obtain the grant of this island. It neither has nor ever can have any value to Persia, and in our hands it must early become an emporium of trade. Its possession would enable us to consolidate with advantage the duties of the Residency of Abushire with those at Bussora and would contribute beyond any measure con templated, to the establishing of the peace and prosperity of the Gulf, and early relieve us from the heavy expenses to which we are now subjected for the attainment of these objects. z 1m Part VI—Chap. XLI. (2) EXPLANATION OF ARTICLES IV AND VIII OF THE TREATY OF 1830-1839. 311. We find that in 1829 the Chief of Bahrein wished that the British Vol 42—360 of 1829. Government should interfere to put a stop to all maritime war among the Arab tribes. The Chief's letter and Major Wilson's explanation of the articles of the Treaty of 1820 are quoted as an enunciation of our policy in the Gulf at the time, which yet shrunk from putting a stop to legitimate maritime war as distinguished from piratical warjare. Translation of letter from Shaik Abdoolla Bin Ahmed to Major D. Wilson, Besident in the Persian Oulf, dated 7th December 1828. I was not aware of your safe return from Bombay before I received your letter and I thank God that you have arrived in safety. You intimate to me that Mr. Hennell had before informed me that the English Government did not interfere in any way in the disputes and quarrels of the Arabian Chiefs. I knew this and have by me a letter from my friend Colonel Stannusto the same effect; God willing, I will shew it to you. With respect to Said Said, the Governor of Muscat, you of course know the enmity he has displayed towards me and how he has cut off our pearl tishing and trading. By the Grace of God, we will retaliate his enmity upon himself and all connected with him, but we have no intention of injuring or interfering* with others. In the treaty of the pacificated Arabs with the English it is stated in the 4th Article that they shall not tight one with another. Now Shakboot and his son Tahnoon of the Baneyas tribe belong to the paciticated Araos. Notwithstanding on Said Said's makino' a requisition for their assistance against the Chief of Bahrein they rose up, and exerted them selves in his service and acted inimically towards us. God willing, we are desirous of repay ing them their enmitv. Some time ago when Captain Lock seized Shakboots and I ahnoons bugla in Bahrein, I told him that 1 understood it was their intention to join the Imam against Bahrein; to this he replied that if he heard such was really the case and that they^were serious in their purpose he would not permit it but would join us. God willing;, we will show you this letter. Copy of a letter from Major J). Wilson, Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Abdoollah Un Ahmed, Chief of Bahrein, dated December 1828, I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 7th December. As you observe I have been much afflicted to hear of the war which exists between you and my friend Syud Syed and Tahnoon to both of whom 1 have in like manner expressed extreme regret at this unhappy circumstance. Tlie best proof I can give of the interest and friendship the British Government feels towards all is to take no part saving and excepting that of a peace -maker which we are always desirous of becoming in the belief that the blessing of God rests with all such. TVom the manner in which you mention the 4th Article of the Treaty which exists between the British Government and the pacificated Arabs, I am apprehensive that some misunder standing respecting it may exist in your mind, I therefore think it right to send you the enclosed explanation of it for the purpose of doing away all misconception of the view taken of it by the British Government. As in times of war and trouble the common people are apt to become forgetful of what is becoming in them, and thereby bring those who are over and responsible for them into difficul ties and dangers, it would afford me much gratification from the interest I take in you if you were to remind your people of what is said in the Eighth Article of the Treaty. ' ' VIII Article. —The putting men to death after they have given up their arms, is an act of piracy, and not of acknowledged war, and if any tribe shall put to death any person either Mohammedans or others after they have given up their arms, such tribes shall be held to have broken the peace, and the friendly Arabs sliall act against them in conjunction with the British, and God willing, the war against them shall not cease until the surrender of those who performed the act, and of those who ordered it.' Continue to send me accounts of your well-being and let me know if I could do anything' to bring about a good understanding among my friends, ^Part VI—Chap. XLI. 176 Explanation of the ^th Article of the Treaty with the Facifcated Arabs. Piratical wars being in existence previous to the conclusion of the treaty with the paci- ficated Arab?, it was necessary for the purpose of introducing the new order of things which this treaty announces in its first article, viz. —' There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy by land and by sea on the part of the Arabs who are parties to this contract for ever/^ that these piratical wars should be brought to a termination. 2. With this view the fourth article of the Treaty was inserted, viz. — ' The pacificated Arabs shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government and shall not tight with each other, and the Hag shall be a t-ynibol of this only and of nothing more.' 3. The meaning of this article when taken in conjunction with the definition of acknow ledged war to be found in the second article, becomes perfectly apparent, and it may be thus developed—'The Pacificated Arabs shall all of them continue in their former political rela tions with each other, with the exception '' that as all piratical wars shall henceforward cease they shall be at peace with tii« British Government and shall not tight with each other in the same piratical manner as formerly. 4. ' The flag is a symbol of this/' viz., that piratical wars have ceased ' and of nothing else.' 5. It is not and therefore never can be called with propriety the British flag, it is only the flag of certain friends of the British who may, by the adoption of this flag, be desirous to avoid the risque of being confounded with pirates. 6. There is nothing in these articles which prevents the arahs from declarinp war, hut whenever they do so they are required to fight after the manner oj an acknowledged war which the second Article define^ to be that which is proclaimed, avowed ami oidered by Government against Government/' The British Government has always said that it will consider all wars that are not acknowledged as piratical, and treat whoever may be engaged in them accordingly, and the latter part of the second article states that ' the killing of men and taking of goods without proclamation avowed and the order of a Government is plunder and piracy. 7. The British Government being most desirous to maintain to the whole of the Arab tribes inhabiting the shores of this Gulf the blessing of peace and tranquillity, isvaost ready on all occasions to offer Us mediation where disputes may exist and will always rejoice at their peaceable and happy termination, whilst it avows most distinctly its absolute determination not to tolerate for a moment any piratical practices, and it will look to the ditierent Chieftains for the maintenance of due order among all their subjects.176 Part VI—Chap. XIA CHAPTER XLI BRITISH POLICY IX REGIRBTO MUI OF MASKIT, 1836-1855. 312. In 1826, the Imam of Maskat, alarmed at some actual or expected vi ao sart * 1 k 9« r. iqn alteration in our policy towards him. Volume 42—860 of 1828, p. loO, -i i v i* t? i m • • asked, through his vakil, permission to come to Bombay to interview Sir Monstuart Elphinstone for the purpose of clearing possible misunderstanding. The Governor tried to satisfy the Imam by assurances of friendship, but His Highness was not satisfied. His main grounds of complaint were the assistance we gave to his enemies in Mombassa^ and he laid a claim to our assistance against all his enemies and especially to the exertion of our influence for the purpose of putting an entire stop to maritime war in the Gulf of Persia. On these points the Resident at Bus hire addressed letters to the Bombay Government, dated 11th December 1825 and 12th January 1826. * 313. The following letter No. 196, dated 11th February 1826, was then Volume 243 of 1826. addressed to the Eesident at Bushire :— I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 11th December and of January the 1st and 4th on the subject of the Imam's complaints of the conduct of the British Agents on the coast of Africa and of the claim advanced by the Imam of Muscat to our assistance against all his enemies and especially to tht exertion of our influence for the purpose of put ting an entire stop to maritime war in the Gulf of Persia. 2. On the first of these subjects I am directed, t) refer you to the communication from His Majesty's Ministers to the Hon'ble the Court of Directors transmitted in my separate letter of this date. 3. The information contained in that despatch will probably satisfy the Imam that he has nothing to apprehend from any further operations of our officers on that coast and he may also be assured that no exertion will be omitted by this Government in representing to the authorities in England the strong claims which His Highness possesses both from his alliance and his personal conduct to every mark of friendship and regard from all branches of the British Government. 4. On the second point I am directed to observe that the Governor in Council is not prepared to admit the existence of an alliance to the extent supposed by the Imam. The only argument by which such a supposition would be defended is the expression in the Coulnameh, or written assurance, given by the late Imam, in the Ist Article of which it is declared that the friends and enemies of the one State shall be the friends and enemies of the other. But this expression appeared never to have heen intended to convey any thing beyond a general notion of strict friendship ; for the other provisions of the treaty so far from fixing the mode of co -operation and mutual assistance [as wight he expected m an offensive and defensive alliances) are strictly confined to the specific object of excluding the French from any settlement in Oman and of allowing the British Government to establish a factory at Gombroon. 5. By the conferences that took place at the time of the negociation these appears to have been the only objects which the British Government had in view ; while those of thfr Imam were to be allowed the same commercial advantages which he had enjoyed before the whole of the western coast of India fell into our hands. 6. That bO loose an expression of general alliance should have been made use of, is to be accounted for by the fact that the engagement was drawn up by the Imam in his own name and only contains promii-es on his part and that it was accepted by a Persian probably as little attentive to the precise meaning of the expressions it contained at the Imam himself. 7. The best proof of the sense put on it by the parties is afforded by the fact that the Imam at the very moment of the conclusion of the treaty objected to certain concessions which he said were likely to involve him in a war with the French with whom we were actually at war at the time and with whom if the words of the treaty were to be acted on he must have been at war also. His Highness's c^a^m to neutrality was so fully admitted by the British Government that a French vessel having afterwards been captured by a ship belonging to • A similar question arose in 1813 (seo ptragrapba 133—137 of this precis above).* Part VI—Chap.

The late Imam does not appear on any one occasion to have shewn a disposition to consider himself as engaged in a general alliance with the British Government; and although the conduct of the present Imam has always been much more strongly marked with the ■pirit of such a connection, yet the frequent explanations that have taken place with him on this subject have been such as to preveut the possibility of any such impression remaining on his mind. In illustration of this fact I have the honor to enclose copies in English and Arabic of a letter from Mr. Duncan to the Imam, dated September 13th, 1810, and of one from Mr. Brown, dated November 20th, 1811, and I am directed further to refer you to the instructions to Captain Thompson on the o^-asicn of his attack on Beniboo Ali of which a copy is enclofed, and to those to Lieutenant Macleod on his appointment to the Residency in the Gulph for proofs that the sam^ understanding of the neutrality of the two States in each other's wars has been avowed and acted on up to the present time, and that whenever we have co-operated with the Imam against the other Powers in the Gulph it has been soMy with the view of suppressing piracy. 9. For the more complete illustration of the nature of the relations between the State of Muscat and the British Government, I am directed to transmit a summary of the transactions that have taken place between the two States since the first discussion of the engagements now in force. 10. The precedin? observations will enable you to meet any arguments which His High ness may seem inclined to bring forward when jou shall visit him on your return to the Persian Oulph in favor of his claim to an assistance on all occasions and it will further be only neces sary to advise him regarding the line of policy which he ought himself to adopt in future. 11. On this subject His Highness miyht be informed that the British Government had no wish to fetter him in any plans or confederacies which he wight think for his own advantage. All it would do would be to point out to him that the common interest of both Governments required that the tranquillity of the Gulph should le maintained and at all events that piracy should be supprtssed tor which purpose it would he wisest in both to avoid disturb ing the present peace themselves as well as to le ready to act together against any Slate that should renew the system of general depredation. 12. r l he plan proposed by His Highness of insisting on the maintenance of maritime peace as reported xn your letter of the llth December dues not appear to be practicable even if it were entirely desirable. We have not the means to compel the tribes on the Persian side to accede to it, and even if all did eo, the system would be very unequal in its operation, as tending to increase the power of those Chiefs who are superior by land while it annihilated those whose principal means of annoyance are at eea : Sheikh T.moon. for instance, would be left without the least diminution of his military resources, while Sultan bin Suggur would be deprived of his only means of acting against his enemies. 13. The duration of such a system also would be uncertain even if its effects were purely beneficial. A change of circumstances might render those most anxious for maritime war who are now most averse to it ; and in the event of the death of His Highness that Imaum his successor might be the first to have rejourse to that naval power in which the state of Muscat so far surpasses all its neighbours. a 14. In 1830, when Syud Said had left Maskat for Zanzibar, a large number of the tribes in Oman rose in Volume 432 o 18.50, p. ioi. rebellion against his power, led by a sister of Syud Hillal, who had been imprisoned in a fort by the Imam, and Hamud bin Azan bin Gheis. The former seized the Fort of Soweik and the latter Sohar. The flame of rebellion spread so far and fast, that the whole of the most productive and populous coast of Hatinah was overrun by the insurgents and even Maskat was threatened. Sultan bin Saggar took advantage of this confusion to make a demonstration against Maakat. The Regent applied to the Bombay Government for assistance in this critical state of affairs in Oman, whereupon they addressed the following important instructions to the Resident with a view to save the power of the Imam from annihilation (letter No. 467, dated 12th April 1830) :— In transmitting to you the documents noted in the margin, I sun directed by the Hon'ble the Governor in Council to signify to you that he considers the British Government to be so far hound to, and connected with, its ally the hnarn of Mnskat ns to prevent his ruin and downfall by evcy means in its power. Without therefore considering it necessary that yo* should interfere on account of any partial disorders in His Highness s territoi ies, f he Governor in Council his no hesitation in authorizing and directing you to inform Sultan bin Suggar, }Jamud bin Azan and any other Chieftains, that the British Gooernwent will not permit any act which you, may deem calculated to annihilate or seriously and permanently to weaken the Imam's power.178 Part VI-Chap. XLI» You will explicitly inform the Chieftains in question that inattention to your proMbition, or refusal to bubmit 10 the aibitration of the British Government, will be treated as an act of. hostility. An attack of Mr.skat, it is hoped, may not be contemplated, but should it be so, you will take immediate measures to prevent a proceeding that would, among other effects, di-tur &gt; so seriously the commerce with the Gulf. There is every desire on the part of this Government to preserve neutrality, but it must be well satisfied of the justice of the grounds on which his enemies proceed before it can permit a Prince wir.h whom it has so long maintained an intimate and beneficial alliance to be ruined by this combination of his enemies. 315. In pursuance of these instructions, the Eesident despatched a vessel of war to Maskat arrangements were tembay Selections, Volume XXIV. ^ ^ despatch 0 f a squadron In case Maskat were attacked. When the Imam returned to Maskat in May 1830, he affected to look upon the state of affairs on the Batinah coast as a trifling matter, easily to he settled, without the British aid, disavowed the application made for their assistance and returned the vessel ot war sent to Maskat. His attempts, however, to reduce the insurgents by the sword failed and he had to liberate Hillal and cede several districts to Ilanmd. 316. Early in the year 1832 the Imam left Maskat for his African possessions confiding to his son, Syud Hillal bin Said, and nephew, Mahomed bin Salim, the direction of his affairs during his absence. Immediately subse quent to his departure, however, these were thrown into the greatest confusion, in consequence of the seizure and imprisonment of the authorities above men tioned, by Sacud bin All, the Chief of Burka. 317. It being then the policy of the British Government to preserve the integrity of Sis Highness''s dominions, the Resident lost no time in despatching his Assistant, with a respectable naval force, to check the designs of JELis JUghness's enemies, as well as to afford advice and support to the existing Government; and Sultan bin Saggar having by letter communicated his wish to commence hostilities against the Imam's possessions, and it being also known that Hamud bin Azan of Sohar, and Hillal bin Imam, although not having apparently interfered, were secretly rejoiced at what had taken place, letters were addressed to those Chiefs, as well as to the Sheikhs of Abuthabi, Soweik, and Barka, intimating that the British Government had determined to support their ally, and further informing the latter that the continued deten tion of his prisoners would lead to a collision with the British Government. Before the naval force could reach IVlaskat, Sultan bin Saggar had seized Khore Fakaun, Khulla, and Dihha, ports on the Batinah Coast, belonging to the Imam ; and Hamud bin Azan, Chief of Sohar, with Sheikh Hillal,* had prepared to attack Eastag, one of the most important inland places in the Imam's territory. The latter two had given assistance to the Barka Chief in his attack upon Masnaah; but the Imam's daughter having succeeded in throwing reinforcements into the place, the siege had been raised. The prison ers had been released and permitted to return to Maskat, and on the Assistant Kesident's arrival at Barka, c^aud bin Ali disclaimed all intention of rebelling against the Imam, and protested that he had adopted such strong measures with reference to his kinsmen solely with a view to self-preservation, his life having been threatened by Mahomed bin Salim. To provide against anj further aggressions and annoyances, a vessel of war was at the request of the local authorities directed to remain at Ma^kat, until the arrival of His High ness the Imanij who was expected from Zanzibar in the course of a fortnight, and these authorities were dissuaded from retaliatory measures in the mean time, and advised to turn their attention to the management of their internal affairs, and to the security of their persons and possessions from foreign aggres sions or treachery. The vessel of war was very shortly withdrawn, its presence being required to give additional force in the demonstration against Ejman. His Highness the Imam did not, however, return to Maskat until the 10th September, when he addressed the Resident upon the subject of the loss of his towns of Dibba and Khore Pukaun proposing to leave the matter in hit hands, hut was informed that British interference, under the circumstances, • Chief of Soweik.Part VI—Chap. XLI. 179 was not called for, and moreover advised, since his absence from Maskat had been attended with so many disadvantages, to consider the integrity and pro tection of his hereditary dominions paramount to every other object, 318. The demonstration made in the Imam's favour by the visit of the British vessels of war to the Coast of Batinah, and their appearance at Maskat, was undoubtedly attended with highly beneficial consequences to the interests of His Highness. The liberation by Saud bin All of his prisoners, for so trifling a consideration as 8,000 dollars, was fco be attributed solely to the apprehensions excited by his knowledge that an application had been made for British interference. The support thus afforded by the British Govern ment interrupted various intrigues carried on against the authority of the Imam, and inspired a degree of confidence in the minds of His Highness's adherents which could not have been derived from any other source. A review of the occurrences of the preceding few years, in connection with this repetition of embarrassment, led to the formation of a very unfavour able estimate of the situation of our ally, the Imam, at this time. It could not, indeed, be concealed, that our influence alone prevented his immediate downfall; and if the policy of the Wahabis had been less peaceable than all accounts concurred in representing it, from their attention being doubtless drawn to their own embarrassments, we should probably have been forced into actual hostilities, for the defence even of his capital itself. 319. The menacing power of the 'Wahabis, and the march of their army into the province of Oman, at the invitation of most of the tribes, began now to excite the fears of the Imam for the integrity of his dominions, and he deemed it his best policy to form a closer connection with them, under the cognisance of the British authorities, who were at the same time fully alive to the critical nature of his situation, and aware, that unless a rupture with this fanatical and restless sect could be averted by the conciliatory policy of the Imam, British assistance, or a renewed success of the Egyptian arms to the north, could alone enable him effectually to resist their encroachments. It was even to be feared that little confidence could be accorded to their for bearance, if circumstances placed the town and shipping of Maskat within their reach. It was agreed that the Imam should pay 5,000 German crowns per annum as Zukat to the Wahabi Chief; that each was to hold possession of his own coast according to the limits then existing, the former's extending to Jaalan, the latter's thence to Katif; and further, an engagement was entered into, binding the parties reciprocally to assist in putting down any rebellions which might arise in their respective territories. The fulfilment of this last article the Imam assured the .Resident when laying the matter before him by letter and through his Agent Haji Hossein Gulam, would depend upon the wishes of the British Government. The line of policy thus marked out and pursued by the Imam coincided exactly with the views of the British Government, who considered it advisable that Sis Highnpss's relations icith the Wahabis should remain friendly; but with reference to his being required to act in concert with them, under the terms of the engagement, that he should avoid being led into hostilities on this account. He was accordingly strongly urged against any participation in foreign war, and cautioned againt committing himself on points of magnitudCt particularly on that of the supremacy of Mahomed Alt, Fasha of Egypt. 320. The Imam was, however, still apprehensive of the invasion of Oman 04 iMoooioQ, i-,, 100 by the Wahabis sooner or later or Volume 34—610 of 1833-1834, pp. 114—122. , , i • i j? being dragged into war for putting down tribes under Wahabis' control. He therefore pressed the Bombay Government for avowal of their policy in such a contingency. They were in favour of protecting the Imam's power being annihilated by the Wahabis, and asked for the instructions of the Government of India and also orders on the policy which they laid down in their letter to the Resident, dated 30th June 1826. The following reply of the Government of India, dated 1st February 2a180 Part VI—Chap. XLL 1834, is a very important pronouncement on the policy to be followed towards Maskat and in general in the Persian Gulf:—&gt; o' Consult 12th March, No. 694. 1 am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 12th September last, with its several enclosures, on the affairs of Muscat, and to communicate m reply as follows : — 2 The Riffht Hon'ble the Governor-General in Council is not prepared to sanction the employment of the British arms for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the continental possessions of the Imam of Muscat. If we were once to commit ourselves hy a declaration of our intention to support thai Chief this line of policy must he followed up at any expense, and it is impossible to set limits to the waste of blood and treasure which might ensue in consequence. 3. The Wahabees evidently exist in considerable force, and the Imam has acknowledged their ascendancy by enteriug engagements with them ; and engaging to hold his forces at their disposal for carrying on offensive operations against their enemies. _ jo par ics left to themselves, a sense of mutual interest will probably lead them to abstain from carrying to extremity any differences that may hereafter arise between them ; whereas if we were to make an offer of military assistance to the Imam, he would probably avail himself of the support of our alliance to rid himself of the burden of the connection wh.ch he has been forced to enter into with the Wahabees, and we should become involved in a series of distressing operations, carried on at a distance from our resources and under great disadvantages from the heat of the climate and the nature of the country, against a brave people with whom we have ourselves no cause of dispute of any kind. 4. Our concern is only with the maritime commerce of the Gulfand^ as long as that is not molested, it matters not to us whether one power or another holds dominion on its Even if the Wahabees were to get possession of the harbour of Muscat, an event of which the Imam himself does not appear to entertain any apprehension, it does not of necessity follow that they would commence a system of piracy. It is more probable that, being already sensible, from their recollection of past events in the Gulf, of our maritime superiority, they would dread to provoke us, and as they would, under the circumstances supposed, have taken their place as a substantive power in that quarter, that they would be glad to continue tne same friendly connection with us which has always subsisted between us and the Imam. 5. It is believed that the Josmees and other Arab tribes in the ^ ahabee interest are even now possessed of establishments in the Gulf, but we do not hear of any piracies being committed by them. They are probably restrained by the fear of our well known ability to punish them, and this salutary dread would be likely to have even a greater mfluence over their conduct than it has at present, after they become possessed of a port like Muscat with a flourishing trade and other interests at stake, which they must sacrifice by provoking hostility with us, 6. But even if the worst contingency that can be supposed likely to taJce place, were . actually to happen, and the W ahabees were not only to acquire possession of the 1 ort oj Muscat but also to commit acts of piracy upon the Gulf trade, it is conceived that it would be much cheaper and easier to chastise them under these circumstances, than to take tip the question in its present state and constitute ourselves the guardians of the possessions of the Imam of Muscat against all his enemies. In the former case the whole extent of our operations would be comprised in such measures as might be deemed most advisable for the purpose of putting down piracy, while in the latter we might become engaged in a system of Continental Warfare, the final result of which it would be impossible to foresee. In the former case we should know exactly how far we should be committed, we should engage with all the advantage arising from our maritime superiority, and, under Providence, success would certainly attend our efforts, while on the latter, we should abandon oui vantage giound to fi^htthe Wahabees in their own country, we should unnecessarily provoke the hostility of a free and powerful people and should be involved in difficulties from which we could not retreat with honour. 7. On the whole. His Lordship in Council considered it fortunate that it has been so clearly established by the result of former discussions that we are not under any defensive engagements with the Imam of Muscat, and it is requested that the British authorities in the Gulf may he instructed to observe a strict neutrality in any disputes that may arise between him and any of his neighbours on the Continent of Arabia. Irom a reference to the 15th paragraph of Mr. Warden's memorandum, dated 17th January 1826, it will be observed that this line of policy is in strict accordance with that which was prescribed by the Supreme Government when the Imam solicited our aid against the ^ ahabees, after the expedition against the Joasmee pir«tes in 1808, on the plea that, owing to the assistance he afforded us on that occasion, they (the Wahabees) threatened to overwhelm him. 321. The despatch of the Court of Directors, No. 6, dated 16th April 1834, reviews our whole policy in regard tp the Arab tribes on the Gulf and thePart VI—Chap. XLI. 181 Imam of Maskat, and entirely coincides with the'Sentiments expressed in the last-quoted letter of the Government of India :— 1. We now proceed to notice such letters and paragraphs addressed to us by your Gov ernment on the affairs of the Persian Gulf, as have not yet been replied to : being the following:— Letter, dated 15th April (No. 7), 1831. „ „ 16th November (No. 37), 1831. ,, „ 1/th ,, (No. 38), „ Paragraphs 4, 8 and 10. Letter, dated 18th February (No. 4), 1832. „ „ 18th April (No, 10), 1832. „ „ 2£th September (No. 28), 1832. Paragraphs 3 to 6. Letter, dated. 29th October (No. 31), 1832. 2. These various communications contain a very interesting summary of the events which have taken place in the Gulph during the period which they embrace ; but they present few subjects for observations or orders. 3. Your proceedings have been conformable to the principle of limiting our interference with the various States in the Gulph, to what is required for the protection of commerce, and the enforcement of the engagements for the suppression of piracy. In this course of conduct you have been well seconded by your subordinates. And we observe with bigh satisfac tion that acts of piracy, even in times of acknowledged war, have become rare, that the Chiefs universally exhibit a disposition to prevent them, and tbat when they occur, redress for the sufferers, or, at least, the punishment of the offenders, is generally, and without much 'difficulty obtained. 4. By a perseverance in the policy which has thus far been so eminently successful, we see no reason to doubt that in a short time the piratical habits of the Arabs will be entirely reformed. 5. By the judicious exercise of your influence you will no doubt in time be able to accomplish another object of importance to civilization, the suppression of the slave trade, which is still carried on, though to a limited extent, between the Coast of Africa and the Arab ports, not excepting Muscat. 6. In the papers now submitted to us, various indications occur, that the Arab States on the Gulph would not be averse to our assuming that general protectorship over them, which would be implied in our prohibiting wars and becoming the arbitrators of all their disputes. We entirely concur with you, however, in considering the assumption of such a power, and indeed, any more intimate connexion with those States than at present exists, to he wholly inadvisable. 7. In one instance you deviated from the principle of non-interference, so far as intimate to the associated Chiefs, who appeared to have brought the Imaum of Muscat to the brink of ruin, thvt you would not premit that Chieftain to be annihilated as a substantive power, or permanently and greatly reduced in importance. This measure, which would otherwise be questionable, may perhaps be defended on the ground of the claims which the Imaum has acquired upon us by his ready and zealous co-operation in our measures for the extinction of piracy, and by his important concessions on the subject of the slave trade. 8. This interposition in the Imaum's behalf might, however, have involved us in un' pleasant consequences, if the Imaum had not so promptly disavowed the application of the Regent acting in his absence, and declined to avail himself of the assistance placed at his disposal. Had that assistance been accepted, it would have imposed on us the necessity of restraining him from the execution of unjust enterprizes, should such be undertaken or meditated by him against other States; since it would be highly improper to allow unlimited license of aggression to one whom we protect from the extreme consequences oj the hostility which he may provoke. We do not think that you are by any means bound^ by your former act to tender him the like assistance on the future recurrence of a similar crisis in his affairs, his having declined to avail himself of it, is a sufficient reason for not renewing the offer. 9. It appears probable indeed that the wars now of so frequent occurrence among the petty States on the Gulph will soon be prevented or mitigated by the submission of those States to a common superior in the person of the ruler of the Wahabees, who have now recovered an extent of dominion nearly equal to that which they enjoyed in the times o£ their greatest prosperity; have taken Lhassa and Katiffe, rendered Bahrein tributary to them, and cultivate the most friendly relations with Sheikh Sooltan bin Suggur and with the Imaum of Muscat, both of whom have acknowledged the superiority of the Wahabee Chief Toorkcy bin Saood. 10. The information you appear to have received concerning this Chiefs srood sense and talents for Government is very favourable and there appears to have been hither to no cause for regretting the ascendancy which he has acquired in Eastern Arabia.182 Part VI—Chap.

Among the letters of the Resident at Bushire during the period under review, is one from Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson of the 11th September 1830, which is recorded upon your consultations of the 1st December 1830, Nos. 73 and 74;. This letter is, we believe, not referred to in any of the dispatches which you have addressed to us. It was accompanied by valuable Memoranda on the countries of Central Asia, which were obtained by Lieutenant- Colonel Wilson from Mr. Masson, an American gentleman. It is in our opinion desirable that a copy of Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson's letter, and Mr. Masson's papers, should be trans mitted by you to the Governor General in Council for their information if you have not already supplied them with a copy.(&lt;*l) Part VI—Chap. XLI—A. CHAPTER XLI—A. BRITISH POLICY IN VIEW OF jHARITIiME DISTURBANCE CAUSED BY PREVENTION OF MASRATS PRETENSIONS TO BAHREIN, 1828-1830. 321-A. In 1828 the Imam of Maskat made an attempt to reduce the island of Bahrein, but he sustained a defeat on landing on the island and some of his and his allies* ships were captured by the Uttubis. The Imam began then to prepare a second expedition to Bahrein. 321-B. In May 1829 the British Government directed their Agent in the Persian Gulf to endeavour to compose the differences existing between His Highness and the Sheikh of Bahrein. The offer of mediation was accepted by His Highness with great alacrity, as the state of bis affairs in Zanzibar imperiously called upon him to proceed in person to theAfriean Coast, for the purpose of crushing, if possible, the rebellion of the people of Mombassa. After some correspondence, His Highness sent up one of his confidential men for the purpose of arranging terms, but the Bahrein Chief, notwithstanding the earnest advice and recommendation of the political authority, refused to listen to any conditions of peace, however favourable to himself, that had not the guarantee of the British Government to them. This, of course, was absolutely refused, although His Highness earnestly begged that the pledge might be given, Finding the Bahrein Chief firm in his determination, the British Hesident, after a correspondence of several months, declared his mediation at an end. Whether the Uttubi Sheikh conceived that our desire for peace was so strong that, sooner than fail in the mediation, we should have acceded to his wishes regarding the guarantee, or whether he really regarded our friendly interference with an eye of suspicion, is doubtful ; but certain it is, that we had no sooner declined taking any further steps in the affair than peace was concluded betwixt tne belligerents (through the agency of a dependent of thelmaum, who had proceeded to Bahrein), on terms perhaps even mora favourable to the interests of His Highness than those offered to the Uttubis through us; thus adding another to the many instances in which the offer of our mediation tended rather to protract than expedite a return to amicable relations. 321-0. The following correspondence that passed during these events *1000 iQ/r mo ^ oio discloses the line of policy we were Volume 42—366 of 1829, pp. 137,198and 212. ,. , . „ .1 inclined to follow at this time on the question of the Imam's pretensions to Bahrein and the maintenance of his influence in the Gulf. Copy of a letter from the Hon hie the Governor to His Highness the Itnaum of Muslcat, dated 16th April 1829. Agreeably to Your Highiie?s's commands Asha jfTahomed Shoosturee has communicated with me regarding the dispute existing between Your Highness and Shaikh Abdoolla bin Ahmud Alkhuleefa, the Chief of Bahrein, and has consulted me on the part of Your Highness as to the expediency of Your Highness's fitting out another expedition against that island. Had Your Highness made known to me your views on Bahrein previously to the departure of the late expedition and the commencement of hostilities on the part of Your Highness, I should not, sincerely interested as I am in Your Highness's welfare, and anxious as 1 feel on account of the British G-overnment to preserve the tranquillity of the Gulph, have hesitated a single moment in recommending Your Highness to be guided in this matter by the disinterest ed and salutary advice conveyed to you by Your Highness's friend Mr. Elphinstone in a letter addressed to you on a former occasion when Your Highness entertained similar views with regard to Bahrein; a copy of that letter I now transmit for Your Highness's perusal. Coincident as my opinions are on this subject with those of my respected predecessor Mr. Elphinstone, I must not conceal from Your Highness that the late occurrences in the Gulph have caused me deep and unfeigned regret, being in every respect liab'e to cause a renewal of piracy and depredation in the Gulph and to involve Your Highness in a protracted struggle not only with the Ootoobees, but eventually perhaps with all the tribes of the Gulph. *181. Part VI—Chap. XLI-A. I would therefore, as Your Highnesses sincere friend and well-wisher, strenuously recommend Your Highness to avail yourself of the first favourable opportunity which may offer to bring to an amicable and honorable conclusion the differences unhappily existing between Your Highness and the Ootoobees being fully persuaded that by adopting this course Your Highness will be consulting your own interest and will conduce in a greater measure to the restoration of that peace and tranquillity in the Gulph which it is the earnest desire of this Government should be preserved. Such is the advice which Your Highnesses sincere friend I consider it incumbent on me to offer you in the present juncture of your affairs, and for further information on this and all other points I beg to refer Your Highness to Major Wilson who has been furnished with the instructions of Government as to the line of conduct to be pursued on the present occasion. No. 44, dated Bushire, the 19th May 1829. From— Lieutenant-Colonel D. Wilson , Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— William Newnham , Esq., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 448, dated 17th April 1829, enclosing a letter to be forwarded by me to the address of His Highness the Imam of Muscat, and intimating that it would afford the Honorable the Governor in Council much satisfaction to learn that an opportunity had offered for the exercise of my influence to effect a reconciliation between the Imam and the Chief of Bahrein, so that the tranquillity of the Gulf may be placei on a permanent footing. 2. It appeared to me of importance that the letter of the Honorable the Governor should reach His Highness immediately, and that 1 should be acquainted with his views after its receipt, as soon as possible, particularly as I und erstand his preparations for renewing his attack on Bahrein are in some state of forwardness. I have therefore taken up a small boat for the purpose of accomplishing this service in the quickest manner, and 1 trust that this measure will be sanctioned. 3. In forwarding the Honorable the Governor's letter I addressed a few lines from myself; His Highness is well aware of |my being a strenuous advocate for peace, but here seemed an opportunity of saying a word more, and I embraced it. It is difficult to get an Arab to acknowledge that he wishes a mediator, his saying so looks in his estimation like an acknowledgment of weakness. I thought therefore that I might on this point be more likely to ascertain His Highness's real wishes through a third person, than directly from himself, and consequently wrote the accompanying note to our Agent at Muskat to whom 1 could more freely and precisely define that 1 could not guarantee anything in any way and that I could only speak as a friend/' To increase the chance of an opening for negotiation, addressed a similar note to the Agent at Bahrein. 4. His Highness the Imam's late defeat at Bahrein, the successful capture by the Utoo- bies, and others who have joined in the war, of a few boats from the people of iMuskat, and of His Highness's allies, and the want of successes on his part to counterbalance those of his enemies, are circumstances which have tended as much to diminish the former estimate of His Highoess's power, as to raise the spirits of his enemies, and probably if His Highness should delay long in proceeding against them, they might seek him in his very capital. The Utoobies, even when his fleet was at Bahrein in force, loudly proclaimed that they would never again consent to pay him tribute which they had done only because they feared our inter ference. 5. Unless, therefore, His Highness should obtain some little success to raise the estimate of his power to its former standard, I |hould despair of seeing matters brought back even to the state in which they were before the war broke out. But even if His Highness would consent to admit our mediation, we ought to look most attentively to circumstances before we negociate anything that would be derogatory in any very considerable degree, to so devoted an ally. Even if his judgment have erred in entering upon the war, still he is looked upon by all as one who has great claims on our countenance, and in extremity, our assistance. We have of late had many opportunities of evincing that we are determined not to mix in the constant quarrels, and petty affairs, of the small States of this Gulf, that we are above all such trifling concerns, and not to be influenced by them, but we may have to consider what our own loss might be, if a very devoted and generally a most obedient ally be brought too low. There are inconveniences in all alliances that must be endured, and none are more full of them than those between great and very small States. 6. I shall watch attentively the progress of the affairs in question, taking on all occasions when circumstances will admit, the orders of the Government on any new occurrences. It is only bee vise references from this distance require so long a time, that I frequently feel called upon to enter more into the details of many subjects than I otherwise should, that the Government observing anything it may deem erroneous in my sentiments, may command accordingly.Part VI—Chap. XLI-A. 185 No. 693, dated the let July 1829. To—The Resident, Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt o! your despatches, dated the 12th and 19th Alayj with enclosures, reiiarding the present state of affairs on the Arabian Coast and His Highness the Imaum of Muscat's meditated attack on Balirein, and to acquaint you that the Governor in Council approves of th^ tenor of your communications to His Highness as also those to the Sheikh of Bahrein, on the subject at issue. 2. The Governor in Council concurs in the sentiments expressed by you regarding His Highnesses views on Bahrein. However much that Prince may have erred in his late efforts at extension of power and however impolitic it is to interfere in the warfare now existing between him and the Arab Chiefs of the Gulf, it would be most unwise to allow the power of this deserving Prince and useful petty State to be destroyed and that of a combination of Chiefs substituted in its place. This would be alike injurious to an ally from whom we have often derived aid and tr» the interests of trade of India which his father and him have been alike zealous and successful in promoting. The Chiefs whom circumstances have united against him would be more likely to turn the power which &amp;uch success gave them to piratical than commercial objects. 3. The Governor in Council however does not apprehend any such extreme as above stated occurring, and if it did he has no doubt who should bw able to save our ally without embarras sing ourselves further than by imposing some salutary restrictions upon his future ambition. 4. In the absence of such necessity of interference, the Governor in Council deems it pru dent to continue towards His Highness the samecour-eas that hitherto pursued and is decidedly of your opinion as to the inexpediency of sending any of the Company's vessels to the pearl fishery this season. It is not proper for us even to interpose unless when we determine to make our authority respected. In such a state of excited feeling of hostility as now exists among the Arabs of ttie Gulf we could not expect to do that without coming to extremes with one of the parties or perhaps both and such an occurrence is much to be deprecated. Besides there is reason to expect that our withdrawing from the same will create alarm and cause losses that may dispose many to desire peace and to seek an accommodation of their diuerences thiougli the British Representative. No. 1268, dated 26th October 1829. To—The Resident, Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, dated the 5th September, No. 80, transmitting copies of your correspondence with the Imaum of Muscat and Chief of Bahrein on the subject of a reconciliation between those chieftains. 2. The Governor in Council highly approves of your conduct on the present occasion and of the judicious manner in which you have maintained the important principle of an even friendship towards all and a desire of restoring peace without allowing that desire to invdlve Government in the embarrassment that must result from becoming guarantee of engagements of which, from the characters of the parties, there would be likely to be continued infractions. There is no doubt whatever that the continuance of such hostilities will prove ruinous to the trade of the Gulf unless every act of piracy or plunder is instantly repressed, and this can only be done by making the Chiefs to whom those that commit excesses belong, responsible for all subject to them or who are their allies. Such conduct on our part steadily pursued will so limit the operation of the belligerents as to render them unprofitable, and it neither party obtains any very decided succees, they will soon seek our good offices upon the teims we are disposed to grant them.186 Part VI—Chap. XLI--B. CHAPTER XLI—B. Sultan of Maskat's Treaty with the United States of America, 1833. 321-D. On the 2nd November 1833 the Government of Bombay received Volume 32 of 1833-1834. information from their agent at Maskat, as also from the Kesident in the Persian Gulf, that two American ships of war had visited the Port of Maskat with the object of entering into a Treaty of Alliance with His Highness the Imam, and of establishing an agent at Zanzibar on the east coast of Africa. 321-E. On referring to the only engagements in existence between His Highness and the British Government, viz.) a cowlnamah, or written engage ment, from the Imam of Maskat, dated 12th October 1798, and an agreement entered into by the Imam with Captain Malcolm, dated 18th January 1800, it did not appear that His Highness was prevented from entering into such engagements with foreign States. The Government of Bombay, however, deemed it proper to bring the above circumstances to the notice of the Governor- General, and in reply they were informed that His Ijordship coincided with them in opinion as to the right of the Imam to enter into such engagements with foreign Powers. 321-F. In the month of April His Excellency Vice-Admiral Sir John Gore, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, transmitted to the Bombay Government copy of a report from Captain Hart of His Majesty's Ship Imogevny of his proceed ings at Zanzibar, to which place he had been deputed to the Imam of Maskat, by the Vice-Admiral. On reaching Zanzibar Captain Hart waited on His Highness the Imam, and in the course of conversation His Highness introduced the subject of the Treaty, which he said he had entered into with the Americans, but not with any intention of injuring or forgetting his best friends, the English, to whom he felt so much attached, that he was willing to give them everything even his country if they wished it. That as for the Americans he cared nothing for them, nor were they anything to him. That if there was anything in^ the Treaty, which Captain Hart objected to, he would immediately alter or break and send it to America ; His Highness requested Captain Hart to peruse the Treaty and give him his opinion on it, and said that he was ready to make any alteration which that officer might suggest. 321-G. This Treaty consists of nine articles concluded on the 21st Septem ber 1833, on the part of America by Mr. Edmund Roberts who is stated to be only appointed by Letters Patent, under the signature of the President and seal of the United States of America, the substance of which is as follows: Art. 1. Perpetual peace between the United States of America and the Imam of Maskat. Art. 2. Citizens of the United States to have free liberty to enter all ports belonging to the Imam with their cargoes of whatever kind, to sell or trade as they think proper, the Imam not to fix a price there on, or on the merchandize to be taken in return, the sale of military stores, ammunition, etc., being reserved to the Imam alone at Zanzibar, but in all other ports of the Imam they may be sold without restriction. Art. 3. Five per cent, duties to be paid on the cargoes of vessels of the United States entering any of the ports belonging to the Imam in full consideration of all import and export duties, tonnage, license to the trade, pilotage, anchorage or any other charge whatever—no charge on cargo on board unsold and re-exported, nor shall any charge be made on any vessel entering the ports of the Imam, for the purpose of refitting refreshmentsvPart VI—Chap. XLI—B. 187 Art. 4. American citizens to pay no other duties or charge whatever, beyond those paid by the most favoured nation. Art. 5. Persons escaping from shipwreck to be taken care of at the ex pense of the Imam, without remuneration ; property saved from wrecks to be carefully preserved and delivered to the owner or the Consul of the United States or to any authorized agent. Art. 6. Citizens of the United States to be permitted to land and reside in any of the ports of the Imaum, subject only to the same restric tions as the most favoured nation. Art. 7. Citizens of the Lnited States taken by pirates and carried into the ports of the Imam to be released and their property restored to them. Art. 8. Vessels belonging to subjects of the Imam visiting the ports of the United States to pay no other or higher duties thau the most favoured nation. Art. 9. The President of the United States may appoint Consuls to re side in the jKDrts of the Imam where the principal commerce shall be carried on ; these Consuls to be judges of all disputes or suits wherein American citizens may be engaged with each other and invested with other powers respecting the citizens of the United States. The Consuls and their household to be inviolate, punish able for offences by the President only. 321-H. On the receipt of this communication the Bombay Government furnished a copy thereof to the Governor-General for any instructions which His Lordship might be pleased to send to them relative to the offer of His Highness to break the Treaty with the Americans which he apparently through ignorance had made. 321-1. Before receiving any reply to this communication Sir John Gore furnished the Bombay Government with a copy of a communication which he had received from Lord William Bentinck in which His Lordship stated that although he regretted that such arrangement had been entered into by His Highness the Imam with the Americans, yet he could not discover any tenable ground upon which the British interference to annul or modify its provisions could be exercised. At the same time His Lordship doubted the propriety and expediency of accepting the Imam's offer to break this engage ment. 321-J. Whilst Captain Hart was at Zanzidar, the Imam requested him to accept, as a present for the King of England, of the Liverpool, a seventy- four-gun ship built some years for His Highness at Bombay, which point he appeared to press very much, as she was, His Highness observed, too large for his service, but receiving the offer of the Imam in connection with the over tures made to Captain Hart to break faith with the Americans who had already began to quarrel with His Highness, the Governor-General doubted the propriety and expediency of accepting this vessel, and observed that if under these circumstances His Highness's offer were accepted it might be construed into an intention to support him against the Americans, which it was desirable to avoid. 821-K. The Admiral accordingly addressed His Highness returning the original Treaty brought down by Captain Hart, intimating to him he could not pledge himself that the British Government would support him in breaking faith with the Americans, and that the acceptance of the Liverpool for the King of England if considered as a pledge for any purpose, he must decline it until he received full instructions from England on the subject. 321-L. In a letter from the Imam to his Agent in Bombay, His Highness directed him to represent to the Bombay Government that on the 28th April 1834, a Prench frigate arrived at Zanzibar from Bourbon for the purpose of negotiating new Treaties of offensive and defensive alliance with His Highness; that they solicited his assistance in an attack on a place called Belamboo or Bembatooka, that they promised in like manner to aid him whenever he might require their assistance, that their second proposition was whether His 2 B188 Part VI—Chap. XLI—B. Highness would allow Frenchmen to settle at Zanzibar and cultivate planta tions there. His Highness told them in reply that he could not enter into such Treaties or join in an expedition without our consent; but that he had no objec tion to allow them to settle at Zanzibar for the purpose stated, provided they would agree to be subject to the Arab flag and authority with which they did not seem satisfied. 321-M. The Bombay Government were of opinion that they should not commit themselves in any way by giving advice to the Imam respecting his conduct towards the French. They however requested the sentiments of the Governor-General as to the communication to be made to His Highness on the subject. 321-N. His Lordship informed them in reply that in his opinion the ques tion was one with which the British Government had no concern, and that pending the war between France and England the Imam was bound by Treaty to refrain from negotiating with their enemies, but that under existing circumstances His Lordship was of opinion that as regards such questions, Government could not with propriety exercise any influence, 321-0. The Imaum's agent was then informed that the Supreme Govern ment had decided that the British Government could exercise no interference to the matter as the British and French nations were at peace.Part VI—Chap. XLII 189 CHAPTER XLII. SULTAN BIN SAGGAR'S ENTERPRIZES*—1833—1838. 322. The most notable figure in the drama of the Persian Gulf affairs Bomb.; sdcciiomi. No. xxiv. t ' iese times was Sultan bin Saggar. We have seen how he was brought to book in 1820, and made to sign the Treaty that year. His enterprises in the direction of Khore Fakaun and Dibba in 1832 have been recounted (see para graph 317 above). We find his enterprizes extending also to Bushireand other parts on the Persian Coast and to the Mussendom Peninsula, where his pretensions were based on less dubious grounds than at Dibba and Xhore Fakaun. 323. In November 1832 a large fleet of Joasmi boats, containing from one thousand to fifteen hundred of the tribe, under the command of Sultan bin foaggar in person, appeared at the head of the Gulf, with a view to affording assistance to Sheikh JWassir, the hereditary Governor of Bushire, who having given umbrage to the Persian authorities had been ejected from the town and had taken to his boats, and commenced a blockade of the port according to a previous engagement with that person, by which, in addition to certain other considerations, the plunder of the place was to be the reward of a successful attack. Previous to their arrival, however, the blockade had been raised, and it was evident, from late events, that Sheikh Nassir had no longer any expectation of regaining his inheritance, but was now merely intent upon inflicting injury upon the town and its inhabitants, which must have involved the destruction of a large amount of British property. Under these circumstances and moreover, the cause of humanity and the protection of those connected with the British Government, calling for the exertion of every endeavour to ward off so great a calamity as that of a band of infuriated plunderers like the Joasmis being let loose in the midst of a peaceable and mercantile community, the Resident, Mr. Blane, adopted the strongest arguments with the Josami Chief,—indeed threatened to resort to actual force, it he did not abstain from a measure which, as had been explained to the Vakil above alluded to, on his mentioning the subject, would be contrary to the wishes of the British Government, The fleet accordingly withdrew. . ,. ^ ne ve fy trifling case only of a piratical nature occurred in 1833, indicative of the innate spirit of the Joasmis for plunder,—a spirit which they found it difficult to restrain even where British property was concerned, and the immediate infliction of punishment must certainly ensue. One of their boats putting into Korgu for water, its crew seized and carried off some portion of a tent, lining the building which had been erected on that island for the accommodation of the Resident's establishment, during the prevalence of the plague at Bushire and in its neighbourhood, notwith standing that they were warned that the same was the property of the British Government. Trifling as was the value of the articles taken, the more wanton and insulting appeared the conduct of the plunderers, and the more urgent the reason for its not being permitted to pass unnoticed. A vessel of war was therefore despatched in quest of the boat, and to demand the surrender of the delinquents. These were found at Mahommerah, and brought to Bushire, together with the stolen property ; but the object having been gained, were immediately freed, in consideration of the Sheikh of that port having begged their forgiveness. 325. After his signal defeat at Khore Suffan (near Abuthabi), the Joasmi Chief commenced making great preparations for the attack and blockade of the Benyas capital, and having secured the support of the Sheikh of Ling ah, and Bashid bin Hamid of Ej man, the combined fleets sailed from Debayi on the 9th of November. The two Chiefs of Abuthabi had however * Note. This chapter recounts the Sheikh's enterprises not in the neiphbourin? lands, but in outlying territories, at those on the Batineh Coast,, near Cape Mussendom, or on the Persian Coast. 2 B 2190 Part VI—Chap. XLII- collected a large force of Bedouins and citizens, and moored with iron chains to the shore six or seven of their largest vessels, well manned, for the protection of their shipping. After a cannonade of three days, which was promptly and effectually answered by the besieged, Sheikh Sultan's baggalow having received two shots in her hull, his whole fleet weighed out of range of the guns on shore, and anchoring confined itself to the maintenance of a close,blockade. The besieged were shortly reduced to the greatest distress from the want of pro visions, and the departure of His Highness the Imam for his African posses sions removed all prospect of relief from foreign assistance. Their difficulties were further greatly increased by the capture of thirty of their boats in Khyran Beniyas, and the loss of ten men killed by the people of Debayee (of the seceded tribe), who, also acting on the offensive by land, intercepted and carried off a caravan of fifty camels, laden with dates from Brymi. 326. Presssd by famine, they fitted out three boats, manned with five hundred men, and secretly despatched them to sea by night. Twenty vessels of the blockading squadron went in pursuit, but unable to come up with them returned after three days to resume their position off Abuthabi, reinforced by some additional vessels from Bussora. The blockading squadron was not with- out its difficulties and privations : provisions and water had to be brought from Kas-ul-Khima and Lingah, and each individual being required to send for his own food, great suffering was experienced. 327. Both parties, therefore, tiring of these protracted hostilities, and dis posed to come to an arrangement, a peace was easily effected, through the mediation of Mahomed bin Guzib, the Lingah Chief, on the condition that Sheikh Kalifa bin Shakbut should give up all the boats and pro] erty his people had captured since the commencement of the war; and the blockading fleets were withdrawn. The 'Wahabis were desirous of befriending the Beniyas in this quarrel, but the threats of their representatives at Brymi proved insufficient to over awe the Joasmi Chief (whereby a decrease of the power of the sect at that time may be argued), and had the effect only of restraining the Bedouins from affording any assistance to Hussein bin Hahmah, who had been despatched into the interior to raise troops for the purpose of cutting off the communication with Abuthabi by land. 828. At the period of the disturbances in the Imaum's dominions, owing to the aggressions of his relative Hamud bin Azan, Sultan bin Saggar proceeded with a large fleet to his possession of Khore Fakaun and Dibba. Although formerly requested by the Imam to assist his representatives in Maskat in any quarrels with their neighbours, it was evident that, far from any intention to exert his power and influence in favour of His Highness's relatives, his sole object was to avail himself of the state of affairs to benefit and promote his own interests at the expense of either party. 329. The proceedings of his fleet, however, were not confined to depreda tions upon the boats belonging to Sohar and its dependencies, as the enemies of the Imam, whose interest he pretended to serve, as also upon the property of the subjects of the Maskat Government, his ally, but were extended to acts of a decidedly piratical nature, upon the vessels of individuals having no concern or connection whatever with the contending parties. For these of course he was compelled by the British Government to afford redress; hut with reference to the seizures of vessels belonging to Maskat, the acting Governors of that place, fearing to incur his more decided enmity, so far from remonstrating, tacitly, and in some cases openly, sanctioned them. 330. In 1837 Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar applied for permission to grant assistance to the Sheikh of Touoanah against him of Charrak, both Persian sub jects, who were preparing to decide their quarrel by the sword,—a request with which his engagement connected with the establishment of the restrictive line of course afforded one just plea, among others, to the Resident, for refusing compliance. 331. The people of Elra, under the authority of Sultan bin Saggar, committing a piracy upon a boat belonging to Bunder Abbas, that Chief of his own accord compelled restitution of the property plundered, and adopted measures to prevent a recurrence of the offence.Part VI—Chap. XLII. 191 332. The Joasmi Chief superseded his brother Salehin the Oovernment of Shargah, and appointed in his place his son, Saggar bin Sultan; a change which was viewed with some dissatisfaction hy the British authorities^ the former being by them considered one of the most enlightened and intelligent Arabs on the coast, who had ever laboured to check the predatory spirit of his countrymen, and maintained a continued cordial understanding with the British Agent, Mulla Hussein, residing at this port. 333. Two piracies were in 1838 committed by two Joasmi subjects, named Sultan bin Sohar and his brother Mahomed ; the former attended with the murder of several persons, and the plunder of much property, to the north of the Gulf, upon a boat belonging to Karrack, having on board a wealthy subject of Chaab, who had fled Mohammerah on its attack and capture by Ali Pasha of Bagdad, and was now on his return ; the other on a Batinah boat off Ras-ul-Hud. Sultan bin Sohar was after some time discovered and seized at Lingah, and placed at the disposal of the Resident, who sent him to Sheikh Samur, the Chaab Chief, to be dealt with as he might think proper ; the other Mahomed took refuge at Ejman, but, as a subject of Sultan bin Saggar, was upon demand subsequently given up by that Chief, together with the Nakhoda of the pirate vessel. As the first of these had suffered severely from his con finement in chains at Shargah, he was released, together with his fellow-prisoner on their furnishing a bond to pay the sum of 100 crowns. 334. Alarmed at the threats held out against them by Sheikh Samur, the Governor of Cbaab, in consequence of the piracy committed on the Karrack boat, having on board one of his most wealthy subjects and firmest adherents, by Sultan bin Sohar, the Joasmi Chiefs of Lingah and Ras-ul- Khima, despatched their boats in a body, forming unitedly a fleet of twenty-two sail, in order that, in paying their annual visit to Basrah, they might be prepared to repel force by force. On their arrival at Bushire, the Besident addressed a letter to the Sheikh of Chaab, deprecating any interference or molestation on his part towards the Joasmi boats, on the grounds that neither Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar nor his subjects had the slightest concern in the piracy on the Karrack boat, and that Sheikh Syud bin Guzib had done all in his power to forward justice, inasmuch as he had, at great trouble and expense, seized and given over the perpetrators. The misunderstanding was thereby amicably arranged, to the satisfaction of both parties. 335. Shaikh Sultan bin Saggar, after various unsuccessful attempts by land against the Shihayin tribe, residing a.d. 1839, Kumza, and Ras Mussendom, resolved to despatch a naval force to blockade their ports, and thus briug them under control. Although the Shihayin were completely enclosed on the land side by the territories of the Joasmi Chief, whose alleged authority over them was admitted by Sis Highness the Itnayn to the British authorities in the Gulf in 1836, yet that tribe had long continued to maintain a sort of independence, and, keeping up a friendly intercourse with Maskat, to exhibit little disposition to submit to the claim of supremacy advanced by the Joasmi Chief. 336. The immediate cause of the present quarrel arose from the trea cherous surrender of one of the Shihayin forts to the Naib of Sheikh Sultan, residing at Dubba, who immediately dismantled it. Skirmishes and predatory inroads on either side were the consequence, until the Joasmi Chief, finding that he could make no impression by land, meditated the adoption of the measures before alluded to. Alarmed, however, at the rapid successes of the Egyptians, and their tool Amir Khalid, he relinquished his hostile intentions against the Shihayin, and both parties being thus equally averse to war, amicable arrangements were quickly concluded, through the means of an envoy from himself.192 Part VI—Chap. XLIII. CHAPTER XIIII THE MARITIME TRUCE AIVD RESTRICTION OF THE SPHERE OF MARITIME WAR, 1835-1845. (i) The Maritime Truce of 1835. 337. The years 1834-35 were marked by unusual disturbances among the Arab tribes in the Gulf and a far greater than the average amount of piracies was the consequence of this general state of disturbance. In every instance how ever means of repression were promptly resorted to and ample reparation exacted. 338. The most signal instance both of the offence and of the punishment was that of the Beniyas Arabs, the subjects of Khalifa bin Shakhbat, Chief of Abuthabi, who under their previous Chief, Tahnun bin Shakhbat, had been distinguished for their peaceable conduct and observance of treaties, but who soon after his murder either from the inability or disinclination of the new Chief to restrain them, broke out into open and avowed piracy not respectino- e ven the British flag, or the property of British subjects. '6S9. The promptitude and energy with which Captain Hennell, the Assistant, in charge of the Residency, made the necessary demonstrations of an intention to blockade the port of Abuthabi produced the required atonement without actual recourse to any hostilities, except those which passed between the Company's sloop of war JElphinstone and the piratical fleet, in which the latter, though none of their ships were taken or sunk, received what they appear to have felt as a severe lesson. As a summary,' says Captain Hennell,* *' of tlie reparation afforded by the Beniyas, it may be stated that one brig, seven •Letter to Mr. Secretary Macnaghten, dated buglas, two batils, five bugarahs, and .J 1 * y . , 5 ' t , , . , the greater part of the goods on board the Danah Dowlut have been recovered, together with upwards of ten thousand German crowns in cash and property, besides an engagement for sixteen hundred more on the termination of the pearl fishery towards the liquidation ot the claims for the cargoes of the vessels destroyed and plundered. In addition to these all the prisoners have been given up—the persons of the two pirates who headed the outrages upon the British flag surrendered—and the three principal vessels of the Beniyas concerned in the late piracies put into our possession as pledges for the settlement of the balance due on account of When to these items the punishment inflicted upon Sheikh Kallifa's fleet by the Hon'ble Company's ship JElphinstone, the seizure in Maskat of an Abuthabi batil with a valuable cargo as a compensation for the plunder of a bugla belonging to that port, and finally the engagements offered by Sheikh Shackbut for the gradual liquidation of the value of the deficient cargo of the Dariah Dowlut are added, I venture to hope that the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India in Council will consider that sufficient reparation has been made by the offending* tribe, and that ellectual measures have been taken for the complete suppression of the lawless and piratical spirit lately manifested.' 340. Of the two pirates mentioned in the foregoing extract, one was tried, convicted and sentenced to death in the Supreme Court of Bombay, but the sentence was subsequently commuted to one of transportation for life by the King in Council. The other pirate could not in the opinion of the law officers be tried in the Supreme Court with any prospect of success, but as there was no doubt of his guilt, he was delivered to Sultan bin Saggar, the Chief of Shargah, jrho from the particular circumstances of the offence was considered to have jurisdiction in the case with a recommendation that he should be punished. 341. In his letter dated 26th May 1835, the Resident reported that having brought the discussions with the Beniyas iribe regarding their late nefarious proceedings to a favourable termination, he conceived that the chances of thePart VI—Chap. XLIII. 193 reourrence of any similar series of outrages would be greatly diminished if all pretences of aggression were removed by the establishment of a peace between the hostile chieftains of the Arabian boats. Accordingly, availing himself of the presence in Bassidore of Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, the Chief of the Joasmis and Sheikh Shakbat, the father and plenipotentiary of the Chief of Abuthabi, despatched a vessel of war over to Debai, with an invitation to Obed-bin-Said, one of the Sheikhs of that place, to meet him at Bassidore for the purpose of discussing some matters connected with the general welfare. The request was promptly attended to, and in the course of a few days this Chief arrived at Bassidore, and was shortly afterwards followed by Hashid bin Hamid, the Sheikh of Ejman. 342. Having made the best arrangements possible for the reception and entertainment of these chieftains, the Resident took every opportunity in his private interviews to impress upon their minds the folly and imprudence of their remaining in a state of rebellion with each other which so far from being advantageous to themselves or subjects, only tended to involve the latter in ruin and misery by cutting them off from the pearl fishery, and thus depriving them of their principal means of subsistence. His arguments were not without effect, and a general disposition was manifested to come to some accommodation of their differences. On endeavouring however to ascertain the terms upon which they were willing to base the establishment of a peace, it was found that any attempt to reconcile their jarring interests, or to adjust their conflicting claims for reparation and satisfaction on account of past injuries was entirely out of the question, and that even had it been possible to make any sort of arrangement regarding the settlement of their demands the guarantee of the British Government for the fulfilment of the conditions was considered by the contending parties as a sine qua non. This of course the Resident had no hesitation in refusing, but unwilling after the exertions he had made to restore a good understanding among the heads of the maritime Arabs that they should separate from each other upon their old terms of enmity, he sounded them upon the subject of a truce, and finding the idea met with a favourable reception, the Resident drew out a paper (of which translation is printed below) and sent a copy to each of the Sheikhs for their perusal and consideration. In reply they all expressed their satisfaction at the prospect of an arrangement which involved no sacrifice of what they considered as their just rights, and yet enabled them to afford to their subjects the inestimable advantages of a tranquil pearl fishery. 343. Finding that the proposition had been so well received, the Resident invited the Sheikhs to a general meeting at my Residency, and accordingly, on the 21st August 1835, they all assembled. After he had briefly impressed upon them the advantages attending the measure suggested, and explained that when once agreed to, an infraction would be treated as a case of piracy without any reference being made to their inland disputes, they replied, that such an arrangement was precisely what they were most desirous of, and that they all fully and cordially agreed to the terms proposed. The separate copies of the truce which had been prepared having been sealed and witnessed, one was retained by each of the contracting parties, and on the 22nd they all took their departure for their respective territories, in order that no time might be lost in affording to their subjects the requisite permission to proceed to the pearl banks. 344. Of the great importance attached by the Maritime Arabs to an uninterrupted pearl fishery an idea might be formed from the circumstance that some of the principal merchants of Shargah in a private communication with the British Agent at that place offered to guarantee to the Indian Govern ment the sum of 20 dollars per annum for each boat that went out to the pearl banks provided they were taken under its immediate protection, and a vessel of war specially deputed to guard them from aggression. Such a pro position of course could not be entertained, but it showed in the Resident's opinion the desire of the mercantile part of the Maritime Arabs for peace, and were strongly corroborative of the reports from all quarters of the joy and satisfaction diffused amongst the inhabitants of the whole line of the Arabian Coast of this Gulf on the intelligence reaching them of the establishment of the truce.194 Part VI—Chap. XLIII 345. Notwithstanding, however, the interests of these people were so closely bound up in the maintenance of peace and tranquillity during the pearl season and that perhaps fairer prospects of its permanency were now opened than have existed for many years past, yet the Resident fully expected that occasional acts of aggression would occur by the injured party not abstaining from retaliation, and appealing to us for satisfaction and redress, these isolated cases might be settled without much difficulty by a prompt loterference on our part. Should the season fortunately pass over with a moderate degree of quietness, it has to be hoped that the members of the truce might be so far satisfied of its advantages as to come to a permanent settle ment of their differences, or at all events be induced to seek our mediation with a view to the cessation of hostilities during each recurring pearl season.

In tlie course of the interview which Major Hennell held with the principal Maritime Arabian Sheikhs at Bassadore in May 1835, he fully explained to them tliat the recent outbreak of the Baniyas tribe of Abuthabi had sufficiently proved the necessity of further measures being adopted for the preservation of the general tranquillity, as well as for the protection of the trade of the Gulf. With this view it was, he added, his intention to recommend to the Government that a certain distance from the Persian shore should be considered as neutral ground, and that no war vessels, even during the period of open hostilities, should be allowed to cruise within the space formed by the coast on one side, and the Islands of Surdy and Bomosa on the other. To this intimation no objection whatever was raised by the assembled Chiefs, who all expressed their readiness to give their assent to any arrangements the British Government might cons ; der best adapted to meet the objects proposed. As he could not then, however, be aware of the light in which the proposition above referred to might be viewed by the Government, he did not ask for the consent of the respective Sheikhs in writing, considering that, as a truce for six months had just been established, there would be sufficient time afforded to receive the instructions of the Government upon the subject, before a renewal of hostilities among the belligerent tribes was likely to take place. 347. Shortly subsequent to this meeting the state of Captain Hennell's health obliged him to leave the Gulf, but his suggestions on the above subject were approved of by the Governor in Council. 348. Major Morison therefore carried out the orders with certain modi fications on the proposed restrictive line Vo!umeo5—755 of I836,p. 258. as explained in his letter No. 2, dated 21st January 1836:— Adverting to Mr. Secretary Norris' despatch dated 17th July last, I have the honor to report having taken the opportunity of my late visit to the Arab Coast, to impose the restric tion authorized in regard to war boats, by the instructions conveyed ia the 3rd paragraph of that communication, and I now beg leave to forward copy of a letter addressed iu consequence to the Officer Commanding the Squadron in these seas. 2nd. —In explanation of having taken upon myself to still further contract the limits proposed in Captain HennelPs report of 21st May 1835, 1 beg to mention that having ascer tained the Island of Surdy to have been notori -us as a place of pirate rendezvous, and from its proximity to the Persian Coast, and central situation, calculated to afford facilities for annoying the trade of India, most desirable to be guarded against, I considered it more ex pedient that the Island of Seir-Aboneid should be laid down instead, as a point of the restrictive line; and as Bonoosa seemed liable to the same objections, though in a lesser degree, I trust my having also excluded it as a resort for boats of a doubtful character, will meet with the appro val of Government, under the spirit of the instractions above referred to. 3rd. —I have every hope that this decisive measure will be attended with most beneficial effects in restoring confidence among the peaceable and well disposed, in regard to our deter mination not only to punish, but to guard against such scenes of blocdshed and outrage as occurred during the course of last season ; while it cannot fail to impress upon all others that the British Government are ready to enforce such measures as may tend to the attainment of these objects. Indeed, under our present active surveillance for the suppres sion of piratical, or unprovoked acts of aggression in these seas, I must further beo- to offer it as my conviction that nothing would tend so much towards the general peace, and amelioration in the habits of the people in this quarter, as the employment of war boats being altogether prohibited in the open seas; for so long as every petty Chief is allowed to possess, and use such means of hostiLty, there can be no security even for those who really feel disposed to turn their views to more peaceful pursuits ; but by providing for their safety and defenoe, by maintaining- similar establishments; and it is already before Govern ment, how difficult it is to prevent such vessels from being occasionally employed for purposes of more general aggression, as well as in prosecution of their own more immediate tends and animosities. 4th. —^ ith reference to the representation made by Sultan Bin Suggur as to the necessity of his war boats occasio ially passing round Cape Musseldom, for purposes connected with the protection of his territories upon the coast of Khorfican, I must bring to the notice oi Govern ment that these territoi ies were only acquired by his taking advantage of the disturbed state of His Highness the Imam's affairs in 1832, and on which occasion he was only prevented from making further encroachments upon His Highness's dominions, by our active interference, as will be observed on advertence to Captain HennelPs despatch dated 30th May of that year. 5^.—As thp Chief of Ras-el-Khimah's operations in that quarter are still more likely to assume an offensive form, than to be required for the protection of these acquisitions, under 2 c196 Part VI—Chap. XLIII. our present altered and neutral policy, as connected with the affairs of Muscat more especially, I have to hope that the arrangement proposed in the ^nd paragraph of my letter to Commodore Pepper will meet with the sanction of the Right HWble the G-ovemor in Council, not only as guarding against the long established predatory spirit of the Joasmee tribe, upon the most exposed point of the Ciulf, but as at least affording a negative protection to our ancient ally the Imam, against any sudden act of aggression by sea, on the part of Sultan Bin Suggur. 6^.—The only Chief absolutely requiring an establishment of war-vessels is the Sheik of Bahrein, whose independence, from his vicinity to the Wahabee power, to which he has been long opposed, must in a great measure hin^e upon his superiority at sea, but the cruising of his armed boats could easily be confined within the limits of the isolated part of the Gulf in which his principal territory is situated; though this chief is too tangible, and too well convinced how deeply his interests would be affected by any collision with British authority and influence in this quarter, ta render it probable he will risk any deviation from that com mendable and peaceable line of conduut, which have lately distinguished him, at least in as far as his general maritime pursuits have been concerned. 7th. —Adverting to the still more limited restriction imposed upon the armed boats of the Beniyas Chief of Aboothabee, I have to explain that in the present divided and unsettled state of the tribe, and with advertence to their late excesses, it appeared extremely desirable that their excursions into the open sea should at least for a time be confined to the narrowest bounds ; more especially, as it was only a few days before my arrival upon the opposite coast that the Shaik's brothers ' Sultan ben Shakboot ' (so deeply implicated in the late piracies) proceeded down the Gulf towards Muscat, with three vessels, said to contain a great number of armed followers : to the annoyance and dismay of the people on both sides the Gulf, who are either at feud with the tribe to which he belongs, or have reason from past experience to dread such a force being abroad in these seas. I trust therefore the precaution now adopted, to confine the offensive means of this restless and daring race to their own immediate coast, will be honored with the further approval of Government. 349. These arrangements were sanctioned by the Bombay Government in their letter No. 763, dated 30th April 1836. 350. Having concluded his arrangements on the Arabian Coast, Major Morison on the 19th January 1836 addressed a letter to Commodore Pepper, requesting him to issue instructions to the naval force in the Gulf to carry them into effect. In consequence of ^ome irregular proceedings on the part of the relations of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed, the restrictive line was subsequently made applicable to Howillah and Bahrein, by being extended from Jlawlul, ten miles north of Eas Rucan, through the Island of Kraing, to Raszur on the main, a measure which was assented to by the Uttubi Chief, in a letter daW the 26th March 1836, and which as far as related to the vessels from Howillah, received the sanction of Government conveyed in their communication No. 573 under date the 13th April of the same year. 351. Upon the whole, the restrictive line, under its several modifications as above detailed, and passing through a number of fixed points, was consider ed as sutticiently defined for oar objects. Erom the preceding statement, however, it will be observed, that although the concun-ence of the Arabian Chiefs in its establishment may be considered by implication to have been afforded, yet that, with the exception of a letter from Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed of Bahrein, we hold no written documents in which their consent has been formally given. The absence of hostilities by sea for several years prevent ed any occasion for our vessels of war using coercive measures for maintaining the neutrality of the principal line of traffic in the Gulf, while the establishment of a truce for the ensuing twelve months, the Resident hoped, would continue to render their interference unnecessary. He, however, suggested in the event of the Arabian Chiefs applying for permission to declare war against each other at any future period, that a written and formal recognition of the restrictive line, and neutral ground, be required from each Sheikh, preparatory to the authority requested being afforded. 352. The Government of Bombay in their letter No. 1356, dated 11th July 1838, expressed approval of the last suggestion of the Resident. 353. Among the parties to this truce the Chief of Bahrein was not included. He was too tangible and too well convinced how deeply his interest would be affected by any collision with British authority and influence in this quarter to render it probable that he would risk any deviation from that commendable and peaceable line of conduct which had previously distinguished him, at least as far as his general maritime pursuits had been concerned. IndependentlyPart VI—Chap. XLIII. 197 of the above considerations, other reasons existed for the Bahrein Chief not being invited to join the truce. It was known at the time that His Highness the Imaom entertained hostile intentions against the island, and it was feared, as a member of the truce, the Sheikh might have chimed the interposition of the British Government to prevent his being attacked. Afterwards arose the irreconcileable feud between himself and Esai bin Traif, and subsequently the family quarrels, all of which rendered it expedient that the British Govern ment should keep itself aloof from interference as much as possible. (ill) Maritime Truce, 1835—1843. 351. The season of the pearl fishery having, owing to the establishment of the truce, passed over with unusual peace and tranquillity, it was renewed for eight months on the 13th April 1836, with undisguised satisfaction by the respective Chiefs, and again on the 15th April of the following year. In September of the same year the Joasmi Chief despatched a confidential Agent by name Mahomed bin Imuz, to wait upon the Resident, for the purpose of intimating his desire that there should be a total cessation of fighting at sea, and that a general agreement should be entered into by the Chiefs on the Arabian Coast to confine their wars upon eao.h other entirely to the land, with the understanding tliat any aggression at sea should be immediately treated by the British Government as an act of piracy, and redress enforced accordingly ; in fact that the truce, instead of being established for six months, should be made perpetual. 355. The Sheikh's Agent explained that his master was led to make the request from the apprehension that on the lapse of the term of the truce, the Beniyas (who were little employed in trading pursuits) would take advantage of his vessels being scattered, in the prosecution of their trading voyages, to attack them individually, and unprepared. The Resident replied to this communication that the British Government could not, for reasons which were explained to the Agent, without its special sanction and authority, be made a party to an asrreement which would cast upon it the onus and responsibility of being the arbiter in every dispute, and settlement of endless claims ; more over, the conflicting interests of the other parties appeared to offer an insuperable bar to their concurrence, and it was at all events necessary, in the first instance, to learn their sentiment upon the subject. In 1838, on the Resident's making a tour of the Arbian Coast, Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar not only expressed his earnest desire for a renewal of the truce, but added that it would afford him sincere pleasure if it could be changed into the establishment of a permanent peace upon the seas. 356. In reply, it was pointed out to him the little prospect there existed of the maintenance of a perpetual peace, with reference to the peculiar habits and dispositions of the Arabs : that when a definite period was assigned, as in a truce, the several tribes were contented to allow their feuds and animosities to remain in abeyance, under the idea that after a specified date it would always be in their power to indulge their deeply rojted feelings of animosity, should they feel disposed to do so. On the contrary, the circumstance alone of finding themselves precluded, by the conditions of a treaty putting an end to all future hostilities by sea, from avenging insults, or taking satisfaction for wrongs, whether real or imaginary, would so embitter the sentiments of hatred entertained towards each other, that a series of aggressions and retaliations would speedily arise, which would only tend to defeat the very object for which the peace had been negotiated. (Extract of letter Xo. 11, Political Department, from Captain Hennell to Government, dated liHh April 1840.) 357. The Sheikh then urged the extension of the truce, and suspension of hostilities, for twelve instead of eight months, and the other parties consent ing to this arrangement, the truce was drawn out accordingly, and duly signed by each. It was again renewed for the same period in the years 1839, 1840, 1841 and 1842 successively, without the slightest demur or objection. 358. Immediately, however, on the expiration of that for the year ending in April 1840, and before time and opportunity had been allowed to the Resident 2 c2198 Part VI—Chap. XLIII. to make arrangements for its renewal, Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar attacked Amulgavine by sea (as well as land), and had nearly succeeded in taking the place,* when the opportune arrival of the Resident permitted of his sucTcess- fully using his endeavours towards a reconciliation, and the blockading force having been withdrawn, the Maritime Truce was again established and subscribed to by all parties for another year. 359. Government had long deemed it advisable that the suspension of hostilities should be rendered obligatory upon the several parties for a more extended period than hitherto embraced within the annual truce. 360. In their letter Nos. 1020-A. and 2383, dated 13th July and 21st Volume 68-1283 Of 1841-42, p. 185. August 1841, the .Bombay Government expressed a wish that the maritime truce might be extended beyond the period of twelve months. In his reply, dated 19th October 1841, Captain Hennell stated that he was inclined to the belief that the inclinations of the Chiefs of tlie Maritime Arabs of the Gulf were rather in favor of an extension ot the period of the truce than otherwise, and that on the termination of the engagement now existing, that he did not anticipate any material opposition \vould be offered to the proposition of ex tending it for two or even five years. 361. The Resident however explained the reasons which had hitherto influenced him in mediating an engagement to abstain from hostilities for only one year instead of for a longer period. y* 362. The line of coast from the southernmost part of the Gulf to its entrance was occupied by the Beniyas and Joasmi tribes. Of these the former was powerful by land, while the strength of the latter lay in its naval resources. Sheikh Khalifa, the Chief of the Beniyas, being a man of restless and ambitious disposition, availed himself of his numerous adherents and dependants in land, continually to foray the districts of his hereditary enemies the Joasmis. These aggressions Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, the Joasmi Chief, in consequence of his inferiority by land, was barely able to oppose, and naturally looked to his superiority by sea, as the means of retaliating upon the marine of his enemy, the aggressions he was exposed to on shore. Such however had been the advantages derived by his subjects and himself, from their being enabled to carry on the pearl fishery in peace and quietness, in consequence of the establishment of the Maritime Truce, that hitherto Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar had sacrificed his resentment to his interests, and had been a cordial supporter of this engagement, although for the period it remained in force he was precluded from avenging the numerous insults and losses inflicted on himself and dependents by the Beniyas Chief. Still however ^ Sheikh Sultan was an Arab) and could not witness his subjects being exposed to such aggressions, without feeling all an Arab's desire for revenge, a desire which was doubtless greatly aggravated by the loud and indignant complaints of his tribe. On such occasions the Sheikh moderated his own an^er and that of his followers by a determination of taking full revenge upon 'the Beniyas by sea, immediately on the termination of the truce. Time rolled on; the smart created by the forays of Sheikh Khalifa was diminished, and when the period for renewing the truce came round, the pressure of immediate interest overpowered the remaining promptings of indignation, and the Arab pride being satisfied that no obstacles existed to their retaliating the injuries they had received, if such a measure be desired, all parties readily united in a renewal of the Maritime Truce. Such had been the working of the Engage ment since first introduced by me in 1835, from which date to the present a profound peace had, wiih one or two trifling and momentary interruptions, existed throughout the Persian Gulf, although the usual spirit of rapine and bloodshed had exercised its influence uncontrolled in land. So long a period of maritime tranquillity was unknown in the former annals of this part of the world. Under the present arrangement the reply to frequent complaints made to the Resident regarding the injuries and bsses sustained by the aggressions of the Beniyas Chief was that on the termination of the truce, Sheikh Sultan would be a free agent in respect to taking measures for redress • The Joasmi Chief waB guilty of deception aud cunninp in thus taking advanfcige of the interim which had been unavoidably allowed to ensae between the lapse of the truce for 1839-40, and its renewal for 1840-41 aa he bad replied in the affirmative to a communication from the liesident, requesting to be informed whether he whs willing to renew the truce for the period of the ensuing pearl fishery. He was, moreover, guilty of an infraction of one of the conditions of the Treaty of 1820, which forbade any Chief engaging in hostilities without tbo prefioua knowledge aud 8anction,of the Resident, to whom he was thereby bouad to make application.J I Oj Part Vl-Chap. XLIII. ^99 by sea. This answer was received as satisfactory, but were the Engagement in question established for an unlimited or any long time, the feelings of disgrace and anger at having no prospect open for revenging the insults they had sustained, would rankle in the minds of the Joasmi Chief and his follow ers, and would probably in the end lead to an explosion, which might inflict a serious and lasting injury upon the peaceful policy which has hitherto been so successful. 363. The Bombay Government thought some weight should be attached to these reasons ursjed by Captain Hennell for a short in preference to an ex tended Maritime Truce. They therefore deemed it proper to vest Captain Hennell with a discretionary authority to act as his local knowledge and experience might induce him to consider most expedient and best calculated to ensure the object Government had in view, namely, the preservation of tranquillity in the Gulf. The Government of India concurred in their views (Government of India's letter to the Government of Bengal, dated 17th January 1842). 364. In 1843, it became necessary to address strong and threatening language to the Sheikh of Amulgavine, in order to induce him to fulfil the agreement which had been entered into between himself and Sultan bin Saggar at the interposition and mediation of the British Resident in 1840, and make the &amp; amende by the destruction of certain fortified works which he had by its terms been precluded from adding to or erecting. One inducement to this chief to concede to this just demand, and to his opponent to acquiesce,—the total removal of the obligations of the treaty thenceforward from all parties,— appeared to exhibit itself in carrying into effect the Government suggestion of lengthening the term of the truce, inasmuch as it obviated, at least during the period thus extended, the necessity he (Chief of Amulgavine) at the time urged for the erection of any sea defences, and all parties consenting (the continuation of the annual gifts being secured to them), a Maritime Truce of ten year* was accordingly, under the special authority of Government, entered into on the 1st June 1813. 365. Writing in 1844, Lieutenant A. B. Kemball, Assistant Resident in the Persian Gull', observed:— These various restraints and checks to irregularities cannot be sufficiently appreciated although the system may at first sight be viewed as exercising too great and arbitrary an influence and control over positively independent States. Thus precluded from the illicit profits to be derived from piratical depredations at sea, it became a matter of vital importance to secure to all the tribes, in common, peace and tranquillity, while engaged in the practice of their vocation on the pearl banks, and the prosecution of their carrying trade, the only means which (the barrenness and infertility of the soil of their country, producing not sufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants, being called to mind) nature has placed within their reach for gaining a livelihood, and upon the success of which mu^t depend the extent of commerce and degree of prosperity and happiness among them. The interest, moreover, of humanity and good policy dictate the prevention of outrage and aggression on these seas, by every precau tionary measure, rather than the punishment and coercion of such when perpetrated by the rude and uncivilized tribes in these quarters. By submitting to the Maritime Truce, the parties have lound themselves not to engage in hostiliti s on the sea under any circumstana s. On the occurrence of disputes of such a nature as not to be amicably arranged by mediation and mutual concession, but to render neces- eary a recourse to arms, the struggle must be held on land; but should these disputes have had their origin in depredations and unprovoked aggressions by sea, and at sea, then the aggrieved chief is entitled to demand redress at the hands of the third party, or guarantee for the mainte nance of the conditions of the truce inviolate; and these conditions are, with tbe perfect knowledge of all, only held to apply to aggressions on the sea by one boat upon another and not to those cases where boats, drawing up on s-hore in the creeks and backwaters, are attacked and robbed by the Bedouins. The interference of the Resident towards redress in snch cannot be claimed. Circumstances may possibly arise calling for the temporary suspension of the operation of the restrictive line, and this contingency forms the nly objection tc imposing any restraint of this nature on the Arabs with whom we have treaties, arising out of the impossi bility of exerting a similar control over other States not so bound, the settlement of whose disputes with the former would be involved in intricacy and difficulty. In cases where lawless and unprovoked aggressions have been made at sea by such a power not authorised by open war, and the remonstrances and mediatory interposition of the British authority have failed to procure redress for the injured and aggravated chief, justice and good pulicy would demand that the latter should be permitted to have recourse to his own means to exact it; and further, that the British authorities, having exerted their influence without effect to brin^ his opponent to a proper sense of his injustice, should restrain any of the other chiefs subscribers to the truce, from interfering in any way, but certainly from affording his assist ance to that opponent.200 Part VI-Chap. XLIII. Such a precedent has not up to the present date occurred, and permission * has, on the other hand, ever been denied to any chief, a party to the truce, incited by avarice and a prospect of booty, and desiring without just cause to mix himself up in the quarrels of others, not subscribers to the truce, in the result of which he has no immediate interest or concern, on the grounds that if granted it would afford a plea to those bound, equally with himself,'not to wage war at sea, whereon to base a similar right to espouse the cause of the opponent with whom he proposes to aily himself, and thus cause in the first instance an indirect violation of the restrictive line and Maritime Truce, whose obligations would be very shortly entirely forgotten and set aside by the allies themselves on either side necessarily becoming principals. Piracies are now of rare occurrence in these seas. Slight cases of aggression, unattended with bloodshed, have almost annually occurred, and must ever be expected occasionally to occur, upon the pearl banks. Their origin is almost invariably to be traced to the practice of debtors avoiding the aettlement of claims against them, on account of advances of money (for the purchase of provisions during the unemployed portion of the year, considered as a remuneration before hand for services to be hereafter rendered on the pearl banks), by deserting their own chief and taking refuge with another ; and the subsequent attempts of their lawful head, or of their creditors, forcibly to recover possession of their persons, or of the amount due by them, or its equivalent from the boat in which they sail, belonging to the tribe they may have joined. For such aggressions and irregularities at sea, it is incumbent upon the British Resident, by the terms and spirit of the Maritime Truce, to exact redress. Attempts have been made to induce the several chiefs to enter into a mutual agreement among themselves, without British guarantee, to refuse refuge to such fugitives; but these have ever been rendered nugatory by Arab pride and sense of honour, as the prospect of the advantage which each chief (forming his own, and therefore of course the most favourable estimate of the popularity and attractiveness of his particular Government and territory whether on^ the grounds of leniency and indulgence in the exaction of more moderate taxes superior military prowess and renown, or greater commercial advantages) anticipates from a' numerical increase to his subjects, and consequent improved revenue and influence. The first principle of our policy enjoining, for obvious reasons, a total non-interference in local matters concerning only themselves, and the false position in which the assumption of the right of insisting upon every fugitive being given up to his own chief would evidently place us, as being calculated to remove the only check at present existing to the tyranny and oppression of the chief over his subjects, constitute powerful arguments against affordino- the required guarantee, or independently striking a blow at the root of the evil, however mudi it may be desirable to remedy it. The piratical Arab Chiefs, satisfied of the advantages obtained by the establishment of the Maritime Truce, which, by common consent, precluding hostilities with each other, removes the chance of a relapse into a system of general depredations, and unprovoked ao-'gressiocs are now quite as much interested in its maintenance as ourselves; and of this they ^exhibited ample proof in their united readiness to renew it for so long a period as ten years, or even more, had such been desired or deemed expedient. As before observed, however, it would be too much to suppose that so radical a change has been or will for a length of time to come be effected, as to admit of the total withdrawal of that influence and political control which have from their wise and mild exercise, rendered this Gulf, whose coasts are inhabited by a brave, rapacious, and cruel people, brought up and nurtured from their childhood among scenes of bloodshed, and licentious and treacherous warfare on land, comparatively as safe and open to the trade and navigation of vessels of all nations, as the seas of any other portion of the world. • Two examples may here be cited. Tn the middle of the year 1835, when the Shaikh of Amulgavine- expressed his wish to assist the people of Charak, it was assumed as a point with him, that whatever claims of superiority he mi^ht formerly have possessed over the Charak people, now they had located themselves in Persia they had become Persian subjects, and conseqnentlv he could not, situated as he was, have any right to interfere actively in their quarrels. And again, in October 1843, when three of the .shaikhs of the Coast of Oman (Sultan bin Susgur, Suggur bin Sultan, and Muktoom bin Butye) applied for permission to afford aid to the ex-Chief Abdoolla bin Ahmed of Bahrein, in regaining his lost authority oyer that island, it was well known at the time that overtures hart been made by the latter's opponents, Mahomed bin Khuleefa and his colleagues, to the khaikhs of Aboothabee (Khaleel'a bin Shakboot) and Amulgavine 'Abdoolla bin Eashid), and that these chiefs were pre paid to join them. A positive refusal was theiefore imperatively called for, and was made in the following terms to the ex-chief through whcm the application had been made ' It is not hidden from you that Mahomed bin Khaleefa, Esai bin Tarif, and their colleagues, being heads of tribes inhabiting Bahrein, the British Govern ment could not interfere in their quarrel with you ; but Sultan bin Suggur and the other chiefs mentioned have no connection or interest in the war, and you are aware that if they become your active allies, Mahomed bin Khaleefa and Ksai bin Tarif would undoubtedly immediately crave the assistance of Khaleefa bin Shakboot and other chiefs. The result would be confusion throughout the Gulf,and enmity between all the tribes; moreover no benefit would accrue to yourself. ' For these reasons, it is not possible that I should grant my concurrence to the interference in any way of the ctiiefs of the Const of Oman, who are intimately connected with the British Government by agreements,, and a truce among themselves made its gaarantse.' It may be here remarked that in the latter ease tbe applicants, although considering themselves in honour bound to eviuce at least the pretence of exertion in favour of their ancient friend and ally, yet experienced great satisfaction at having it in their power to adduce the unanswerable argument of the restraining power of the British _ Government, contrary to whose wishes they were not prepared to act. It must be remembered too, and to this they were fully alive, that by assisting the ex-chief they would have given umbrage to the 'Wahabee raler. Ameer Fyzul, the powerful ally of his opponent, and that, moreover, they had everything to lose and nothing to gain by engaging in a profitless warfare, to the prejudice of their trade, and the interrup tion of the pearl fishery.Part VI—Chap.

(1) MEHEJIET ALI'S AMBITIOUS PROJECTS AMD BRITISH POLICY. 366 Mehemet Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt, under the Porte, was at this time building up for himself an independent empire on the ruins of the appa rently doomed Ottoman Empire, and he found in his energetic aud clever son Ibrahim Fasha, an able lieutenant in carrying out the object of his ambition. Created Pasha of the island of Crete by the Porte, his unsatisfied ambition led him to wrest Syria under his control in 1832. The Ottoman Empire was saved from wreck under the invading forces of Mehemet, by the quick intervention of Russia, in which England and France joined later on after at first keeping aloof. A temporary reconciliation was p itched up in 1833, as a result of which Mehemet Ali was confirmed in his Government of Egypt to which was added practically the whole of Syria. 367. The restless ambition of Mehemet Ali was now turned to the con quest of the Wahabi Kingdom in Arabia. He set free Khalid, a cousin of Amir Eeysal, who had been under surveillance at Cairo and despatched a force under the command of Kurshed Pasha with the apparent object of deposing Feysal and setting up Khalid in his place as Amir of the Wahabis. Nejd was easily overrun in 3837, and Hasa and Kalif were conquered in 1838. Eeysal was seized and sent a prisoner to Egypt in December 1838. His successor Khalid, called upon the Uttubis to pay the tribute which had formerly been exacted by Amir Turki. The Egyptian general now threw oil his disguise as the auxiliary of Khalid, openly declared Nejd as a possession of his master and avowed his ambition to improve and extend his conquests. 368. Mehemet was not only satisfied with his conquests in Arabia. He aimed at converting provinces under his Government into an hereditary monarchy for his family. He began to give open indications of his denial of the Porte's sovereignty in his provinces, and in 1838 we find the Porte's and Mehemet's armies and fleets coming into collision, resulting in disastrous defeat of the former. Great Britain was now determined to intervene without Porte allowing Russia to be first on the field as in 1833 for its own benefit and to the humiliation of Turkey. The policy of the British Government under the ministry of Lord Palmerston was to reduce Mehemet Ali to a proper subordi nation as a vassal of the Porte, and check the progress of Egyptian Generals in Arabia and elsewhere. 369. With reference to the Egyptian progress towards the Persian Gulf, Volume 64-1060 of 1839. the following despatch of Lord Palmers- ton to Colonel Cambell, the British Consul-General at Cairo (dated 29th November 1838), indicates the attitude of the British Government:— You stated in your despatch No. 5 of this y^ar, that Meliemet Ali in reply to a commu- nicatioo which by my despatch No. 25 of the 8th December, you had been directed to make to him, had assured you thfit he had not the least idea of extending his authority towards the Persian Gulf, You also stated in your despatch No. 54 of this year, that the Pacha's forces had been entirely successful in Arabia, and particularly in the Nodjit country and the Hedjas, and that the Asser tribe of Arabs had entirely submitted to the Pacha's forces under Aehmet Pacha and you added that you considered these successes to have afforded a very great relief to Mebemet Ali, as Arabia will in consequ ;nce no longer draw Egypt of men. money and pro visions. Advices, however, which Her Majesty's Government have recently received from Bagdad represent the Egyptian forces as beinw about to cross the Peninsula of Arabia to Lah?a'and Kalif with the ultimate purpose of taking possession of the Island of Bahrein in the Persian Gulf.202 Part VI- Chap. XLIV- I have to instruct you to ask Mehemet Ali whether the fact is so, and you will add that Her Majesty's Government hope and trust that he will, upon full consideration, abandon any intention of establishing himself in the Persian Gulf, because, as you have already declared to him, such a scheme on his part could not be viewed with indifference by the British Govern ment. (II) ACTION TAKEN BY TIIE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TO THWART HIS PROJECTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. 370. When reports were received of the conquest of Nejd by the sub mission of Hasa and Kalif to the army Volume 1839. 0 £ ^he Pasha of Egypt under the command of his General Kurshed Pasha and Amir Kalid, and Oman and B .mbay Government letter to the Resident, Bahrein were threatened with invasion, dated 26th February 1839. Bombay Government instructed the Resident in the Gulf to exert all his influence to check the further encroach ments of the Generals of the Pasha of Egypt on the Arabian Coast of the Gulf. 371. The Government of India in their letter, dated 13th March 1839, approved of the tenour of the Bombay Volume 6ir-i060 of 1839. Government's letter to the Resident as being highly judicious. 372. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, in obedience to the instructions * which he had received from the Government of Bombay, exerted his influence to check the further encroachments of the Generals of the Pasha of Egypt on the Coast of the Gulf and the presence in the Persian Gulf of the Naval Com mander-in-Chief greatly conduced to this end. The Governor-General recom mended that an immediate communication be made to Sir Frederick Maitland of the position of affairs in the South Western Coast of the Gulf, of the instructions which were given by Lord Palmerston to Her Majesty's Agent and Consul at Alexandria^ dated the 29th of November last, and of the dissatis faction with which Her Majesty's Ministers could but regard the encroach ments made by the Pasha of Egypt contrary to his express assurance in this quarter. 373. It rested with Her Majesty's Consul-General in Egypt under such instructions as he may receive from England, to make due representations to the Pasha in regard to the conquests already achieved by the Egyptian Army. But if the Egyptian Generals should attempt further encroachments on the territories of the States on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and if in particular an invasion of the Island of Bahrein should be in contemplation, the Admiral was authorized strongly to use his influence to deter them from such an attempt, and, in the event of their persisting in their designs, and the Govern ment of Bahrein inviting, or calling for his assistance, to afford that Govern ment every encouragement to resistance and all support short of placing himself in actual collision with the Egyptian authorities. 374. The Government of India would not, in the absence of specific instructions from time authorise more decisive measures, felt satisfied that the expression of the wishes of the British Commander and the exhibition of naval strength would for the moment have all the effect which could be desired in regard to the Island of Bahrein. At the date of the advices then received from the Gulf, instructions could scarcely have been received by the Egyptian Commander from the Paaha, consequent on the remonstrance which the Consul- General in Egypt was directed to address to him by Viscount Palmerston's despatch of the 29th November^ 375. The Governor-General was not disposed at the time to enter into any new engagement with the Chief of Bahrein, but in the event of such engagement being tendered, the Admiral was desired so far to encourage his proposals as to transmit them for the consideration and orders of the Govern ment of India. The Government of India desired at the same time to have all possible information upon the disposition, the strength, and the relative interests of contending parties in this quarter, and particularly on the means of resistance which the Uttubi Chief can command. 376. In forwarding a copy of the above instructions to the Resident, the Bombay Government in their letter No. 671, dated 1st April 1839, directedPart VI—Chap. XLIV.] 203 him strongly to remonstrate with the Egyptian Commander against persever* ing in his designs on Bahrein, and explicitly inform him that his proceedings were in direct opposition to the understanding existing between his master and the Government of England; and that his not attending to our remon strance would probably lead to an interruption of the amity now existing batween the two States. The Resident was asked at the same time to point out to the authorities at Maskat that it was not for their interests that the Pasha of Egypt should extend his conquests in the Gulf and that Government confidently expected they would not in any way favour his designs, but on the contrary act in unition with the wishes of the British Government. 377. In his letter No. 42, dated 7th May 1839, the Resident (Major ^ Hennell) submitted his report about the o ume o jo .,p. . disposition, the strength and relative interests of the contending parties in the Gulf with the establishment of the Egyptian power in Arabia. 378. It was found at the time Khorsid Pasha, the Egyptian Commander, Abdullah bin Ahmed, the Sheikh of Bahrein, and Esa-ben-Tarif, the Head of the Al-i-Ally tribe, were the only parties who could strictly speaking be said * sheikh Jaber of Koweit. to be in hostile relations with each other. t ii al i a / a of A ^ b ' ot u habe • The list,* however, of those whose Sheikh Muktoom of Debay. . . , 7 ' , Sheikh Saltan-hea-Suggur of Ras-el-Khyma interests were more or less atiected by the and shargah. advance of the forces of Mahomed All Sheikh Ab^iiah^beiS^hed^f ^Am^lgavine. direction, included all the Maritime Said Hamud ben Azan of Sohar.

The strength of Khorshid Pasha lay in his artillery and regular _ „ , troops, the exact number of which it Khorshid Pasha. j'/c iaj . • • -r. was dimcult to ascertain. It was, however, thought that, including his cavalry and irregular Mughrubbee infantry, he had not above 3,500 available, unless indeed he had received the reinforcements of 1,000 horse and 2,000 foot expected by him from Medinah, From the coast, which was already in his possession, and the Beduins under his authority, he could probably collect from 4 to 5,000 men, but upon these little dependence could be placed in the event of his experiencing anything approaching to a reverse. 380. The means of resistance possessed by Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmed auj i, u u- 11 j were such as to afford a prospect of suc- Abdullah bin Ahmed. i i i ^ . i r i -^-r. cess it fairly brought into play. His insular position, and the great superiority of his naval force, of course were very much in his favor. His war boats, which were numerous, were of the first description of that class of vessels. His subjects were brave and deter mined, and were moreover equally accustomed to serve at sea as well as on shore. Of these, on the two Islands of Monama and Muharag alone, perhaps not less than six thousand armed men, prepared to support their Chief to the last extremity could be collected without difficulty, while half as many more might be^ brought over in case of emergency from the Uttubi possessions on the main land. The population of Bahrein could furnish a much larger number of men capable of bearing arms than that above specified, but not including the aboriginal or Shia inhabitants, who were an unwarlike race, but who, smarting under the oppressive conduct of their Uttubi masters, would gladly see the downfall of that tribe, and the establishment of any other power m its room. Could Khorshid Pasha once gain a footing on the Island of Monama with his guns and stores, and at the same time keep open his communications with Ojeir and Katif, it was probable that the unregulated bravery of the Uttubis would eventually succumb to the powerful effects of the disciplined troops and artillery of the Egyptian Commander, but as long as the Bahrein Chief maintained his naval superiority, the enterprise would be one of so much risk, as to render it doubtful whether it will ever be attempted by the Pasha unless supported by the ships of the Viceroy, or those of His Highness the Imam. The arrival of the former had been long looked for in the Gulf, but it was possible that the earnest remonstrances of the British Government might have induced Mahomed Ali to suspend his intentions 3 D201 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. of despatching them. Regarding the vessels belonging to Maskat, it was not likely that the regency of that port, after becoming acquainted with the views and wishes of the British Government, would allow their fleet to co-operate in any naval expedition contemplated by the Egyptian ruler in this quarter. 381. Of all the Arabian Chiefs possessing any naval resources, the only one whose interests would be promoted Esa bm Tanf. by a connexion with the Egyptian Commander or who was likely to co-operate cordially with him was Esa«ben- Tarif. This individual had seceded from Bahrein with his followers in consequence of the oppression experienced from the hands of the relatives of the Uttubi Chief, and after residing a short time in Maskat had finally settled in Abuthabi, the Sheikh of which place. Khalifa ben Sheikbut, had then intimated his intention of making common cause with him against Bahrein. Notwithstanding this declaration, however, the natural good judg ment of the Beniyas Chief had led him to see how deeply the conquest of Bahrein by the Egyptians would affect the independence of all the other Maritime Arabs, and therefore instead of joining Bsa-ben-Tarif in his cruises against the trading vessels of that island, he had sent his brother Sultan, and entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with the Uttubi Sheikh: at the same 'time intimating to the members of the Al-i-Ally residing in Abuthabi, that under these circumstances, he could allow of their carrying on aggressions against his ally, while they availed themselves of the protection of his port. This change in his position, and the natural reluctance which existed in the breast of almost every Arab, to see those with whom he was at all connected by the ties of blood or clanship, although his enemies fall under the yoke of a foreign power, might, it was hoped, induce Isa-ben-Tareef to accept the overtures of peace proffered by the Sheikh of Bahrein. At the same time ii was not impossible that the desire to revenge the injuries and losses they had sustained from the hands of their relations in Bahrein might induce the Al-i-Ally to remove from Abuthabi and settle in Katif, a measure which would greatly promote the views of Khorshid Pasha, by affording him the assistance of several large vessels, and some five hundred brave and energetic men. 382. Next to the ruler of Bahrein the Chief whose interests are most cn.-ivrv likely to be seriously affected by the Sneikh Jaber of Koweit. ^ -r, V. . * advance of the Egyptian Army to the shores of the Persian Gulf was Sheikh Jaber of Koweit, whose port being situated on the mainland of Arabia rendered him much more tangible than Sheikh Abdullah ben Ahmed. He possessed a large and well appointed fleet, but from the above circumstance it could, like that of the Bahrein Chiefs, be made available for the defence of his place. His subjects (a branch of the Uttubis) were brave and many in number. The Resident considered it to be an object of great importance that this place should not fall into the possession.of the Pasha, as its position so near the mouth of the Euphrates, and the numerous vessels belonging to it, would greatly facilitate the attainment of those objects which were supposed to be held in view by Khorshid Pasha in the direction of Bussorah and Bagdad. It was affirmed that an Agent of the Egyptian Commander was stationed in that port for the collection of supplies. 383. The next place of importance on the Arabian coast was Abuthabi, situated about the same distance to the eastward of Bahrein as Koweit is to the north-west. The Beniyas, who inhabited this port and its vicinity, were a brave and warlike people, mustering altogether in cases of emergency perhaps 8,000 armed men. Even during the height of the Wahabi ascendancy, this tribe always maintained its independence, and refused to pay the Zukal or tithes claimed by the head of that sect. There was in the Resident's opinion consequently little probability of Khorshid Pasha making any impression upon Sheikh Khulifa ben Shakbut, the Chief, who has distinctly shown the line of policy he intended to pursue in the present juncture, by having promised his support to the Beni Narein (then in open opposition to the Egyptians) and having entered into a close alliance with Sheikh Abdullah ben Ahmed ofPart VI—Chap. XLIV.] 205 Bahrein. He had likewise exhibited a disposition to bury ancient feuds, and to enter into close and friendly relations with Sheikh Sultan ben Saggar, the head of the Joasmi tribe, an object greatly to be desired and which the Resident did not despair of seeing accomplished, were it not for the intrigues of Sheikh Makhtum of Debaye (a port situated between Shargah and Abuthabi), whose interest lay in keeping the Beniyas and Joasmi Chiefs at variance. 384. The visit of Rear-Admiral Sir Frederick Maitland in the Wellesley to Ras-ul-Khima had been most op- Joasmi Sheikhs. portune, and would in all probability decide the future policy of Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar with reference to Khorshed Pasha. From the report of the native Agent at Shargah it appeared that the wily Egyptian had deputed to the Maritime Sheikhs of Oman a person named Saed hen Mutluk i who during the time that Sheikh Turky was head of the Wahabi sect resided in Brymi, as the naib or deputy of that personage; this individual, who possessed great personal influence among the Arabian tribes, and who had a perfect knowledge of their various and conflicting interests, having been removed by Feysul, the ex-Wahabi Chief, had joined the Egyptian Commander, and had been deputed by him to Ras-ul-Khima to persuade the Chiefs on the Coast of Oman to acknowledge the authority of Mahomed Ally in reality, but ostensibly that of his Tul Khaled the now nominal head of the Wahabis. Saed ben Mutluk's unexpected appearance seemed to have thrown the Joasmi Chief into the greatest perplexity, but at last by a mixture of threats and promises the Egyptian Agent persuaded him to unite in requiring the Beni Naiem, who had lately got possession of Brymi, to surrender it to the Nedgdis. The reply received was they would bury themselves in the ruins of the place rather than give it up. On receiving the summons of Saed ben Mutluk the Beni Naeim applied to Sheikh Khulifa of Abuthabi and Saed Humud of Sohar for support to resist the common enemy. This call was promptly responded to by the latter Chief, who instantly despatched his brother Gess with 200 men to Brymi. Secretly pleased in his own mind at this bold demonstration of the Beni Naeim, Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar was still greatly embarrassed between his desire to maintain his own independence and his dread of the power of the Egyptian ruler. The Resident, however, hoped that the appearance of the Wellesely, and the knowledge of the disapprobation with which the British Government viewed the proceedings of Khorshid Pasha on the shores of the Persian Gulf, would at once determine Sheikh Sultan to decline any further connexion with Saed ben Mutluk, and to unite with the other Arabian Chiefs in making a bold and resolute stand against the further encroachments of the Pasha. His example would be followed by the Sheiks of Debaye, Ejman, and Amulgavine, who in matters of general policy commonly acknowledge his supremacy. The united forces of these four Chiefs were estimated to be about 10,000 men, of which number 8,000 would be the adherents of Sultan himself. 335. As already stated in a former paragraph Syed Humud ben Azan of Sohar had sent a reinforcement under Hamud ben Azan. brother to the Beni Naeim in Brymi, he stood therefore fairly committed with Mahomed Ally. He was a man of great talent and energy, and may be considered as a most important addition to the league against the Egyptians. On an emergency he can muster about 5,000 armed dependants. 3S6. With regard to the Government of Maskat, the expression of the wishes of the British Government would The imam of Maskat. su ^ 0 i en t to prevent any support or aid being afforded to the Egyptian Commander. It was asserted that some time previously the Imam had agreed with Mahomed Ally to pay him an annual tribute if placed in possession of the Island of Bahrein, but the Agent at IVlaskat reported that the secret instructions held from His Highness by the Regency of that port were to join cordially with Hamud ben Azan of Sohar, in his opposition to the encroachments of Khorshid Pasha, if it be ascertained that the Sheikh was acting in his exhibition of hostility, otherwise they were to be guided by circumstances. The establishment of the 2 D 2206 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. supremacy of Mahomed Ally over the Province of Oman, and the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf, was so obviously opposed to the influence and interests of the Imam in this quarter, that he cannot view the progress of Khorshid Pasha with indifference. At all events, the line of policy taken by the British Government, with reference to the Pasha's encroachments, would in the Besident's opinion ensure the neutrality of the Maskat Government, even if it should refuse to join those Arabian Chiefs. 387. In view of the threatened attack by Korshid Pasha on the island of Bahrein, the Bombay Government authorized General Maitland to interpose to prevent any such attempt. The Egyptian Commander himself was appre hensive of the British opposition to his intended attack on Bahrein, and he wrote to Captain Hennell, with a view to sound him as to our policy in regard to his movements. Captain Hennell clearly indicated the views of the British Government and requested that he would not undertake any active operation against Bahrein without previous intimation. 388.

Secret Department. To—I. P. WmoiTQHBY, Esq., Secretary to the Government, Bombay. S ir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated respectively the 28th ultimo and the 1st instant. 2. In reply to the latter of these communications I am instructed by the Eight Honorable the Governor-General of India to state, for the information of the Honorable the Governor in Council, that His Lordship is aisposed to think that, if the letter of the Honorable the Governor of Bombay to the address of the Naval Commander in Chief dated the 28th ultimo reaches His Excellency before Kliorshed Pasha is prepared to attempt putting into execution his threat of attacking the island of Bahrein with a view to its con quest, the authority given to His Excellency to interpose to prevent the attempt, and to encourage resistance to it if it shall be made, will ha\e proved sufficient to deter Khorshed Pasha from further prosecuting his design. For that officer must, soon after the dispatch of his letter to the Resident in the Persian Gulph, have heard from Egrypt that his proceeding had attracted the notice of Her Majesty's Ministers, and the prosecution of conquests in Arabia would, in all probability, have either carried on with redoubled vigor in order that his conquest might be rendered as extensive as possible before it could be arrested by the strong remonstrance of the British Government, or they would have been suspended by orders from his master the Viceroy of Egypt. His addressing Captain Hennel in order, as it should seem, to sound that officer as to the line of policy which the British authorities in the East were likely to adopt with regard to his extending his conquest beyord the point, which he had then attained, seems to indicate that he had already received some intimation from Egypt that the British Government was strongly opposed to his proceedings. And the reply which he would receive from Captain Hennel must have convinced him that such was also the feeling of the British authorities in the East. The request of Captain Hennel that he would not undertake any active operation against Bahrein without previous intimation, in order that British subjects might be duly warned of the posture of affairs, was exceedingly well timed and judicious, and may. His Lordship trusts, have contributed to delay the meditated attack on Bahrein till the arrival of Rear-Admiral Maitland off the island. 3. Under these circumstances it appears to the Governor-General most probable that the necessity or further interference on the part of this Government to save Bahrein from falling into the hands of the Egyptian General will have been obviated, either by his having attacked it successfully before the Admiral s arrival, or by the Admiral's presence and interference having rescued it from attack. And His Lordship, in the absence of instructions from England as to the mode of arresting the Egyptian asrgressions on the tribes inhabiting the coast of the Persian Gulph which would coincide with the policy of Her Majesty's Ministers, feels some difficulty in authorizing any further measures of interference than those which have already been communicated for the guidance of the Naval Commander in Chief. 4. In the event however of the Chief of Bahrein having, as Captain Ilennel anticipates, claimed onr interposition and offered io place the island under British protection, the Gov ernor -General will authorize Sir Frederick Maitland to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty's squadron in the Gulph, and to intimate to Khorshed Pasha that he has done so and that it will be incumbent on that General to abstain from further military pro ceedings till both officers shall have time to receive orders from their respective Governments, It must be presumed that an intimation to this effect would produce a cessation of hostilities against Bahrein, and, if it should fail and Khorshed Pasha should persist in his design. Admiral Maitland will be justified in declaring that the Egyptian General, if he attempts to cross over to the island of Bahrein, must hold himself responsible for commencing hostilitiesPart VI-Chap. XLIV.] 207 againet the British Government whose officers are empowered to defend Bahrein against his invasion till the pleasure of Her Majesty'd Government shall be made known to them. After this declaration the Admiral must exercise his discretion as to the most expedient metbod to be adopted for the defence of Bahrein. 5. There is no other part of the correspondence received with your despatch of the 1st instant that requires immediate notice. 6. His Lordship requests that the Hon'ble the Governor will, as he proposes, forward hisdespatches to the Admiral by Her Majesty's ship Volage, and that he will avail himself of the best and earliest opportunities of transmitting copies of this correspondence for the information of the Honorable the Secret Committee and of Her Majesty's Consul in Egypt.

(Ill) PROGRESS OF EGYPTIAN INFLUENCE ON THE GULF TRIBES AND BRITISH ATTEMPTS TO FORM CONFEDERACY AGAINST THE EGYPTIAN POWER. 389.

I had the less hesitation in undertaking this object, as the state of affairs in Persia appeared sufficiently tranquil to allow of my absence without detriment to the public service. 2. On the evening of the 26th ultimo 1 embarked in the Hugh Lindsay and arrived at Bah- Bahrein. mw 011 aftmKxm of the 28th. Bern^ desirous • of learning more precisely the real sentiments entprtained by Shaik Abdoollah ben Ahmed, the chief of that i?land, with reference to Khorshid Pasha's proceedings, and also ascertaining as far as possible the actual motives which had in duced him, contrary to every expectation, so readily to acknowledge the supremacy of Mohamed Ally, by consenting to pay him an annual tribute, I lost no time in requesting that I might be favored with an interview. The Shait having agreed to meet me at the Aeent's house in Munama, I landed early the next morning, and was shortly after joined by him attended only by his ^uzeer Hajee Boo Shab. After the usual compliments, and some preliminary conver sation upon the state of Syria, and the present hostile attitude maintained on the Aleppo Frontier by the Egyptian and Turkish Armies, all those present withdrew, excepting the old Chief and his Wuzeer, myself and Arabic Moonshee. I then informed the Shaik that I had taken advantage of the steamer touching at Bahrein, partly in order to renew the personal acquaintance which had commenced between us so many years before, and partly to obtain a more full explanation from him touching the motives which had led him to submit so unexpectedly to Khorshid Pasha, that I had felt much concerned to learn from his reply to the letti-r I had sent to him by the Government vessel, the insufficient grounds, as they appeared to me, of his hasty proceeding ; it was true, I said, that upwards of three months before 1 had declined giving an opinion upon the point he had then referred to me, regarding the expediency or otherwise of his sending a member of his family to Lahsah to meet Khorshid Pasha, because at that time, not having been made acquainted by the latter with hia yiews upon Bahrein, it appeared to me a matter of little consequence which way the Shaik208 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV, decided on a point of apparently sucli minor importance. I had however mentioned in tbat communication that I possessed no instructions from the Government, but that I would make a reference to Bombay on the subject. Under these circumstances, and especially referring' to his promise ^iven to my Assistant Captain Edmunds that he would take no steps in regard to placing himself under the authority or protection of any foreign Power without first com- muoicating with the British Residency, 1 said that I did not think the Shaik had acted either so openly or fairly as he ought to have done, considering the intimate nature of his relations with the British Government, in having entered into an engagement with Khorshid Pasha without first giving us specific notice of his intimation to do so. In reply to my observations the Shaik said that he considered the object of his writing the letter referred to was sufficiently explicit, that on the receipt of the reply informing him that he himself was the best judge as to the expediency or otherwise of sending one of his relations to Lahsah, he had given up all hopes of either support or Hssistance from the British, that considering himself thus left to his own unassisted resources, and finding himself threatened with a war with Aboothabee, his trade harassed by the aggressions of Esa-bin-Tareef, his Bed win subjects on the main going over in great numbers to Khorshid Pasha, who was then threaten ing an invasion, considering moreover the difficulty of defending Bahrein from an attack if made from the opposite coast, there being many places where in a few hours a fleet of 3 hundred boats could make its way across, without the possibility of being approached by either ship or bugla on account of the shallow water and numerous shoals : taking, he repeated, all these circumstances into consideration, he thought his own interests were best consulted by his agreeing to pay the Pasha so trifling a sum, as little more than 2,000 dollars a year, to secure the iutegrity of his own territories, and the undisturbed possession of his own authority over them, as it had been expressly stipulated by him that no agents of the Pasha were to reside in Bahrein. I replied, that the Shaik had entered into a very serious engagement, which by binding him to consider the friends and enemies of Khorshid Pasha as his own might for aught he knew place him sooner or later in hostile relations with the British Gov ernment, and therefore as it was opposed to the spirit of the first article of our Treaty with the pacificated Arabs, which pledged him as one of its members to the maintenance of a lasting peace with the English, I felt certain that my own Government would not sanction it, and therefore I considered it my duty to hand him a distinct protest again&gt;t it. The Shaik after having read this protest which is nearly the same r tho , rvr hi ^, * a&lt;Ivisable from Bahrein, to send to xLhorshid Pasha and of which a copy and translation is now enclosed for the information of the Government' Again expressed his regret that he had not been made sufficiently aware before that the support of the British Government would have been afforded him, but that after having written the letter he had referred to, he did not think that any blame could attach to him. On my pointing out that upwards of three months had elapsed between the date of the communication in question, and that of the engagement he had entered into with the Pasha, in which interval his interview with Captain Edmunds, and the visit of Rear-Ad miral Mairland, must have made him quite aware of the views of the English Government with reference to the proceedings of that personage, he replied that the engagement alluded to had been negotiated before the arrival of the Wellesley, and the date actually affixed, only marked the period when it was finally ratified. The Shaik adverting to my remark touching the possibility of his engagement with the Pasha placing him in hostile relations with us, observed that such a contingency could never occur; it was true, he added, that he had been compelled by the pressure of circumstances, for his own preservation, to make certain arrange ments, but that on the Pasha calling upon him at any time to act in opposition to the views of the British Government he should always consider it quite a sufficient reply that he had been forbidden compliance by us. Upon my pressing this point further, he said that both himself and every other Arab detested being at all connected with, or coming under the rule of the Egyptians, and that if the British Government would give him a distinct and written pledge, to protect him, and his, from all attacks and aggressions of Khorshid Pasha and the Arab tribes connected with him, that he would drop all further connexion with the Pasha, and intimating that we had disapproved of the agreement he had entered into, avow himself a dependent of Great Britain, In my asking the Shaik to give me a few lines to the above effect, to enable me to submit them to the authorities in India, he declined doing so, saying that for the present at least he had got rid of a pressing evil by a comparatively trifling sacrifice and he would not therefore give a document which might seriously commit himself, until he received the fullest and most satisfactory assurances from the Government of its protection, and even then, he said, that to preserve his own consistency, he must decline compliance with the terms of his agreement with the Pasha upon the grounds, that they were displeasing to us. Towards the conclusion of the interview when I remarked to the Shaik that he appeared more inclined to connect himself with the Egyptian than the British Government, he seemed alarmed and altered his tone, saying, that he rejoiced beyond measure to find that the encroachments of Khorshid Pasha in this direction were so displeasing to England and that were this generally known among the Maritime Arabs and Bcdowins it would diffuse universal joy—that nothing! but the skill with which the Egyptian Commander had availed himself of the unhappy feuds and divisions among the tribes could have enabled him to establish himself in Central Arabia, with such a compara tively small force, but that in the event of Ibrahim Pasha suffering any check or defeat fromPart VI—Chap. XLIV.] 209 the Sultan's Army in Syria, almost eveiy Arab in Nedgd would be immediately arrayed against him after alluding in a tone of complaint to the Government not having compelled Esa-bin-Tareef and the Al-i-AUy to return to their allegiance to him, but expressing his sincere desire for the maintenance of his friendly relations with the British, the Shaik took his deparature. 3. The impression I have received from this interview is, that Shaik Abdoolah Mir Ahmed beino' now advanced in years is unwilling to be placed in any situation calling for active and personal exertion, and that to avoid this he is prepared to make considerable sacrifices. He is evidently overawed by the almost invariable success which has hitherto attended the political intrigues, and military operations of Khorshid Pasha. Indeed to such an extent does this influence act upon his otherwise naturally acute mind, that I am inclined to think he is doubtful whether the Ensrlish could cope with the Fasha prosperously by land, however superior they may be by sea, at all events so great is the Shaik's desire to have his tranquillity as little disturbed as possible that I am by uo means certain whether he would not prefer allowing matters to remain on their present footinor than bestir himself to main tain his independence even with the aid and support of fie British Government. Nevertheless, he would be delighted to be relieved from the burden he has taken upon himself if this could be done by the influence of England without imposing upon him the necessity of making any personal exertion. 4. As a general belief has been entertained by myself, as well a' others, that Bahrein could be protected by our vessels of war from an attack, I think it riyht to draw the atten tion of the Government to the positive assertion of the Shaik, that there are many parts between the island and the main, where neither bugla nor ship could be of any service in preventing a large fleet of boats from makinj; its way across in the course of a few hours. Shaik Abdoollah assured me, that in the time of Shaik Nassir, he had himself successfully attacked Bahrein in this manner, although his antagonist possessed a strong naval force, but which could not be made available. 5. No alteration appears to have taken place in the stations and distribution of the Egyptian Army in Nedgd; the Pasha himself being, according to the latest; accounts, still at his Head Quarters in Surmada, settling the affairs of Central Arabia. Shaik Abdoolah, in speaking of Beymee, and its refusal to submit to Said bin Mootluk, mentioned a report, that Khorshid had given 10,000 crowns to 400 camelmen, and 100 horse of the Mutteer Bed wins, under Bin Buttal, and Houssey, to m;irch across by land to reinforce Said bin Mootluk, who belonged to that tribe. The Shaik added, that considering the season, the diffieiency of water in the desert, and other difficulties, he doubted whether the expedition would be undertaken. In concluding the subject of Bahrin I have only to observe that the tone of my conversation and the tenor of my protest have made Shaik Abdoolah aware that I consider he has placed himself in a somewhat ambiguous position with reference to us. It must however remain for the Government to decide, whether it is advisable to detach him altogether from the Egyptians by giving him the written pledge of protection he asks for. 6. On the 1st instant the Hugh Lindsay anchored off Aboothabee, within the reefs about three quarters of a mile from the town, a 00 ia e&lt; '' position which could not have been occupied by a sailing vessel without incurring much risk: thus shewing the advantages which would attend permanent addition of a steamer to the Gulf Squadron. It was afterwards ascertained by sounding that the Hugh Lindsay could have lain within a pistol shot of the place without the least danger. Shaik Khuleifa bin Jhalboot having come on board, I informed him, after the usual compliments on both sides had passed, that having received information which led me to believe that certain Chiefs on the coast had, by entering into friendly communica' tion with Sued bin Mootluk, been acting contrary to the understanding which had been come to in their interview with Captain Edmunds on the occasion of the recent visit of Admiral Maitland, I had lost no time in repairing to the spot in order to ascertain who the individuals were, who had thus rendered themselves obnoxious to the displeasure of the British Government by their deceitful proceedings. The Shaik on reply denied with great apparent earnestness and sincerity, that he had given the slighest countenance and support to the Pasha's Agent; on the contrary, he said, that he had expressly intimated to Shaik Sultan bin Suggur, that the only condition upon which he would consent to levy all former feuds and quarrels in oblivion was the expulsion of Sued bin Mootluk from his territories within a given time. The Shaik then dwelt with much earnestness upon his close alliance and friendly relations with the inhabitants of Brymee, who, he added, were supported by Humood bin Azan of Johar, and quite determined to resist any attempt to bring them under the rule of the Egyptians ; that he had received two communications from Sued bin Mooltuk sealed with the Pasha's Signet, calling upon him to acknowledge the authority of that person of which he had not taken the slightest notice (an assertion which I afterwards ascertained was a positive falsehood) ; that from the time of the receipt of the last letter I had addressed to him upon the subject of Sued bin Mootluk he had been more than ever determined to avoid all connexion with that individual, but on the contrary, to cultivate more sedulously than before his relations with the British Government, and resisting 1 to the last extremity all attempts of Khorshid Pasha to subjugate him, to look to the English alone for support and protection. On my asking Shaik Khuleefa whether he would give me a written paper expressive of these sentiments. Copy and translate of declaration made ly he readily assented, and I have now the honor Shaik Khuleefa bin Shakboot. to enclose a copy and translation of this docu ment for the information of the Hon 'ble the Governor in Council. The Shaik was profuseI 210 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. in his expressions of satisfaction that he had seen me and had been made so explicity aware of the disapprobation with which the proceedings of Khorshid Pasha and Sued bin Mootluk in these quarters was viewed by the British Government, adding that the Pasha's Agent was only a promoter of feuds and quarrels among the tribes and that he would pledge himself that ii once removed from Shargah that person should not be allowed to land at any place between Aboothabee and the Guttur Coast. Notwiihstandiag all these professions, 1 felt quite satisfied from his manner that the Beniyas Chief had been in frequent communication with the Egyptian Agent, but I think the effect f f this visit and the tone held by me will prevent his commit ting himself for the present by any overt support or assistance to Sued bin Mootluk. Prior to taking his departure, the steamer was got underweigh at the Shaik's request, and the manner in which she steamed out of the narrow channel in which she was lying, directly against the wind appeared to make a very powerful impression upon him. 7. Leaving Aboothabee at sunset, the Hugh Lindsay hove to opposite Debaye the Delays, next morning, and about noon Shaik Mukhtoom, the Chief of that place, came on board. On my opening the object of my visit in nearly similar terras to those I had used to the Shaik of Aboothabee, he began by expressing his earnest desire to meet the views of the British Government in every respect, and then went into a long accusation against Shaik Lhnleefa who, he affirmed, had by his treacherous proceedings rendered the engagements, which had been entered into by the Arabian Sheiks in the presence of Captain Edmunds against the common enemy, of no effect; that the Beniyas Chief had been in constant correspondence with Sued bin Mootluk ever since the date of that interview, and that only the day before two messen gers had arrived from Aboothabee to the Egyptian Agent with letters from the Shaik, offering to support him with his forces in an expedition against Brymee. Shaik Muktoom concluded by saying that although Shaik Sultan had rigidly fulfilled the terms demanded by Khuleefa as the condition upon which all further aggressions upon each other's territories were to cease, yet the latter had no sooner returned to Aboothabee than he plundered seventeen 8har ali valuable camels from the neighbourhood o£ . _ ar9 *' „ , TT . Debaye. These statements were corroborated ny the British Agent Moollah Houssein on his coming on board from Ghargah, to which place^ the Hugh Lindsay had proceeded on the arrival of Shaik Mukhtoom. The Agent like wise informed me that Shaik Sultan bin Suggar had put Sued bin Mootluk in possession of a strong fortified house and tower forming part of the defences of that town; he also told me that three days before a messenger having arrived from Khorshid Pasha via Kateef and Bahrein to the Egyptian Agent, with other letters to the address of the different Chiefs, and (according to the Sued's statements) promising speedy reinforcements, flags were hoisted, and guns fired, in token of rejoicing. Shaik Mukhtoom, ly ^ ^ , taking ' h . is doparture assured me that v he had never visited Sued bm Mootluk, and pressed me to insist upon Shaik Sultan ben Suo-o-ar icmoving him from the coast, where his presence, he observed, was productive of nothino' but injury to the Maritime Arabs. To my request that he would give me these sentiments in wntmg, the Shaik assented without hesitation. A copy and translation of this document (forming enclosure No. 4.) is now transmitted for the information of the Government. 8. Quitting Shargah on the afternoon of the 2nd the Hugh Lindsay anchored off Amulo-a- Amulgavine. vine about sunset, and at my invitation I was -r&gt; i-i - shortly afterwards visited bv Abdoollnh Rashid, the Shaik of that place. The subject of Khorshid Pasha, and the proceeding of Sue m oo luk in thrs quarter formed the topic of our conversation. The whole tenor of the Sha 1 - s language plainly showed that he was (as indeed he has always been represented) altogether averse to the presence of Sued bin Mootluk on these parts and the extension of the Egyptian influence to the shores of the Persian Gulf. He said that the expulsion of the 1 asha s Agent had been fully determined on by all the Shaiks and he was quite at a loss to comprehend the sudden change m SuHan bin Suggur's policy on this point. Shaik Abdoollah b n Rashid urged me strongly to press upon the Joasmee Chief the expediency of removino- ^ r? + i hlS . t f rrit0rieS &gt; ^ a ddedthat it was of much consequence that this should be one with as httle deky as possible, as the evils arising from his artful proceedings were increasing, while the difficulty of effecting his removal daily became greater. He expressed great satisfaction on hearing that it was my intention to send an Age at to Beymee, sayin&lt;.- hat he thought it would produce the best effect on the minds of the inhabitants of that place confirm them m their purpose of maintaning their independence, and make a great impression on all the Arabs upon the coast and in the interior. The Beni Naeem, he said, were even more i an ever determined to resist the attempts of Sued bin Mootluk to subjugate them, since the receipt of my letter of encouragement. He added that such was 'the satisfaction the arrival of this communication had produced in Brymee that a salute of ten guns had been led on the occasion. On ray showing him the paper given me by Shaik Mukhtoom (enclosure No. 4) he readily gave rae another from himself couched in the same terras. 9. At sunrise on the morning of the 3rd instant, the steamer anchored off Kasel Khymah, Masel Khymah. 110 ^'eat distance from the town. Having renuesf fr* &lt;5,-11+- k' c ^ 0lU Agent Moolla Houssein on shore with a request to . haik Sultan bin Suggur to afford me a meeting, that Chief accompanied by a few ot his principal followers came off about noon. After the usual compliments had/assed, I TPart VI—Chap. XLIV,] 211 informed the Shaik that the object of my visit to Rasel Khymah was to require an explanation from him regarding his late extraordinary conduct in having, forgetful of his obligations to the British, and his long and intimate connectiou with that Government, apparently thrown himself into the arms of a Power whose establishment on this side of the Arabian Continent, he was quite aware, was not only obnoxious to the views of England, but also inevitably dis- tructive of his own independence. These proceedings, I added, were the more inexplicable, as being wholly opposed to the language and sentiments he had expressed to R o ar-Admiral Sip Frederick Maitland, on las recent visit to Rasel Khymah. In reply to these remarks, the Joasmee Shaik entered into a lon^ explanation to show that he had been perfectly sincere in the pro fessions he had made to Captain Edmunds on board the tFelleslcy, that no one could be more fully aware than himself of the evil and injurious effects which had arisen, and were likely to arise, from the continued sojourn of Sued bin Mootluk in this quarter, and that under this impression he had actually taken steps for the removal of that individual from his territories, when all his arrangements were thwarted and overturned by the treacherous proceedings of Shaik Khuleefa of Abothabee, who had entered into a close and intimate correspondence with the Egyptian Agent, and had offered him an asylum in his port in case of his expulsion from Shargah. In corroboration of this statement the Shaik produced a letter received by Sued bin Mootluk only three days before from the Beniyas Chief, acknowledging the receipt of the Pasha's communication, and after alluding to the little assistance afforded to the Syed by the Joasmees during the four months he had resided on their coasts, pledged himself to support him in the attainment of his objects, with the whole of the resources of the Beniyas, whether by land or sea, although somewhat struck by this glaring proof of the deceitful charaettr of Shaik Khuleefa's proceedings (as the document productd must have reached its destination about t^e same time that the latter was disavowing to me in the most serious and energetic manned'his having ever entered into any correspondence with Sued bin Mootluk). I thought it best in my reply to Sooltan bin Suggur to affect to bjlieve that at the time this communication was sent, Shaik Khuleefa, having been deceived by the misrepresentations of the Pasha's Agent, had not been aware of the disapprobation with which the Government viewed the proceedings of Khorshid Pasha and Suid bin Mootluk in this part of Arabia; buc that on being made acquainted with their sentiments, he had readily pledged himself both verbally and in writing to drop all further connexion with both. On hearing this, Shaik Sooltan said that he was quite as desirous of the removal of Suid bin Mootluk from his coasts as I could be, but that the Suid had positively refused to leave the country unless satisfied that the British authorities were opposed to his continued sojourn, and would intimate the same to him in writing. The Shaik added that if I would furnish him with a document to this effect, one great difficulty in inducing the Egyptian Agent to take his departure would be removed. I replied that the conduct of Suid bin Mootluk was so directly contrary to the assurances given to H. M. Ministers by Mahomed Ally—so opposed to the declara tions of Khorshid Pasha and so immediately tending to interrupt the relations of peace and friendship existing between the maritime tribes of the Arabian Coast and the British Gov ernment, that he could be looked upon in no other light than as a disturber of the general tranquillity, and. therefore, I should have no hesitation in addressing letters both to Shaik Sultan and Suid bin Mootluk upon the expediency of the latter quitting these coasts and returning to Hedgd. I accordingly prepared the two documents, of which the accompany- Copy and translation of letter to Shaik Saltan j'? ( enclo ™ r08 No ?- . 5 and , 6 ) are ''P' 68 an&lt;1 trans - bin Piggin. lations. On receiving the communication to himself, and being made acquainted with the contents of the one addressed to the Pasha's Agent, the Shaik expressed himself quite satisfied, and said that I might rely with confidence on immediate arrangement being made for Copy and tranelation of letter to Said bin of SD ' 1 d '&gt;'? Mootluk. I answered Mootluk. tllat W1 th every wish to believe him sincere, yet I would not conceal that the confidence I should otherwise have placed in his promises had been greatly shaken by his proceedings subsequent to his intprviews with Admiral Maitland, but that if he were dona fide in his present sentiments, he must give me a paper to the same effect, as those so readily furnished by the other Shaiks on the coast. After some hesitation he said that the removal of Suid bin Mootluk, and the opinions expressed in the document referred to, might not unlikely give serious offence to Kliorshid Pasha, and therefore, in the event of his being attacked by that General, he wished to know whether he might look to the British Government for aid and support. Bearing t. o r nr o . „ mind the opinion expressed by the Eisfht letter of 'Kt ApriMn the to' H ? u ' ble the Governor-General 'that circamstanees the Bombay Government. might occur under which it might be proper that aid should be afforded to them (the Arabian Chiefs), in arms and ammunition' and also 'that Sultan bin Suggur, Chief of the Joasmee Tribe, and any other Chieftains who may seek for assistance and advice from the Resident should certainly be encouraged and strengthened as much as possible,' bearing in mind I repeat these opinions, and my firm belief that a crisis had arrived in which decided measures were called for to prevent our influence in this quarter being altogether supplanted by that of Mahomed Ally. I venture to think that I did not exceed the spirit of my instructions in distinctly assuring the Joasmee Chief that if his compliance with the wishes of the British Government involved him in hostilities with any other power, I would engage to furnish him with such munitions of war as might be necessary and p oper. On the Shaik asking me whether I would give him this promise in writing, I an&gt;w&lt;red that I had no objection to do so, but that I must first be satisfied by the departure 2 s212 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. of Suid bin Mootluk from h's coasts, that he was sincere in It ' h professions, and secondly he must add a clause t&lt;&gt; the declaration given by the otlier Shaiks, binding himself to enter into no correspondence or treaty with Mahomed Ally, his dependents or any other foreign Power, without the knowledge and consent of the British Government , and, moreover, that the friends and enemies of the English should stand in the same relations with himself. To the addition of this clause, the Shaik consented without hesitation, and said that to remove all doubts of his sincerity, the engagements above referred to mio-ht be deposited in the hands of Moollah Housseio, the British Agent at Shargah, with instructions that it was not to be handed over to him (Shaik Sultan) un il the final departure of Suid bin Mootluk and his followers. This arrangement being finally agreed upon and Shaik Sultan Declaration of Shaik Sultan. ^ vin ; his seal the declaration o£ which No. 7 is a copy and translation. I drew out an agreement to furnish him, under certain conditions, with warlike munitions, and now do myself the honour to submit a transcript of this document both in the Original and Arabic Copy Of agreement with Shaik Sultan bin for the consideration and I venture to hope, ap- Piggin regarding supplies of warlike muni- r rova ' of the Right Hon ble the Governor in tions. Council. In concluding the particulars of my . . interview wuh Shaik Sultan 1 must not omit to mention that he dwelt with great indignation r.pou the utter faithlessness of Shaik Khuluza m havmg without provocation, plundered the Debaye Chief uf a number of valuable camels' although he himself had made a considerable sacrifice in settling the claims of the former upon the latter, in order to effect a permanent reconcihation. Shaikh Sultan urged it upon me that the ensjagement to abstain from any further aggressions upon each other's territories had been solemnly ratified in the presence of my a-sietant Captain Edmunds, on board, one of the Government vessels, and therefore, I ought to take up the subject. As the Shaik's arguments were not destitute of reason, 1 promised, that when more weighty matters were settled, I would enquire into the affair, and exert my influence to procure the restoration of the plundered property. 10. In referring to the commencement of my communication to Sued bin Mootluk For translation of letter from chiefs of ( e £ nclo6Ure I f 0 - 6 ) intimating that the Beni Naeem Brymee. of Hefmee had been taken under protection pend- . ^ _ ing the settlement of the subjects in discussion between the British and Egyptian Governments, I now beg to forward, for the information or the Hon ble the (iovernor in Council, a translation of a letter from Humud bin Surtor, and Mahomed bin Abdoollah, Chiefs of the Naeem Tribe, to the British Agent at Shargah appeal ing to the English authority in the Gulf for support and protection against the intrio-ues and aggressions of Sued bin Mootluk. Thisapppal, under the present critical juncture of affairs 1 have comidered myself justified in receiving favourably, and therefore, in reply, I have encouraged them to stand firm in their determination to maintain their own independence, informed them that as soon as a suitable person can be found it is my intention to send an Agent to reside in Brymee, and that in the event of their being attacked for their compliance with our views, that 1 will furnish them with a supply of ammunition if necessary. 11. I feel quite assured that Shaik Sultan bin Sujfgur at the present moment is sincere in Copy and translation of letter to the Chiefs ^ j P ro ^ e8S ions and promises he has made to me, of the Naeem in Brymee. an( i I think it likely he will take immediate steps i • i , . i, , . to induce Sued bin Mootluk to quit his territory, in which object, aided as he will be by the support and wishes of the Shaiks of the neighbouring oifet'icts, he will probably be successFul. But the character of the Joasmee Chief is so hollow and rarthless, and at the same time so vacillating that it would not very much surprise me, to nud him again changing his intentions and policy. However this may be, I entertain ever^ hope that I have succeeded in giving a cheek, at least for the present, to the intrigues or Sued bin Mootluk, and the encroachments of Khorshid Pasha in Oman, by having infused confidence and courage into those disposed to uphold their connexion with the British, and lowered the hop-s and pretensions of the party inclined to advance the Egyptian influence in this part of Arabia.^ I consider it however my duty explicitly to lay before the Government my opinion that this favourable re-action is not likely to be permanent, unless supported by firm a d decided measures by the Indian and Home autfcorities. The repoitof Ibrahim Pasha jemg successful in his impending conflict with the Sultan—the arrival of reinforcements in Oman either by land or sea trom Khorshid Pasha, or the return of Sued bin Mootluk (suppos ing urn now removed) with a larger and better equipped body of troops—all or any one of tiiebC not improbable contingencies would be t-ufficient to turn the scale, and give the final blow to our already unsettled influence in these parts. Previously to having had the a( yantairc of a personal examination into the actual state of affai's on the Arabian Coast of this Guli, it was my opinion, as expressed in a late communication to the Hon'ble the Secret Committee, that the only effectual check to the encroachments of Mahomed Ally, in this lie* t on, could be given by Her Majesty's Ministers making serious and peremptory re- monstrauees to Cairo. I am, however, inclined now to think that this alone will not be eumcient, unless some demonstration be likewise made by the Indian Government on this side, is cut cult to point out, how such a demonstration could be mot-t effectively exhibited, but would mo.-t respectfully suggest for consideration that in the event of Shaik Sultan bin uggur not removing Sued bin Mootluk voluntarily, agreeably to his promise, that he should e o.tt'd to exj el him, and supported by our naval and military means should he allege his want oi power as an excuse for the non-perftrmance of his engagement. The naval force inPart VI—Chap. XLIV.] 213 the Gulf should be fufficiently increased to enable us to provide for the safety of Karrak, and at the same time to keep two vessels of war cruizing off the Arabian Coast until the present crisis be past. In the event of Sued bin Mootluk's return to Kateef and Khorshid Pasha ag-ain Ul lBlD CJ vy » V vr*. ^ ^ - , preparing to despatch him by sea, wiih a larger force to the Coast of Oman, authority should be given to blockade that port as well as those of Ajeer and Lohat. Should it be ascertained that any of the Chiefs on the coast, for the furtherance of their own feuds and quarrels with each other, are aiding and abetting the Egvptims, or these tribes connected with them, in attacking Brymee, they should be threatened with the destruction of their towns and vessels if they did not immediately desist, and this threat should be carried into execution if necessary. If these measures were authorised, and at the same time an explicit intimation given to Mahomed Ally by Her Majesty's Government that he would be held responsible for any loss of life which might arise from carrying them into operation, it would, I venture to think, at once put an end to the temporizing policy he has so long successfully pursued, and by compel- lino- him to issue peremptory orders for the with»irawal of his troops and agents from the direction of the Persian bulf, secure the independence of this side of Arabia, and thus establish the influence and reputation of Great Britain in this part of the world, upon a firmer founda tion than ever. (IT) SHEIRII OF RO WE IT'S DISCOURTESY TO OUR AGENT—FULL! A ISLAND, 1839. 390. Whatever we can trace about our early relation with the Sheikhs of . , ^ Koweit is interesting. They had been Vol. 68—1064 of 1839-40, p. 28o. ... j. , i * -i i * i qqq always Inendly towards us, but m lo39 we find Sheikh Jabir in the grasp of the Agents of Mehemet Ali, Yiceioy of Egypt. Lieutenant Edmunds, Assistant Resident at Bushire, was deputed by Captain Hennel to sound the Sheikh and if possible keep him from tailing into the net spread by Mehemet Ali with a view to make the Arab Chiefs on the Persian Gulf his vassals. The Sheikh, however, disposed to be friendly with the British, had a dread of the name Mehemet Ali, and received Lieut enant Edmunds with scant courtesy. We shall quote extracts from the Assistant Resident's report about the reception and the value of Koweit and the island of Eujira for commercial and military purposes :— Extract of a report from Lieutenant Edmunds, Assistant Resident, to Captain Hennell, Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, dated 5th November 1839. I h nve the honor to report that having agreeably with your instructions embarked on board this vessel, I arrived at Koweit on the i30th ultimo and immediately sent your letter to Sheik Jabir, who told the bearer that I should have an answer in the morning. From the circumstance of no return having been made to, or any notice whatever taken of the salute ficed by this vessel as we anchored, and from the Sheik's having omitted the usual compli ment paid by Arab Chiefs to English vessels of war arriving at their ports (in this instance the more marked as he had been informed that the object of my visit was to hold a personal conference with him), viz., that of sending some one of their relatives or followers on board to offer their services and welcome those arrived, I thought it as well, with a view of observing what degree of friendship he really entertained for us, to wait a day or two,before making any further advances. Meanwhile and chiefly through the great kindness and attention of Moo-a bin Faris, a wealthy and highly intelligent merchant of Bussora who has lately settled at Koweit, I was enabled to make every enquiry regarding the facility of forwarding the over land post, and other points connectid with the place. This person, who has frequently visited India and has travelled a good de»l, is much better informed than any Arab I have met with, and evidently entertains, what so few of his countrymen are capable of doing, an adequate estimate of the power os, the British Government. Hearing that I was anxious to enquire of the merchants regarding he different routes to Syria, he of his own accord came on board the vessel to volunteer his services, and afterwards introduced me to other merchants more immediately engaged in the Damascus and Alleppo trade than himself. Having until the third day after our arrival remained altogether unnoticed by Sheik Jabir, I then sent to say that 1 was desirous of meeting him ; and shortly after went to his house, when I found the old man sitting with a number of people about him. My reception was anything but gracious as the Shaik onlv half rose from his seat and did not think it necessary to lay aside the pipe which he was smoking. I told him that my visit was on6 of business only and to enquire from himself whether he was willing to assist in forwarding the Government mails; that if I had not been charged with this duty 1 should, in consequence of his neglecting to letinn our salute to answer the letter of introduction which I had brought or to take any ot er notice of us, have left the place without seeing him. He answered that his people it well paid would convey packets to Damascus, Aileppo, Bussora or Bagdad, and al&amp;o went into some details from which I did not gain any new information but which served to show t lat he hes not the excuse of dotage for his unusual conduct and manners ; from his advanced age I hac at first thought this probable. The Sheik then shortly denied having been gmlty of am omission towards us stating that he had never been in the habit ot noticing iiUglisn 2 b 2214 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. vessels of war which visited his place : and further that an answer had been written to the letter, which he expected I would have sent for : this last prove i true as it was produced. To this I answered that his lack of hospitality was unlike anything that I had witnessed amongst the Arab Cliiefs especia'ly taose of consequence, that the Imam of Muscat, although his port was often visited twice or thrice a month by Government vessels, invariaUy returned all salutes, and sent some one of his household on board with a comp imentary message, present of fruit or the like. In reply the Shaik again repeated that he had omitted nothing necessary and so the subject dropped. Notwithstanding his persisting in and justifying his refusal to return our salute and the rudeness of my reception, it is difficult to believe that Sheik Jabir intended a gratuitous insult; but these indications would seem clearly to prove that he values not the good opinion of the British Government, and would have little or no faith in its power to protect him were such a thing proffered. From what I heard and from my own observation, it would appear that although a person of some energy and rather popular a« a ruler, he is naturally a coarse bigotted Arab extremely ignorant of all countries and affairs excepting those with which he is immediately concerned and believing Mahomed Ali to he the greatest potentate on earth: this consideration and the fact of an emissary (an Fgyptian Turk) from Khorshid Pasha being now, and having for many months been resident at Koweit, may help to explain his conduct. This agent is ostensibly placed in Koweit to purchase barley, some boat-loads of which have really been sent by him to Kutest, although no grain is grown at Koweit, it being imported fro-n the Bussora river and Persian Coast; but his more important and real duties are doubtless to intrigue, gain - information, and to watch Bu^sora. He is well treated by the Sheik, who gives him the first place at his assembly or durbar, and it seems not improbable that we were slighted in order that it may be reported to the Pasha that the English receive no encouragement at Koweit. As we have no treaty with and have not of late years been (1 believe) very intimately connected with Koweit, the Sheik's conduct so far as allying himself with Egypt (and that he has submitted or allied himself or contemidates doing so can scarcely be doubted) would not appear so reprehensible as that of other Chiefs, who have been directly advised against the step and who have treaties with us : but I w^uld beg to suggest that some means of shewing the displeasure of Government might be adopted, such as for instance abstaining from affording protection to his vessels, or recovering any property lost by plunderers, etc. As Koweit exists purely by its traffic such a measure if made known would be severely felt and might effect eome change in Sheik Jabir: at any rate it would shew others that although the English men-of-war giatuitously perform the police duties of this sea, they will no longer be permitted to protect the pioperty of these who insult them by refusing to return their salutes. Leaving Koweit we proceeded to Fuleeja, distant about ten miles, and in fact forming one side of the harbour ; day was spent in examining the inner or western, and the following two days the opposite and outer side of the island. It is about eight miles long, by two or three wide, extremely low, and to all appearance .ewampy ; after rain or high tides, the soil though sandy is by no means bad, and there is plenty of fresh water and no great depth from the surface. The only village at present inhabited is Zoor containing from 100 to 150 families mostly engaged in fi^hin?, and situated on the western side of the island. I there fell in with Moobarruk, the petty Sheik of the place, a relative and dependant of the Koweit Sheik ; he also on the following day came on board the vessel to bring a sick man for advice. From Moobarruk's account the climate of Fuleeja must be very bad, for he said that most of the children died and that the people generally suffered much from fever ; the appearance of the place certainly warrants this assertion. On the western and protected side of the island the shoals run out so far that steamers and the smallest sized ships could not approach nearer than four miles ; on the eastern side there is water enough at half this distance but then the anchorage is expo-ed and there are no inhabitants. On the whole I think Fuleeja ill adapted for either a naval or military station even less so than I arrak, for although it possesses the advantiges of comparative fertility, good holding ground and on one side sheltered and safe anchorage for shipping, yet the inconvenient distance (especially so for steamers coaling) at which vessels must remain and the probable greater unhealthiness of the place are serious drawbacks. Although Fuleeja*possesses few advantages, there are several considerations connected with the neighbouring town of Koweit, which has already risen to considerable commercial importance on the decline of Bussora to render it worthy of attention should it be resolved to evacuate Karrak and gain possession of some other place; as also if a coal depot and rendezvous for the vessels of war only were sought for. Its first recommendation is the magnificent harbour, the only one in this Gulf capable of receiving very large vessels. As all the supplies come from the Persian Coast and Bussora River, and as all depend upon the sea for their livelihood, the place might be easily controlled by a naval force only. The chief merchants are men of wealth and the whole population seem actuated by a commercial spirit and much less addicted than the generality of Arabs to engaging in feuds. A line of battle ships would ride two miles from the town and ordinary vessels at half that distance. I have already stated its advantages as regards the overland post, and it is a place where intelligence would from the number of boats resorting there be quickly received from every part of the Gulf. As compared to other places in this sea, the natives praise the climate of Koweit, but as they say that the old Bussora Factory resided there for some seven or eight years there may possibly he some record of its effect on European constitution. Kowqit is certainly the mos^Part VI—Chap. XLIV.] 215 flourishing place, and would, I believe, exeeptin? Bharein (and possibly Busliire), prove a more valuable settlement than any other place in the Gulf. I have the honour to be, etc., T. EDMUNDS, As»tt. Resident, Persian Gulf. 391. The observations and suggestions made by Captain Hennell in his letter dated 12th October 1839 on this report are interesting, and it is quoted below: — Herewith I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the Honourable the Governor in Council, the accompanying extract from Lieutenant Edmunds' report to me of his visit to Koweit and Fuleeja, under date the 5th instant. 2. It was with regret I noticed the great want of civility exhibited by Sheik Jabir towards Mr. Edmund?, the more so, as the friendly tone of his correspondence by no means led me to anticipate such a lack of hospitality and attention. I am inclined to coincide in the opinion expressed by my assistant that the old Chief probably wished Khorshid Pasha to be made aware of the little consideration given to the Knirlish in Koweit. In fact Sheik Jabir, like the ruler of Bahrein, appears completely overawed by the extraordinary success attending Mahomed Ally's measures, and evidently possesses but a very inadequate idea of the power of Great Britain. 3. It is certainly desirable that some notice should be taken of the uncourteous behaviour _ , . , of the Governor of Koweit, and the suggestion Reearding the notice ^ to bo laker, of his made by Mr. Edmunds of withholding protection behaviour. Objection agiunst putting his port out n i • , i t • &amp; r v of British protection. 1:1,0111 hls yes^els, or declining to recover any property piratically taken from them, might not be the least efficacious method of shewing him how much the increasing commercial prosperity of his town has been fostered and promoted by the suppression of piracy, and the maintenance of the tranquillity of the Gulf by the policy pursued by the British Government. Among other reasons, however, which render me reluctant to recommend the adoption of the measure suggested, there is one of greater weight than the rest, namely, the risk of reviving, and piving strength to those habits of piracy and rapine, which although now by our vigorous policy apparently so successfully repressed among the maritime tribes of this Gulf are still only dormant; and were it generally known that aggressions upon the trade of a commercial port like Koweit would be overlooked by us, would, it is to be feared, speedily regain their former strength. Moreover, as justly remarked by Mr. Edmunds, the conduct of Sheik Jabir although unfriendly in so evidently preferring a connexion with the Egyptians to entering into closer relations with us, is not so reprehensible as that of others, who have treaties with us, and who have been made expressly aware of the views of the British Government in opposing the extension of Mahomed Ally's influence in this direction. If any one of the Chiefs of this Gulf deserves more than another to be deprived of the advantages of our protection, it is the Sheik of Bahrein ; the commerce of whose island, were it not for us, would soon be most seriously injured, but who, although well aware of this circumstance, has deliberately thrown himself into the hands of the Egyptians, notwithstanding his being assured of our support and aid, in the maintenance of his own independence. 4.

Their letters to the Bombay Government quoted below show the measures they wished to take for the purpose in view. Secret Depai tment. To I. P. Willoughbt , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, transmitting Volume 65-1061 of 1839, p. 542. 9?P ie . s of despatches from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to your address. 2. From the tenor of your letter, the Governor -General was led to expect that the Honourable the Governor in Council would favour him with such observations on the subject216 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. of these despatches as his esp rience might su^^est, and His Lordship would have been happy to avail himself of them in forming his own judgment. But as I have not heard from you again on the subject, and as these papers relate to matters of importance on which it is desirable that some resolution should be formed without delay, I am directed to communicate to yon, for the information of His Honour in Council, the following remarks of the Governor- General on Captain HennelPs despatches. 3. His Lordship hiirhly applauds the zeal and energy which induced Captain Hennell to Captain Henuell's letter A, dated 4th July 1839, undertake his late vojage along the coast, in with enclosures. order to ascertain fully the motives which had induced the Chief of Bahrein and others to submit, without apparent necessity, to Khoorsia Pacha, the Egyptian General, and to endeavour by his presence and personal influence and exhortation to stop the progress of submission on the part of the Maritime Chiefs which might otherwise, he had reason to apprehend, extend over the province of Oman. 4. The explanation afforded by Sheik Abdoola bin Ahmed, the Chief of Bahrein, either in his letter to Captain Hennell, or in his conversation with that officer, of the motives which had induced him so unexpectedly and apparently so unnecessarily to place his territories in a position of dependence on Egypt, and to become himself tributary to Muhammad Ally, appeal's to the Governor-General most unsatisfactory. The facility of erossin&lt;r from the main land to Bahrein in boats, which he alleges as the cause of his weakne-s and inability to oppose the Egyptian General, might have been a valid reason for submission to an army assembled on the coa^t, and furnished with boats to effect the passage. But no such imminent danger threatened him, and much time must have been occupied in preparations for the invasion of Bahrein. Jar from waiting for these, the Sheik appears, on the arrival of an Agent of Khoorshed Pasha, to have surrendered his independence at the first summons, and even now to discuss «ith complacency the propriety of his conduct. From the date of the enga gemenr, entered into with Khoorshed Pasha, it appears that it was negotiated subsequently to the visit of Admiral Maitland and Mr. Edmunds to Bahrein, and the Sheik's assertion that the engagement was concluded before the arrival of the IFellesley at Bahrein can deserve little credit, as such a transaction could hardly have escaped the knowledge of Mr. Edmunds, if in reality the island of Bahrein had become a dependency of Egypt before his visit. It must therefore be assumed that Sheik Abdoolah consented to become tributary to the ruler of Egypt, not only before he was (compelled by any military demonstration to adopt that course, but after all the encouragement to resistance and promise of support which he had received from the British Government, and it would thence appear manifest that, by whatever motives he may have been influenced, he has deliberately preferred his present connexion with Egypt to his former independence in alliance with the British Government. 5. Sheik Abdoola's conduct is unfortunately not a solitary instance of too ready submission to the demands of Khoorshid Pasha and his Agent Syud bin Mootluk. There is reason to believe that Sheik Kuleefa bin IShakboot and Sooltan bin Sugfiur had rather encouraged than otherwise the pretensions of Syud bin Mootluk and but for the app-arance of the Resddent on the coast of Oman, it is to be apprehended that the other Chieftains in that quarter would ere long have been induced or compelled to submit to the authority of the Officer appointed by Khoorshid Pasha to rule over them. 6. Under such circumstances it could have only been by energetic measures such as those adoptei by Captain Hennell, that the continued influence of the British Government over these petty States could have been longer maintained. 7. Tfie Governor-General it therefore prepared to approve and confirm the engagements entered info hy that officer for the supply of munition* of war to certain of the Chieftains^ and His Lordship hopes that the engagements concluded hy several of the chiefs 10 adhere to their former connexion, and not to permit Syud bin MootluJc to obtain a footing among them, will he faithfudy performed, 8. Of this there might not have been much prospect if Khoorshid Pasha and his Agent, Syud bin Mootluk, were to persist in prosecuting their designs against the independence of the Chiefs of Oman, for it has been seen with how little regard to honor and good faith several of these Chieftains who had engaged to Lieutenant Edmunds to oppose with one accord the encroachment? of Syud bin Mootlnk were almost immediately afterwards in friendly communication with that officer, and were preparing the way for the general subjugation of their own, and of all the surrounding territories. 9. Any dependence on the steadiness of these Chieftains to the engagempnts they have subscribed being therefore limited to the inducements which they may have to keep them, and as Captain Hennell had so little reason to rely on their good faith after he had left the coast, he appears to have acted with a sound discretion in resorting to other means of deterring Syud bin Mootluk from his projected subjugation of Oman. The Governor-General approves the tenor of the Resident's letter to that officer, and trusts that the remonstrance may not only produce an effect upon his proceedings, but may tmd as much as their engage ments to Captain Hennell to unite the Arab Chief'ain in the defencee of their independence. 10. Captain Hennell's previous remonstrance to Khoorshid Pasha appears not to have been without effect, and his protest against the encroachments of the Egyptian forces in the direction of Oman, will, it is to be hoped, lead to the immediate recall of Syud bin Mootluk from that province, %Part VI—Chap. XLIV.] 217 11. Captain Hennell having thus succeeded in restoring, for a time at least, the con fidence of the Arab Chiefs, submits his opinion that their present more favorable disposition will not be permanent unless supported by firm and decided measures of the Indian and Home authorities. It is suggested that the tone of remonstrance addressed to the Gove nment of Egypt should become more urgent and peremptory, and that it should be supported by a military dfnions'.ration on this side, and that in case of the Joasaiee Thief failing to perform bis engagement by the expulsion of Syud bin Mootluk, he should be compelled by a naval and military force to do so, to accomplish which objects an augmentation of the number of vessels employed in the Persian Gulph would become necessary. 12. The measures which ought to be adopted for the preservation of British interests m the Persian Gulph and the Aiabian shores at the present moment must depend, I am directed to observe, so much on the line of policy wi ieh Her Majesty's Ministers may think proper to pursue towards the ruler of Egypt, both with relation to European interests, and on consideration of the manner in which the remonstrances of England against the encroachments of Khoorshid Pasha have been virtually neglected, that the proceedings of tlie Indian Government must be confined to following &lt;&gt;ut that system of conduct towards the Lgyi^tian authorities which may be recommended, or laid down for our guidance by the Britis &gt; Cabinet. And it appears to His Lordship that even he were not deterred under this restriction from pursuing a more immediate course of active operations in support of British interest on the Coasts of Arabia, it would be imprudent not to wait the event of the measures of negotiation or remonstrance which are now probably in progress to induce Mahammad Ally- to recall his army in Arabia from the coa-t. Eor it is evident that no warlike demonstrations that the Indian (Government lias the means of making in support of those of the Arab Chiet- tains who may hold out against Khoorshid Pasha would lead to such decisive results as the complete withdrawal of liis army and his lately estab ished authority by the orders ot' his master. Nor ci'uld we feel assured from the fickle and faithless character of many of these Chieftains that our efforts in their behalf would be cordially seconded by themselves. Khoorsliid Pasha appears to exercise an extraordinary influence over them and while they remain lukewarm or indifferent to our endeavours to excite them to the maintenance of their independence, it would require an extent of force to preserve our iiiflu^nce over them, which it is not consistent with oiher political considerations for the Indian Government at present to afford for this object. 13. The Maritime Chiefs on the coast of Arabia who subscribi d the Treaty of 1820 are under certain obli^atiots to the British Government, of which such engagements as the Chief' of Bahrein has concluded with the Egyptian General are subversive, and it is manifest 'hat, if this General's process were allowed to go unchecked and uncontrolled, all the other Chiefs, including the Imaum of Muscat, may be compelled to submit to similar conditions, whereby their friendlv connexion with the British Government would become dependent on the will of another Power, and our long continued influei.ce over them, which without infringing their liberty and independence has been successfully directed to insure their prosperity, and ta the suppression of their national feuds and acts of mutual violence and aggression, would be changed for the grinding oppression of a foreign master from whom their commerci;il intercourse with the British possessions in India would meet with little favor or encourage ment, The obligations ot' these Chieftains by treaty to the British Government, the stroni? motives which the Indian authorities feel to maintain their beneficial influence over them, whereby piracy and slave dealing have been effectually suppressed, and tl e insidious and unfriendly attempts which the ruler of Egypt persists in making to loosen those ancient ties by which the British Government is connected with the Arab tribes on the coast, are fit subjects for the grave consideration of the British Cabinet, and it is fitting that the Indian Government should suspend any mnasures which may involve it in direct h( stility with that of Egypt, till the receipt of instructions, consequent on the continued refusal or evasion of Mahamoaad Ally to attend to the expostulations of Her Majesty's Consul-General at Cairo, to desist from his projects of conquest on the coast of Arabia from the Home authorities. I'l', In the meantime His Lordship deems it to be proper, and he trusts th 't it will l&gt;e sufficient, that such Chieftains as evince a determination to protect their independence against the encroachment of the Eiiypiian forces, should be cordially assisted in the manner arranged by Captain Hennell with ammunition, and that officer should continue to proclaim the just and valid objections of the British Government to the aggressions and pretensions of Khoorshid Pasha, and should consider himself to be fully authorized to extend his measures for granting aid in quarters where encroachment is threatened in munitions of war, and in provisions as may seem to him to be useful and requisite. The means for affording such aid, including a pecuniary credit of fixed amount, yet such as may be reasonably supposed to be adequate for the occasion, should be placed by the Hon ble the Governor in Council at Captain Heunell's disposal, and I am directed to request that the necessary orders may be forthwith issued for this purpose. It would be very desirable that our naval force in the Persian Gulph should ba increased to the extent suggested by the Resident, but the probable demands for ships of war in other quaiters may perhaps preclude the possibility of furnishing this additional toica at the present moment. A copy of this desra 'ch, with extracts from Captain Hennelfs letters, will be furnished to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chi'f from this office, and Hi'? Excellency will be informed that His Lordship considers it ti be an object of great and pressing national interest that if possible the request of Captain Hennell for the presence in the Gulph of two additional ships of war should be complied218 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. with.' Hia Lordship, however, is aware tbafc this request must be considered with reference to information which His Exce lency may have received from the HouoraMe the President in Council and from other quarters, and His Excellency will be requested to communicate his decision on the subject to the Honorable the Governor in Council of Bombay, with whom it will also rest, on this statement of His Lordship's general views, to determine to what extent Captain Hennell's recommendation can be prudently complied with from the Indian Navy. 15. The Grovernor-General trusts that whatever may be the result of Captain Henuell's late negotiations with the other Maritime States in checking the progress of Egyptian aggression, there is no immediate fear for the eecarity of our ally, the Imaum of Muscat. 16. The Governor-General is not sufficiently acquainted with the condition and position of Bryme to be able to form a judgment of the expediency of extending: our protection to its Chiefs. Such a measure appears to go beyond the principle on which our relations with other Chieftains in the same quarter have been established, and is of a nature to demand much caution and consideratijn ere it is finally adopted. The assistance afforded to the Sheiks of Bryme as reported in Captain Hennell's letter of the 10th July is approved, and it is to be hoped that if they are attacked by Syud bin Mootluk, the authorities of Muscat will see their own interest in affording them support. 17. His Lordship is happy to perceive from Captain Hennell's letter of the 9th July that the removal of Mirza Afsud from the Government of Bushire is ascribed to a desire to conciliate the British Government. 18. I have only further to add that the Governor-General presumes that no opportunity is omitted of keeping Her Majesty's Consul at Cairo acquainted with all the occurrences which take place in the Persian Gulf, I have the honor to be.

' 28th ' ', two letters. 2. In reply, I am desired to state that the Gov- „ 31st „ „ ernor m Council will be aware that the course of , P olic J to be observed in respect to the move ments of the Egyptian forces upon the shores of the Persian Gulph must be mainly determined by the instructions which may be received from the authorities in England. No recentart VI—Chap. XLIV-3 219 intimation on this subject has reached His Lordship, but the opposition of tie British Govern' meat to the late course of measures adopted under the orders of His Highness the Pasha has been openly declared. On the one hand, the Government of India in the absence of more exact orders as to the policy to be followed by Her Majesty's Government at Home must seek not to multiply any avoidable occasions of collision, while at the same time it may be believed that His Highness would not wish to commit himself to a direct contest with the British power. It is of importance therefore not to weaken the impression of oi-r determination to resist his plans of aggression. For effectual resistance to those plans in the actual state of the demands for the employment in other quarters of the naval force at present in the Indian Seas, it seems to His Lordship that some additional aid from Her Majesty's Navy would he necessary for the special service of the Gulph, and His Honor in Council is requested to furnish a separate report to the Secret Committee of the means which can be spared for that service from the Indian Navy and of the extent of assistance which it may seem desirable to obtain from England. A copy of the despatch now under reply and of this letter will be communicated to the Secret Committee by His Lordship by the ensuing steam mail, and such instructions applied for as the exigency of the case appears to His Lordship to require. In the mean time bearing in mind the general views above indicated, I am desired to communicate such remarks and directions as have suggested themselves ta His Lordship upon a review of the papers now before him. 3. His Lordship does not think it necessary to take any formal notice of the uncourteous conduct of the Sheik of Koweit. Captain Hennell will no doubt be able to mark in his inter course with that chieftain that his proceedings have been such as to excite the displeasure of the British Government. 4. The Governor-General is not disposed to view the question of our supplying our allies in the Gulph with arms to enable them to resist the aggression of the Egyptians in the same light in which it would seem from the 7th paragraph of your letter of the 31st ultimo to have appealed to His Honor in Council. Having remonstrated with Mahomed Allee on his supposed projects of aggrandizement on the shores of the Gulph and having received positive assurances that he harbours no such designs as those attributed to him, the British Govern ment can be accused of no offence against, Mahomed Allee in supplying munitions of war to its allies to enable them to repel attacks of the Egyptians which after such assurances must be regarded as the unauthorized and unwarrantable aggressions of the Pacha's Generals. It was with this view of the question as between the British Government and that of Egypt that the Governor-General in my letter of the 12th August last specifically authorized the supplying munitions of war to the Chiefs of Brymee, and he is still of opinion that so long as the pro ceedings o£ those chiefs are directed solely and obviously to the preservation of their own independence, this is for the present the most expedient mode in which the chiefs decidedly friendly to the British Government should be enabled to resist the encroachments of the Egyptian Generals. 5. The most important question arising out of these despatches which requires the atten tion and the decision of the Government of India is that which relates to the position and disposition of the 1 maum of Muscat. This Prince has ever evinced the most friendly disposi tion to the British, and the Governor General deems it so essential at the present moment to cuLivate the most intimate relations with him that the first step which His Lordship would take for the recovery of our influence on the coast and for effectually checking the encroach ments of the Egyptians, is the present establishment of a British officer at Muscat to have the more immediate charge, though subject to the general superintendence of Captain Hennell, of our political relations there, in the province of Oman, and along such a portion of the coast as may be more conveniently controlled from Muscat than from Karrack. 6. His Lordship directs me to observe that he considers the experience and qualifications of either Lieutenant Kdmunds or Captain Hamerton to be such as that either of them might properly be selected for this duty. 7. The credentials to be given to the Political Officer deputed to Muscat should in the first instance convey little more than the assurances of the most cordial and friendly feeling on the part of the British Government, and should state as the reason for his deputation to Muscat that it is thought highly expedient in the present state of affairs, that the close alliance between the two States should be made clearly apparent and that the Imaum should have near his person a con fidential and capable Agent, with whom he may consult or through whom he may fully and instantly communicate with the Government in India in any difficulty. It would assuredly be the wish of His Lordship that the danger of extended influence on the part of the Egyptians on the coast of the Persian Gulph should pass away without any exhibition of warlike inter ference on our part, but the tide of encroachment may come so rapidly on the chiefs of that coast as to induce them and particularly His Highness the Imaum to seek assistance from the British Government, and as it appears to His Lordship this assistance can only be given to him in arms and stores, in naval protection and in officers for the purpose of raising and con ducting a local force. To the two first of these within reasonable limits His Lord^ip could see no objection, but before the organization at Muscat of a military force under British officers should be consented to, it seems to His Lordship that a clear case of necessity should be made out and previous knowledge of many circumstances with which he is now unacquainted should be obtained ; and though in the ca^e of pressing exigency he would wish the Governor of Bombay in Council to act upon any proposal to this effect, he would otherwise think it absolutely 2 f120 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV necessary, before new and distant engasreraents of this nature should be contracted, that they appear to be justified by the aspect of coming events and that the means of the Imaum and the conditions under which such a force is to be raised should be clearly understood. S. The Governor-General is of opinion that the line of conduct pursued by Abdoola h'm ShaJcboot has deprived him of all claim to the good offices or interference in his behalf of the British Government, for this chief has set an example to his neighbours of assisting the course of unjust violence and conquest in which Mahomed Alee appears to have been recently engaged and of preferring the alliance of the Egyptians to that of his ancient supporters and friends and he has done so with the knowledge that he was so injuring the rights and interests of the British Government in the Persian Gulph. The Governor-General had been prepared to afford to the Chief of that island aid against the invasion with which he was threatened by Khoorshid Pasha, but His co.nxiot ioeX himxelf called upon to stand as his protector against the Imaum of Muscat, should His Highness determine to take up the quarrel which has long existed between him and Abdoola bin ShaJcboot and to invade the Island of Bahrein. But His Lordship would pause upon giving encouragement to any such invasion, for it could hardly take place without the Imaum being directly in collusion with Khoorshid Pasha and hastening a crisis which it is on every reason desirable to postpone. 9. It seems to be in the first necessary that the British Agent above to be deputed to Muscat should furnish a full report of the resources and military and naval strength of the Imaum^s Government and the degree to which his territories are exposed to aggressions from the interior against which defensive arrangements could not easily be concerted. It is to be remembered that the submission of the Chief of Bahrein to the Egyptian Commander in Arabia appears to be so complete that there seems little probability of any occasion for that officer to proceed to the occupation of that island in force so long as no intentions on the part of the Imaum of Muscat to act against its present Sheik be declared. 10. It occurs to His Lordship that some accessation to our present naval strength in the Gulph may be obtained by His Highness's placing any of his armed vessels under the general direction of the British Officer Commanding in the Gu'ph, and the (Governor in Council is requested to give such directions as upon a consideration of this suggestion he may think expedient. 11. Further information is shortly expected as to the ciraumstances of Brymee and the tribes possessing influence in that quarter. Every encouragement should be given to them and other Chieftains of the Oman province who are disposed to resist the aggressions of the Egyptians and the Political Officer should be furnished with the means of assisting them in the manner indicated in my letter of the 1st August last. 13. The Governor-General hopes that this general exposition of his views will be sufficient for the present occasion, and he requests His Honor in Council to send the necessary orders to Captain Hennell and to the officer who may be nominated to the Agency of Muscat. Copies of such instructions are requested for His Lordship's information. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, A. F. MADDOCK, Secretary to the Government of-India with the Governor'General. C amp at G waliob; The 13th January 1840. 393. The following observations of the Secret Committee on their Despatch dated 1st July 1839, on the Proceedings of the Government of India may be quoted— We have received from the Governor in Council at Bombay letters dated 13th April (No. 41) and 8th May (No. 55) on the proceedings of Mehemet Ali in respect to Bahrein and of the Persian authorities at Bushire, which have led to the removal of the Residency to Karrak. Our letters to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia and to the Resident in the Persia n Gulf, of the 13th ultimo, copies of which were under the same date communicated to you, will have put you fully in possession of our views in regard to the movement of the Egyptian troops upon the Shores of the Persian Gulf, and the particular questions in respect to Bahrein, and the anticipated occupation of Bussora. We consider the preservation of these places against the danger with which they appear to be threatened to be an object of great importance, and we leave it to your discretion to adopt such measures, in concert with Her Majesty's Naval Commander-in-Chief, from the means at your disposal, as may be effectual to secure the independence of the Arab Chiefs on the shores of the Persian Gulf.Part VI—Chap. XLIV.] 221 We trust, however, that the representations which will have been made by your Agents at Bagdad, and in the Gulf, under the instructions above referred to, aided by the presence of the Admiral in the Gulf, will have proved effectual to deter the Egyptian Commander from the further prosecution of his views in that quarter. The Governor in Council at Bombay has properly impressed upon Captain Hennell the expediency of his losing no opportunity of encouraging the Chiefs of Arabia and the Imaum of Muscat to unite and resist to the utmost the encroachments of the Egyptian forces. If necessary we should not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachment from Mehemet Ali, hut we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell as to whether it would he expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government, We are, Your affectionate friends, E. W. JENKINS. E. W. W. BAYLEY. East Indian House, London ; The 1st July 1839. 394. Again in their despatch No. 691, dated 27th March 1840, the Secret Committee observed :— Our wishes in regard to the affairs of the Persian Gulf have been already communicated to you. Vessels carrying munitions of war are to be stopped. Every effort is to be made to cultivate the alliance of the Imam of Muskat within whose territories a British Consul will re-ide under the treaty which has been concluded by Her Majesty with that Prince. JFe consider ourselves -.^■relieved from all regard to the interests of the Chief of Bahrein and we should be glad to hear that his island was in possession of a friendly Chieftain. The Maritime Chiefs of Arabia should be encouraged in their opposition to the encroachments of Mehemet Ali. 393. The change of attitude in regard to Bahrein indicated in this despatch was probably owing to its Sheikh's having completely thrown himself at the mercy of Korshid Pasha. (VI) mxm CHIEFS, AND ATTEMPTS TO UNITE THE* IN AN ALLIANCE AGAINST EGYPTIAN ENCROACHMENTS—D1STRIBLTION OF MONEY AND AMMUNITION AMONG TUEM. 396. A description of Brymi at this time by Mr. Mackenzie, Assistant „ , icq t iq&lt;n 1^9 Resident at Bushire, will be found on Volnme 153 of 1840, p. 152. t. 01 ..• pages 116—118 of the Bombay Selections No. XXIV. The position of the Brymi tribes has been already described, and the orders of the Government of India as to how to deal with them have been quoted. The following is an account of the meeting the Political Resident at Bushire and Captain Hamorton, Agent at Maskat, had with them at Bjman and the measures taken for bringing about conciliation between the contend ing tribes and for uniting them in an alliance against the encroachments of the Egyptians (Resident's letter No. 20, dated 12th January 1840):— About noon accompanied by Captain Hammerton, I landed at Ejman, and was met on the beach bv the Brymee and Naeem Sheikhs, with a large party of their followers. On being seated in the room assigned by the Chief of Ejman for my reception, the several Sheikhs Humud bin Surnr, ') Chiefs of the Shuwa- a3 noted in the margin were introduced to me. Mahomed bia Abdullah, [ mis tribe mid holders After the usual compliment, I commeuced the Ahmed bin Surur. 3 of the forts of Brymee. conversation by saying that it afforded me great pleasure to have this opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with those Arab Chiefs who had displayed such a creditable determination to maintain their own independence against the attacks of Khorshid Pasha to bring them under the yoke of Mahomed Alii ; that the advance of the Egyptians in this direction was received with disapprobation by the British Government, as tending to bring the tribes of Oman under foreign control, and also to interrupt the friendly relations hitherto subsisting between the maritime Arabs and the English ; that the British Government entertained no desire to establish its authority in the interior of Arabia, neither did it at all profess to take any of the inland tribes under its protection, or consider itself under an obligation to defend them in case of their being attacked; that, although the Sirkar deemed it but proper to withhold any pledge of this nature to tribes and places located beyond its control, it was most desirous to impress the Arabian Sheikhs with a due sense of their own interests, and to induce them to combine cordially together to repel the threatened aggressions of Khorshid Pasha and the Egyptians; it therefore kept the proceedings of the tribes of Oman in view, and where it observed on the part of any of them a disposition to adopt this line of policy, it was inclined to cultivate their goodwill and friendship; that 2 F 2222 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. Iiowever brave and determined the several tribes might be individually, yet that no hope could exist of their independence being preserved, unless by a real and cordial union with each other, and it was for this reason, I noticed with pleasure, the assemblage in one place of so many influential chiefs, and trusted that before the meeting broke up, I might not only have the gratification of removing any ditferences existing among those present, but that I might be able to effect a sincere reconciliation between the Sheikhs of Brymee, and their neighbours the Zuwahir tribe. In reply to these observations Humud bin Surur, the principal Sheikh of Brymee, answered on behalf of himself and his allies that the disinterested motives which induced the British Government to come forward at this juncture were fully known and appreciated by all parties, that the unexpected sympathy and countenance afforded to the Shuwamis and Naeem tribes, at a time when they had been deserted by everyone excepting Seid Humud of Sohal, had inspired the most lively sentiments of gratitude in himself and his kinsmen, they had therefore gladly availed themselves of the present opportunity to impress in person their deep sense of obligation, and their earnest desire to regulate all their pro ceedings by the views of the British Government. The Sheikh then went on to say that the quarrel between themselves and the Zuwahir had arisen from the tribe in question having intrigued with Said bin Mutluk to dispossess them of Brymee, which of course had added much to the difficulties of their position. In the event, however, of a defensive alliance being estab lished between themselves and their late enemies through the mediation of the Kesident, and Sheikh Khalif;t of Abutali being restrained from acting hostilly towards Brymee, they would not fear any external foes, whether they came from Nedjd or elsewhere, that if the Government would not receive them as its dependents, and as being under its protection, thev still hoped the two objects above referred to might be attained through its influence. I answered that 1 was tully sensible of the importance of the Zuwahir uniting with the Sheikhs of Brymee for their common defence, and that in my approaching interview with the Chiefs of that tribe, I hoped to induce them to forget all past differences, and cordially join with the Shuwamis and Naeem for the maintenance of their independence. With reference, however, to his second request touching the Chief of Abuthabi, I said that I did not consider myself authorised to give any pledge to the effect asked for, as in the event of Sheikh Khalifa attack ing them, the Government would take such steps as suited its own convenience, or as circumstances might seem to render expedient, that our object, as already intimated, was not to involve ourselve* in affairs beyond our own control, or to increase our responsibilities by taking upon ourselves to protect the island tribes from aggression, but simply to afford our friendly coun tenance and, aid to those whose vieios, with reference to the encroachments of Khorshid Pasha, coincided with those of the British Government, which, I a^dei, was willing to afford a sub stantial proof of its goodwill and sympathy by furnishing a moderate quantity of ammunition and provisions, in case of their being attached by the Egyptians, and they continued firm in their resolution to defend themselves, I concluded by sayiuu that in order they might not be altogether unprepared for such a contingency, I intended now to present them with a small supply of money, gunpowder, lead, etc. The Shuwamis Chief and allies having withdrawn, I sent for the Zuwahir Shiekhs (Maho med bin Surur and Rashid bin Said) from the neighbouring t 'wu of Shargah, where they and their followers had taken up their residence, as the hostile feelings still existing between them did not allow of their occupying the same spot together. After some conversation, I found themselves and the Naeem. quite willing to accept of my mediation to renew the friendly rela tions formerly subsisting with the Brymee Sheikhs, and prepared to enter into an alliance with them against the Egyptians, but they seemed unwilling to break off their connexion with the Monasir Muzjra tribes, both of which are known to be in Khorshid Pasha's interest. At last both parties consented to meet in my presence and after an animated discussion of some hours, the Zuwahir chiefs were prevailed upon to enter into a defensive alliar ce with the Shu wamis and Naeem, against all enemies whatever, but with the single reservation that they were not to be called on to j '&gt;in the Brymep Sheikhs in any operations of a purely aggressive character when originating from the latter. To ratify this engagement the several chiefs joined their hands and repeated a solemn form of oath which was dictated by Sheikh Humud bin Surur. This important point being thus satisfactorily attained, I introduced the subject of the Beni Kittul, and urged the acceptance on the part of the Shuwamis and Naeem Sheikh^, of the proposal of Abdullah bin Ho vedan, to form a close alliance with them pro vided his mares were restored. In reply I was informed that the original dispute had arisen from one mare havinof being carried off by the Arabs of another tribe who had scld her to Surerbin Ally, the Naeem Sheikh, and that the foal as well as the dam were now claimed by the Beni Kittul Chief. The heads of the Shuwamis were evidently much inclined to make up matters with Abdulla bin Koweedan on any terms, but the son of Surur bin Ally declared that his father would not upon any consideration give up steeds he valued so highly. It was in vain I urged every argument in my power, and even offered to settle the disputed point by purchasinij the two animals in question myself, and presenting them to the Beni Keitul Sheikh. Finding all my efforts in this quarter unavailing, I sent Mullah Hossein, our Native Agent, into Shargah to try if Abdullah bin Howeedan would waive his claim to the disputed mares ; upon receiving an equivalent gift this attempt was equally unsuccessful, as the Sheikh would listen to no other proposal than the actual surrender of the animals themselves. I was consequently obliged to content myself with making the latter chief a triflia&lt;r present, and leading him to hope for the favour and goodwill of the Government to a greater extent, if he opposed the encroachments of the Egyptians in Oman. Having been unexpectedly detained on shore at Ejman in consequence of the unsettled state ot the weather obliging the Clive again to leave the coast, I did not rejoin that vessel beforePart VI-Chap. XLIV.] 223 the 11th January, employing the interval in a friendly intercourse with the Brymee Chi.-£. Unnn my return to cruiser, I availed myself of the authority conveyed iu the 11th paragraph of the Officiating Secretary Haddock's' letter, dated the 1st August 1889, to make a distribu tion of a small sum of money, together with a moderate quantity of rice and ammunition according to the statement No. 1 herewith enclosed. Enclosure No. 2 contains a detailed account of the expenses incurred in entertaining these Sheikhs and their numerous followers (amounting to about 300 men) which the customs of Arabian hospitality obliged me to undertake ^ they have, however, been limited to the lowest possible scale. The total amount in money and rice distributed to the several chiefs, and expended in their entertainment is German Crowns two thousand six hundred and nine and two-eighths which disbursement I trust may receive the sanction of the Hon ble the Ciovemor in Council. I venture to think that the personal communication I have had on the present occasion with the Frontier Sheikhs of Oman, and the distribution I have made, will be productive of much benefit, and while it promotes onr views of policy, will extend our name and influence to ports of Arabia where it has hitherto been little known. At the same time the just aud liberal conduct of the British Government will be placed in favourable contrast with the tyrannical and oppre-sive proceedings of the Egyptians. The greater port ion of the money and provisions and the whole of the ammunition, have been bestowed upon those Chiets, who, by their resistance to Said bin Mullak, are fairly committ-d with the Egyptians. To the others I have given sufficient to render them desirous of deserving an equal share of the favour of Government with the Brymee Sheikhs, and as this favour is understood by all to be contin gent upon their future'conduct and proceedings with reference to the Egyptians, there are Sood grounds for anticipating that if Said bin Mulluk attempt to penetrate into Oman, he may now experience a more serious, if not combined, opposition, than would have been the case had such an expedition been undertaken at an earlier date. (VII) THE EGYPTIAN AGENT LEAVES OMAN—WEAKENING OF THE EGYPTIAN INFLUENCE. 397.

Ilis removal from Oman proved a severe blow to the Egyptian influence, and broke up the combina tion rapidly forming in his favour. On his voyage from Shargah, having landed on the island of Kenn, on the Persian Coast, he forcibly carried off four hundred sheep and other property,—a gross and wanton aggression upon the subjects of a friendly power, which was duly brought to the notice of Mahomed Ali Pasha, and led, among other causes, to its being subsequently intimated to the Sheikh of Katif, the Egypto-Wahabi seaport, that any expedition against Oman or the territories of the Imam would be opposed by the British squadron in the Gulf. 398. A portion of the Naim tribe (a branch of that which had so openly resisted the encroachment of Korshid Pasha and his Agents at Brymi), residin 0, on the Guttur Coast, having refused to pay the Zukat or tribute, when called upon through Abdulla bin Ahmed, the Chief of Bahrein, Maho med Effendi, the Egyptian Governor of Lahsa, despatched a party of regulars, assisted by some of the Mukazibah Arabs, to ravage their pasture lands and date '-roves. Before this foray could be effectually made, the expedition was compelled to retreat, in consequence of the murder of Mahomed Effendi, its originator, by some Arabs, in the suburbs of Eahsa. 399. A Guncha (belonging to Koweit) reached Katif from Hodeida, in the Red Sea, in November 1839, laden with ammunition and military stores for the use of the Egyptian forces in Nejd. The Agents on board did not fail to spread all sorts of extravagant reports regarding a fleet of some eighteen or twenty vessels, laden with troops and warlike stores, being about to follow. 400. The remonstrances of the Home Government combined with the capture of Beyrout and other places on the Syrian Coast by the British navy began now, however, to have full effect; m )reover the quarrels and d : ssen- sions amongst the Egyptian Agents themselves, and the jealousy lately itubibed l)y Mahomed Ali Pasha of his General, Khorshid, tended very much to weaken their power and influence, which were threatened by, among other disaffected tribes, that of Ejman, numbering upwards of four thousand men, whose chief had lately succeeded in effecting his escape from Lahsa, where he had been treacherously seized and confined by the Pasha's orders. Communications224 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. between the different towns and districts began to be seriously interrupted, and sl, Ppl ies ^or the Egyptian forces at Thurmidah, the hend-quarters, needed escorts ot considerable numbers of horse and foot to ensure their safety. Syud bin Mutluk was distrusted, acd sent under surveillance to Kiaz. A move ment by Kbalid into the distiicts, attended by the Egyptian cavalry, for the purpose of confirming his authority, and receiving the alle-iarioe of the various unset tled tribes, indicated an intention on the part of his allies to evacuate Neid, and their desire, by putting him forward in a more prominent position of out ward authority than he had hitherto enjoyed, to check the growing disaffec- tions previous to his being left at the head of affairs, 401. Just when the blockade of Katif and Ojeir, held by the Eo-yp- tian troops, began seriously to he contemplated by the British Government intdhgence was received (May lb40) that Lahsa had been evacuated, and that the mam body of the Egyptian troops had actually left Neid ; which being corroborated by the declaration shortly before made by Mahomed All Pasha, the Egyptian ruler, to Her Majesty's Consul-general at Cairo, and subsequently in a measure confirmed by the despatch of a vessel to those ports, which were now found to be in the hands of Arabs, adherents of Amir Khahd, although the Egyptian Agent still continued to exercise the actual authority and control, rendered the adoption of this measure unnecessary. The grossly oppressive and extortionate conduct of the Pasha and his A-ent fur ther afforded a plausible reason for the belief that the Egyptians no loncer contemplated the permanent occupation of Central Arabia. 402. As a sacrifice to the memory of his deputy, Mahomed Effendi, who was shot while Governor of Lahsa, Korshid Pasha's last act, previous to his departure, was to put to death Bargeish, the Chief of the Ali Humid. It was ^ i n i l !/ ntei i d . e(1 0n being made over to the charge of Amir Khalid, that chief should nevertheless continue to act under the authority of the Egyptian Agent whom it was intended to establish at Medina, a post whence he could exercise a general superintendence over the country of the Hujib Arabs and Central Arabia; but the moral influence of the usurper among the various tribes, which under the most favourable circumstances had been very trifling, was now entirely lost: despised, disliked, and deprived ot the support of his patrons, he had very shortly his hands fully occupied with the intrigues which were set on foot to dispossess him of his illegal power. ° . 403 - ^ period of the evacuation of Lahsa and Ojeir, one Mushrif arrived at Bahrein, despatched probably by the inhabitants of those places to invite Shaikh Mahomed bin Khalifa (the grandson of Soleyman, the brother ot Abdulla bin Ahmed) to come oyer and claim those districts, when they would throw off their allegiance to Amir Khalid. 404. The spirit of disaffection now developing itself in Central Arabia was in no slight degree promoted and encouraged by the current report of Amir Feysul having effected his liberation from Cairo, and commenced his journey to Medina, as well as by the news of the reverse sustained by the Egyptians in ^ Syria, and the consequent reduction of Mahomed Ali Pasha's authority within its legitimate limits. 405. Syud bin Mutluk nevertheless continued to address letters to the Chief of Oman, announcing his march into that province ; but these intima tions (the excitement they at first caused having worn off, from their havinff v! 8 , 11 8( L 0f . ten I1] 1 ade ' aild havin ? as often proved without foundation) produced little effect There was indeed little probability, under existing circumstances, of Amir Khalid actually making any attempt on the province of Oman : it was however decided by the British Government that in the event of the expedition being undertaken, it should be met with as much active resistance as his means afforded of arraying against it. 406. It now appeared that the Sublime Porte advanced their claims to authority ow Nejd ; and certain it is, that having received some presents from Amir Khalid, that Government appointed him Wali of that province His submission was of course hollow enough, having been in all probability prompted by Ivhorshid Pasha, to be disavowed whenever it mi^ht meet the views of the Egyptians. He addressed a very friendly letter to the British Isative Agent at Bahrein, expressing an earnest desire to renew the amicablePart VI—Chap. XLIV.] 225 and cordial relations wbicb formerly subsisted between bis late father, Saud and the British Government, hinting that he had wished before to open the correspondence, but had been prevented by Mahomed Ali Pasha. 407. On his arrival at Lahsa in October 1F41, notwithstanding these professions, he prepared a force, destined (as announced by the Native Agent at Bahrein) for invasion of Oman, and the siege of Brymi, and to be commanded by the notorious Syud bin Mutluk. The British Government having provided for this contingency in its instructions that the Resident should endeavour to obtain accurate information of Amir Khaled's move ments, and, if he were preparing for the invasion of Oman, should warn him of the opposition of the British Government, and require him to desist from the undertaking, and good grounds existing for the belief that the expedition was now really in contemplation, it was deemed expedient and advisable by him to despatch a British officer to wait upon the Amir in his camp at Lahsa (distant seventy miles from the coast), with written and verbal communica tions, indicative of the views of the British Government, to which he replied that he had not sent, nor entertained any intention of sending, Syud bin Mutluk into Oman ; and supposing him to have been so disposed, it subse quently turned out that he really had not the power ; and this was the more fortunate as the Maritime Chiefs, although outwardly professing their determi nation to maintain their own independence, were known to be secretly carrying on intrigues and correspondence with him, and as the irregular proceedings of the Brymi Chiefs in foraying the districts of Syed Humid bin A.zan of Sohar, must have greatly diminished, if not altogether destroyed, the prospects of any co-operation on the part of the latter in the event upon an attack upon Nejd.226 [Part VI—Chap. XLIV. CHAPTER XLV. REVERSAL OF THE RECENT BRITISH POLICY OF PRO- TECTING INTERNAL TRIBES OF OMAN, 1843. 408. With his letter dated 30th November 1841, Captain Hennell for warded translation of a communication from the Native Agent as Shargah regarding the projected expedition of Amir Khaled airainst Brymi and expressing his opinion that little, if any, reliance could be placed on the Chiefs of Oman offering an effectual or even a real resistance to Amir Khaled's force should it advance into that province. Captain Hennell stated that he was of opinion that in the event of the Amir refusino- to change his intention of invading Oman that sunh of the Chiefs as give unequivocal proofs of maintaining their own independence, by actually opposing Saed ben Mutluk's advance, should be supported by the British Government by receiving moderate supplies of arms and ammunition. Cap tain Hennell at the same time observed that it would be a point for the consideration of Government how far the entire removal of our military force from the Persian Gulf might be expedient, should the Nedgdis enter Oman, and whether its temporary location at Bassadore might not be advisable, until it be seen what turn affairs were likely to take, both in Arabia and Afghanistan. 409. If Amir Khaled could be dissuaded from his designs, the Governor in Council was very doubtful bow far it would be good policy to oppose the Amir in the manner suggested by Captain Hennell, but af all events the Bombay Government was decidedly averse to the location of the British troops at Bassidore, or in any other place in the Gulf, and were of opinion that on the evacuation of Karrak the troops should be withdrawn altogether and the Government be content with maintaining its naval supremacy (Bombay Government letter No. 1951, dated 31st December 1841). 410. The Government of India replied as follows in their letter No 47 dated 17th January 1842 :— 6. With reference to the Resident's despatch No. 142 of the 27th of November I am directed to observe that, although it was considered to be the policy of the British Government to exert an unusual degree of influence to counteract the efforts of the Pasha of Eo-ypt and his Generals to establish their authority as far southward as the province of Oman and Captain Hennell was in consequence authorized to encourage the Chiefs of Brymee and'other petty principalities to resist any attempts at their subjection, now that the ambitious designs oj the ruler of hgypt have heen checked, it would he more prudent and more conformable to our general news of 'policy in that quarter, to avoid mixing ourselves up with the contests of the native powers, and far preferable that we should confine our interference to the constant maintenance of our maritime supremacy over the tribes on the coast. For these reasons, His Lordship in Council wculd have been satisfied to watch the proceedings of Ameer Khaled without attempting to arrest them, unless they were directed against the power and privileges of any of the chieftains whom we are bound to protect. It is doubtful according to the Resident's own opinion, whether the petty Chiefs of Oman feel enough of interest in their own independence to defend themselves against the Ameer if he actually invades their territory, and if they are indifferent on the subject, it is not apparent to'the Governor-General m Council what political object is to be gained by our exciting them to resistance, while it is certain that the extension of our relations with the chief of the interior will ere long prove troublesome if not embarrassing to us. 7. On these grounds His Lordship in Council doubts the expediencv of Lieutenant .lopp s deputation to Ameer Khaled, and would wait the issue of that officer's mission bei re giving authority to assist the Chiefs of Oman, and for the future His Lordshin in Council would strongly impress on the Resident the expediency of our confirming as much as possible our political relations to the maritime Chiefs with whom we have so lon^ been intimately connected, and avoid, as far as possible, interfering in the politics of the inland Slates. r '111. Deprived of the Egyptian aid, Khaled was quite unable to hold his own in Nejd, and had soon (o make place for his cousin Abullah ben Suneyan. 412. The new ruler had been just a year installed in authority, when Feysal reappeared in Arabia having somehow effected an escape or a releasePart VI—Chap. XLV. 227 from Egyptian captivity. The Nejdeans flocked to the standard of the rightful Prince, and in June 1843 Abdullah-bin-Suneyan was forced to surrender at discretion. 413. In July 1843 Feysal sent a messenger with letters to the maritime and inland Sheikhs of Oman, intimating his intention of sending an army under Syud bin Mutluk, on the termination of the hot weather, for the purpose of bringing that province under his authority. In consequence of this threat the Chiefs of the inland fort of Bereymah applied for the aid of the British Government. ' They were informed, in reply, that the communications formerly entered into with them by the British Government had reference solely to the advance of the Egyptian troops, and the connection subsisting between His Highness Mohammed Ali Pasha with Nejd; but that these circumstances being now altogether changed, and the impending danger removed by the departure of the troops under Khurshed Pasha from that province, it was now the intention of the British Government to withdraw from all interference in the internal affairs of Arabia.' 414. At this very time too the Eesident received a communication from the Amir himself, expressive of a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father Turki and the British Government. Proper response was made to this demonstration of amity, and the Amir was further informed that the sole object of the British Gov ernment in this quarter was the suppression of plunder and bloodshed on the seas, and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the shores of the Gulf. 415. In September 1843 the Bombay Government (at that time headed by Sir George Arthur) enquired of the Government of India what policy ghonld be pursued towards Feysal. The Bombay Government considered that as long as the Chief remained within his former possessions no inter ference would be necessary, but it nevertheless doubted whether he should be allowed to obtain a preponderating influence at Bahrein and with the Arab Chiefs who were under treaty engagements to us. To this reference the Governor-General (Lord Ellenborough) in Council replied simply that it was 'not at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceeding's of the Chief. ,, 416. In December of the same year Amir Feysal interposed in a quarrel Wahabi interference at Bahrein. ^ f*™ 1 claimants for the Ometship of Bahrein, and having seaured the victory for his own protege, appropriated the fort of Demaum as the reward of his assistance. On the 26th August 1844 the Bombay Government British policy. renewed its enquiry 'as to the policy which should be pursued in the now certain event of Amir Feysal, the legitimate Wahabi Euler, extending his authority over the Chiefs of Oman, and especially if he endeavoured to effect this object by sea. It was pointed out that Feysal's proceedings might ultimately endanger our relations with Oman and the martime Arab Chiefs, and so tend to resumption of piracy. And the letter concluded as follows :— &lt;f It does not therefore appear to the Governor in Council unworthy of consideration whether the Resident in the Persian Gulf should not at once endeavour to effect an arrange ment with Amir Feysal, ratifying and securing existing engagements at sea. In other words, that, as the price of forbearance on the part of the British Government, this Chief ehould become a party to its maritime engagements, whereby commercial interests may be secured. ' As the not improbable event of the Wahabi Ruler encroaching on the possessions of His Highness the Imam of Maskat, an old ally of the British Government, is a contingency which ought to be provided for, this Government is desirous of being favoured with the sentiments ot the Right Hcn^ble the Governor-General in Council on this point.' No official reply was issued to this application, but the view adopted by the Government of India was evidently that suggested in Lord Hardinge's brief remark on the back of the letter, No case for interference has arisen.' 417. Early in the year 1845 Syud bin Mutluk came to Brymi from Nejd and at once all the neighbouring Arab tribes, inspired perhaps as much 2 G228 Part VI—Chap. XLV. by fear of Wahahi arms as sympathy with Wahabi tents, vied with each other in tendering their allegiance to Feysal's representative. Elated with greater success than he had expected, Syed bin Mutluk ravaged the territories of the Sohar Chiefs seized the fort of Mujis, butchering all its garrison, and compelled the Chief to consent to a very heavy tribute. He at the same time demanded a large tribute from Maskat, and was preparing to enforce the request by invasion. At this juncture the Bombay Government again addressed the Government of India, enquiring what was to be done if the Imam asked for our help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied on May 6th in the following terms :— o It would appear that Feysal-bia-Turki, in whose name and on whose behalf the present expedition of Syud-bin-Mutluk has been undertaken, has not hitherto done more than endeavour to re-establish the Wahabi supremacy as it existed in the time of his father, Tarki- bin-Saud, before the Egyptian aggression reduced the Wahabi power, and that it is the opinion of Major Hennell that our interests with respect to the maritime Arabs are likely to suffer by Syud bin Mutluk's proceedings. « if therefore the mere establishment of the Wahabi power in Oman and the reception of the willing allegiance of the maritime Chiefs whom on a former occasion we took under our protection and encouraged to resistance were to be the only result of the present expedition of Syud -bin-Mutluk, the Governor-General in Council would see no occasion to modify the opinion given in the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our interference is not called ior; but if it appear to be the purpose of Feysal-bin-Turki to extend the Wahabi supremacy 'beyond former limits and to encroach upon the possessions of our ally, the Imam of Maskat, or if the result of these proceedings are found detrimental to our relations with the Maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppression of piracy, a case for our interference will, in the opinion of the Governor-General in Council, arise, and it may be perhaps desirable in such case for you to instruct the local authorities to declare to Feysal-bin-Turki that our forbearance, from which he may have hitherto taken some encouragement, will be extended no further,' and that we cannot countenance or allow wanton aggression on the territories of our ancient ally. « The Governor -General in Council is disposed to think that the explicit expression of our feelings on this subject will be sufficient to cause the Wahabi Chief to desist from active operations, should they be contemplated, against the Maskat district, or that, at any rate, a demonstration by sea by the force now in the Gulf will produce the desired effect. On this subject the local Government of Bombay will be better able to form a judgment than the Governor-General in Council. ' The Governor -General in Council, however, wishes it to be understood that he would not, on the one hand, commit the Government at the present moment to a line of policy which would be likely to involve the necessity of despatching troops to the Gulf, nor would he, on the other, make to the Wahabi Chief or his agent Syud bin Mutluk a threat which he would not be prepared fully to carry out. 44 If therefore the Bombay Government consider that a mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone will in all probability effect what is desired, the Governor-General in Council authorizes the Bombay Government to instruct the local authorities accordingly ; but if on this subject His Honour in Council entertains doubt, he is requested -to refer to us again with a full exposition of the views and opinions of the Bombay Government for the further instructions of the Government of India.'Part VI—Chap. XLVI- 229 CHAPTER XIVI. BRITISH PROTECTION OF THE IMAM OF MA SKAT AGAIXST ATTACKS FROM THE CHIEF OF SOIIAR AND THE JOASMI CHIEF SiLTAA BIN SAGGAR, 1839—1850. 418. To what extent the dynasty of Seyyid Said bin Sultan owes its very existence to the protection of the British is proved among other facts by their friendly intervention in the feuds between the Chief of Sohar and the Imaum. It will* not be therefore out of place to trace from the beginning our relations with the Chief of Sohar. 419. It was in the year 1730, that the Persians were driven out of Oman by Ahmed bin Said, then Governor of Sohar, who in consequence became the first Imam of Maskat. In 1797, his second son Said Saltan succeeded to the Imaumship, to the exclusion of the elder son and rightful heir. In 1804, as we have seen, on the death ol Said, an attempt was made to usurp the Government from his sons, which failed and when Sait bin Beder was murdered, the Chief of Sohar was deprived of his patrimony. In 1830, Syud Bamud bin Azau bin Ghez, taking advantage of the Imaum's absence at Zanzibar, and of the confusion which followed the treacherous seizure of feyud IJillal already alluded to, succeeded in regaining Sohar his paternal inheritance. On the Imaum's return, he attacked Sohar, but being unable to reduce it made terms with Svud Hamud, who agreed to pay tribute to His Highness and to restore the districts of Shinas and G bulla I, on condition of being allowed to retain possession of the districts of Khizza, Khalura, Mackies and Sohar. In the following year however the Imaum again attacked Sohar, and owing to the treachery of some of his allies was again defeated and compelled to make peace with the Chief, nearly on the same terms, as in the preceding year. 420. In x832, Syud Haraud, taking advantage of the disorders created by the seizure of the Imaum's son and nephew by the Chief ot Burka, and the Imaum's absence at Zanzibar, in conjunction with the Chief of Soweick prepared to attack Rustak and other inland places in the Imaum's territory, but as already stated their plans were frustrated by our sending a naval force to Maskat to support the Imaum's authority. In 1834, the Chief of Sohar having possessed himself of Rustak and threatened other places we asain interfered, and proceeded to the length of informing him ' that if ^ by further aggressions he placed himself in a position of actual hostilities against the dominions of His Highness the Imaum, he would by so doing incur the penalty of being considered as an enemy of the British Government.' He nevertheless, notwithstanding this warning, surprised and partially gained possession of the town ot Soweick, but was in the end driven out with some loss. At this period our Resident reported £&lt; that the popularity and influence of the Chief of Sohar now appeared to be continually increasing in the Province of Oman, while the imbecile conduct and want of energy of the son and nephew of the Imaum daily diminished their authority.' ^ His Highness the Imaum having returned to Maskat attempted to recover his lost influence and powers. But so great was his necessity, that he imprudently invited the piratical Arab tribes to aid him, and also entered into an agreement with the Wahabi A^ent Syud bin Mutluk to assist him in the expulsion of Syud Hamud from the places he had during his absence seized.^ The combined forces accordingly invested Sohar by sea and by land, but His Highness the Imaum having ascertained that it was the intention of the Wahabi Agent, when Sohar fell, to garrison it on account of his ^Master, the Imaum considered that this would be a greater evil, than allowing it to be retained by his rebellious kinsman, and therefore suddenly abandoned his allies and the seige of Sohar, and returned to Zanzibar. Captain Hamerton in allusion to these events observes: * ' During the • Letter,dated tiie 5tb eeptembe* 1814. attention of the Imaum was 2 o 2230 Part VI—Chap. XLVIr directed towards his African possession, conspiracy and rebellion was being matured in Arabia. The Chief of Sohar, the Imaum's cousin, took possession of the fort of Ristook, the Capital of Oman and where the Imauras had resided for centuries. Although His Highness the Imaum, at two different times, undertook expeditious against his cousin, he both times failed to effect any thing of consequence, the Chiefs and their followers who were bound to aid and assist their own Prince, basely deserted his cause, and refused to light against Hamood bin Azan, telling the Imaum that the right to the Chieftainship of Bistook and its dependencies on the part of Hamood, was quite as good as that of His Highness, and that they would not fight against Hamood, who has maintained his position since 1805, This affair hurt the Imaum's pride, and greatly circumscribed his influence and lessened his dignity in Oman. ,, He added that His Highness the Imaum in his two expeditions against Sohars, expended in presents to the Chiefs above 300,000 dollars, which they treacherously accepted and deserted him. The countries subject to Eistuk and Sohar are described to be the best and most fertile in Oman. 421. Matters remained in this unsatisfactory state, until the return of the Imaum to Maskat in 1839, when a reconciliation was effected between His Highness and Syud Hamud, under the following circumstances, through the mediation of our Resident in the Persian Gulf. On the 16th August, the Resident reported the arrival of a confidential Agent of the Chief of Soliar, named Merhun bin Ally, apparently with no other object than to express bis earnest desire to be guided in all his policy entirely by the views of the British Government and his determination to oppose the intrigues and encroach ments of the Egyptians in Oman, by all the means in his power. At this time KhursMd Pasha, the Commander of the Egyptian forces, was endeavouring to establish the Pasha of Egypt's supremacy over Oman, and as this was opposed to our views, the Chief of Sohar bad rendered good service, by assisting the Naum tribe of Beyance in their resistance to Khurshid Pasha's attempt. In reply to this overture, the Resident reminded the Agent of the intimate terms of amity existing between us and His Highness the Imaum, and was informed that the best proof his master could afford of his desire to be guided by our wishes would be to abstain from aggressions on the territories of our ally. He added that when His Highness returned from Zanzibar he should be glad to exert his friendly offices ' to remove the hostile feeling at present existing between him and the Imaum, and establish relations between Sohar and Maskat on a friendly footing.' 421A. Government entirely approved * of the Resident's proceedings and • Letter, dated tie 7th September 1839. authorized him to endeavour to mediate a reconciliation between the parties. The Resident proceeded to Maskat, and in personal communication concluded t The Treaty consists of seven articles, and tllL a gieement the purport of-which is given stipulates— ' in the margin, f The Imaum agreed artter Aper£eCtandlMti0g ^ be '' Cel1 tt ° ' to for g' Te an d fwget all that had 2nd. —Free intercourse for trade to the subjects passed, provided the Sohar Sheikh WOuld of each party. . .. , ^ + v pledge himself to abstain from any 3rd. —Voluntary emigration from the terntory f 4.1 • x «? •.! t • i • , , of the one party to the territory of the other party. lurtlier interieience ith his Subjects, and 4th. —Neither party to aid the rebellious cease to excite them to rebellion, and sup- 'S-NeiAe^pan^to openly or eeeretly P ort t^m in their factious conduct aggress against the other party. towards him.'

Maskat. At a meeting which CUSUed The Treaty is dated the 23rd December 1839, between the parties on board the St. C. and is sealed by both parties. Sloop Clive, the Chief of Sohar conducted himself in a very intemperate manner, and made some very unreason able demands. These having been firmly declined by the Imaum, the meeting broke up, Syud Hamud promising to give a final answer on the following day. The Resident then produced the draft of a Treaty suited as he considered to the interests of either side, which the Imaum requested might be read aloud. At the termination of each article he placed his hand upon his breast and said * it is accepted.' 'When the whole of the clauses bad been iiinPart VI—Chap. XLVI. 231 gone through, he turned to Hamud and declared tliat he would solemnly pledge both himself and his children to preserve tlie conditions of this Treaty inviolate,—that the present occasion was not one in which an insignificant Arab Chief was acting as mediator, but that a British officer was officiating in that capacity, agreeably to the instructions of his own Government, and therefore both parties ought to waive something of their claims upon each other and come to an amicable settlement; that with reference to the demand for an annual income, he could not think of binding himself down to any condition on such a point, but that when once the foundations of friendship were laid, Syud Hamud might rest assured that he would treat him with even greater kindness than he displayed towards his own sons. 421B. The day succeeding this interview Syud Hamud accepted the terms, with an additional article stipulating that His Highness the Imaum should support him if attacked by enemies. Another interview occurred at which Syud Hamud apologized to the Imaum, for the warmth he had displayed at the first meeting and expressed his desire to be henceforth considered by His Highness as a faithful and devoted servant, to which His Highness having returned a gracious reply, and copies of the Treaty having been interchanged, the Resident placed the hand of the Sohar Chief in that of the Imaum, which he took and pressed in a respectful manner. This action (which is considered by the Arabs essential to the ratification of any agreement) appeared to remove the remaining feelings of unkindness on both sides. The Resident further reported that the conclusion of this Treaty gave general satisfaction to the inhabitants of Maskat and Sohar, but that some members of the Imaum's family and especially his nephew Mahomed bin Salim were displeased with it, but nevertheless he hoped that respect for the mediation of the British Government would produce a spirit of forbearance on both sides, especially if the Chief of Sohar married one of the Imaum's daughters, which it was reported he was anxious to do. The Resident's proceedings were considered judicious and satisfactory, and were approved of by Government. 4i2lC. Shortly after the conclusion of this Treaty, the Chief of Sohar evinced his trust and confidence in the British Government by repairing to Bombay, where he was received with all proper respect and honour. As far as we know the Chief had, except on one occasion, faithfully performed his part of the contract. In fact in 1811, when Syf bin Salim rebelled against the Imaum, and seized a strong fort belonging to His Highness, the Chief of Sohar afforded good proof of his sincerity, by cordially uniting with the Maskat authorities against the rebel Chief, who in consequence returned to his allegiance. 421D. The only formal engagement we have entered into with the Chief of Sohar is one for the suppression of slavery. On the 22nd June 1848, the Resident reported that he was the only maritime Chief in Arabia, who had not come under our arrangements for the suppression of this infamous traffic. The Government on the 9th September 1848 approved of his being invited to join in these arrangements and His Majesty's Government likewise intimated their desire that he should do so. Accordingly the Resident having proceeded to Sohar in May 1849, found that the old Chief Syud Hamud had from some cause, not then apparent, retired into the interior, leaving his son Syud Syf and his brother Ghez de facto in authority at Sohar, After communicating with Syud Hamud and having been informed by him that ' all the places to which the proposed Treaty related were in the hands of his son Syud Syf,' the Resident succeeded in inducing the latter to enter into a Treaty for the suppression of the slave trade, similar to those concluded with the other maritime Chiefs of Arabia, and this was approved of by Government on the 4th August 1849. From subsequent information however it is evident that Syud Syf must have usurped his father's authority, for on March 18th last Government received a report from the Resident to the effect that Sheikh Syud Humood bin Azan (who had been set aside from the Government of Sohar by his son Sheikh Syf) had entered the town by night, and having put his son to death, had repossessed himself of his former authority in that place.' In a letter, however, dated the 25th March, from the Native Agent at Shargah and only just received, he reports ' the murder of Sheikh Syf bin232 Part VI—Chap. XLVI. Huraood, by his confidential slave at the instigation of his father Hamood bin Azau, and the establishment of the latter in his former authority at Sohar. 5 * 422. In 1849 Syud Soweyni arrived off Sbinas in his frigate Caroline and . . o „ « , . „ . ^ entered into communication with the Arab Reported S. C. I^o. 51, dated 3rd October 1850, . « oi -t o j •! mi.* ■\ Chief, Sheik Saud ibn Tatirnun, regard ing the projected seige of Keymi. His Highness at the same time opened a friendly communication with the Chief of Soliar, and a meetiug was agreed upon between them, with the object of combining their friendly relations and removing all doubts and suspicions between them. Accordingly His Highness landed at Shinas and with an escort of 450 horse and camelmen proceeded to Nuduwah, a place between Shinas and Sohar, where Syud Hamud met him with 500 horse. During the interview which followed, every appearance of friendship was exhibited on both sides, and a Treaty which had been negotiated in 1839 at Maskat through the mediation of the British Resident between His Highness the Imaum and the Chief of Sohar, was contirmed. The Governor of Maskat after having made some handsome presents to the Chief of Sohar, and having promised that he should receive the same allowance as had been granted to him by his father, His Highness the Imaum returned to Shinas, and Syud Hamud returned to Sohar. 422A, On the 3rd March the Chief of Sohar, though naturally of a suspicious disposition, was induced to quit his stronghold, and accompanied by his confidential Agent Merhum, his slaves, and an escort of ten followers, embaiked at Sohar, and joined Syud Sowyeni then at Shinas, on board the Prigate Caroline for the purpose of concluding the negotiations commenced at their first interview. There he remained for five days the favoured and honoured guest of Syud Soweyni, but on being pressed to unite with the forces of Maskat and Abuthabi in an attack on Keymi and on his declining to do so in consequence of his connection with the Abbu Khuiban tribe who are opposed to that design, the Governor of Maskat rashly determined to seize Syud Hamud, and afterwards to march with his forces to Sohar, and endeavour to capture the place by a coup de main. His Highness however was even ashamed to seize his guest on board his own vessel, and persuaded Syed Hamud to land for a few days for change of scene, but the Chiefs suspicions were from some cause excited, for he sent otf his Agent Merhum to Sohar. 422 B. On the 10th March Syud Soweyni and Syud Hamud landed at Shinas, and took up their abode in tents. The discussion about the latter uniting in the hostilities contemplated against Keymi was renewed, but without effect, and Syud Soweyni having withdrawn to another tent on the pretext of holding a private interview with Syud Hillal, on a preconcerted plan, the slaves of His Highness seized and bound the unfortunate Chief of Sohar, and conveyed him on hoard the frigate. His Highness then ordered his troops to march by land on Sohar and himself proceeded to that place in his frigate. On Ids arrival before Sohar, he compelled Syud Hamud to address letters to his son, to Saiek bin Saud, and to his confidential Agent, directing them to surrender the fort to the Maskat Army, but with true Arab spirit they replied that they regarded S.vud Hamud as a dead man, refused to give up their fort and prepared for a vigorous resistance, and at their summons large reinforcements from the neighbouring tribes entered Sohar. Shortly after Syed Gez the brother of Syud Hamud came with 100 men from Rustak, and the seige commenced by sea and land, Syed Soweyni commanding the town from his frigate which was returned from the fort. 4220. Immediately on his arrival at Sohar, Syud Hamud's brother addressed a letter to our Resident in the Persian Gulf, from which the follow ing is an extract: 'My brother Syed Hymood bin Azaain's trust and confidence arose from the treaty which was specially made by your own hands, was drawn out by you in writing, and which contained conditions still remaining in force. At this present if you approve of what has taken place, this is the decree of God. Humood is only one man. Should he die or be killed, do not complain of what will after this take place between us and them as we have informed you of what has happened. This attack has been made from the sea. ' This appeal was dated the 15th March, and on the 19th he despatched a second letter much to the same purport, appealing for thePart VI—Chap. XLVI. 233 Resident's interference to obtain redress. He observed, tc tbis is wbat lias taken place. You know best. If you do not interfere between us let ns know. If you have any other intention, we hope you will quickly do justice between us. Every word has its answer. In short, I have sent my messenger to let you know what has occurred.' 422D. Government received two further despatches from the E-esident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 14th and 21st May, the first reporting that Ilis Highness Syud Soweyni, finding tbat he could not obtain any aid from the neighbouring Arab tribes and having been repulsed on the 30th March in an attempt to take the port by assault with a loss ot 30 men killed and wounded, had been compelled to raise the siege of Sohar and returned to Maskat on the 4th April, that his treacherous conduct towards Syud Hamud had created a general feeling of sympathy towards that Chief, and that various Arab Chiefs had combined to aggress against His Highness the Imam's territories, having taken one fort (Ghullah) and the united forces of Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar the Sukun Chief, and of Syud Gez bin Azan having also laid siege to the still more important fortress of Shinas. Tliese were the natural results as the Resident remarked ' of the imprudent and faithless proceedings of the Imam s son Syud Soweynee in the seizure of Syud Humood bin Azan, and the unpro voked attack on Sohar. ' The Resident's despatch of the 21st May reported the death of the unfortunate Chief of Sohar at Maskat on the 23rd April. This death is said to have been occasioned ' by the heat of the place in which he was confined, ' and the Resident adds, 44 he was treated with unnecessary severity by orders of Syud Soweynee, the irons in which he was originally confined having been exchanged for heavier ones, after he arrived at Maskat notwithstanding he was then suffering from fever and dysentery.' 423. We must also mention that Shaikh Sultan had for some time past been planning an expedition against Khore Fukaun, a port on the Batinah Coast, now in the possession of His Excellency Syud Soweyni; but, owing to the strong terms in .which both Syud bin Mutiuk and Shaikh Muktum of Debaye expressed their aversion to the proposed measure, he abandoned the plan. 424. In the early part of 1850, however, when the Sohar Chief sought his assistance against the Maskat authorities, who had seized upon his brother, and invaded his territories, Shaikh Sultan gave ear to the request, and finding that Syud Ghes promised, in the event of being freed from his obnoxious opponent, to aid and support the Joasmi in recovering his lost possessions vpon the JBatinah Coast ) as also to pay tribute, the same in amount as he had hitherto paid the 'Wahabi, assistance was speedily proffered. 425. The Joasmi troops were yet on the way, when they were met by Syud Ghes, who, having successfully resisted the convulsive efforts of the Maskat Governor to take the fort of Sohar, had driven His Excellency Syud Soweyni to retreat from the neighbourhood, and return to Maskat. The combined Chiefs now proceeded at once against the fort of Shinas, and, after a stout resistance had been offered, compelled the place to capitulate on the 10th May 1850. They were equally successful in their attacks upon Ghulla and Khore Fukaun, and having thus reduced the whole of the -Batinah Coast from Merya to Cape Musseldom to a state of subjection, and come to a satisfactory understanding of the partition to be made, they both returned to their seats. 426. The correspondence that passed between the Imam of Maskat and the Resident, and the orders passed by the Bombay Government are interesting as showing our policy in these inland conflicts between the Joasmi Chief and the Sohar Chieftain and the Imam :— Translated extract of a letter from IllS E igene SS S yed S yoweykee to major E ennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 15th Zilkauda or 3rd October 1849.

Although the British Government does not interfere in affairs which take place inland, still, considering that a Treaty of Peace and friendship was concluded between His Highness Syed Saeed and Syed Humood bin Azam through the mediation of the Sirkar, I have considered it expedient to write to him a letter ot advice and admonition on the subject. With reference to the case of Sheik Sultan bin Suggur, I beg to reply that I have received several letters from him complaming that although Khor Fakaun had for years belonged to turn. Your Highness s people had taken possession of it. As I did not deem it advisable to interfere in the case of the seizure of this fortress from the hands of Sheik Sultan, so neither can i now prevent that Chief from attempting to recover it.

In the actual turn, however, which affairs have taken at Muscat, H is Lordship in Council finds it difficult to determine what measures are the best to be pursued, and can therefore only lay down some general principles for your guidance. 3. The policy of the British Government, I am desired to inform you, is now, as it has alwavs been, to strengthen the influence and power of His Highness the } ImaLTn Ambia as much as possible. His Lordship m Council is nevertheless of opinion that interference on the present occasion can scarcely be exercised to shield Syud tfhoweynee from the 00^0^ 0? f p n , c . 0 ° si ^ a ^ e an( j f ^ thless conduct, without stipulating on behalf of the family of the deceased Chief oJ Sohar all the compensation which the nature of the case now admits of p 4, h as for some time been the intention of Government to despatch a steam frigate to the Persian Gulf, and as the present exigencies render it desirable that this intention thould be earned into effect without delay, instructions have been issued for the immediate despatch of the Honourable Company's steamer ' Auckland,' the Commander of which vessel will on his arrival at Bush ire under instructions from the Commodore in the Gulf place hSselfnnZ yy orders. The Kight Honourable the Governor in Council deems it ^^10™ to btd l 1 an v? P 0bltlve 0 f ders to act in any specific manner, but rather to leave you to be guided bv events which may since the date of your communications have occurred. His Lordship in Council is however disposed to think that it is advisable that you should proceed at once to Muscat, and endeavour to effect a settlement which * * * *Part VI—Chap. XLVI. 235 will be satisfactory to the family of the deceased Chief and at the same time preserve the interests of His Highness the Imam from the injury which at present appears so eminently to threaten them. 5. In carrying out these instructions you should be careful to abstain in the present state of affairs at Muscat from anything like coercion and confine yourself to taking advantage of any opportunity which may present itself for acting as a friendly mediator between the parties. I am further desired to remind you that the general policy of Government in the Persian Gulf is to abstain from all interference in disputes by land, and that Government is chiefly influenced in authorizing you to mediate in a friendly way between the parties in the present dispute by the apprehension not only that the integrity of the Imam's Arabian possessions is in danger, but that the feud which lias arisen between the families of Muscat and Sohar, will lead to aggressions on sea and disturb the general tranquillity of the Persian Gulf. These instructions, however, are conditional on any change in the state of affairs which in your discretion you may be of opinion would change the views of Government. 6. I am desired to annex for your information copy of a letter which I have this day addressed to Her Majesty's Consul and the Hon'ble Company's Agent at Zanzibar and of its enclosure, together with a letter from the Bight Hon'ble the Governor to His Excellency Syud Thoweynee, a translation of which is appended for information. You will be guided by circumstances in delivering or withholding this letter from His Excellency. 7. You should avail yourself of the u Auckland'for making the tour of the Gulf and such other duties as she may be required to perform. An extract paragraph 2 from my letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy is annexed for your information. 427. The Governor of Bombay also wrote to Syud Said who was at Zanzibar counselling his immediate return to his disturbed possessions; they animad verted with the greatest delicacy upon the conduct of his son and representa tive ; they pointed out the course that appeared most fitting for His Highness to pursue;—they offered, in fact, every moral support in their power. His Highness gave heed to the friendly warning, and repaired with haste to Muskat. The well known character of Syud Said for moderation and justice gave every room for hope that matters might once more be restored to peace and quietness. 428. Syud Ghes was, however, called upon to restore the forts he had lately seized with the assistance of his ally Shaikh Sultan bin Saggar, on the Batinah Coast. He refused, and hostilities were at once commenced. His Highness proceeded to Khahura, with two ships and a number of Sur boats, having previously despatched a force by land under the command of Syud Soweyni to invest the place. 429. The campaign opened in September 1851, and began auspiciously enough for the cause of His Highness; Kasbiah fell without a struggle; Khabura was taken after a bombardment of two days' duration; and other preparations were in course, when His Highness effected a meeting with Sultan bin Saggar, and induced him to abandon the cause of the Sohar Chief. Deserted by the Joasmis, opposed by the combined forces of Syud Said and the Sheikh of Debaye, Syud Ghes stood but little chance of success. He turned, however, to bay, with much display of fierceness, and strove to meet his opponents single-handed. They proved too strong for him : Shinas fell an easy prey to the allied armies, and Syud Ghes was compelled to surrender. Sohar was handed over to His Highness; Rastak and Hebi remained in possession of Syud Ghes, who also received from the Maskat Government % pension of 200 dollars per mensem,—a poor indemnity indeed for all the wrongs he had suffered. 2 H236 Part VI—Chap.

Towards the close of the year 1852, His Highness Syud Said left Maskat and returned to Zanzibar and his African possessions. His departure Bombay Selections, Volume XXIV, page 232. the siijnil for revolt: fresh disturb- aT^ces arose; signs of disaffection were freely manifested by the tribes in Batinah, and the whole of His Highness's dominions was in a blaze with dissensions. At this conjuncture, too, the advancing steps of the TVahabi Chief were heard thundering once more in the distance. He came in the character of arbiter and redresser of wrongs suffered by his children (the Sheikhs) in Oman. He took up his position at Brymi, and summoned the Chiefs to attend him. The force despatched on this occasion was so unusually large, and entrusted to the command of so influential a person,—that person being no less than a son of the great Amir himself,' thdt all the tribeSj struck with, awe, hastened to meet its commanderj and seemed to vie with each other in acts of submission and homage towards him. The maritime Chiefs, too, repaired with haste to pay their ^addresses and to relate their tales of woe. 431. Scarcely had Abdullah bin Feysal arrived, ere he sent forth demands for the immediate cession of Sohar, and the payment of tribute so lar^e in amount that it was plain he sought but a pretext, in the refusal that must of necessity follow, to attack and lay waste the districts of Batinah. The Sohar Chief, it cannot be doubted, added fuel to the flame, by recounting with fiery eloquence the wrongs he had suffered, the indignities that were heaped on his ill-fated brother. A blow, it was manifest, was about to be aimed at His Highness's dominions, that would imperil their safety, and endanger their integrity. The aspect of affairs was gloomy indeed, and had it not been for the opportune presence of the Resident on the Arabian Coast, and the steps he adopted to stay the storm, coupled with the noble stand of Sheikh Syud bin Tahnun in support of His Highness, matters would have proved most truly serious, for not only was His Highness threatened with ruin by the confe deracy in league against him, but great fears also existed lest a renewal of the Maritime Truce, about to expire, should not be effected ere hostilities com menced. The Resident had proceeded to the coast for the express purpose of arranging a firm and lasting peace among the Arab tribes, and now so engrossed was their attention with the designs of the Wahabis, that not one of their number found himself either able or willing to return to his post. It seemed highly probable, therefore, that unless the crisis had passed ere the coming month of June, either His Highness would fall a prey to his enemies, and maritime disorder in every shape and form arise, or else the British representative must act, on his own responsibility, with a degree of coercion entirely opposed to the rules of British policy. 432. Such was the position of affairs when the Resident reached the Coast of Arabia, a position, it must be admitted, highly difficult and embarrassino'. He at once addressed a letter of strong remonstrance to Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, charging him in the name of the British Government to abstain from intriguing, and desiring him to return to his seat, to meet the British repre sentative, who awaited his coming. Syud Soweyni was likewise apprised of his presence, and his intention, if dangers thickened, to repair to Muskat in pet son, for the purpose of assisting him. To jLhdulla bin Fysul was conveyed the extreme surprise of the Resident that any circumstances whatsoever should induce him to prevent the Sheikhs from obeying his call. These measures, backed by the presence of a vessel of war sent to cruise on the Arabian Coast!Part VI—Chap. XLVII. 237 together with the decided tone of opposition adopted by Sheikh Syud bin Tahnun, tended greatly to restrain the W«habis. His Excellency hastened to Sohar, placed the fort in a state of defence, and assumed a hostile attitude. After some display of hesitation, the plan of attacking Batinah was abandoned, and a series of negotiations entered upon, which ended in a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between Syud Soweyni and Abdulla bin Fysul, whereby the Muskat Government agreed to pay to the Wahabi Amir an annual tribute of 12,000 crowns, besides arrears to the extent of 60,000 crowns, and the usual supply of provisions and stores. The Wahabi likewise pledged himself to assist His Excellency in every hour of difficulty ; and the boundaries of the dominions of either remained as heretofore.238 Part VI—Chap. XLVII. CHAPTER X1VIII. DISTURBANCES IIV THE IMAM'S RENTED POSSESSIONS ON THE PERSIAN COAST. POLICY OF PROHIBITING MARITIME WAR BY THE IMAM ON THE PERSIAN GULF ATTEMPTED, 1846 47. 433. Disturbances occurred in 1846 in the rented possessions of the Imam of Maskaton the Persian Coast, in which the British Resident for the first time prohibited the Imam from carrying on maritime war and thus disturbing peace of the Gulf. Ihe Imam had two grounds of complaint against the proceedings of the Persians. 434. Firstly in 1846, Mirja Abbas, Governor of Bushire, instigated it was said by the evil counsels of Mir Bauker, a Bushire merchant, tried to extort a large sum of money from a newly arrived wealthy merchant of Maskat, Mahomed Ali Bundera. As the latter obstinately refused to pay the money, recourse was had to harsh measures and ill-usage, but without effect: at last, however, driven to extremities, and finding that preparations were in course to inflict torture upon him, he agreed to pay the sum of 750 Tomans. Having given the above promise, he was released, and contrived to make good his escape from Bushire harbour before he had paid any portion of the money. Mir Bauker pretended that the sum of 750 Tomans was due to himself, for he said that, having guaranteed the payment thereof to Mirza Abbas, he was eventually compelled to disburse the whole amount from his own pocket. 435. During the preceding year (1845), some seven cases of indigo were sent to Bushire for sale by Syud Mahomed bin Salim of Maskat, nephew to His Highness the Imaum. Mir Bauker, ever seeking a pretext for revenge, and still incensed at the escape of his would-be victim, now thought a fitting opportunity for the practice of a little more villany had arrived. He declared Svf bin Salim's indigo to be the property of Mahomed Ali Bundera, and, by means of bribes, and a representation of his claims upon the latter party, induced Mirza Iledayut, Acting Governor of Bushire, tc seize and confiscate the whole of the boxes. These were transmitted to Shiraz, and no appeals from the Besident either to Mirja Hedayut or to Sheikh Nasir, the de facto Governor of Bushire, could effect their relinquishment. The Maskat authorities retaliated by the seizure of a quantity of silk, belonging to Persian merchants, that was intercepted on its way to the Presidency. Much discussion arose, and many letters were exchanged on the subject of the above seizure and counter- seizure,' but it was not until after the lapse of close upon a year that matters were in any way settled or adjusted. 436. We now come to the second ground of complaint:—This consisted in the despatch of troops by Hussein Khan, the Governor of Fars, against Bandar Abbas, with a view to exacting a large sum of money from Sheikh Syf bin Kubhan, the Governor, aud the Imaum's deputy in that place. 437. The Imaum was determined to resent these injuries. He addressed himself to the Governor-General of India, ' intimating bis desire to blockade the port of Bushire, and also wrote to Sheikh Nasir direct, remonstrating with him for the unfriendliness of his behaviour in the matter of the indigo, and telling him plainly that as he understood Persian troops were encroaching upon, and ' destroying his possessions in Bandar Abbas, he would retaliate by destroy ing Bushire.' 438.^ The chief fears entertained by Sheikh Nasir, on receipt of the above communication, were lest the Imaum, by means of his fleet, should take possession of Karrak, 439. The Governor of Fars likewise seems to have had a wholesome dread of the Imaum s naval superiority ; for although he did not actually deign to express such feeling, he besought the Resident to pacify and appease HisPart VI—Chap. XLVIII. 239 Highness,—to assure him that in no way had Persian troops encroached upon or injured his rented territories,—they had merely been despatched for the purpose of settling affairs on the frontier. The Resident, in reply, refused to interpose, until the illegally confiscated indigo had been restored to its lawful owner. In this refusal, too, was he justified, for the Persian Ministers had both disavowed the military proceedings of Hussein Khan, and commanded the immediate restitution of the indigo. That they were not sincere, however, in their professions of disavowal, is plain, for two reasons,—the indigo was not restored until after much evasion, and troops were again marched into the vicinity of Bunder Abbas, Minao being actually invested by Puzl Ali Khan, the Governor of Kirman. 440. Syf bin Nubhan lost all patience, and was on the point of himself carrying into execution the threats made by His Highness of blockading the ports on the Persian Const, when an intimation reached him from the Resident, ' that he would not he permitted to carry on hostilities at sea in the name of his master, and thus disturb the peace of the Persian Oulf.' His designs of reta liation were thus frustrated, and he had recourse to another line of conduct. He promised Fazl Ali Khan, in the event of his raising the siege of Minao, and withdrawing his troops, that he would disburse to him the sum of 12,000 E. I. Company's rupees. Whether or not the money was paid, or whether Syf bin Nubhan merely guaranteed its payment, with a full intention to break his promise so soon as a favourable opportunity presented itself, I know not. Ruse or no ruse, however, it had the desired effect: hostilities against Minao were suspended, and the districts were evacuated by the Kirman army. 441. His Highness had up to the present time behaved with much for bearance, and entirely abstained from acts of aggression; but in October 1848, perceiving that no amends were likely to be made for the insults offered to his dignity, and the wrongs done to his territories, he again wrote to the Resident, reiterating his request for sanction to proceed agaist the ports on the Persian Coast. The Resident had hitherto sent no direct reply, but confined himself to doing all in his power to dissuade the Imaum from entertaining the idea of a blockade ; to assuring him that such an act would in the end prove detri mental to his own interests ; and to holding out to him hopes that, through the exertions of the British Envoy at the capital in his behalf, justice would yet be done^—amends would still be made: but now the aspect of affairs was greatly altered,—indeed it is difficult to say where matters might have ended, or what disturbances might not have arisen, had not His Excellency Haji Mirja Aghasi, then Prime Minister at the Court of Persia, withdrawn from office, consequent upon the death of Mahomed Shah, which occurred at this season, and been succeeded by a minister more favourabe to British views, and more inclined to give ear to justice ; for instructions had been issued by tbe Supreme Government to the Resident, in reply to a reference he had made on the sub ject, that he was not to thwart or prevent His Highness from carrying into execution his threat to blockade the Persian ports, in the event of redress being refused him. These instructions had arrived, and the Imaum had become desperate. Mirza Aghasi's successor was appealed to. He promised redress ; he fulfilled his promise: Puzl Ali Khan was removed from his post, and matters were peaceably settled. 442. The opinion of the Resident at the time was that had His Highness, in lieu of threatening to take the law into his own hands, plainly and soberly laid his grievances before His Majesty the Shah, full redress would have been afforded for any amount of wrongs he had suffered at the hands of tbe Persian Government; but the precipitate line of conduct His Highness adopted, the objectionable tone of his written address to Sheikh Nassir, the proneness to take offence displayed by Sheikh Syf bin Nubhan,—these all tended to provoke and exasperate the Persian Ministers, and, naturally enough, to shut out every hope of a peaceable settlement. 443. Towards the close of the year 1847, His Highness the Imaum espoused a grand-daughter of the late Path Ali Shah. This marriage caused considerable surprise to many, for no one had in any way heard of the proposed match until the lady made her appearance at Maskat, on her way to join His Highness at Zanzibar. No political importance, it may be observed, was attached to this Persian connexion by the British Minister at the capital.240 Part VI— Chap. XLIX. CHAPTER XLIX. PERPETIAL TREATY OF PEACE SIGNED BY THE PIRATE CHIEF, 1853. 444. In view of the lapse of the period for which the truce of 1843 was agreed to, Captain A. Kemhall, Resident in the Persian Gulf, corresponded with the Trucial Chiefs on the advisability of continuing the truce for a limited or agreeing to a perpetual peace. The replies he received are summarised and his views expressed in his letter to the Bombay Government dated 16th September 1852 :— I have accordingly the honor to submit herewith^ for the information of the Eight j at 4 Hon'ble the Governor in Council, translations of Sheik of Rusnlkhymah. the communications I have already received from „ of Aboothabn. the subscribing parties (the Sheikh of Amulgavine ' of Eima'um. excepted) from which a judgment may be formed of the general sense of the Arabian Chiefs and their intention as to the renewal of the existing engagement, or the substitution of a peace in lieu of it; you will observe that the minor Sheikhs of Ejmaum and Debaie declare their willingness to be guided entirely in the decision of this question by the wishes which Government may be pleased to express regarding it, while those of Rusul Khymah and Aboothabu propose to defer its discussion until my visit to the coast on the next occasion. 2. I think it not improbable that the more powerful Joasmee and Beniyas leaders at our expected interview may with a show of earnestness seek to take credit to themselves for relinquishing one means of coercing their weaker neighbours, to whose allegiance formerly they sometimes laid claim, as well as for abandoning a privilege they would declare to be so consistent with Arab honor of lending naval aid to relations or allies who may not be parties to their common agreement; and more particularly may Sheik Sultan bin Suggur refer to his superior power of retaliating at sea injuries which may be inflicted upon his subjects by his rival Saeed bin Tahnoon on land. These Chiefs, however, will be found, I believe, to be no less accessible to reason now than heretofore. Their arguments would be fairly met by the considerations that the issue at war must at all times be doubtful more especially of hostilities of an aggressive nature which would inevitably give rise to a confederacy against the assailant—that interference in the quarrels of foreign belligerents (by ranging them as auxiliaries on opposite sides) must have the effect of course of bringing them into collision which each other, while a restraint freely adopted by all could under no circumstances affect their individual honor and finally that a superiority of maritime resources with reference to the legitimate avocations of the Arabian tribes must imply at the same time a greater vulnerability to the attacks of an enterprizing enemy. 3. In anticipating thus their affected scruples, I should observe, that if adduced at all they would be so equally whether the matter to be determined were the renewal of the truce for a limited period or the establishment of a peace in perpetuo; but I have no hesitation in expressing an opinion that the advantages they have experienced from the maintenace of maritime tranquillity in the security of the pearl fishery, and in the safe prosecution of their trade in all quarters during the past 18 years are too highly appreciated Sheik Sultan bin Suggur in 1837,himself proposed ^ ^ diiefs concerned to permit of their the substitution of a permtment peace for the mari- offering a serious objection to whichever arrange- time truce vide letter from Officiating Resident ment may be preferred by Government. There ia to Government No. 83 of 16th September 1837. i, -j ** • i • .i c ih ^ however one consideration involving the continu ance or cessation of their annual presents to which, as having attracted notice in 1843 I would beg leave to recall your attention. The practice of bestowing the gifts in question during the periodical visits of the Resident to the piratical coast is, I submit, both expedient and desirable as furnishing, as well the occasion to remind the Chiefs severally of their obligations, as constituting a mark of the satisfaction of Government with their due observance, and I respectfully hope therefore that I may be authorized to announce their intended distribution for the future to all those who during the preceding year may have faithfully acted up to their engagements. 4. Presuming that the success of the ten years' truce now about to expire is deemed to be conclusive as overruling the objections which during the previous years of its existence, it was supposed might operate against its further extension, and as recommending now the establishment in its stead of a permanent peace, I beg to remind you that some modification of the terms of the original Agreement would be necessitated by such a change, to which the prior confirmation of Government would appear called for. In transmitting herewith English and Arabic drafts of an amended treaty which I have framed to answer the object contemplated and which I propose should be presented to the Arabian Chiefs in the event of its meeting the approval of the Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council.Part VI—Chap. XLIX. 241 445. The Bombay Government strongly supported the proposal for a peace in lieu of truce in their letter No. 14)7, dated 24tli November 1852. We shall quote their observations :— 2. The Right Hon^ble the Governor in Council desires me in forwarding these documents to observe that the success of the maritime truce, now about to expire, has, it is believed, been complete and that the benefits resulting from it, to all parties, undeniable. It is, therefore, an object of great importance that the present peaceful relations maintained among the Chiefs of the Persian Gulf with each other, and with the British Government, as the acknowledged paramount power, shall not be interrupted. 3. The Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council considers the proposed treaty for a peace in lieu of a truce to be unobjectionable, and is of opinion that the execution of such an agree ment is highly desirable ; I am accordingly instructed to request that you will submit, for the consideration of the Most Noble the Governor-General in Council, the suggestion of this Government, that it be allowed to authorize the Resident to conclude an agreement on the terms he has recommended, using his best endeavours to carry through the measure with as little delay as possible. 4. Should the Government of Ind^ authorize the above course. His Lordship in Council purposes to instruct the Resident, in the event of the Chiefs evincing a serious disinclination to such a treaty, or opposing to its conclusion, any obstacles which that officer may be unable himself to overcome, to refer the subject again for the consideration of Government; taking care in such a case that the truce is not suffered to expire, but renewed for such short intervals as may give time for a reply to the references he may find it imperatively necessary to make. 5. The Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council is of opinion that the usual annual presents to the Chiefs in token of their adherence to their engagement should not be discontinued, and be made subservient to the maintenance of British influence. 446. The Government of India approved of the proposal. 447. An agreement was accordingly concluded with the Chiefs on the See Aitchieon's Tr«tie., VoW x. Arabian coast to be in force in perpetuity. In a letter dated 11th May 1853, Captain Kemball reports the particulars of the interviews he had with the respective Chiefs on the occasion of concluding the general Treaty of Peace and throwing as it does much light on the condition of affairs at the time, it is quoted at length below:— Having this day completed the tour of the ports of Oman in prosecution of which I left Bassidi re on the 3rd instant, I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, the particulars of my interviews with the Maritime Chiefs on tlie occasion of concluding the General Treaty of Peace, w T hich is referred to in your instruction No. 447 of 31st December last. An Arabic draft of this engagement duly authenticated by the seals of the contracting Parties, as also an English version, are herewith transmitted. 2. On the 4th instant the Clive arrived off Shargah, and in the course of the day I received the visit of Sheikh Sultan bin SuggarAfter reproaching the Chief with the detention to which his protracted stay at Brymee had subjected me, I observed that having already apprized him by letter of the light in which his proceedings would be viewed by the British Government, I had only now to rejoice that the apparent efficacy of my remonstrances should have obviated a recourse to more serious measures in order to vindicate its policy, and to support the interests of an old and faithful ally. This allusion to his schemes my visitor in the first instance repudiated, asserting on the contrary the friendship he had always enter tained for the Imaum, In proceeding to Brymee he said he had only followed the example of Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoon and the other Maritime Chieftains and was prompted thereto merely by the desire to counteract intrigues which, he apprehended, they might set on foot to injure him; but on my remarking that, if such were the case, the fact of his exclusion from the subsequent negotiations, and the ascendancy gained by his rival Saeed bin Tahnoon in the Councils of Abdulla bin Fysul would be inexplicable, he admitted that the faithless treatment he had experienced at the hands of the Imaum had certainly provoked him to espouse afresh the cause ot 55yed Ges Bin Azan and, in furtherance of his objects to avail himself of the co-operation of a party whose power was adequate to the control of the other tribes. His Highness, he declared, when persuading him on the last occasion to join his side, had promised him an annual donation of 8,000 dollars, but no sooner were his aims accomplished than he withdrew trom his engagements. In acting therefore as he did, he had sought only to obtain what he conceived to be his right, and that his intentions extended no further I must myself be sufficiently convinced, when I considered that it would be quite as hurtful to his interests as to those of His Highness that the Wahabees occupied Sohar. Here I thought proper to remark that although the British Government as a rule did not interfere in the internal concerns of the Arab tribes so long as their differences were confined to themselves, still, if a third party interposed to disturb its arrangements, it could not be denied the privilege o! asserting its views. f lhe Sheikh then assured me that on receiving my letter he had immediately disbanded his followers, and relinquished absolutely the designs to which he had before lent himself j so242 Part VI—Chap. XLIX. distinct an avowal, I said, was at least satisfactory in that it might serve to qualify the displeasure which the Government must have felt at his previous conduct. 3. The subject of the new treaty being now introduced I was agreeably surprised to find that my visitor afFected no disinclination to the arrangement, but on the contrary ani madverted upon the little respect which, he alleged, had been paid to the former Maritime Truce on the repeated conveyance of troops and warlike stores from one port to another in viola tion of its conditions. As his remarks however were to the same effect precisely as those contained in his letter to my address of 28th August last, and were again answered in the terms of my reply, translations of both of which documents were submitted to you in my despatch No. under date 2nd October 1852, they need not be here recapitulated. I was either ignorant of, or could explain the several instances he enumerated, but I could assure him that whatever may have occurred in the past, nothing of the kind would be tolerated for the future. 4. An additional question on this subject, as illustrating the views so lately entertained by the Joasmee Chief, is perhaps worthy of mention. He asked whether, if the Imaum's party attacked by sea his possessions on the Batinah Coast, he would be at liberty to retaliate in like manner, and was informed that under a contingency so very unlikely of occurrence in the event cf his opponents refusing to attend to the mediation or remonstrances of the British Government, I could not suppose he vould be withheld from retorting any injuries they might inflict upon him, but it would be obviously necessary in such case that he should give me timely notice before proceeding to extremity. He then affixed his seal to the several drafts of the Treaty presented to him. 5. The next matter brought under discussion was the alleged exportation of slaves from Ras-el-Khymah by one Abdool Rahman-boo-Sheit in the summer of last year, being the case referred to in your despatch No. on I invited his explanation. Sheikh Sultan said he had nothing further to advance beyond what he had stated in his reply to my written remonstrance to the effect that the gent in the affair being the Envoy of the Wahabee Ameer, was too influential a person to be meddled with, and he apprehended that the confisca tion of his property would have drawn reprisals upon his own dependants located within the power of the latter. 6. On my answering that such an excuse appeared to me rather to aggravate than extenuate bis offence, seeing he had been already explicitly informed that Government could admit no external influence or control whatever to excuse the infraction of a solemn engagement, and that, with reference to the party implicated, every Chief was liable for the acts of indivi duals residing within his jurisdiction, he observed that he had fully anticipated the nature of my objections ; the slaves in fact had been carried beyond his reach, and he could only assure me that, if the present instance were overlooked, he would take care it should not recur. 7. With respect to the plunder of the Zanzibar vessel by his dependant Yedeedee, the Joosmee Chief said, he would be prepared to comply with my requisition so soon as the amount of compensation could be decided upon.' 8. On the following day, 5th, I was visited successively by the Sheikhs of Darbair, Ejmaum and Amulgavine. My interviews with these Chiefs were characterised chiefly by the readiness which each displayed to suhscribe the New Treaty, and with the first of these only were any topics discussed other than those of a general nature. 9. On meeting Sheikh Saeed bin Butye I hastened to express my satisfaction at the promptitude which he was said to have exercised in punishing an act of irregularity committed by one of his dependants in the interval since my first arrival ; the particulars of the case were briefly as follow :—' An inhabitant of Debaie having forcibly r*moved a slave from a Shargah boat at sea, a complaint was immediately lodged with Sheikh Saeed by the British Agent and reparation demanded; the delinquent being summoned denied the fact, but was called upon to take oath of his innocence in the most solemn form observed among Arabs by the divorce of the wife. 13 On his declining to do so, he was tied to a gun and subjected to corporal punish ment until induced to make confession, when he was required to furnish security for the surrender of his captive. This individual who, it appeared, had been secreted at Aboothabee, was then recovered and made over to the rightful owner. In acknowledging my remarks the Sheikh observed that his motives in the transaction mutt be self-evident since the parties aggrieved were at the time at open feuds with his tribe. 10. My visitor then calling my attention to an aggression which had been lately com mitted by a plundering party from Shargah upon some of his people engaged in fishing in one of the numerous back-waters situated between Debaie and Aboothabee, called Khore Ghurabee, wished to be informed whether the occurrence was one coming properly within my jurisdiction and of a nature to entitle him to redress at my hands. The circumstances having been previously investigated, I replied that, as the assailants had operated entirely from the land, which indeed he could not deny, their proceedings violated no condition of the Maritime Truce, and further that as a rule when boats drew up in creeks and back-waters, and were attacked from the shore by persons, it might be, who were not accountable to any of the parties to that agreement, the Government had never yet exercised a right of interference. He said that my answer was not altogether unexpected, and he only mentioned the grievance (having previously addressed me in writing on the subject) in order to prepare me for complaints of retaliation in a similar form which might be practised by his followers. HePart VI—Chap. XLIX. 243 informed me tliat in the affray two Debaie men had been wounded and their property carried off, and that one of the crew of an Aboothabee boat fishing in company had been likewise killed on the occasion. It is proper I should mention here that on the previous day I had brought the above matter to the serious notice of Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur. Though not, I said, constituting a cafe for my authoritative interference, yet it bordered so closely upon maritime irregularity, that 1 hoped the respect he entertained for the favourable opinion of Government, to say nothing of motives of good policy, would prompt him to afford all the redress in his power. The Joasmee Chief was earnest in his promises of acquiescence, but from the general tenor of the excuses by which they were preluded, to the effect that as members of an inimical tribe the sufferers had no claim upon his sympathy, and moreover that the aggressors were for the most part Bedouins, not subject to his authority, I could encourage little hope of their fulfilment. 11. The advent of the Wahabee force under Abdullah bin Fysul being referred to, Sheikh Saeed bin Butye observed that their presence in Oman in such strength was opposed to the best interests of the maritime tribes and could not fail sooner or later to be productive of much embarrassment to the British Government; nothing was easier, he added, than for the Government to defeat their schemes by declaring the whole line of coast from Aboothabee to Mussendom under its protection—with much more to the same purpose, all tending to the query with which he concluded. 'Whether if the 'Wahabees attacked his territories, or offered to co-operate with either of his ambitious neighbours in such an enterprise he might count upon its support and assistance ? To this I replied, ' the neutrality generally observed by Government in inland aflairs seemed to suggest a sufficient answer. The Maritime Chiefs, whether united or singly, might always assure themselves of its sympathy and even its good offices when struggling fur their independence, but I could at present contemplate no contingency which should move it to deviate from its declared policy. All I could promise him was that, as heretofore, he should be gale from attacks from the side of the sea, or from any hostile demonstration whatever upon that element ; the above consideration, he answered, had been one of his principal sources of anxiety, but being now satisfied that no change was intended in this respect by the new treaty, he did not despair by judiciously availing himself of the jealousies of the Baniyas and Joasmee Chiefs of counteracting any plans which might be formed for his subjection. 12. The language and demeanour of Sheikh Saeed bin Butye impressed me with his character for activity and intelligence ; though wanting perhaps the abilities of the late Sheikh Muktoom, he is said to possess all his energy, and will probably meet with equal success in maintaining his position. In his relations with Government I am happy to observe that he has as yet exhibited the same readiness to fulfil his engagements, which distinguished his brother during the latter years of his life. 13. On the 9th The Clive reached Aboothabee, when at my invitation, and in the absence of his brother, Humdon bin Thanoon came off to meet me. He informed me that Sheikh Saeed bin Thanoon's return might be looked for daily, but that as his representative and vested by him with full powers, if I did not choose to await bis coming, he was himself prepared to transact business in his behalf. Finding that my visitor suffered severely from sea-sickness, I did not detain him longer than sufficient to explain the objects of the proposed treaty, and to prepare a provisional document for his signature vouching for his brother's acceptance of its obligations, a precaution the necessity for which was, however, superseded by the latter's arriving in person yesterday, and by his visiting me this morning to affix his seal to the new engagement. This he did without hesitation, and without any allusion to his previously avowed designs for the reduction of Debaie, on which subject his silence was to be accounted for by his having lately resumed friendly relations with the Chief of that place. 14. With the exception of a complaint of the affair at u Khore Ghurabee/'to which I have referred to paragraph 10 of this report, the rest of our conversation was entirely engrossed by the proceedings of the Wahabees at Brymee. On arriving, he said, in their camp he found that Abdulla bin Fysul, being correctly informed of the defenseless state of Batinah, had made up his mind to invade the district, and had accordingly pitched his demands upon Syud Soweynee at so high a rate, including therein a requisition for his personal attendance as apparently to close the door to an accommodation. The approach of the Joasmee Chief was then only awaited and a day had been fixed for the march of the coalesced forces. Matters having gone thus far he wrote to Syed Soweynee recommending him to proceed himself and to despatch all his available troops to Sohar, and to assume at least an attitude of resistance in order to give weight to his mediation. He could eee, he told me, that both the Joasmee chief and the Wahabee Lieutenant were employing Syed Gez bin Azan as the instrument to subserve their own ends, and he felt, therefore, that by holding a bold language towards the latter, while he tendered his personal security for a reasonable amount of tribute, it might be possible to divert him from extreme measures. Much negotiation thereon ensued, but it was not until he declared his adherence lo the Imaum's I'arty, and begged, if the expedition were finally determined upon, to be permitted to withdraw, that his remonstrances seemed to make any impression. The result, as already known to me, was the deputation of himself and Ahmed el Sirdeyree to Sohar for the purpose of effecting an amicable arrangement. He regretted to add that, in spite of all his efforts, he was unable to obtain more favourable terms than payment of arrears of tribute to the amount of 60,000 dollars as the price of a Treaty2U Part VI—Chap. XLIX. of Alliance, offensive and defensive, between the parties, whereby His Highness Syed Sowevnee bound himself to a tribute of 12,000 dollars annually, and was on his side secured ia tlie possession of all the territory now under his rule, including the districts both of Sohar and Muscat. When I commented upon the magnitude of this exaction Sheikh Saeed replied that circumstances admitted of no alternative, it was no longer a question of purchasing the foruearance ol the Wababee Commander with a view to deter him from ravaging Batinah, but the object no^v virtually was to gain his support in order to prevent the dismemberment of the Imaum's dominions. The whole country had shewn itself disaffected to His Highness's authority, and my visitor had himself become awire of overtures made to Syed Ges bin' Azam, not only by the most influential dependants of his deceased brother, but by the Chiefs of considerable Tribes, both within and without His Highness's territories; so sensible was Sved Soweynee of the want of internal support that even after the withdrawal of Sheikh Snltau bin Sugyrur, when it was proposed to him to defy the Wahabees and defend himself to the last. His Highness declared that such a course would be hopeless ; the garrison even of Sohar could not be depended upon, and he would rather pay the whole amount originally demanded than risk the issue of a content. On my referring to the Wahabees having been permitted to prosecute their march into Oman unobstructed, Sheikh Saeed observed that in this respect too his efforts had been paralyzed by the same causes, for when he invited the Muscat authorities to occupy his enemies in the rear, while he encountered the invaders, his proposal had not been responded to. 15. The heavy sacrifice which the Muscat authorities have been called upon to make may be regarded perhaps as a just penalty for the unfortunate policy they pursued towards the late Humood bin Azan, but it is to be feared that their disregard of the advice of Government on that occasion has placed them in a position to deprive them for the future of the full benefit of its intervention. The fear of its resentment would doubtless suffice to secure the ostensible neutrality of the Joasmee Chief, but such a motive could hardly operate m the same degree to check the progress of tribes less amenable to its influence, or to induce Syed Ges, when in the ascendant, to accept of any accommodation short of a special guarantee for his complete and permanent restoration to his hereditary rights. 16. Under these circumstances it seems certain that a more direct interference on my part could hardly have averted their humiliation, whereas failure might have necessitated the adoption of such extraordinary measures,! should suppose, the nature of the case would hardly justify. Although the predominance of the Wahabees in Oman must be generally prejudicial to the views of the British Government, I cannot learn that their Chief has as yet evinced a disposition to disturb the mutual relations of the Maritime Sheikhs as at present existino-. Abdullah bin Fysul, I am told, will return to Nedjd as soon as the season opens, leavino- our officer as heretofore with a small garrison to represent his authority at Brymee, and to collect arrears of tribute. 17. The concentration of the squadron at the lower end of the Gulf appearing to be no longer necessary, I beg herewith to enclose copies of letters addressed by me to Commodore Robinaon relative to the future disposal of the Tigris and Constance. Treaty of Peace in perpetuity agreed upon by the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, under the mediation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. 01 We* whose seals are hereunto affixed, Sheikh Sultan bin Suggar, Chief of Ras-el-Khaima Sheikh Syeed bm Tahnoon, Chief of Abuthabee, Sheikh Saeed bin Butye, Chief of Debaie Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid, Chief of Ejmaun, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid, Chief of Amulgavine, . having experienced for a series of years the benehts and advantages resulting from a Maritime Truce contracted amono-st our selves under the mediation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and renewed fronTtime to time up to the present period, and being fully impressed, therefore, with a sense of the evil consequences formerly arising from the prosecution of our feuds at sea, whereby our subiects and dependants were prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery in security, and were exposed to interruption and molestation wheu passing on their lawful occasions.

HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE IMAM OF MASRAT AXD SHEIKH ABDUL RASSUL OF BrSHIRE AND BIUTISH POLICY, 1826. 449. The Imam of Maskat haTing long suspected that Sheikh Abdul Bombav Seleotiona, Volnme xxiv, page 194; Bassul Khan, Governor of Bushire, had , and letter from Resident to (iovernment, dated by his intrigues and misrepresentations sist July 1826, Volume gfi of 1826. traduced him at the Court of Shiraz, and even attempted to supplant him in his proposed connection with the Prince Eoyal of Fars, His Highness availed himself of the absence of his rival on a pilgrimage to despatch an expedition to Bushire on May 1826. 450. Two ships and a brig from Maskat anchored in the British roads on the 27th July 1826 with orders to seize on all vessels belonging to Sheikh Abdul Kassul Khan, but not to offer the slightest molestation in other respects to the trade of Bushire, or to adopt any hostile measures against the town or its dependencies. This squadron was accompanied by the ship of Nusrut Shah formerly belonging to the Sheikh of Bushire, but lately captured by the Imam on her return from Bengal. This ship had been sent up for the purpose of landing the goods consigned to the merchants of this place, the whole of the Sheikh property having been previously taken out at Maskat and the ship itself fitted out to reinforce the squadron. 451. Mahomed bin Suliman the Commander of these vessels forwarded to the Kesident a letter from His Highness explanatory of the objects of the expedition, and acquainted him at the same time that he had orders to restore all the property of the merchants and agents of this place that had been taken on the Nusrut Shah, on condition of their paying to him such duties as were usually levied at the Port of Bushire. As it appeared, however, that in making this demand the Imam had been actuated entirely by motives of enmity to the Sheikh, without reflecting that the merchants would then be subjected to a double charge, the Resident prevailed on Mahomed bin Suliman to abandon this claim, and to permit the goods to be landed free of imposition. The utmost tranquillity prevailed at Bushire since the arrival of the squadron which remained stationary without attempting to place the least restraint on the trade of the port. 452. The immediate consequences of this long threatened expedition were far less serious than could have been expected, and the moderation pf Seyyid Said in forbearing to invade the Persian territories, or injure the subjects of that kingdom, prevented his conduct from being viewed as a national aggression : his difference with Sheikh Abdul Rassul was not considered in any other light than that of a personal quarrel, in which, like the constant feuds between their Arab dependants, Government would not deem it necessary to interfere. But the virulent nature of the enmity between the two Chieftains would, it was feared by the Resident, involve the whole Gulf in their mutual quarrel, and afford a rallying point to those unsettled and discontented spirits which abound on its shores. The various tribes of Arabs on the Persian Coast between Kishm and Congun, were said to be impatiently waiting an invitation to engage on the side of the Imam, while overtures were reported to have been made by the Government at Bushire for assistance from the Joasmis, with whose Chief a friendly intercourse had been maintained by Sheikh Abdul Rassul Khan for many years past. The arrival of the Sheikh, who was expected to return through the centre of Arabia, would, the Resident feared, probably give the signal for hostilities and it would require the utmost vigilance and delicacy on his part to restrain the parties within lawful limits and to afford effectual protection to the neutral trade amidst the general confusion. 453. From Bushire the Imam's ships proceeded to Basrah to enforce some private and public claims advanced by the Imam against that place. 454. When a report was made of these circumstances to the Bombay Government, the Resident was directed to allow the Imam to pursue his oun250 Part VII—Chap. LI, course of policy towards JBushire and Basrah, and to maintain the strictest neutrality in these disputes. 465. In the month of September 1826 the Imam proceeded to cruise with t&gt; u a i v yytv ku iqk his fleet off Kishm for the purpose of Bombay Selections No. XXIV, pages 194—195. . ^ cn m i i? x» Vw* Foreign Department Sect, corres. dated 23rd intercepting the Sheiktl 01 15U8nire On niS March 1827, No. 8. return from Mekka. This plan was at tended with entire success as he fell in with the Sheikh on 13th September and after a short action captured that personage together with his two vessels. 456. The Imam's claims upon the authorities at Basrah having been brought to an amicable arrangement, the blockade of that place was raised in November 1826, and his fleet returned to Maskat much to the relief of the authorities in the Gulf. 457. In May 1827 Sheikh Abdul Rassul was restored to liberty by the Imam, and on his giving a bond for 80,000 German crowns, his two vessels were likewise given up to him. 458-461. Sheikh Ahmed, an uncle of Sheikh Abdul Rassul, was appointed Governor of Bushire on the capture of the latter by the Imam of Maskat, In 1827 Sheikh Abdul Rassul was restored to liberty by the Imam and on his giving a bond for 80,000 crowns, his two vessels were likewise given back to him. 461A.

On the night of 27th November 1826, Sheikh Nasir III, the eldest son of the late Governor Sheikh Abdul Eesident's letter to Lienfenant-Colonel ^assul, fled from the hoUSC of his erand Edt0 ^ Te ^ eran »dated 28th NoTeui» uncle sheikh Ahmed, where he had resided ever since his deposition and Yolame of 1827, page 159. threw himself on the protection of the Resident to avoid, as he declared, the intended violence of Sheikh Ahmed. On such an appeal the Eesident could not hesitate to grant him an asylum; although it was his earnest wish, and had hitherto been his invariable practice, to abstain from the slightest interference with the squabbles at Bushire, and in those terms he communicated the circumstance to Sheikh Ahmed, giving him at the same time to understand that the Resident would consider himself bound in honour to afford the young Sheikh a place of security as long as he might find it convenient to remain at the Residency. 463. In reply to this message Sheikh Ahmed expressed his surprise at the step taken by Sheikh Nasir, who, he assured me, had always been treated by him with the utmost delicacy and never had the remotest cause of apprehension for his personal safety, that he could not however but feel grateful for the kindness with which his relation had been received, and that he should look upon the Resident's friendly attentions to Sheikh Nasir as the light of a favour conferred on himself. 464. In the then state of affairs here, it was hoped that the Government of Shirauz could not feel offended at the conduct which circumstances had compelled the Resident to pursue on this occasion nor misconstrue a common act of hospitality into an officious interference with matters connected with their authority, but Colonel Stannus's past experience of the extraordinary suspicions entertained by that Government, on occasions less liable to mis construction, was to render him uncertain of the light in which their affair may be viewed. 465. These facts were reported by Lieutenant-Colonel Stannus to the Government of Bombay. He also informed them that Sheikh Ahmed had been confirmed as Governor of Bushire by the Prince of Pars and had been given by him presents of the value of HI,400. 466. The views of the Government were expressed in their letter No. 112, dated 25th January 1827 :— In the peculiar state of Arab manners, the Governor in Council conceives, that yon could not refuse your protection to the fugitives. Every means not repugnant to the ideas of the people of the country should, however, be adopted to relieve the British Government from the embarrassment that may arise from protecting persons in opposition to the existing Government, and the slightest attempt at intrigue or disturbance of the present order of things should at once deprive them of our protection. 2. Sheikh Nassir and his uncle should be apprized of the condition in which our protection can alone be continued to them. 8. The Governor in Council sanctions the amount of presents made by you to the new Governor of Bushire on the occasion of his being confirmed by the Persian Government in that office. 2 K252 Part VII—Chap.

In February 1827 events Occurred 7th February 1827. a t Bushire which were followed by serious Volume 3VV of 1827, page 305. consequences. On the 2nd February tbere was a simultaneous and almost unpremeditated insurrection of the inhabitants of Bushire headed .hj 150 men from the Benifladgi tribe from a neighbouring village and led on by Sheikh Hussein (brother of Sheikh Abdul Eassul Khan) who had for the last two months resided under the Besident's protection. 468. The insurgents during the night surprised the onlv two towers of the fort which were occupied by Sheikh Alimed's faithful adherents and suspended their further operations till daylight when they surrounded the Sheikh's house, and after skirmishing the greater part of the day compelled him to subscribe to an agreement concluded under Colonel Stannus's mediation, whereby he was obliged to abdicate the Government and take refuge in the Besidency till accounts were received of the surrender of Karrack, when he was to be furnished with the means of proceedinsr by sea beyond the limits of the Bushire territory. 469. The authority of Sheikh Ahmed was at no period more generally recognised or more cheerfully submitted to than on the day previous to his downfall. His popularity was lost by a plan which he had formed of sending hostages from each tribe to Karrak as pledge of their fidelity on the approach of the Prince, and this one act of oppression had been found to cancel all his former claims on the gratitude of the inhabitants. ^ 470. On the second day after Sheikh Ahmed had taken up his abode at the Besidency, it became necessary to make a communication to the new Govern ment on behalf of that Chieftain, which induced him to repair to the house of Bheikh Mahomed, the uncle of Sheikh Abdul Bassul Khan, when the Resident requested that the two young Sheikhs who were in possession of the Govern ment might be sent for to hear the proposal with which he was entrusted. In the course of the conversation that followed Sheikh Hussein took offence at an observation which fell from the Kesident, left the house abruptly and rushed towards the towers with his followers, who were soon raised-by his voice and gestures to a proper pitch for executing any act of violence. 471. The consequence was that the armed rabble of the town were soon everywhere in motion. The Residency was gradually surrounded by men posted in groups behind the neighbouring huts, and detached parties were seen creeping along the roofs of the houses to occupy commanding positions. These demonstrations were followed by the approach of a large gun which was brought from a distance and planted within 100 yards of the house, one of the Besidency servants was stopped close to the walls and plundered of articles which he was carrying to the gate. Parties were stationed in the streets leading to the Residency avow 7 edly to prevent ammunition being introduced there, in which occupation they committed the most wanton acts, emptying water jars, opening bundles, and searching the persona of Armenians and Others who approached it. 472. These violent proceedings forced the Resident to adopt measures for sustaining an attack, and the Residency was in the course of the afternoon placed in a respectable state of defence, but fortunately for both parties matters were prevented from coming to extremities. A note which Colonel Stannus addressed to Sheikh Kasir about 12 o'clock occasioned them to pause and reflect a little on the consequences of their proceedings, and a second written about three hours later produced a cessation of the frantic preparations and the removal of the armed bodies from our immediate neighbourhood.Part VII—Chap. LIII. 253 473. On 4th morning, as expected, an attempt was made by Sheikh Nasir to disavow all intention of violence. The most abject professions were made to soften the Resident's resentment and every argument used to impress him with the utter impossibility of their entertaining such an idea, all founded on the high respect in which the English were held, the benefits which Bushire in particular had experienced from their connection with it, the severe retri bution which would inevitably be exacted for the perpetration of such an out rage and above all in the grateful feelings entertained both by Sheikh Hussein and himself towards their benefactor and preserver. 474. But all these deceitful and at best hypocritical arguments were of no avail against the direct evidence of facts and the personal observation of every man in the Residency. The destruction howeTer of every individual within the Residency even if it would have been effected without risk or difficulty appears to have been an object of such trivial moment when compared with its serious and inevitable consequences that the Resident could scarcely persuade himself that the leaders would have contemplated anything beyond intimidation or perhaps the gratification of mortified vanity by a temporary display of superiority ; but such considerations, he thought, however they might lessen the moral responsibility of Sheikh Hussien and the promoters of the ferment, could afford no satisfaction for the insult offered to the representative of the British Government, nor would their utmost exertions have restrained the violence of the populace had it once been set in motion by the slightest act of imprudence on either side. 475. Soon after these events the Prince of Pars came to Fars with his Minister Gil Khan, but his presence did not improve matters much. A representation made by Colonel Stannus to the Prince brought a reply in the most offensive language, throwing the whole blame of the recent outrages on the Resident. Further outrages were added in stopping Residency servants from carrying water and insulting others in public roads. These proceedings left no other course to the Resident than to retire from Bushire to a village close by. 476. Meanwhile Captain Wilson had been appointed Resident in the Persian Gulf, and on his arrival to relieve Colonel Stannus, he received a letter from the Prince of Fars promising redress for the outrages to the Residency and to exclude Sheikh Hussein from the administration at Bushire. 477. The following order was passed by the Government of Bombay on the or, o 8 , 1q&lt; vt reports of the Resident (letter, dated Volume ^ of 1827, page 466. 00 ^i A nt:or , . ^ &gt; • Vrr-i n 28th April 1827, to Captain Wilson) 2. Tbese despatches coDfirm the opinion before expressed that no instructions issued at an earlier period would have been of any avail, the state of affairs daily cbanging until the final return of the Residency. 3. The decision of all questions is now mncb facilitated by events that have since taken place, Sheikh Ahmed having remained at Bushire until the Prince's arrival agreeably to his own request and having been made over to His Hoyal Highness in the manner he 'himself wished, has no further claim on the British Government. 4. It only now remains to decide on the course to be pursued towards the Sheikhs in possession and the notice to be taken of the letters of the Prince of Shirauz. 5. The treachery of the Sheikhs in intriguing while under the protection of the British Government, their ingratitude in having employed their newly acquired power against their late protector and the mean subterfuges by which they endeavoured to excuse their un provoked violence, leave no room for doubt as to the estimate to be formed of their character. The only part of their conduct however which requires public notice is the open preparation which they made for attacking the British Residency. Had that attack been carried into effect, it might have been impossible to admit of any circumstances however strong as a palliation for an outrage which would have lowered the impression of the British character through the whole of the Persian Gulf, but as the Sheikhs had sufficient prudence to stop before any act of open hostility had been committed, it is reasonable to make some allowances for the disturbed state of the place, the agitation of their own minds, the precarious foundation of their authority and the alarm which they must have felt as long as Sheikh Ahmed remained in their neighbourhood and under the protection of the Resident. These considerations would dispose the Governor in Council to admit of the immediate, public and abject apologies with which the violence of the Sheiklis was followed as a sufficient atonement for their indefensible proceedings. Even the disavowal of all intentions beyond that of preventing the escape of Sheikh Ahmed, though contrary to the truth, is a mark of humiliation on the part of the Sheikhs and a proof of a disposition to deprecate the resentment of the Resident.254, Part VII—Chap. LIU. 6. Had this conduct been persevered in the Governor in Council would not have been disposed to have made any exception even of Sheikh Hussein in his acceptance of the submission of the Sheikhs, but the renewal of the outrages mentioned in the beginning of Colonel Stannus's despatch (No. 8), the attempts at recrimination described in the same despatch, together with the ill-judged measures of the Prince of Shirauz, considerably altered the footing on which the transaction stood. 7. In these circumstances the step adopted by Colonel Stannus of withdrawing from the Residency was justified on the score of resentment for the slight that had been offered to him and was rendered indispensable even in prudence by the uncertainty of the continuance of tranquillity as loni; as Sheikh Hussein was in power and the whole town of Bushire in such a state of confusion. 8. Colonel Stannus's proceeding therefore in removing the Eesidency is approved and his whole conduct from the beginning of the disturbances till his departure is considered to be marked with the same decision, temper and firmness that has all along characterised him. 9. I am now directed to communicate to you the Governor in Council's full approbation of your return to the Hesidency at the time when you took that step and his ^ense of the judg ment evinced by you in coming to that resolution. The language of the Prince's letter was no doubt extremely offensive and such as might at another time have afforded strong ground for remonstrance, but the substantial concessions by which it was accompanied were a sufficient compensation as far as the point of honour was concerned, while the restoration of tranquillity in Bushire and the exclusion of Shiekh Hussein from all share in the Government afforded ample security against the apprehension that the presence of the Residency might give occasion to fresh grounds of dispute: a refusal to return on the ground of the Prince's language alone would entirely have altered the grounds of the discussion and could scarcely have failed to produce embarrassment. Your acceptance of the terms offered was therefore highly judicious, and your disregard of the irritating language in which they were conveyed was the most temperate and dignified course that could have been pursued, 10. The subsequent alteration in the Prince's language and the hope of future amendment in consequence of the ascendancy of the II Khani induced the Governor in Council to abstain from any expression of resentment at the ill-judged and intemperate language of the Prince of Fars and to confine himself to removing the false impression to which the tone of the Govern ment of Shirauz is calculated to give encouragement. 11. The only point that remains for decision is how far the permanent exclusion of Sheikh Hussein from the administration ought to be insisted on. If the employment of this person were a matter of indifference to the Persian Government, no consideration for him personally would lead to any relaxation of our demand, but as from his superior activity he appears to be the chief support of bis party, it seems doubtful whether his exclusion may not operate to the serious injury of Sheikh Abdul Rassul and to the embarrassment of the Prince Regent: should this be the case we must expect a continual struggle for his restoration and a state of feeling on the part of the local authorities more unlavorable than would result from our own acquiescence in the employment of Sheikh Hussein. 12. While therefore the Governor in Council is prepared to insist on the continued exclusion of Sheikh Hussein if it be considered that his return to power would occasion the risk of a renewal of the former outrages, he leaves it to your discretion to admit of his employ ment if it should appear to you that it may be acquiesced in with safety in the actual state of affairs. 13. The remarks of Colonel Stannus on the situation of the Residency appear to be entitled to ureat weight, but independent of other considerations, the impression which would be created by a removal at the present moment seems far from desirable. The Governor in Council will therefore await your opinion as to the probability of the consent of the local authorities to the construction of a Residency in a more favorable situation and of the expense at which a suitable building might be erected. In the meantime a cruiser detained at Bushire will afford the means of security as long as affairs remain in an unsettled state and the Governor in Council is disposed to think that an occasional resort to the same expedient will be found sufficient for the future also. 14. Before closing this despatch the Governor in Council directs me to call your particular attention to the inconvenience which has resulted from the practice hitherto prevalent of allowing fugitives to seek an asylum at the Residency. The Governor in Council is aware of the prejudices of the Persians and Arabs on this subject and of the difficulty of reconciling them to the propriety of refusing admission to a suppliant; but he considers it extremely desirable that this practice should be limited as much as possible, and that the degree to which it is limited should be publicly known. It ought to exclude all fugitives, whose presence can have a political influence on the Government, or is likely to involve the British Government in the internal affairs of Persia. It is not possible to take a better model in this case than that of the Embassy at the Court of Persia. The Governor in Council therefore requests that you will communicate with Colonel Macdonald and be guided by his advice in narrowing as much as possible the description of persons who may be permitted in certain cases to benefit by your temporary protection. 15. The Governor in Council directs me to express his satisfaction with the favourable reports he has received of the conduct of Lieutenant Heonell, M. E. 83th April 1827,Part VII—Chap.

Tlie Bombay Government asked the opinion of the Envoy at Teheran, on the abovementioned points. His Volume 284 of 1827, psgs 295. reply, dated 8th July 1827, is quoted below:— i 1007 n.i , •! ioo» o . c , n ,, . 1 have the hononr to acknowledge the receipt 1827. P P of several despatches e£ the dates speeitied in the margin. In reference to the letters addressed by Prince Hussein Ali Meerza to His Highness the Imam of Muscat, adverted to in No. 438, I have to observe that I never for a moment entertained the idea, though a solicitation to that effect was made to me bv the Shah, of deputing a gentleman to Shiraz, in order to effect an accommodation between that Govern ment and Sied Syed. Nor did I conceive myself authorized to interfere further in their disputes, than to communicate to the Governor-General the request of the King that his Lordship would intercede with the Imam in behalf of the imprisoned Sheikh. The events and transactions which have since taken place at Bushire will I hope put this question finally to rest, in as far as we are concerned. I have, since the arrival of the King in Azerbijan, again brought the conduct of the local authorities in I'ars towards the British representative under the consideration of His Majesty's Ministers, who have given me the most solemn assurances that every reparation in His Majesty's power will be made for the insults, which drove Lieutenant-Colonel Stannus from the Residency, that Mahomed ZeeJcee Khan has been fined in 40,000 Tomans, for his conduct on that occasion, and that Sheikh Hoossetn has, in the most positive manner, been interdicted from the exercise of any authority in the Government of Bushire. The tenor of the Firman which was a short time ago addressed by the Shah to his son, and of which I had the honour to forward to you a copy has, I doubt not, produced a salutary effect on the mind of that personage ; and probably led to the sudden alteration in the tone of his communications to the Kesident, In reply to the 3rd paragraph of No. 545, I beg leave to observe that the treaty concluded by Sir Gore Ausby with the Persian Government is no longer in force, the engagements which we entered into on that occasion having been abrogated by the subsequent arrangements made hy Messrs. Morier and Ellis. In the Treaty negotiated by these Gentlemen, and which is in Jact the only convention now existing letween the two States, it is stipulated as follows: &lt;f Should his Persian Majesty require assistance from the English Government in the Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. The expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Govern ment, and not enter other harbours without permission, except from absolute necessity. But whether these stimulations allude to European or Native Powers, it is impossible for me to decide. The Persian Government asserts that they have reference to both, and further say that they consider all the commercial engagements entered into by Sir InsMalcolm in 1801 as annulled by the compact of Messrs. Morier and Ellis, who quitted the country without carrying into effect their intention of forming a new Commercial Treaty. A note addressed by Mr, Ellis to Meerza Shefee, and to which no written reply was ever given, would appear in some measure to verify this interpretation, though I have, in all my official communications to this Court, invariably considered the engagements entered into by Sir InsMalcolm, relative to the commerce of the two countries, as still binding on both contracting parties. In answer to paragraphs 8 and 9 of No. 543,1 have to remark that any proposal to build a defensible Residency beyond the walls of Bushire would most probably be objected to by the Persian Government, on the same grounds formerly urged, and which afterwards led to the total destruction of the mansion, erected bv Captain Bruce, the walls of which were razed to the ground.256 Part VII—Chap. LIV. As tte unsettled state of the country would render it necessary that the new Kesidency should be made capable of defence, that circumstance alone would countenance any mis representation of our views, founded on the construction of such an edifice, and there is every reason to fear that any attempt of the local authorities to excite apprehension at Tehraun might under such circumstances prove successful. The jealousy which has at all times been openly manifested on this subject by the Court of Persia may be traced to the current belief that our vast Empire in India grew out of a like establishment. The story relates that having got permission to fortify a factory for the purposes of traffic, we gradually extended our influence and dominion at the expense of our allies, and however absurd it may seem to imagine that a similar course is contemplated at Bushire, an attempt to remove the impression, made by this idle tale, would perhaps rather tend to confirm it. In such a state of feeling therefore, on the part of this Court, I should not consider it advisable to agitate the question at this particular moment, since it might tend to give a colouring, if probability to the insinuations thrown out against us by the Sbii az Government, and there can be little doubt that the Sliah, if called upon to decide in such a proposition, would be guided by the opinion of the local authorities, to whom he would no doubt refer the business. There is certainly every material difference between the position of the Resident at Bushire and the mission at Tehraun vn. cases of application for protection. But there can be no doubt that in our relations with the authorities in Bagdad, Bussora and Bushire, as well as in the Levant, where our right is confirmed by positive capitulations, more emban-assment has arisen, more quarrels taken place, and more irritation been created, from our exercise of this privilege, than from any other source, and that were it practicable to do so, it would be extremely desirable to dispense with it in future. It has not happened that any case has occurred either at Tehraun, or at Tabreez, which could form a precedent for the guidance of Captain W ilson, since the British palaces at these places have fortunately not been considered by the Persians as an asylum against the vengeance of those in power, perhaps because no great political revolution has driven the people to seek for such protection. So far, however, as my judgment and experience go in such cases, I should feel inclined to suggest the interdiction of the Resident from all interference in the intestine quarrels of the different Chiefs, as well as from affordiug protection to persons, obnoxious to Government, provided such interdiction did not compromise the high name, honour, and generosity of the British nation, I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, Royal Camp at Karatuppa j The 8th July 1827, I. MACDONALD. 479. When the Shah heard of the recent events at Bushire, Hi8 Tolome 284 of 1827, page 680. de P uted Ali Murad Kb™. Golam Peshkedmut, to enquire into the griev ances of the British Residency. He had an interview with Captain 'Wilson on 1st August 1827, and the following is the substance of the conversation held by them. About 10 a.m . Ali Murad Khan called on the Resident and after the usual compliments had taken place on both sides, he produced the King of Persia's Pirman and mentioned the very high esteem His Majesty held Captain Wilson in. The Resident in reply expressed his satisfaction at the Shah's having appointed a person of his address and qualifications to visit Shiraz on the business mentioned on the firman; and trusted that everything would be arranged in a satisfactory manner. The Khan then entered into some particulars of the circumstances under which he had been first sent and stated that he was trusted with full powers to enforce the execution of every wish or desire the Resident might have. 480. Captain Wilson then opened the subject by asking in what light he viewed the insult which had been offered to the British Residency at Bushire by the dregs of the population of that place, and enquired, as Sheikh Abdul Rassul was about to return, what security there was that a similar outrage might not be perpetrated again. Ali Murad Khan replied that their conduct was most inexcusable and that with recard to the Sheikh he would, if the Resident so desired, speak to him in his presence and that of the Prince, andPart VII—Chap. LIV. 257 admonish him most seriously as to his future conduct, and that he would at the same time inform His Eoyal Highness that the Shah, so far from overlooking any improper conduct on the part of the Sheikh, would make him (the Prince) answerable for it. In answer to this offer, Captain Wilson begged to mention that he had hitherto received every civility from Sheikh Abdul Rassul and his bringing up the subject was simply to have matters placed on such a footing as would supersede the necessity of troubling His iioyal Highness in future, that he was far from wishing to insist on anything which mi&lt;,'ht be unpleasant to the feelings of the authorities at Shiraz, and that he considered it would be sufficient for the Khan to impress upon the Sheikh in a private interview the sentiments of His Majesty the Shah, with relation to the English. To a question from the .Resident as to what he conceived were the real feelings of the Court of Shiraz towards the British Residency, he replied that he thought they were friendly, but hinted that the attention which the Resident had lately received was principally owing to the measures he had adopted, and the letters he had written, previous to his departure from the north ; he continued to say that if Captain Wilson wished he would so arrange matters that the Prince should request a letter to the Shah, to the etl'ect that the Resident was perfectly satisfied with the recent conduct of himself and his Ministers; to this Captain Wilson replied that he would consider the subject. 481. The affair of the Plunder of the boats wrecked off Dashty was next introduced and the highly irregular conduct of the Chief of that coast in plundering, instead of affording assistance to the vessels lost in its neighbourhood, commented upon. The Khan said that he was perfectly ignorant of all matters relating to the sea, but had been informed that such had been the long established custom of the maritime inhabitants of Fars. In answer to an enquiry from him, touching our custom on such occasions, he was^ told that the cargo of any vessel belonging to a subject of Persi i, which might be wrecked on the coast of India, would he preserved and guarded with the greatest care. The Khan then asked what steps Captain Wilson wished taken respecting the bugla belonging to Sied Humza adding that he had authority to compel the Chief of Dashty to make restitution of all that had been taken from it if he was provided with a list of the cargo. In answer to this, the Resident briefly mentioned the terms the English were on with the inhabitants of Johanna, the manner in which the affair first commenced, the steps taken by the Shiraz Government in sending an officer to Dashty, his return without doing anything, and the narrow escape Sied Humza and the Resident's servant, who accompanied him, had from being poisoned, and concluded by saying there were still two free men belonging to Johanna, detained in that country whose release he was most desirous of procuring.^ The Khan then suggested that a letter should be written to the Prince as acknowledging the receipt of the Shah's firman and His Roval Highness's Ruckhum, and stating that Ali Murad Khan would communicate to him the particulars of the conversations he had held with the Resident on the above and other subjects. To this Captain Wil&gt;on assented. The Khan then continued to say tliat he had sent for J a snal Khan, and hoped to arrange the business in a satistactory manner. 482. In the course of conversation it was suggested by the Resident that effectual steps ought to be taken to prevent the duties of the Eahdaree being levied on the English and those individuals connected with them, as had latelv been done in two or three instances. With this the Khan fully agreed, and said he would take a written document from Mirza Ali Ukbar Kalunter, the Chief of the Customs and superior of all the Rahdars, declaring the exemption above mentioned in the most precise and positive terms; he also promised to procure a paper from Sheikh Abdul Rassul disclaiming all intention of interfering in any way with the merchants of Bushire, in the disposal or lading of their cargo upon any vessel, whether English or other, they might think proper, and that he would not compel them to embark their goods on his ships alone. Nothing further of any particular consequence was discussed, but the Khan was pro fuse in his protestations of the high degree of favor the Shah held Captain Wilson in, and which bo had afforded sufficient proof of, by his sending down a special messenger to Bushire to congratulate him on his arrival in the Gulf,258 Part VII—Chap. LIV. that His Eoyal Highness the Prince and his Ministers had been most particu larly enjoined to treat the Resident, as one of the nobles and persons in antbority in Persia, showing him every honor and respect in their power. The Khan soon after took his departure. Note delivered hy the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Ali Murad Khan, Golam Feshkhedmut of His Majesty the King of Persia. Having fully discussed in several conversations with you the various subjects noticed in the Firman I had the honour to receive from His Majesty the Shah, through your hands, it only remains for me now to give a short recapitulation of the most important points. %iid. —A distinct intimation is required to be given to the present Shaik of Bushire that all the rights and privileges hitherto enjoyed hy British subjects at Bushire are still fully guaranteed to them by Bis Majesty the Shah and Bis Boyal Bighness the Prince cf Fars, and the Shaik should be required to proclaim that the merchants and others have free permission to send their goods on board of English vessels, should they prefer to do so. The Shaik should likewise be required not to permit any person to molest messengers, who may be employed by the British authorities, or to prevent such from coming direct to the British Eesidency. 3rd. — Several recent circumstances as well as former occurrences render it particularly necessary that the Government of Fars should give new and specific instructions to its subordi nate authorities, positively enjoining that no radharee or gomcie or duties of any kind shall be levied on articles being conveyed through that country Jor the use of the English, and that on no pretence whatever should it be attempted to take more from persons attached to their teivice on the plea of their being so. 4^.—Respecting Seid Humza's people, boat and goods, and the British property on board of the boat, I have already communicated a detailed statement to ycu, and need not here repeat the earnest desire the British Government must naturally have to redeem the subjects cf a friendly power from slavery, and to recover as much of the property as mjiy be practicable. 5th. —In various parts of Fars, cossids and messengers, passing between the British authorities, have very frequently been detained, molested, the packets broken open, and on one occasion important despatches and letters were utterly destroyed and carried away ; it is requested that the Government of Fars may be pleased to direct its subordinate authorities to take such decided steps, as to prevent the possibility of such things again occurring, and that a privilege carefully preserved in all civilized countries to foreign authorities fhould not be infringed in Fars.

In August 1827 Commander John Betham had a fracas with Sheikh Nasir of Bushire, which might have Volume 284 of 1827, page 341. entailed unpleasant consequences but for that officer's promptitude and the Sheikh's timely yielding. The facts as narrated by Captain Betham himself in his letter, dated 29th August 1827, are as follows:— 484. Having obtained information on 28th August 1827 that a deserter from the Amherst was on board a bugalow in the Bushire Harbour, Captain Betham sent a midshipman with the cutter to take him out: he shortly after wards returned, complaining that the people of the bugalow had beaten the lascars of the Amherst and refused to give up the man. One Hadji Jassimwas then sent to the Sheikh with this information, and Captain Betham proceeded immediately afterwards himself with Maliomed Ali as Interpreter, but meeting with Hadji Jassim on the road, was informed that the Sheikh was not at home— consequently Captain Betham jumped into the boat and went to the bugalow fearing the deserter would otherwise make his escape, which in fact he did as they approached the vessel, together with the persons who had beaten the lascars. One of the men belonging to the bngalow was ordered into the boat, who voluntarily acknowledged that he knew where the deserter was secreted, and also that he knew the persons who had ill-used the lascars. Captain Betham therefore wished to have him as a witness before the Sheikh, and sent Mahomed Ally to Sheikh Nasir with his compliments to state what had occurred and to beg he would order the Amherst's man to be delivered up instantly. Instead of complying with this reasonable request, he beat Mahomed Ally in a most barbarous manner, and was nearly putting him to death ; he seized the Amhersfs Syrang, one of its lascars and the Nautilus tindal threw them into prison and threatened them with punishment. Captain Betham therefore sent his witness on board the Clive and informed the Sheikh that he would keep him until the deserter, who was a British subject, was delivered up and that unless he released the men forthwith, he should consider the Sheikh an enemy, and act accordingly and that without delay. This was refused, whereupon Captain Betham immediately ordered the Inspector to join the Clive and Nautilus, which order was promptly obeyed. He also desired his boats to be sent on shore armed and the gun to be got into the launch to protect him in case any attempt should be made to prevent his embarkation, which from the insolent messages he had received from the Sheikh, he thought not unlikely. Captain Betham then intimated to the Sheikh that unless he obtained satisfaction for the gross insult offered the flag within two hours he would proceed to his ship, sink the Homani, a Persian ship, and do his utmost to destroy all the Sheikh's vessels. At this time the British boats had reached the shore and the Sheikh became a little sobered in his judgment, seeing that the British Commander should probably carry his resolution into effect, and consented to release our men and Mahomed Ally also, and to send a lascar (a British subject) in lieu of the deserter until he could be found. Captain Betham agreed to this arrangement, but stated that he would only wait half an hour longer on shore for them. He waited rather more than the specified time and then embarked, when they brought the men down to the beach with Mahomed Ally. He then returned, and the matter was thus far adjusted. The Sheikh promised to satisfy Mahomed Ally. The latter refused to go, in fact his eyes had both been nearly knocked out. This man had served the English for the last twenty years and had committed no other fault than going with him as interpreter. 2 L »260 Part VII—Chap. LV. 485. The following letter was addressed by the Resident to Captain Betham on 8th September 1827:— 2. The proceedings you detail in your letter are of too important a nature to be hastily investigated at a distance, or indeed even to be thoroughly understood, but in the meantime I have most particularly to request that you will, in all your proceedings, bear in mind the peculiar alliance that exists between the British Government and that of Persia, to which Bushire is subject. 3. As much irritation seems to exist in the mind of Shaik Nasir, I have likewise to request that you will not hold any further communication with him or Shaik Abdul Russul on the subject of the late past events, which will be duly enquired into.Part VII—Chap. LVI. 261 CHAPTER LVI. SHEIKH ABDUL RASSIL SEERS BRITISH PROTECTION, 1838. 486. In his letter, dated 8th January 1828, the Resident reported to the Bombay Government that Sheikh Volume 315 of 1828. Abdul Ea ^sul had sent him through the Mirza of the Residency a particular message. Sheikh Abdul Rassul was desirous of expressing before the Resident and several other individuals his extreme anxiety to connect himself in the closest manner possible with the British Government, to consider himself in future as belonging to it, and to be looked upon by it as one of its dependants; the Sheikh wished at the same time to enter into any engagements with the Resident and the Government that the Resident might consider expedient, that being particularly desirous that this proposition should not be made public, the Sheikh would write a letter to the Governor of Bombay to say that whatever communication the Resident might make to him touching the above subject was to be considered as if from the Sheikh himself, and that any answer which Sir John Malcolm should send could be communicated to the Sheikh verbally. The Resident believed that this move of the Sheikh was entirely sponta neous, and doubtless arose from his fears of what might happen in the event of Russia choosing to assume a decided influence in Persia, which the Sheikh seemed to consider entirely at the option of that Power. 487A. The Resident returned an answer to following effect:— The Resident had received the Sheikh's message. There was no necessity for any fresh assurance on the part of the Sheikh of his friendly feeling towards the British Government, as the Resident was aware of the Sheikh's attach ment to its ancient ally the King of Persia, between whom and it there existed the closest connection by treaty. 487E. On the delivery of this message the Sheikh observed that he was aware of the connection that existed between the British Government and the King of Persia, who of course was his master, and towards whom he could never for a moment think of changing; all he meant was to show how friendly he was inclined, and devoted to the British Government. The Resident also forwarded a letter to the address of the Hon'ble the Governor, sent by the Sheikh for translation, of the contents of which letter he was not aware, but he had little doubt of its relating to.the subject above mentioned, as the Sheikh seemed deeply interested in the present posture of affairs in Persia. He called on the Resident personally and again brought the subject forward by alluding to the message which he intimated he had sent by the Mirza. Captain Wilson observed that he had received it and that any further assurance of his friendly feelings were quite superfluous. The Sheikh then alluded to misunderstandings that had existed between him and former Residents, and expressed his earnest desire to be on the best terms possible with Captain Wilson, who then assured him that he was in the same manner perfectly well disposed towards him, and dropped the conversation. 487C. The Resident observed that he conceived the immediate object of the Sheikh had probably been answered by his making this communication to the Government, that the Sheikh would thereafter, either deny totally or refer confidently to what had passed, just as might be convenient, but that the Sheikh probably considered it safe policy at all events to be recognized as on a friendly footing with the British Government, towards which many in that part of Persia then looked, conceiving it deeply interested in the war carried on with Russia, and by no means unlikely to take an active part in the contest. 488. The views of the Governor in Council were expressed in their letter, dated 1st February 1828 : The Governor in Council directs me to return the letter unopened, and to request that an earlyjopportunity be taken to convey it back to the Sheikh, thatlhe Governor will be delighted to receive every open mark of the Sheikhas friendship to the British Government, and of his personal regard for him, as one long acquainted with his family j no communication can be262 Part VII—Chap. LVI. received under circumstances that lead to a supposition it is inconsistent with the Sheikh's duty to his immediate superior, the King of Persia, the ally of the British Government, \ou will at the same time assure the Sheikh that no displeasure is mixed with this proceeding which is adopted merely from principles of action in such matters from which the Government cannot depart. You will also be pleased to inform the Sheikhjthat with the resolution this Government has adopted to preserve inviolate its friendship with the King of Persia and which it is particularly necessary to observe at this moment, there would be a hazard to him if any letter of Irs were opened and answered that had the most distant allusion to the proposition made to you, for it might, if information of it reached the Persian Government, expose him to its resentment, and the Governor in Council could grant him no support, even by remonstrance, without incurring suspicions of having given him encouragement. The Governor in Council directs me to add that no letters should be forwarded from the Sheikh of Bushire, or any other Persian Chief, the contents of which you are not acquainted with, that you may be able to judge of the propriety of transmitting them.'s) Part VII—Chap. LVII. 263 CHAPTER IVII. FEUD BETWEEN TIJirR MIRZ4 AND SHEIKH ABDLL R4SSUL. INTERFERENCE OF THE IMAM OF MA8RAT. 1830-31. 489. In a letter dated 19th May 1880 to the Resident the Imam of 47 Maskat stated that he expected some Voium® ^ of 1830. trouble between Timur Mirza and Sheikh Abdul Rassal, and the former would probably ask for his assistance in ships. The Imam requested to be advised by the Resident on the matter. Major Wilson wrote in reply— That the Firmun Firmah of Tars had given Cazerun and all the country between that place and Bushire into the hands of Sheikh Abdul Rassul, and was said to have given Icklad, Izardwhost and Bowanat to his son Prince Timur Mirza, and the Wazir of Pars Mirza Mahomed Ali was at Bushire settling this affair. The Resident did not think that it would in any way be advantageous for the Imam to send ships to assist Prince Timur. Such an action would only create a great deal of confusion and would do much harm to His Hlghness's name, for there was not any sufficient reason that could be given for such a warlike proceeding on his part, in favour of a person who was not the Chief of that country. The Kesident further assured His Highness that he has always taken the greatest interest in his concerns, and never on any occasion had offered advice that he did not believe would be for His Higbness's benefit. 489A, 'We find, however, the Imam of Maskat still continuing to meddle v i ttit « 00 , in the affairs of Bushire. He appears to Volume VII of 1831, , ... . ^ — JT.* . have written to the rirman iirma at Shiraz proposing that Sheikh Abdul Rassul should be removed from Bushire, and that one of his (Prince Governor's) sons appointed Governor of Bushire (see translation of a letter from the Prince of Pars to the Imam), For getting rid of the Sheikh of Bushire, however, the Prince of Fars was anxious to secure the aid of the Imam's ships at Bushire. When the Resident learnt of these intrigues he strongly remonstrated against the Imam's meddling in Persian affairs, pointed out to him that he had on behalf of His Highness only recently recovered all the dues from the Sheikh of Bushire (20,000 krans).* 489B. The Governor of Bombay also wrote to the Imam to the following effect:— a Intelligence of the unfriendly disposition of Your Highness towards the Sheikh of Bushire having been transmitted to this Government by Major Wilson, and I am induced, as a sincere friend to Your Highness, very strongly to advise you against any rupture with that Chief as also * agaimt interfering with the affairs of Fars or of any province of Persia. It is the interest of Your Highness to cultivate peace as much as possible, and only to have recourse to war when your own safety is endangered, or the safety of those who are really your friends. The Sheikh of Bushire has satisfied all your demands so you have no reason to declare war against him; but should Your Highness be so wrought on by the counsels of those who wish only to aggrandize themselves, and are not at heart your friends. Your Highness cannot expect to be assisted by this Government in the way you were lately, when the Arab tribes meditated an attack upon your territories. You are an old friend and ally of this Government, who wish nothing more than your prosperity and rejoice to see you succeed in any honourable enterprise, but in this which is against all prudence, I am sure you will meet with misfortune. ,J ♦ As regards the advice given by the Bombay Goreinment in respect of his claims against Bahrein, sae Chapter XLI—A.

PERSIAN CLAm FOR BRITI81I I]\ T TERVEXTIO\ AGAINST MARITIME AGGRESSION m THE PERSIAN COAST. 490. In his despatch No. 77» dated 26th December 1832, the Kesident, „, „ „, „ Captain Blane, reported that since the Volume 33—goo o 183., p. 28. assumption of the Government of the Town of Bushire by His Eoyal Highness the Prince Reza Kuli Mirza he had received several complimentary Rukhums from His Royal Highness's father, the Prince of Shiraz, requiring of him to co-operate in the settlement of the affairs of the port and to take upon himself the prevention of any aggression by sea. 491. In reply the Resident acknowledged their receipt explaining upon each occasion that he was prohibited Jrom any interference in the affairs of Persia and restricted hy his instructions from the adoption of any active measures in a contest of the description of that which had arisen with the family of the late Sheikh of Bushire. 492. Prom a late Kukhum received this explanation would not, however, appear to have met with the full concurrence of His Royal Highness, and the Resident therefore submitted a copy with translation of it as likewise of his reply in order that the Governor in Council might be fully aware of the tenor of the communication which had taken place. Translation of a Rukum from His Royal Highness the Prince of Fars to the Resident in the Persian Qulf, dated Rajah or December 1832. Honored by our kindness know that you being one of the servants of the powerful (English) Government, and it being right that we should countenance them according 1 to their several ranks we have now favored you with this Rukum. It is not perhaps concealed from you that after the establishment of a firm amity between the two mighty States (which has not been shaken on either side for a series of years and never will be so by those who are attached to them) it was settled among other articles that in the event of any persons creating confusion upon the seas, the English authorities should forthwith punish and root them out. At this time, however, when certain evil disposed characters have commenced disturbing the peace of the Gulf and committing various acts of aggression, you, whose duty it was to put an end to such proceedings and to acquaint your Government of the same, have purposely over looked them. We are indeed at a loss to understand why you should ba^re chosen to neglect what was established between the two States, and why you have not used every exertion to destroy this tribe. It is therefore incumbent upon you on the receipt and perusal of this Rukum that you explain the reason for our information, otherwise your remissness in carry ing into effect that which was arranged between the two Governments will remain unexpli- cable. Accordingly it is necessary that, acting in a different manner from formerly, you should use every exertion towards the destruction of the evil disposed (who are creating confusion upon the seas) and the adjustment of affairs in that quarter. Consulting therefore the Ministers and advisers of my son the Naib oollyala you will take measures to settle the concerns of the merchants and to re-establish order in the Gulf. Copy of a letter to His Royal Highnets the Prince of Fars, from the Resident in the Persian Gulf in reply. After compliments. —With reference to your Royal Highness 's expression of dissatisfac tion with my conduct, I lament that it should have been viewed in such a light because I am not conscious of having failed in any respect to the extent of the authority which I possess and have several times represented to your Royal Highness that I am entirely bound by the instructions received from the Bombay Government and cannot interfere in any foreign matters without their express permission. As regards the Treaties in existence between the two States it is certain that no disregard of them ever has taken place or can occur, but on this head the Envoy is the constituted medium of communication, and I am not only without authority, but actually forbidden to enter into any discussion on the subject. In thus explaining my?elf with the distinctness which 1 have deemed incumbent upon me, I feel that I stand in much need of your Royal Highness's indulgence.Uik) Part VII—Chap. LIX. 265 CHAPTER LIX EXPULSION OF PRINCE REZ V Rl'LI JIIKZ4 AUD APPOINT MENT OF PRINCE i nil U MIKZA TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BIISIIIRE, 1833. 493. Soon after a revolution occurred at Bushire. Prince Eeza Kuli 'H M' * — . Xr I il ^ m Li &lt; &lt;-&gt; «• 1 ^i/-v ^4- the autbority vested in the hands of Jemal Khan Bushire'* supported by the Chiefs of the neighbouring districts of Dashlistun and Tungistun. 494. The immediate cause of this rebellion against Prince Reza appears to have been the disgust occasioned by the conduct of His Royal Highness's mother, who during a late visit, rendered herself particularly obnoxious by her exertions in the introduction of unpopular measures for the increase of the revenues of the Bushire Government and the seizure of the Chief of *' Borazgun' in execution of the said object led to the explosion of this feeling into open insurrection. 496. On the evening of the 14th April 1833, a large body of the armed followers of the Chief surrounded the Palace of His Royal Highness and having released the prisoner, threatened to proceed to extremities unless His Royaf Eighness consented to leave the town early the next morning. Having in vain attempted to appease them and finding that he had no adherents upon whom he could depend, he was compelled to accede to the terms required of him and went out accordingly accompanied only by a few of his own personal attendants. The ladies of His Royal Highness were likewise permitted to take their departure a few days after so soon as mules could be obtained for the transport of their Tuekti-rowan and baggage. Considerable alarm regard ing the sequel to these revolutionary proceedings prevailed amongst the merchants and other peaceful inhabitants of the town. 496. Referring to the expulsion of Prince Reza Kuli Khan from Bushire, the Prince of Shiraz wrote in May 1833 to the Resident to say that the perpe trators of the crime having expressed their sincere sorrow for their fault and prayed for the appointment of His the Royal Highness's son Prince limur Mirza to the Government of Bushire, His Highness was pleased to comply with this request and asked the Resident to meet the wishes of his son in all respects. The Resident (Mr. Blane) replied:— ' Your Royal Highness is aware from the representations which I have already transmitted that I am bound by instructions and without power in matters of this nature. Nevertheless, confiding in Your Royal Highnesses penetration, I have a full hope that things ^will not so happen as to cause any diminution towards me of \ our Royal Highness s favour. 497. The Bombay Government approved of these proceedings of the Resi- 498. His Royal Highness Timur Mirza had in the interim been admitted into the* town on the alleged conditions of his bringing few attendants and of his retiring after a short stay and leaving the government in the hands ot his infant son or some other nominal representative. The number of his followers was stated however to be gradually increasing and symptoms of disunion having shewn themselves amongst the insurgent Khans, it was not expected that their power would be of long continuance. 499. His Royal Highness the Prince Timur Mirza, in observance of his promise, however took his departure from Bushire on 29th June leaving two persons of rank, Mirza Ali Khan and Tamasp Kuh Khan, as his representatives during his absence. By this arrangement little real alteration was made in the power and influence previously assumed by Jumal Khan of Bushire and his supporters the Chiefs of the powerful tribes of Dashtistun and Tan^istun. Subsequently however the conduct of the latter Chief appears to have excited the suspicions of his associates, and on the morning of the l^t Resident's No. 16, dated 23rd April 1833. Volume 33—609 of 1833, p. 76. Mirza, son of Farman Farmah, Prince of Fars, who had been recently appointed Governor of Bushire, was expelled and dent.266 Part VII—Chap. LIX. August 1833 he was put to death, while attending at the place of public assem bly, by his rival the Chief of Dashti. Hossain Kuli Khan of Angali, one of his adherents, was likewise killed and another severely wounded. The rest of his followers sought refuge in the British Residency which prevented further bloodshed, and the Resident subsequently obtained the consent of the opposite party to this despatching them, a part by land and a part by sea, to their own homes, 500. A blcod feud of the most inveterate description was thus created between these tribes, of which, whatever may be the final result, the immediate effect could not be otherwise than to increase the alarm and insecurity of the peaceable inhabitants of this town. 501. Shortly subsequent to the murder of the Tangistun Chief Mirza All Khan, the deputy of His Royal Highness Timur jVIirzci becume so much alarmed for his life that he sought refuge in the house of the Kazi, but distrustful even of the sanctity of that abode, about 10 a.m . on the'19th August he fled to the British Residency and claimed its protection. He had entered so dressed as to avoid all suspicion of his real character and finding him determined not to return, the Resident obtained by signals a boat from the H. C. Sloop of War Ternate and fortunately eot him on board before any difficulties could be raised. 502. On the morning of the 20th the Prince's troops appeared before the town and the party inside having failed in their attempts to open a negotia tion commenced their preparations for escape by sea. They had previously spoken very boldly of their determination to defend the walls but were taken by^ surprise with reference to the strength of the opposing force. A few individuals stationed in the towers deterred the assailants from entering during the daylight, but shortly after dusk in the evening they advanced and finding no opposition quickly passed through the town to the sea shore in hopes of overtaking some of the fugitives. The last of their boats had however got out of reach and no one remained to prolong the contest or to gratify their revenge. 503. The Prince Reza Kuli Mirza, Timur Mirza and Nusrulla Mirza who were present with the camp and forward in entering the town used great exertions to prevent its being plundered and their endeavours were attended with complete success, ihe houses which had been occupied by the rebel Chiefs formed the only exceptions, and the sole loss of life 'hitherto sustained was occasioned by a party of the langistunis busied m searching the house of Jumal Khan at Bushire having unfortunately thrust a light into some jars of gunpowder, the explosion of which proved fatal to eight 5 of their men. 504. Jumal Khan of Bushire despatched his family and property on board the Feizrahana % a Maskat ship which had arrived from Bussora a few days previously and was anchored in the outer roads, with the intention of following them so soon as circumstances might admit. It appeared that the Dashti Chief secured him at the last instant with a view to eventually giving hiy n up as a means of obtaining terms for himself and the feelings of the Princes were so inveterate against the said Khan that they would no doubt make great sacrifices to get him intc their power. The more general belief was however that he succeeded in getting on board the above ship and had proceeded in her to Maskat. 505 f In the hurry of departure some of the Dashti tribe were left behind, of whom a few have found refuge in the Residency. Others were dispersed about the town and the Tangistunis were searching for them to sacrifice to their blood feud, but their places of concealment having hitherto evaded dis covery it is to be hoped they may eventually escape.Part VII—Chap. LX. 267 CHAPTER IX. REMOVAL OF SHEIKH KASIR AAD HIS REINSTATEMENT AS GOVERNOR OF BUSHIRE, NOVEMBER 1830. 506. Soon after these eyents we find Sheikh Nasir, son of Sheikh Abdul Kassul as Governor of Bushire. 507. In his letter No. 90 of 9th November 1837, the Resident, however, reported that Sheikh Nasir the Governor Volume 84—968 of 1837-1838, p. 236. proceeded to Shiraz on the 22nd September with the view, as generally believed, of inducing the Shiraz Government to allow him to postpone the payment of certain arrears due by him, and, if possible, to procure a reduction of the sum in which he was assessed. 608. After various reports sometimes favourable, at other times adverse, as to the progress of his affairs, and his hopes of being reinstated in his Gov ernment, the matter appeared to be at last decided by the arrival in Bushire on the Ist instant of a person named Mirza Mahomed Riza, representing him self to be invested with the Government of the place, full powers to examine into the affairs of Sheikh Nasir and his treatment towards those who had been subject to his authority and also to call to his aid the adjoining tribes should any opposition be offered to his placing himself in a position to exercise the functions of his office. 509. Previous however to the Mirza's arrival at Bushire the extent of his authority and power were not well known, and ostensibly he was only the bearer of an honorary dress for Sheikh Abdulla the Acting Governor but the Sheikh, as well as the other relation of Sheikh Nasir, looked upon the Khelat, and the ceremonies that must have been gone through on his being invested with it, as a mere scheme for getting possession of his person, and sending him a prisoner to Shiraz. This he therefore determined to guard against, also, if possible, hold his position and with this view, on hearing of Mirza Mahomed Hiza's approach, he endeavoured to collect a few of the Eeni Ilajar tribe and people of Rohilla, as those best disposed towards his family, with the intention of opposing his entrance into the place ; but either the call was disregarded, or it having been discovered that the Mirza was supported by the Chiefs of the Tangistun and Damuk tribes, both unfriendly, if not inimical to Sheikh Nasir, any attempt at resistance was considered useless, and all thoughts of it relinquished. 510. Accordingly Sheikh Abdulla and his brother Sheikh Hussain with a few attendants (their families having been already sent to the island of Karrak as a place of security) embarked on the 1st instant on board their vessels consisting of two Batils, one Bugla and one Begarah manned with about fifty individuals, and lying at anchor in Bushire roads. Ihe Sheikhs however in thus leaving the place did so with great reluctance and would still willingly entertain hopes of regaining their position, and with a view to this object! and the idea, however, ill-judged, of effecting the liberation of Sheikh Nasir, who was now supposed to be a prisoner at Shiraz, they determined to molest the trade of the port by levying a tax (a blockade with their force not bein 01 thought of) on such vessels as might wish to enter, and thus render unproductive this source of income to the Shiraz Goveinment, In pursuance of this scheme they intended to send one or more of their vessels and intercept the Colonel Nexcall, which was known to be near at hand. On this the Resident addressed a note to Sheikh Abdulla, (1) intimating to him that this could not be permitted, and also recommending as a friend to release some boats which were said to be detained by him. On the occasion a letter (2) was also addressed to Commodore Pepper requesting that the movements of the fcheikh s vessels mi^ht be watched ; for however desirable it might be to avoid all direct into ference, and if possible keep on friendly terms with all parties, it was con sidered desirable to protect the property of British subjects and vessels sailing under the British flag as in the instance of the Colonel NetDall.268 Part VII— Chap.

The policy which the British were disposed to pursue in regard to Volume 78-968 of 1838-39. inter-tribal disputes on the coast of Fars can be judged from the correspondence printed below:— (i) Alleged seizure of Towanah boat by the people of Chartah. Sultan bin Saggar's proposal to interfere. Translation of a letter from Saltan bin Saggar.to the Resident, dated the 2nd February 1839. You are aware that in all cases where either my subjects or dependents are injured or oppiessed by others, it is incumbent upon me, for the due preservation of my reputation, to rise up and punish the aggressors; but as I wish to do nothing without your concurrence, I now be^ to acquaint you, that the inhabitants of Tuwana are our relatives and friends, descended from the same tribe and the same kindred, and have like the people of Jjingah always been closely united with us, and although occasionally trifling causes of complaint mi^ht arise between us, yet these have scarcely interrupted the connection so long subsisted. Now you must know that at the present time the people of Charrack have surprised and seized a small foit called Nukul Ameer belonging to l awonah, although these two places were then at peace. As soon as the complaints of the latter reached me my^ first intention was to assemble all my friends both in Pars and Oman and proceed to their assistance, but as I do not like to embark in any proceeding which may appear doubtful to you, I have considered it necessary to acquaint you with this affair. This is a very serious matter to us, and I am sure that it will lead to formidable results. I have therefore to request that you will kindly do one or the two things, viz., either to send a person to the people of Charrack with a recom mendation to restore the fort and desist from such irregular proceedings for the future, or el&gt;e that you will abstain from all interference, and permit me to assist my friends in obtain ing satisfaction. For God's sake adopt one or other of these alternatives, I nm guided in all my actions by your will. My subjects and dependents are injured and oppressed both in Oman and Pars, as if I did not possess the means and power of punishing the aggressors. In former days all the inhabitants of Fars and Oman were afraid of my power, but now that they see that I am guided by the views of the Sirkar, every one behaves just as he pleases towards me. I beg to be favoured by an early reply. Draft of a letter from the Resident to the Snltan bin Saggar, dated the 2nd March 1837. Your letter of the 25th Shewal has been received and its contents understood. Touching the dispute between the people of Charrack and Tawanah, I understand that the affair has been settled by the interference of Ahmed Khan the Chief of Rustuk, You must however be aware that under any circumstances the British Government cannot permit the Arabian Chiefs to interfere themselves in the internal quarrels and dissensions of the residents on the coast of Fars. The inhabitants of Tawanah, Charrack and Lingah are all subjects of Persia, and if they conceive that they are aggrieved by their neighbours, it is proper that they should refer their cases to their own Government for redress, as long as they choose to reside in the Persian Territory, they must be subject to the laws of that country, nor can their friends on the Arabian side of the Gulf be permitted to interfere in any way in their intestine disputes. This system has always been acted upon, and although not long ago. Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Roshid ol Amulgovin wished to take troops over to Charrack to assist the Chief of that place, he was not permitted to do so, Yon will therefore see the propriety of abstaining from all interference, as you may rest assured that if you attempt to send over a force to the Persian Coast for the purpose of assisting thp people of Tewanah, that you will incur the displeasure of the British Government.

This person who is the ' Zabit '' of Asseloo has, contrary to former established rule and custom, sent oat vessels to sea, and captured and plundered several boats belonging to a faithful subject of Persia named Sheikh Joobarah the ' Zabit ' of Congoon which he has subsequently sold for a large sum to the Arabs of Oman, viz., the Beneyas tribe. Apparently it is not unknown to Your Royal Highness that the British Government has for many years past kept up a naval force in the Gulf of Persia at very heavy expense, for the sole purpose of maintaining the safety of the lines of traffic, and the suppression of piracy and aggressions upon the property of others, in order that both the inhabitants on the coasts^ as well as the voyagers on the seas, might be enabled to carry on their several occupations of trade and commerce, and earn their subsistence in peace and safety. Certainly, from the presence of the Government cruisers in this Gulf the seaports of Persia have benefited in a very great degree in two respects. Firstly, from the general protection thus given at sea. Secondly, from aggressions being put an end to and redress afforded to their inhabitants in cases where their vessels and property have been plundered by pirates and evil disposed persons. As a sufficient proof of this I would refer Your Royal Highness to the occurrences which took place three years ago, when a number of vessels with a large amount of property and goods belonging to merchants of this country were captured and plundered by the Beneyas tribe. Upon the occasion of these outrages, the vesfels and cargoes in question having been recovered by the British Government from that tribe, were restored to the respective owners, and the guilty parties visited with condign punishment. Sheikh Khulfan of Asseloo is however on close terms of friendship with this tribe of the Beneyas, and it is to be apprehended that if he acts in the manner he has done, the evil disposed among them, and the Joasmees, etc. etc., will make the pretext of affording assistance to either party the cover for committing every species of excess and aggression upon the vessels belonging to the Persian Coast, and as the part of the sea where Shaik Khulfan sends out his boats to attack those of bongoon is directly in the track of the Bushire vessels coming from India, it is to be feared that if the irregular proceedings of that person be not checked and punished, the trade of the Persian ports may be injured. I have written to Sheikh Khulfan upon the subject of this letter, and have been informed by him in reply that both Sheikh Joobarah and himself had been summoned to the presence of Your Royal Highness, in order that the matter should be inquired into. It is however well known that although Sheikh Joobarah has obeyed the summons of Your Royal Highness and proceeded to Shiraz, Sheikh Khulfan has no intention whatever of doing so or even of quitting Asseloo. I feel however quite assured, that Your Eoyal Highness will not permit your authority to be thus treated with contempt by an inferior defendent, but that Your Royal Highness will take measures for enforcing the attendence of the Asseloo Chief at Shiraz and punishing him according as you may see fit, for having dared without any permission from Your Royal Highness to disturb for the tranquillity of the Persian Gulf. S. Hennell, Officiating Retident in the Persian Gulf, Translation of a Rnkem from His Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz to Captain 8. Hennell, Officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated Suffur 1254 or May 1838. Be it known to the high in rank and dignity Mr, Hennell, the Resident of the English Government, that his friendly representation has been received, and the degrees of faithfulness and loyalty of that exalted in the estimation of the two mighty Governments have been understood. 'With reference to the aggression of Sheikh Khulfan, upon Sheikh Joobarah Khan, which was represented, the truth is, that the tenor of both the representation, and the letter was contrary to the custom of the friendship of the two powerful States, and opposed to the understanding and faithfulness of that high in station, because the two Shaiks and the two ports with relation to this established Government are as one, and the oppression of either towards the other, if true, is contrary to regulation. In the fortunate presence,* and those • viz. the Shah. ordered for the service of the frontier, the rule over sea and land is the same and it is apparent that whenever any of the subjects or Governors be oppressed, and make representa tion, the oppressor will be subject to punishment and retribution, without the necessity of foreign assistance.Part VII—Chap. LXII. 271 CHAPTER IXII. THE CASE OF THE VESSEL CALLED 'COLONEL flEWALL', 1838. 517. The Resident at Bushire in his letter No. 71, dated 31st August 1838, requested the instructions of the Governor in Council, with reference to the following circumstances. In 1838, a vessel called the Colonel Newall nominally the property of a Mogul merchant residing in Bombay named Haji Mirza Sheffi, and carrying a British pass and colours, brought up a cargo to Bushire. During her stay in the port, a negotiation was opened between Sheikh Nasir (the then Governor) and Mullah Mahomed (a native of the place), the Nakhoda or Commander, for the purchase of half the vessel in question, which half was very generally believed to belong to himself. How far the bargain was concluded, there was no means of ascertaining, but the sum of 15^000 Sahib Heruns was paid into the hands of Mullah Mahomed by the Sheikh, and taken down on board the Colonel Newall to Bombay. Upon the return of this vessel to the Gulf a few months after, a claim was made by Mirza Abbas Ali, the then Governor of Bushire, on behalf of the Shiraz authorities, upon Mullah Mahomed, for either half of the barque, or the 15,000 Heruns received from the Sheikh Nasir, upon the plea that the latter personage had fled from Bushire, carrying with him a large portion of the revenues of the place. Mullah Mahomed upon this denied having had any intention of disposing of part of the Colonel Newall, but that at the request of Sheikh Nasir, he carried the money down to Haji Mahomed Sheth the owner, and lodged it in his hands, leaving it to the Haji whether he would accept the offer made or not. Mullah Mahomed, however, was a person whose word could never be relied upon and there was no doubt he did bargain with the Sheikh for the sale of half the vessel. The Colonel Newall was now at Basrah, but there was no doubt that if she Instructions requested as to how far the returned to Bushire and Mullah Mahomed Nakhoda w a8 entitled to our protection. landed, that an attempt would be made by the authorities there to seize and detain him until he either gave up half his vessel or paid over the 15,000 Heruns received from Sheikh Nasir. Under these circumstances, the question was as to what degree of protection Mullah Mahomed could claim from the Residency, as it was obvious that had he not embarked in what appeared an illegal, or at least irregular transaction, in receiving a sum of money from a foreigner for the secret purchase of part of a vessel ostensibly belonging to a British port and carrying British colours, he would never have been involved in the predicament in which he now stood. Had the Commander and crew of the Colonel Newall been English subjects, the case would have been much more simple, but unfortunately both one and the other were natives of Bushire, and it was doubtful whether there was a single British subject on board the vessel; the consequence of this was that although Mullah Mahomed by remaining on board might be safe in his own person, yet the families and connections of both himself and crew were quite at the mercy of the Persian authorities. The points on which the Resident wished to be instructed upon were. Particular points upon which instructions firstly, whether Mullah Mahomed was were requested, entitled to the same protection as a British subject commanding a British vessel, secondly, whether he was legally liable to be called upon by the local authorities for a sum of money received by hira from Sheikh Nasir, while that person was Ruler of Bushire, upon the bare assertion of the Persian Government that he had made away with a portion of its revenues; and thirdly, whether in the event of its being decided that he was to be protected against this claim, whether the same protection was to be extended to his family and relations who by the barbarous practice of the country were all liable to be seized, punished, and stripped off everything in the absence of the offending party. 518. The Government how ever were of opinion that the best course would be to advise the owner of the vessels of the risk he would incur by bringing it to Bushire, while the claim on question was hanging over him (letter Ko. 1832, dated 25th September 1838).272 Part VII—Chap.

In the month of May 1838, a bn^la under Arab colours, named Summary, Totome 966 of 1838-1841. Puteh-ul-Ruhman belonging to Obid Ali of Maskat, with a valuable cargo on board from Bombay, got aground and swamped near An jar, on the Island of Kisbm. Her Nakhoda immediately engaged a boat to take a messenger to Bunder Abbas, for the purpose of requesting the aid of Syef ben Nubban the Governor of that port. When Sheikh Abdul Rahman of Kishm heard of what had taken place, he detained the boat with the messenger while on her way to Bunder Abas j and, with a body of about 1,000 menj proceeded by land to the spot, where the wreck was. 520. Upon reaching the ground, Sheikh Abdul Rahman sent off a party of his men on board the wrecked bugla, lying about 100 paces from the shore, for the purpose of taking possession of her; and having summoned the jNakboda, he compelled him by threats to give a paper promising half the cargo as salvage. After this, the Sheikh is said to have taken possession of a large portion of goods, which had been safely landed by the crew of the buWa prior to his arrival and to have caused the greater part of the boxes and cases so saved to be broken up and their contents mixed together, so as to prevent the legitimate owners from recognising their own property. ou 1 *! ? n tlie ^■ u ^ ust a vessel named Mombassa belono-ino- to the Sheikh of Kishm arrived at Busbire, with a portion of the cargo saved from tne ruten-ul-Runman for the purpose of being made over to the owners Upon enquiry, Captain Hennell, the Resident in the Persian Gulf was informed that the goods restored by the Sheikh did not even amount to a sixth part of the original cargo, the whole of which, with the exception of some sugar, was believed to have been recovered from the wreck, and a larffe portion of which was insured by British subjects in Bombay. 0 622.^ As the conduct of Sheikh Abdul Rahman on this occasion appeared to Captain Hennell so shamefully irregular, and as he was a dependant of the Imam of Maskat, that officer in his letter dated the 18th August 1838 recommended to Government the expediency of making a formal demand upon the authorities of that place, for the portion of the cargo insured by and lond-fide the property of, British subjects, or its value and in the event of their pleading their inability to compel the Sheikh, either to restore the one or make good the other. Captain Hennell was of opinion that this demand should be enforced against the Sheikh himself (as soon as the squadron was rendered availnble by the settlement of our relations with Persia) by blockad ing bis port of Kishm, or by taking possession of his vessels. 523. Captain Hennell was on the 15th September 1838 informed that Government concurred in the view taken by him of this case, and the proprietv of adopting (when the proper period arrived) the measures suggested by him for the recovery of the plundered property. Captain Hennell addressed a letter to His Highness ' Syed Suwany,' the Acting Governor of Maskat on the subject of the irregular proceedings of Sheikh Abdul Rahman in order to know whether His Highness would take upon himself to realize such portion of the cargo seized by the Sheikh, as was bond-fide the property of, or had been insured by, British subjects. His Highness in reply informed Captain Hennell tha t he had given orders to the Kishm Sheikh to restore the property in question which the latter in a separate communication also promised to do. 524. In the month of April 1839, Captain Hennell instructed Lis Assistant Lieutenant Edmunds, then on a yisit to the Arabian Coast, to touch atPart VII—Chap. LXIII. 273 Kishm, and brinsr away the insured carso of the Futeh-ul-Euhmm, in the possession of the Sheikh of that port, leaving the balance of our demand against him on that account for future adjustment. From Lieutenant Edmund's report, dated the ISth May 1839, it appeared that the Sheikh had only given up eight boxes and four bundles on account of the property insured, although there was every reason to believe that the whole of it, consisting of fourteen cases of Madras piece-goods, valued at £113,000 and a bundle of long- cloths at H600, fell into his hands, together with a large proportion of the rest of the cargo of the wrecked bugla. 525. In his letter dated the 2nd October 1838 Captain Hennell reported that a portion of the restored goods had been sold at Karrak, and had realized 10,250 Mahomed Shah Rupees. His Highness the Imaum having in the interim returned to Maskat from Zanzibar, Captain Hennell was instructed by Government to address His Highness on the subject of obtaining redress for the outrage committed by his dependant, the Chief of Kishm, on the occasion of the wreck of the Bugla Futeh-ul-Buhnian. 526. In his letter dated the 14th December 1838, Captain Hennell reported that at an interview which he had with the Imam, His Highness evinced great reluctance to compel the Kishm Sheikh to settle the claims upon him, on account of remaining portion of tbe property seized by him from the wrecked bugla and added that, from what he had personally observed of the tone and temper, in which the proceedings of his dependant were spoken of by the Imam, the enforcement of our demands would be viewed by His Highness with any feelings buttboseof satisfaction. Captain Hennell recommended that in the event of Government being unwilling to press the Imam further on this subject, an embargo be laid upon the vessels of the Kishm Sheikh, visiting the ports of Bombay and Mangalore, which measure in his opinion would soon compel the Sheikh to come to a settlement of the claims upon him. 527. Acting on the suggestion of Captain Hennell, the Government of VI qo qftn Bombay with a view of compelling the Vomme 82—960 of 1838-1841. 4-11 • r £ • u x a j i.« r Chief of Kishm to afford restitution for the cargo withheld by him, issued instruction on 16th April 1840 to the Superintendent of the Indian Navy for an embargo being laid on all vessels belonging to the Chief visiting the port of Bombay and for the detention until further orders of all vessels belonging to him which might be in or might enter the harbour of Bombay. The Government of Madras was also requested to issue similar instructions to the Collector of Kanara in regard to the port of Mangalore; a vessel also of the Chief named Acoob or Gusscm then on the point of leaving the Bombay harbour was detained and placed under the charge of the Collector of Customs (letter to Captain Hennell, No. 590, dated 16th April 1890). 528. The account of the claim against the Sheikh of Kishm stood thus :— R a. p. The original total claim on the Sheikh of Kishm, on account of the plunder oE the luteh-ul-Euhman, in May 1838, was ......... 24,500 0 0 Deduct value of certain articles subsequently restored . . 7,283 15 0 Balance Company's . 17,216 1 0 Value of a bale shawls, subsequently ordered to be deducted in consequence of its being doubtful whether it was on board the bugla .....*. 8,000 0 0 Grand Balance . 14,216 1 0 Add to this pay to Lascars for taking charge of the bugla Jcoob now under embargo, up to the Slst August 1840 161 6 5 Balance up to August 1840 • 14.377 7 5 The balance due by the Sheikh of Kishm was, it will be seen by tbe above statement, 377-7-6 at tbe end of August 1840, to which was to be274 Part VII—Chap. LXIII. added the pay subsequent to that date of the establishment left in charge of the Acoob, 529. From Captain Henneirs letter, dated the 26th November 1840, it appeared that two other buglas belonging to the Sheikh of Kishm were on their way to Bombay, with horses, and that officer promised the Sheikh that if he paid a sum of 113,255 on the arrival of his two vessels in Bombay, and a further similar amount, at the expiration of one month from the date of the first payment, no molestation would be offered to either of the vessels, and that tbey would be permitted to return to the Gulf, or proceed to whatever place the Sheikh might wish. The Chief promised to pay accordingly and further gave Captain Bennell a bond for the payment, on the 26th May 1841, of the remaining balance R7,867-7'5, and that officer stated that he did not anticipate any difficulty in the realization of this last mentioned amount. In the letters from His Highness the Imam forwarded with Captain Hennell's letter, Bis Highness expressed himself to be very solicitous that Government should authorize the release of the Sheikh of Kishm's bagalow Acoob under embargo in Bombay, on that Chief fulfilling the conditions to which he had agreed. 530. In the circumstances the Governor in Council was pleased to remove the embargo laid on the vessels of the Sheikh of Kishm, and to direct the Collector of Customs to release the ship dcoob on payment by the Sheikh's agent of the sum of E6,510 (letter to the Collector of Customs dated 19th January 1841).^art VII—Chap.

JUahomed Shcih (1835) succeeded in (isoo-i8o0.) defeating his rivals mainly through the able and skilful handling of the troops by Sir Henry Bethune. On the accession of Mahomed Shah, the British Government having determined to retransfer the superintendence of the .Persian mission from the Government of India to the Crown deputed Sir Henry Ellis as His Majesty's Envoy to Teheran to congratulate the new Shah. Sir Henry was received by the Shah in November 1835. He returned to England in August 1836, and was succeedtd by Mr. McNeill, who had been for many years in Persia as Doctor to the Mission. 532. Mahomed Shah was an ambitious prince and entered into a scheme of conquest in the direction of H^rat, in which he was encouraged by Count Simonich, the Russian Minister at Teheran, bat to which the British Govern- xuent was opposed. In November 1837. the Persian Army led by the Shah in person invaded the territory of Herat. Gharian was captured on 15th Novem ber and on 22nd the siege of Herat commenced. Kamran Shah the ruler of Herat, an old drunken debauchee, left the management of his State in the hands of his Minister Yar Mahomed, and the latter's influence over the defenders, seconded by the energy and skill of Lieutenant Eldred Pottinger (a nephew of Sir Henry Pottinger, Kesident in Sind), enabled the town to offer a stout and gallant defence against the Persian attacks. 533. On 6th April 1838, Mr. McNeill arrived in the camp and formally protested against the Shah's proceedings. He declared that the invasion of Herat was a violation of the treaty and therefore Great Britain was at liberty to take measures to compel the withdrawal of the Persian Army. All British officers serving in Persia had already been ordered to leave the country. 534. Meanwhile the siege on Herat was pressed with increased activity under the personal superintendence of Count Simonich, and Russian influence had become paramount in the Persian Court. One of McNeill's messengers had been stopped and insulted by the Persians. Outrages had been committed against the Residency and our officers at Bushire and all demands for repara tion were treated by the Persian Government with contempt. In these circum stances Mr. McNeill was driven to the necessity of leaving the Persian camp at Herat which he did on 7th June 183S. He was the next day on his way to Meshed and Teheran. 535. While Mr. McNeill was still in the Persian camp, the Government of India conceived the project of sending Volume 78—962 of 1838-1839. • an expedition to the Persian Gulf, as appears from the following letter dated 1st May 1838 from the Secretary to the Government of India to the British Envoy :— 1 am directed by th^ Rig^t, Hon'ble the Governor-General of India to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's' letter dated the 7th ultimo, with the copies of despatches to the address of Her MMjesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs which accompanied it, and for which His Lordship desires me to tender to you his best thanks. 2. His Lordship gathers from these documents that the state of our relations with Persia is at the present moment exceedingly critical, and that Your Excellency may not improbably be compelled to assume a very high tone in your communication with the Shah. It has occurred to the Governor-General that it mifiht prove of very essential aid to vour negotiations were as many cruizers as can be spared for the service, together with a regiment of Native Infantry despatched to the Persian Gulf to hold themselves in readiness for any service on which Your Excellency might s^em it expedient under the orders of Her Majesty s Govern ment, or the general authority which you may possess from it to employ them with a view to the maintenance of our interests in Persia. A recommendation to this effect will accordingly be made immediately to the Right Hon ; ble the Governor in Council of Bombay, who will 2 N276 Part VII—Chap. LXIV» further be requested to despatch the Hugh Lindsay to the Gulf, 'with a view of conveying rapid intelligence to India of the state of affairs in Persia in the present highly critical emergency. 3. His Lordship understands from a demi-official communication with which Your Excellency has favoured him, that it is your intention to proceed to Herat with a view of prevailing on His Majesty the Shah to raise the siege of that city. Your Excellency is fully aware of the great importance attached by the British Government in India to the preserva tion of the integrity of that place, and His Lordship would be glad at any efforts you can make to save it, which may not be inconsistent with the instructions under which you are acting from Her Majesty's Government. 4. The Governor-General has recently received letters from Kamran Shah and his Vizier and His Lordship's replies are sent herewith. Copies accompany for your information. Your Excellency will be best able to judge as to the expediency and practicability of having them delivered. A duplicate of the present communication has been sent through Captain Buines. 5. With my letter of the 27th ultimo, I had the honour of forwarding for Your Excel lency's information copy of a letter written on the same date to Captain Burnes at Cabool presenting the conduct he has to pursue in the present exigency, together with a copy of a despatch from His Lordship to the Hon'ble the Secret Committee. 536. The necessary instructions were given to the Government of Bombay, who passed the following orders, dated Volume 78—962 of 1838-1839 (Consul., 23rd ^Qlh May 1838, from which it will be ay 1638, No. 2250). seeri that they selected Karrak island as the more convenient place for landing the troops :— Proceedings held at an Extraordinary Council at Malahar JPoint on Saturday the 19th May 1838.

The Board having taken the above letters into consideration, and having consulted Pear-Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm, Superintendent of the Indian Navy, Major Neil Campbell, Acting Quartermaster-General of the Army, Captain Turner, Mint Engineer, and Captain Lowe, Commanding the Hon'ble Company's Steamer Berenice, as to the best and easiest mode of equipping and transporting a small force to the Persian Gulf, it is unanimously resolved as follows:— 3. 1st —That in consideration of the probable importance of the despatches received yesterday by express from the Governor-General at Simla, it is not expedient that the departure of the Berenice with the overland mail on the 21st instant should be interfered with, 4. 2nd—That with reference to that part of the Governor-General's instructions, directing that the Hugh Lindsay steamer be sent to the Persian Gulf, His Lordship be informed that both Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm and Captain Lowe being v of opinion that at this late season of the year it is more than doubtful whether this vessel could reach Muscat, and that on failure thereof, she would have no alternative but to return to Bombay, it is impossible that this part of the instructions can be carried into effect, 5. 3rd —That it appearing that the Hon'ble Company's Steamer Semiramis can be got ready for sea in ten days from this date, and that as this vessel has been directed to proceed to Calcutta to try an experiment, which ought to yield to the necessity of complying with the Governor-GeneraFs orders in an emergency of the present description, she be despatched to the Persian Gulf with as many troops on board as she can conveniently accommodate, 4^—That, as it distinctly appears from the statement of Sir Charles Malcolm that the Tigris can carry no troops, and the Coote a very few men, while the Semiramis cannot, well carry above 800, Sir Charles Malcolm be directed to endeavour to engage a vessel of 4f)0, or 500 tons, for the conveyance of troops to the Persian Gulf. 7. 5th —That he be directed to prepare the Hon'ble Company's Sloop of War Coote for service in the Persian Gulf, with all practicable despatch. 8. 6th —That the Hon'ble Company's Brig-of-War Tigris, now ready for sea, be ordered to proceed to the Persian Gulf, as soon as despatches can be prepared for the Envoy in Persia and the Resident at Bushire informing those officers of the measures about to be adopted by this Government, to give effect to the instructions of the Governor-General. 9. 7ih—That by the above vessel, orders be issued to the Resident at Bushire to concen trate the whole of the squadron in the Persian Gulf at Bushire or at the Isle of Karrack. 10. 8th —That provided tonnage can be obtained, a force consisting of five hundred rank and file of Native Infantry, and two six pounders completely equipped for service be despatched with as little delay as possible to Bushire. 11. 9M-—That the Native Infantry be composed of detachments from the 15th, 23rd and 24th Regiments, and the Marine Battalion, now forming part of the garrison of Bombay, in order to admit of those castes being selected, which are likely to suffer least from a sea voyage. 12. 10th —That it being highly desirable that an officer of judgment and experience should be selected to command on this service, the Right Hon'ble the Resident proposes thatPart VII—Chap.

That the Resident be directed to apprise the Envoy in Persia of the arrival of these troops, and of their being placed entirely at His Excellency's disposal. 17. ^5^—That the Kesident be directed to apprise the Persian authorities at Bushire that the troops are sent on a special service to the Gulf, and that the British Government hope that they will make no objection to iheir being landed at Karrack and that they will afford every aid in effecting that object, Captain Henntll being informed that it is left to his discre tion to land them on that island even in opposition to the wishes of those authorities, provided he deems this necessary and expedient, and that it can be done without compromising the safety of the troops. 18. 16th—'Ih&amp;i the despatches recently received from the Governor-General to the Envoy in Persia be forwarded by the Semiramis, together with duplicates of the despatches of this Government to be sent by the 1 igrit. 19. 17th —That copy of Mr. Secretary Macnaghten's letter and enclosure of the Ist instant, and copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the Hon'ble the Secret Committee of the Court of Directors by the Hon'ble Company's Steamer Berenice. 20. 18th —That copy of these resolutions be immediately transmitted to tlie Governor- General, and the Government of India, with an intimation that beinj; unable to carry into, effect literally the instructions of the Supreme Government, we have felt it our duty to comply in the best manner our means will permit with those instructions in a case in which the inter- ests of the British Empire may be materially and perhaps vitally involved. R, GRANT. 19th May 1838. 537, The Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Hennell) in his letter No. 801, dated Volume 1878—963 ot 1833-1839. 20 ^ f' 110 1838. reported that feeling perfectly certain that any application to the local authorities of Bushire for permission to land the troops at Karrak would either be refused or evaded under the pretext of want of powers and the necessity of previously making a reference to Shiraz, it appeared to him better to locate the detachment at once upon the island, taking it for granted that no objection could or would be raised to such an arrangement, than to do so after permission had been denied. The island of Karrak abounded with wells and springs of excellent water, but it was scantily inhabited and great difficulty would be felt in regard to provisions. This it was hoped, however, could be imported from the ports of Bushire, Banderik and Genawa. 538, Mirza Abbas, the Governor of Bushire, was duly informed by the Resident on 2l8t June 1838 that the troops had been sent up the Persian Gulf upon a special service in those seas, and that on account of the superiority of Karrak over Bassidore and every other island in point of climate, the troops had been landed there. At the same time a request was made that the Gov ernor would show every kindness and afford every assistance to the troops, especially in allowing boats to carry over supplies from Bushire. The Govern nor replied that he had reported the matter to the higher authorities, but that there was no objection to the transport of supplies (letter dated 21st June 1838 from Mirza Abbas to the Resident). 539, The Prince of Shiraz soon afterwards sent a Rukum to the Resident asking for explanation of the British proceedings in landing troops at Karrak, to which the Resident replied in conciliatory terms and giving the same explanation as given to Mirza Abbas (letter dated 11th July 1838).278 Part VH-Chap. LXIV. 540. The Resident had asked Mr. McNeill's orders on the question of the removal of the Residency to Karrak, but was informed by him that he had received despatches from England from which it appeared that the authorities there did not wish the Residency to be withdrawn from Bushire even in the event of Mr. McNeill having to leave Persia. But if any hostile demonstra tion should be made by the Shiraz Government, and especially if it be found that it was proposed to take steps to fortify and strengthen Bushire, or to place a garrison there, and if the Resident was of opinion that the force under Colonel Sherriff with the naval force at his disposal was sufficient for the occupation and defence of Bushire, he was told to intimate to the Governor of Shiraz that any hostile demonstration he might make would oblige him immediately to occupy Bushire and defend it if necessary; but if no such demonstration should be made, Mr. McNeill desired that the troops should remain in Karrak until he received further instructions (letter from AJr. McNeill to Captain Hennell, dated 10th July 1888). 541. Sheikh Nasir having returned from Bushire roads came off on 20th June 1838 to the steamer to pay the Resident a visit. After the usual compli ments had passed, he expressed his satisfaction that we had selected his island as the place upon which to locate troops. He said that he had sutTered so much from the oppressive rule of the Fars Government^ that he should be delighted to be under our protection ; his object, he added, in going once to Bushire had been to ascertain from Resident whether he would not be permitted to retaliate upon the Persians the many and grievous injuries he had experienced at their hands. Captain Hennell replied that we were not at enmity with Persia and it was to be hoped that no occasion would arise to render necessary any change in the friendly relations hitherto maintained with that country, that the British Government had sent up a body of troops for special service, and that the Island of Karrak had been chosen for their location on account of its superiority of situation and climate, that under these circumstances it was in every respect advisable the Sheikh siiould abstain from commencing hostilities, otherwise, it would most certainly be believed that we had instigated him to do so. The Sheikh acknowledged the justice of this observation, and said, that he would remain tranquil for a few months and see what turn affairs might take—adding, that he could raise a force of three or four thousand men in a very short time, and submit them without difficulty, by making descents upon the Persian coast provided we only withdrew our interference. He then proceeded to intimate that the necessity of maintaining a garrison for the protection of the women and children on the island during the absence of their male relations, was a source of considerable expense to him, and loss to his dependants, most of whom were unable to carry on their usual employments of fishing and trading in conse quence of their apprehension of an attack from the Persians,-while they were away. He therefore wished to be informed whether we would defend the place under such a contingency. The Resident replied that as long as our troops were located on the plain at a distance from the fort, and having no connexion with it, he did not see how we could interfere, as the town would of course be defended by its own garrison, it being only necessary for us to take such steps as were required for the safety of our own camp, hut there were parts of the defences rented by us as a depdt for coals and stores, these of course must be protected from every aggression. It was then hinted that the small citadel erected by the Dutch would be a suitable place, tor the hire of which he was prepared to pay a liberal rent. The Sheikh replied that^ he could not give the fort as all the wives and families of himself and relations dwelt there, and in point of fact had no other place of residence^ upon the island, but that he had no objection to let us have the southern bastion of the town walls (which completely command the best landing place during the prevalent winds) at a monthly rent of 250 rupees. That the place specified was certainly much out of repair, but that we might expend two or three months of the hire in putting it into an effective state. That if this offer were accepted the only stipulation he wished to make was that the entrance should be from the outside, and that it should not communicate directly with the town. In reply he was told that the Resident would consult with Colonel Sherriff, the Commanding Officer of the Troops, before giving a definitive answer uponPart VII—Chap. LXIV. 279 the subject. Sheikh Nasir then asked whether in the event of our permanently occupying the island, we should in such case oppose his going over to the main land and attacking the Persians. Captain Hennell replied that under present circumstances it was impossible to speculate with any certainty upon what turn affairs might take, but that in every point of view this was a ques tion to which he did not feel himself competent to give an answer, excepting under the special instructions of his own Government. 542. In the evening Sheikh Nasir paid a visit to Lieutenant-Colonel Sherriff in the camp. Upon this occasion the subject of a place suitable for the deposit of coals and stores was again brought forward, and it was finally arranged that the Commanding Officer should inspect the position offered by the Sheikh for this purpose before he decided upon its acceptance.2S0 Part VII—Chap. LX\r, CHAPTER 1XV. OUTRAGES AGAINST THE BRITISH AT BU8HIRE. REMOVAL OF THE RESIDENCY TO KARRAK, 1839. (i) OUTRAGE ON THE RESIDENCY SHROFF. 543. This was a time when the feeling in Persia against the British was very B ..idenl'. letter, dated 21.1 November 1738, bitter ' Bushire frequently the Volume iv— 1063 of 1839, page 18, scene of outrages upon the Eesideney and people under its protection. One of the notable ones was a gross and unprovoked outrage committed at the instigation of Sheikh Hussein ; the Kazi of Bushire, upon the person and property of the shroff of the British Residency. The facts briefly are these— 544. In consequence of a dispute between the merchants of Bushire and Mirza Abbas, the Governor, regarding the settlement of certain duties which they alleged had already been paid to Sheikh Nasir while in power) the bazaars were closed. On the morning of the 17th of November 1838,, Mirza Abbas sent his Farrashes to compel the inhabitants to open their shops. Upon this Sheik Hussein directed them to refuse compliance and 1o assemble in arms round bis house. Upon the pretence of one of the Mirza's Farrashes being intoxicated an order was given by the Sheikh that all the wine found under the roofs of the Jews should be destroyed. Upon this the rabble led by the Kazi's slaves and a certain Sued Ally proceeded to the Jews* Mahullah, and having among others forcibly effected an entrance into the house of the Residency Shroff they destroyed the wine and spirits packed for exportation to the value of 40 or 60 Tomans, and at the same time so beat and ill-treated the owner himself as to compel him to take refuge in the Residency for fear of his life. Upon the occurrence of this outrage the Resident sent his Mirja to the Governor to know what steps he intended to take in consequence. His reply was to the effect that the turbulent rabble of the town, instigated by the Kazi and the Merchants, had not only wholly thrown off his authority but were endeavouring to expel him from the place. He further entreated that the Resident should make an early representation to the Prince of Shiraz (who was then at Kazerun) of the real state of affairs here. 545. Having regard to the prospect of a satisfactory adjustment of our relations with Persia, the Resident felt unwilling, notwithstanding the ample means now at his disposal, to take upon himself the punishment of the authors of this unprovoked aggression upon a dependent of the British Residency. He however laid the circumstances of the affair before the Prince of Sbiraz, with an intimation of his earnest expectation that full redress would be afforded. There was, however, little hope of anything satisfactory being done by His Royal Highness. The Resident suggested that Mr. McNeill might demand the removal of Sheikh Hussein, Sheikh Suliman and their dependents from Bushire, and the punishment both in person and property of the individuals who rendered themselves conspicuous on this occasion. He thought that some such serious notice should be taken of the outrage now reported, as he feared that both our character and influence would be lowered; these repeated insults on the part of the Kazi had been long allowed to pass without the exaction of ample and fitting satisfaction. (ii) MIRZA ASSAD SUCCEEDS MIRZJA ABBAS. HIS ANTI-BRITISH PROCEEDINGS. PROHIBITION OF EXPORT OF SUPPLIES TO KARRAK, 1839, 546. The Governor of Bushire had given full permission for the transport of supplies from Bushire to Karrack ; it was however found that all sorts of restrictions were placed on the arrangements made for the purpose. A prohw bition was put on the export of wheat and flour to Karrak by Mirza Abbas. Soon after one Mirza Assad Uolah was appointed Governor of Bushire. He was deeply anti-British in his feelings, proceeded so far as to lay not only aPart VII—Chap. LXV. 281 total prohibition upon all persons from serving the British detachment in Karrak, but like wise refused to allow the smallest article of supplies even those required for the officers* mess to be sent from Bushire. Captain Hennell proposed the expediency of resorting to retaliatory measure of stopping the trade of the port of Bushire (Resident's letter dated 28th December 1838, to Mr. McNeill), 547. This proposal was objected to by Viscount Palmerston for the following reasons:— (i) it would injure the interests of the Indian traders with Bushire as well as the local merchants, who were friendly to the British, (ii) it might induce the Shah to stop the importation of British goods to northern Persia, (iii) it would not probably have the effect of altering the Persian attitude. Lord Palmerston suggested the alternative course of warning the Persian authorities of the necessity the British Government might be driven to of employing its own meaus to obtain the supplies required and if the warning be not heeded to act upon it. There was no necessity felt to resort to this course, since Colonel Taylor had made the necessary arrangements to send the supplies from Bussorah (Secret Committee's Despatch to the Government of India, dated 29th April 1839). (iii) OUTRAGE OX REAR-ADMIRAL MAITLAND AND HIS STAFF. REMOVAL OF THE RESIDENCY TO KARKACK, MARCH 1839. 548. To crown the recent insults to which the British were subjected at Bushire, there was committed an outrage Jnme iX.'o' '' 0h 183! '' a g ail ' Bt the Naval Commander-iD-Chief and his staff which in its insolence had been rarely surpassed in the history of the British connection with Persia. 549. On the evening of Friday the 22nd March a boat brought Captain Hennell a letter from Commander Hawkins of the Clive informing him of the arrival of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Rear-Admiral Sir F, L. Maitland at Bushire. On the morning of the 23rd Captain Hennell sailed in the Elphinstone to wait on His Excellency and receive his orders. On his doing so. His Excellency was pleased to signify his intention of not interfering with the Squadron, unless some exigence of the public service should render it necessary. 550. Sir F. Maitland going to return the visit of the Governor on Sunday morning the 23rd, the Resident and the Commanders of the Squadron accom panied him; the interview went on well until the Admiral spoke on the subject of supplies for himself and ship having been stopped that day, and intimating that if it occurred through any mistake or error on his (the Admiral's) part in not attending to the regulations of the port, he was sorry and would prevent it in future, but if otherwise, it was contrary to the usages of all civilized and friendly nations. On this the Governor began stating it was customary to send a list. The Resident, who had served on and off in the Gulf for thirty years, declared most positively that so far as the ships of war either of the Crown Y)r East India Company were concerned, this was not true and that the first instance of even an attempt at such a thing being made was on his own baggage a fortnight previously, which when resisted, the point was immediately given up. The Governor next stated it was irregular and contrary to the rules of the place that boats should land at the Residency and that all and every thing must go off from the landing place at the town. Sir F. Maitland appealed to the Resident to know if such was the case, when he distinctly said, it was not or never had been, moreover that at all times when the weather permitted, our boats constantly landed there, whether they went on duty or pleasure to the Residency, and that things belonging to the resident officers of the Indian Navy or other persons at the Residency were landed or shipped off, from the same place whenever the parties thought it most convenient. Sir Frederick then ptated his determination, as it was the custom, to go off from where he landed,282 Part VII—Chap. LXV. with his personal bacrgage, and any attempt to stop him would be considered as an insult to the Admiral personally, as nothing of the sort had been done to any one before, also as he had the means of resisting any agsrression or attempt to impede his embarkation ; be should go off on Monday, and request ed the Governor distinctly to state if he would prevent it; this he declined answering more than once; and the Admiral got up to leave declining under these circumstances the proffered hand of the Governor; the Governor however laid hold of him and got him to sit down again ; the question was again repeated twice, and again an answer declined, when the Admiral got up, and with his party quitted the place. 651. On Monday morning the boats of Her Majesty's Ship Wellesley and those of the Indian Naval Squadron came off the Residency to secure His Excellency's embarkation from insult. It must be mentioned that immediately after the return of the Admiral to the Residency, a party of Suborze came down and went into the Sea Tower near the Residency and a sentinel was placed at the landing place: it was ascertained that they had orders to prevent the boats landing. 552. On Monday morning the Gigs of the Wellesley and Captain Maitland and the Flag Lieutenant came in, far in advance of the other boats; in these two boats neither the men or officers displayed any arms, on the con trary they were carefully concealed. Sir Frederick the Admiral, the Resident and several officers of the Royal and Indian Navies were standing on the cliff over the landing place unarmed. A crowd of people were also lounging about. On Captain Maitland's boat touching the beach, a Suborze of the Governor cocked his musket and told them to keep off, or he would fire; this not being heeded he brought his musket down to the arm, and would have shot Captain Maitland had not the Admiral seized the musket and thrown the muzzle up, at the same time Captain Hennell and the other officers seizing the man and after much resistance disarming him. At this moment the mob around attacked the party with sticks and stones, but the gig's crews displaying their arms and landing they dispersed towards the huts. Captain Maitland and several officers were struck ; fortunately the Admiral escaped this additional insult. 553. The other boats now began to near the shore, when a fire was opened upon them from a breast work, which had been thrown up during the night, and was quickly returned, but without much injury owing to the shelter of the breast work; the Admiral immediately on the fire opening from the boats ordered to cease, and a messenger was sent to the Governor to say bis people must cease firing or he would be responsible for the consequences; shortly after the firing from the breast work ceased and the embarkation took place. It appears that the destruction of Bushire or at least the lives of many of the inhabitants, was only prevented by the lenity and for bearance of Rear-Admiral Sir F. Maitland, for the insult was without cause given, and the firing on the boats premeditated, the orders the sentinel had, his attempting to fire on Captain Maitland, as well as the throwing up a breast work, and filling it with armed men were sufficient proof on this point. 554. It having in consequence of these uncalled for insults and aggression been determined to remove the Residency to Karrak, the Resident remained on shore until evening, giving aid in furtherance of this object; when every thing being entrain and the place quiet, he went on board Wellesley leaving Commander Hawkins to superintend this duty; on Wednesday morning 27th Clive telegraphed that a party of artillery under Captain Leslie with two guns had arrived, and that one hundred Europeans under Captain Strong had left Karagh the day before ; as the latter had not arrived and some boats had been seen from the Wellesley to leeward of the port. Captain Hennell offered his services to the Admiral to go down to Hallilah in Her Majesty's Brig dlgerine to pick them up, as it was of much consequence they should be prevented landing and marching on Bushire, a circumstance likely to occur from their being unacquainted with the actual state of affairs, and which might have caused serious inconvenience; in the evening we anchored in? Hallilah Bay, transhipped the men and returned to Bushire at 11 a.m . on the 28th.Part VII-Chap. LXV. 283 555. It being expected that some resistance might be made to the Resident's embarking on Eriday morning, the Rear-Admiral despatched ihe boats of Her Majesty's Ship JVellesley and those of the Olive and Elphimtone under Captain Maitland of the JVellesley to secure this object. The able arrangements of Captain Maitland and the sight of ten gun-boats lying off the landing place ready to act, prevented any resistance although Bakhar Khan Tangistuni with near four hundred of his tribe were paraded on the cliffs above the landing place. At 2 p.m . of the 29th the Wellesley, Elphinstone and Algerine quitted Bushire for Karrak, where they anchored on the morning of the 30th, The Clive remained as guard ship at Bushire for protec tion of British interests and shipping. 556. In the opinion of the Government of India (letter to the Bombay Government, dated 9th May 1839), this occurrence, though not altogether unlocked for as a possible contingency, was still to be regretted. Whether the first grounds of difference between the British authorities and the Governor Mirza Assadulah might have been removed by mutual explanation, and a conciliatory course of proceeding, and whether the retirement of the Residency might not have been conducted with something less of apparent precipitancy, it was impossible for the Governor-General to judge, but after the extreme measure of hostile encroachment adopted by the Government of laying down the plan of a fortified building in front of the Residency to command the landing place, and at his pleasure to stop the direct communication between the Residency and the shipping in the harbour. His Lordship was of opinion that the Mission could not have been much longer maintained with safety and with honor, and he therefore generally approved the measure of removing the Residency to Karrak. 557. The buildings of the British Residency appeared to have been preserved from injury and a good feeling in British favor was said to exist in the town of Bushire, and the communication with the Island of Karrak would tend to preserve our friendly intercourse with the town uninterrupted ; except in the event of a hostile declaration of the Persian Government against us, it was hoped that, in the then footing of our relations with that Govern ment, we should not in the end have lost ground by the evacuation of the British Residency at Bushire, before any hostile declaration was made by the Government. 558. The Govern or-General highly applauded the cordial and able assistance afforded by the officers and crews of Her Majesty's and the Hon'ble Company's ships in the removal of the Resident and his suite from the Residency on board the ships, an operation which but for their aid might have been attended with difficulty and danger. 2 o284i Part VH-Chap. LXVI. CHAPTER 1XVI. ADMINISTRATION OF THE RARRAR ISLAND, 1838-1841-EX- PLLSION OF SHEIKH NASIR FROM KARRAR. 559. On tbe arrival of Captain Hennell with his establishment at Karrak, „, A , questions arose as to the respective powers 0 Qm&lt;, 0 ' that ought to be exercised by the Eesident and the Commander of the Forces on the island, Colonel Sheriff., The latter carried things in a high-handed manner and expelled in a very harsh manner Sheikh Nasir, to whom we referred to above. This proceeding was justified on the ground that Sheikh Nasir being an avowed enemy of the Persian Govern ment, his presence on the island would be likely to be misinterpreted by the Persians. But there was no justification for carrying out the expulsion in a violent and harsh manner. Sheikh Nasir 1 claimed the island as his own territory^ but Captain Hennell thought that he and his ancesters had held it as an appanage just as they had Bushire (letter dated I9th April ]i839, to the Bombay Government). The Resident afforded every facility for his departure without serious inconvenience to himself and his family. Further' Colonel Sheriff was inclined to take a serious view of the recent acts of the Mirza Assad and to consider them as amounting to a declaration of war by the- Persian Government against Great Britain, and wished Captain Bennell to take certain measures for being prepared to take the offensive against Persia (his letter dated 9th April 1839 to Captain Hennell). On the other hand Captain Hennell had reason to believe that Miraa Assad had proceeded without orders from superior authority. The Government of India animadverted strongly on Colonel Sheriff^ proceedings in their letter dated 23rd May 1839r:— 4. The Rijjht Honourable the Governor-General has viewed with regret the proceedings- connected with the removal of Sbcik Nasir from Karrack. No reaeoue have been adduced by Colouel Sheriff to convince His Lordship of the necessity of that measure on the ground assumed that Sheikh Nasir's continuance on the islandi compromised the safety or endangered our position on Karrack. The amount of British force on the island of Karrack is certainly not so insiornificant that our tenure of the place would have been placed in jeopardy by the presence of Sheikh Nasir and his followers, and no cause is assigned for his abrupt expul-. sion founded on his misconduct or on the manifestation of a hostile disposition towards the British (Government, and the supposition that he might intrigue against us is rendered improbable by the implacable enmity which he is said lo bear towards those with whom in. such an event he must conspire. Another reason is assigned by Colonel SherifE for consi dering the Sheikh's residence at Karrack inexpedient, namely, that the Persian Government might take offence at our position on that island under the flag of its rebel subject. The unsoundness of this argument was shown in Captain Hennel's reply to Colonel Sheriff's letter, and the question was one depending so entirely on political considerations that it should have been left to the decision of the Resident, and it does not appear to His Lordship to have been the proper province of Colonel Sheriff to enter into argument on such a point, with that officer. His Lordship would be glad if any measures could be devised to provide for the comfort and the security of this individual, and that just compensation for loss and expense should be afforded to him at the discretion of Captain Hennel. 5. This observation applies with still greater force to the style of Colonel Sheriff's letter to Captain Hennel of April 9th, in which the former officer has far outstepped the bounds of his official duty, and appears to overlook the fact that the presence of the Kesident on the island of Karrack relieved the officer commanding the troops from all political responsibility, excepting such as the Kesident might think proper to impose upon him. It will be desirable in His Lordship's opinion that the Honorable the Governor in Council should point out to Colonel Sheriff the error into which he has fallen, and desire that for the future he will leave the consideration and decision of all political questions affecting the relations of the British and the Persian Governments to the officer entrusted by Government with their superintendenpe. 6. The Governor-General approves the tenor of Captain HenneFs language in his correspondence with Colonel Sheriff on the political aspect of affairs in Persia, but the Resident should avoid discussion in an official form of such subjects, holding himself solely responsible to his Government for the correctness of his own views and measures. Till the British Government had intimated an intention of invading continental possessions of Persia, it was as unnecessary as it might have been offensive for its officers to have engaged in preparan tions for such an enterprise. Nothing has been brought to the knowledge of the Governor- General to lead His Lordship to suppose that, as long as Karrack can be provisioned withoutTart VH-Chap. LXVI. 285 difficulty, and hostilities are avoided with the Persian Government; any measures of a com pulsory nature, such as it is presumed are alluded to in the 2nd paragraph of your letter of the 11th instant, can be required. The settlement of our relations with the Court of Persia on a better footing than at present must depend upon the view which Her Majesty's Government may take of the actual position in wliich our differences have already placed us, and it is very far from the wish or intention of the Governor-General to anticipate, by any measures of a nature hostile and offensive to Persia, the determination of Her Majesty's Government regarding our future line of conduct towards that power. 7. The Governor-General approves of Captain Hennel's proceeding in the Welledeyin meet the Persian nobleman, Hu^sain Khan, who had been deputed by the Prince of Fars to confer with him on the subject of the retirement from Bushtre of the British Residency and His Lordship considers the language of that officer on the occasion and in his subsequent not© to have been judicious. 8. As stated in my letter to your address of the 9th instant, His Lordship is of opinion that the re-establishment of the Kesidency at Bushire is now become a question, the decision o£ which must rest with Government, and Captain Hennel, unless he should receive clear instructions from Her Majesty's representative now at Erzeroun, or the compliance with his demands should be clear and unqualified, may be desired to refer any propositions that may be hereafter made to him with the object of inducing his return to Bushire for the orders of Government, apprising the Persian authorities that he is not empowered to give a final answer to any overtures which he may receive from them on this point. 9. The Governor-General will not desire a reference upon any pressing occasion to be made to himself, for the Governor in Council of Bombay will understand, in replying to any appeal made to him by Captain Hennel, that the re-establishment of amicable relations with Persia is an object earnestly to be desired, if it can be accomplished without loss of national dignity, or danger to national interests, 10. The Governor-General fully approves the mode of Government of the island of Karrack suggested by the Resident. The Government of the town and island should be military, under the Commanding Officer 1 of the Forces, the Keddent's establishments being excluded from his jurisdiction. As long as the Resident remains on the island, all its foreign and political relations will of course remain under the charge and exclusive control of that officer. 11. The property of the Resident having been unmolested at Bushire after the evacuation of the Residency may be taken as an indication that the Governor, Mirza Assud, is appre hensive of the light in which his previous offensive conduct may be viewed by the Persian Government. And it is natural that the Prince of Fars and the subordinate authorities in the South of Persia should wish that the appearances of amity should be maintained as long as their Government has not declared open hostilities against that of England. The conti nuance of a British functionary at Bushire, pending our present differences with Persia may well therefore be desired, and though under present circumstances he would not reside there without the hazard of the recurrence of such embarrassments as have lately occurred, yet these circumstances are from day today liable to change, and it is possible that a clear line of proceeding may very shortly be opened to him and to his Government. 12. His Lordship anproves of the measure sanctioned by the Resident of taking into the service of the British Government the Letter of Resident, Persian Gulf, 23rd April, Beloochees left on the island of Karrack by No - 80 - ' Sheikh Nasir. 13. The different questions arising out of this correspondence which were specially referred to the notice of the Governor-General in your letter of the 11th instant have now been remarked upon, with exception to that relating to the disposal of the collections at Karrack, and the non-receipt of a copy of Captain Hennel's despatch on that subject marked No. 27 on the margin of your letter of the 10th instant, precludes His Lordship from expressing any opinion on that matter. 560. The Governor-General informed the Bombay Government that he would be glad if any measures could be devised to provide for the comfort and the security of this individual and directed that just compensation for loss and expense should be afforded to him at the discretion of Captain Hennell. Further, the Government of India considering the extreme hardship of the operation, expressed a wish that every proper opportunity should be taken to make suitable reparation to Sheikh Nasir, that the Resident m the Persian Gulf should take every means in his power to contribute to the Sheikh's comfort at the place to which he had retired and should hold out to him the prospect of the eventual recovery, of his residence in Karrak, that meanwhile that instructions might be given to Captain Hennell to preserve the residence of Sheikh Nasir in the condition in which he left it. 561. With reference to these instructions Captain Hennell stated in hia letter dated the 24th August 1839 that Sheikh Nasir having at the invitation of Mansschehr Khan the ' Moatimed^oo-Doulatt ' proceeded into rersia, e ft o 2286 Part VII—Chap. LXVI. received by the Khan in the most honourable and distinguished manner, and that it is reported that the influence of this nobleman had procured for Sheikh Nasir a Firman from the Shah re-appointing him Lord High Admiral and Gov ernor of Bushire. Captain Hennell therefore observed that however gratified he should feel in carrying into effect the above instructions of the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General of India, to provide for the comfort and security of Sheikh Nasir, he was too uncertain of the Sheikh's position to be able to communicate with him, or to make any arrangements calculated to promote either one or the other of these objects, but that His Lordship might rest assured that no favorable opportunity of carrying into effect his benevolent views with reference to the Sheikh would be overlooked. That the question of Sheikh Nasir's return to Bushire would probably soon be decided and that should tbe ' Moatimed' obtain the object of his ambition, the office of Begler Beg of Fars,' in succession to the present occupant of that high station, little doubt can be entertained of the restoration of Sheikh Nasir to the rank and possessions so long held by his ancestors. 662. Adverting to the instructions of the Governor-General of India on the subject of the preservation of the residence of Sheikh Nasir, Captain Hennell stated that this dwelling which only consisted of an upper storey of three rooms, was now used as a guard room by the British garrison (stationed on the small fort in which it is situated as being the only habitable place inside that build ing during the hot season) and that Sheikh Nasir did not appear to have enter tained any great predilection for a residence in these quarters, further than as being within the Fort, the security of himself, family and immediate followers was better provided for, while the chance of any treacherous surrender of that stronghold was guarded against by his constant presence inside. 563. Captain Hennell's letter dated the 26th August 1839, No. 75, contained intelligence of a collision having taken place between the Prince of Fars and the regular troops on one side and the citizens of Shiraz on the other, on which occasion it was stated some lives were lost on the part of the latter, and that both parties are in a state of siege. The Naranj Kella being occupied by the Prince and the troops, while the rest of the city was in possession of the insurgents. In his letter dated the 26th August, No. 76, Captain Hennell reported that intelligence had on the same day reached Karrak that Sheikh Hussein (the uncle of Sheikh Nasir) in conjunction with Bakir Khan, the Chief of Tungistun, has expelled Mirza Mahomed Hossein, the Persian Governor of Bushire, from that town, and assumed the Government himself, and stated that as it was well known that Sheikh Hossein while at Shiraz was intriguing for the office of Dureya Begee, to the exclusion of the claims of his nephew Sheikh Nasir, the general opinion was that he would oppose the latter, should he attempt under present circumstances to act upon the Firman he was reported to have received from the Shah, nominating him to the Government of Bushire, and that he would be supported in this opposition by Bakir Khan whose object would appear to have been so to embroil matters in this quarter as to compel the authorities of Shiraz to confer the Government of Bushire upon himself, as the only person who possesses the means of maintaining any sort of tran quillity in that town and its vicinity. 'With his subsequent letter dated the 28th August No. 77, Captain Hennell forwarded an official report from the Officer Commanding the vessel of war stationed in Bushire roads, confirming the intelligence of the forcible deposition of Mirza Mahomed Hossein from the Government of Bushire, by Sheikh Hossein and the assumption by the latter of the chief authority in that town.tart Vll-Chap.

We have seen above (Chapter LXlV) that Mr. McNeill left the Eoyal Camp on the 7th of June 1838 for Meshed and Teheran; at Shahrud he received despatches from England instructing him to place before the Shah the strongest disapproval of Her Majesty's Government on the line of conduct His Majesty was pursuing towards Herat. Colonel Stoddart was then sent back to the Eoyal Camp with a message communicating this disapproval. He was also to inform the Shah of the arrival in the Persian Gulf of the British cruisers and the occupation of Karrak. Colonel Stoddart arrived at the camp on 11th August and found the King disposed now to listen to the British proposals. He raised the siege of Herat, and returned to Persia. The Persian Government had yet to make reparation to the British Government in regard to the outrage against the Envoy's courier and the Persian forces had not^yet withdrawn entirely from Afghanistan, and the British Government insisted 'on their evacuation every portion of that country they had occupied. The Shah who felt much embittered against the British for being instrumental in snatch ing Herat from his grasp, was not disposed to comply with the British demands He had sent an_ envoy, Hussein Khan, to England to complain against Mr. McNeill, against whom his personal feelings were extremely bitter, and wishing to await the result of this mission, gave evasive replies to our Envoy Mr. McNeill, who however, on the expiry of the time he had given the Persian Government for coming to a decision, broke off diplomatic relations with that Government, and having ordered the British officers, who had been lent to the Shah, to proceed towards Baghdad on their way to India, he retired to Erzeroum with the members of his mission. 566. The Shah's Envoy Hussein Khan, after meeting various obstacles found his way at last- to England, and succeeded in being fidmitted to an inter® Tiew with the British Minister for Foreign Affairs. Lord Palmerston took up a firm attitude in defence of Mr. McNeill and the Conference broke up with the understanding that the ioreign Office should embody in a memorandum the principal demands of the British Government, which were nine in number namely:— (1) A written apology should be offered by the Shah's Government for the outrage to the British Envoy's Courier. (2) A firman must be published in Persia assuring protection to all persons employed in the British Mission. (3) Ghorian and other places still held by the Shah's forces in Afghanistan should be evacuated. (4) A written apology should be given for the illegal seizure at Teheran of the house of a British officer, (5) All persons who had been concerned in the outrage on the broker of the British Residency must be punished. (6) The Governor of that port, who had affronted Sir P. Maitland, must be removed from his office, and the reason of his removal should be stated publicly by the Persian Government. (7) The claims of a British subject on account of some iron works at Karadagh must be liquidated. (8) The sums due to the officers of the British detachment lately serving in Persia must be paid.

These demands were made in London on 11th of July 1839, but it took a long time before the Persian Government could be persuaded to comply with them all. The Shah's greatest objection was to the evacuation of Ghorian. But the determined attitude of the British Government and his anxiety for the evacuation of the Karrak island compelled him to accede to the essential demands one by one. (ii) Removal of Mirza Assad from the Governorship of Bushire» June 1839—The British Envoy returns, October 1841. On the 5th June 1839, Mirza Assad the Governor and Bakir Khan the Military Commandant of Bushire, were invested with the dresses of honor alluded to therein as having been sent down from the Shah. 666. On the 8th June, however, Mirza Assad received an intimation from the Wazir of Ears that he was removed from the Government of Bushire, and Mirza Mahomed Hussein Khan (the 'Wazir's son-in-law) appointed in his room. A letter to Captain Hennell's address from the Shah's news-writer in that town informed him, that the removal of Mirza Assad from his situation had been directed by the authorities of Ears, in order to prove the sincere desire entertained by them for a renewal of the former friendly relations with th© English. 567. Mirza Assad left Bushire and took up his residence in the neigh bourhood where he intended to wait the reply of the Prince of Shiraz to a petition got up by the Chief Mullah and merchants of the place for his being reinstated in the Government. The town was for the moment under the charge of Bakir Khan. Some of the head servants of the new Governor have arrived and the Khan himself is expected in the course of a few days. 568. The Persian Government had now performed the essential conditions on which the British Government had consented to re-establish diplomatic relations between the two States. A mission was accordingly despatched from London under the direction of Sir John McNeill, which arrived at Teheran on 11th October 184il and was most cordially received by the Shah.2 ? Part VII—Chap.

Lord Palmerstons objection to the proposed purchase of Rarrakfrom Persia-Evacuation thereof ordered on certain conditions-Removal of the detachment. Voiuines69—1170 of 1840, pp. 333-339. ^0. The following correspondence on the above subject is interesting to read :— The Right Hon'ble Sir John Hobhousb, Bart ., etc., etc., etc. 0 IRj I have had under my consideration the letter from your Department of the 17th of August, enclosing copies of letters from the Resident of the East India Company in the rersian (xulf, and intimating with reference to what is stated in those letters, your opinion that it would be very desirable to obtain by purchase a permanent settlement in the Island of Karrak. I have the honor to state to you in reply that if the Persian Government concludes the 1 reaty ol commerce with this country, which it has engaged to sign, the British Government is positively bound to withdraw the British troops from Karrak. But the withdrawal of these Iroops would not render necessary the removal of the Company's Resident, nor the retirement ot any British merchants who may have established themselves in the island, and it would be quite possible, and perhaps expedient, to have a small ship of war often visiting the island tor the purpose of affording protection to British interests. It would, I think, hardly be expedient that a proposal to purchase Karrak should be ma e to the Persian Government, before the British troops are withdrawn from it, because such a proposal might look like a desire to evade the performance of our engagement. But, if you wish it, I will instruct Sir John McNeill to do in this whatever, from his local knowledge of the Persian Government, he may think expedient; and to propose the purchase of the island either before or after the withdrawal of the troops. There is one objection however to such an arrangement, the force of which will not escape you. Persia still owes to Russia a large sum on account of the expenses of the last war in which those two countries were engaged; and Russia would no doubt be glad to commute that debt for territory in Ghilan, the acquisition of which would be of great political and commercial importance to Russia, and would very much strengthen the ascendancy of Russia over Persia, and diminish the means of Persia to maintain her independence. Now, at present, Great Britain is able to object to any such commutation, and to say to Russia that the integrity of the Persian territory, as it now stands, ought not to be trenched upon under pretence of commuting a debt. But if Great Britain were herself to set the example of getting possession of a part of the Persian territory in exchange for money, it is to be feared that Russia would not be slow to imitate the precedent, and Great Britain would then be less able than she now is to object to such an arrangement. If, therefore, as is perhaps possible, almost all the advantages of commerce and the facilities for establishing a coal depot, which the sovereignty of Karrak would afford, might be attained without withdrawing that island from the nominal dominion of the Shah, such a course would have great advantages with reference to the considerations which I have mentioned above.

My Lord, The Commissioners for the Affairs of India having duly considered the letter of the 23rd instant, addressed by Viscount Palmerston to Sir John Hobhouse, I am directed to inform you that as His Lordship does not think it expedient to make any proposal for the purchase of Karrak, they hope that, in accordance with His Lordship's views, as expressed in the above letter, an engagement may be entered into with Persia stipulating that after Karrak shall have been restored to the Shah, a British Resident may be established at that island, and a coal depot or other magazines formed for the use of British steamers or sailing vessels frequenting the Persian Gulf.

LXVIII To— Sir John McNeill, G.C .B., etc., etc., etc. Sir, I transmit to you herewith copies of a correspondence between this office and the India Board respecting the wish of the latter department that measures should be taken for acquiring possession of the Island of Karrak by purchase from the Persian Government. You will see in my letter of the 23rd of August a statement of the grounds on which it appeared to me to be inexpedient that Her Majesty's Government should make to the Persian Government any proposition for the purchase of Karrak. The India Board, as you will gee, acquiesce in the objections which I have stated, at the same time they express a wish that measures should at all events be taken for establishing in Karrak a Kesident and a coal depot, or other magazines, for the use of the British steam and sailing vessels frequenting the Persian Gulf. I have accordingly to instruct you, when the island of Karrak is to be evacuated by the British forces, to explain to the Persian Government that a British Resident will remain there for the protection of British commercial interests, and that a coal depot will be wanted on the Island for the use of the British steam vessels navigating the Tigris and the Euphrates and you will request the Persian Government to order the local authorities in the island to alford facilities for that purpose.

I have the honor to inform you that the Commercial Treatv here alluded to has been signed and that I ha?e received the Shah's ratification to be sent hom^ along with the Treaty. The conditions on which the British Government has directed that the island should be evacuated without further delay have thus been fulfilled by the Government of Persia, and I have therefore*to direct that you will lose no time in causing the evacuation of the island of Karrak by the British troops. If arrangements for the transport of the troops shall not already have been made, I beg that you will communicate with the Resident in the Persian Gulf as to the means of giving the necessary intimation as speedily as possible to the Bombay Government by whom the amount of tonnage required will doubtle-s immediately be furnished, as that Government has certainly for some time been in possession of instructions on the subject. When the British troops shall have evacuated Karrak, you will deliver it up to the person who may be appointed by the Persian Government to receive it, and y^u will inform that officer that the depot of coals for the use of the British steamers will continue to be on that island, and that a British officer will reside there. 572. The detachment of the Bombay Army was withdrawn from Karrak in January-Pebruary 1812. * * * (ii) Removal of the Residency from Karrak—Resident's residence in Summer at Karrak. 573. The Officiating Resident H. D. Robertson removed the Eesidency from Karrak to Bushire in May 1842.* The Resident, however, soon after went back to Karrak and resided there for the summer months. The Persian authorities remonstrated strongly to the British Charge d'Affaires (Colonel I. Sheil) on this proceeding. The following letter dated the 3rd November 184!2 (from Bushire) of the Resident to the address of Colonel Sheil explains the circumstances in which he had proceeded to Karrak and the condition on which he resided there With reference to my letters dated the 11th of August and 3rd October last, I beg to explain that on the 20th of May I recommended to the Government of Bombay to take into serious consideration the advisability on political grounds of making an effort for removing the Resident from the town of Bushire to some plac« at least some miles distant from it inland, or on the coast before expending any money in repairing the Residency there, and that I *Xo arrangements werd apparently made to maintain a Residency at Karrak, as had been intended presumably owing to the Peisian Government's objections.Part VII—Chap. LXVIII 291 received an answer to that letter only on the 10th ultimo; until an answer was received it will be obvious to you that I could not enter on any repairs to this Residency since to have done so wouLl have been to defeat one of the reasons I urged for removing the Residency to another situation. I mention tliis to obviate any misapprehension as to the cause of my not puttino: the Residency here into a habitable state for myself and my Establishment during the summer season. 2. I beg also to apprize you that my residence during the summer away from Head-quarters which were uniunabitiole, was not intended by me co form any ground tor deputation allowance; whether i lived at K.hoormooj or at Karrak, or anywhere else, and that my residence at Karrak although I stayed there to be nearer to my Gulf duties, was considered by myself as private. 3. For the same reason that I did not myself inhabit Bushire, I left it optional with all others of my fcistablishment to stay there or not, excepting those who were absolutely required to bi at Busliira, and one cljrk and one Mirza whom it was absolutely necessary to keep with mvself. My assistant and the surgeon were written to oflBciallv to go to Bushi'e or not just as they pleased ; tor as 1 found that the local business at Bushire would allow of both my assistant and myself being generally absent, without any detriment to the public sei vice, I was unwilling to oblige my assistant and the surgeon to live in quarters so much in dis-repair as theirs were without an absolute necessity. This permission placed them also on the same private footing as mysell: if they chose not to stay at Bushire, but to go to K.hoormooj, Karrak, or elsewhere. They selected Karrak for their summer quarters, and although absent from the Head-quarters, of course drew no deputation allowance any more than myself ; and Government has approved of my having given them iheir option. My assistant and myself nevertheless ran over to Bushire, sometimes for a week, sometimes for more, and on one occasion Mr. Kimball lived there for three weeks till he tiaisned the duty (negotiating Bills for money) on which he was deputed. 4. I sent as few of the guard to Bushire as I could, not only because their quarters were in bad repair there, but because the Doctor having determined to stay at Karrak, it was better to keep as many of them near him in the unhealthy season, as could be left, without danger to the Treasury or Residency, rhere were 18 men :lnrefore of the guard at Karrak—the uther half being at Bushire. Public peons or servants of any kind there are none allowed on my Establishment ; not even a man to sweep the office. 5. I have mentioned these circumstances with the view of shewing he inaccuracy of the opinion of the Persian Ministers, communicated to me in your demi-otficial letter dated the 12th ultimo that I was staying at Karrak as Resident, and with all the pomp and eclat attached to the situation. My flagstaff at Kar.-ak was struck in May, when the flag itself was removed to Bushire, so that all the requisites of pomp which I had kept at Karrak were one English clerk and one Arabic Mirza (but these you can easily believe could give me no pomp, and were only requisites f )r business) the flag, flagstaff. Treasurer, and Accountant^ Departments with all the records having been with half the Escort sent to Bushire and all the rest of my Establishment left to go there or to any other place they pleased, not very far from Head-quarters. 6. Hal I gone to Khoormooj [ have little doubt that mv assistant and the civil surgeon would have stayed half the summer there, iu visits to me and the other half at Karrak where they had the use of a tolerable bungalow. 7. It is unnecessary to say anything on the subject of my having appointed a headman (Ked Khoda) to the Islanders of Karrak, beyond making a simple denial that so foolish an absurdity ever entered my imagination. 574. The naval stores were removed from Karrak to Bassidore in October- November 1842 (Commodore Lowe's letter, dated 5th November 1842, to the292 Part VII—Chap. LXIX. CHAPTER LXIX. OCCUPATION OF KARRAK BY A LAR C.ARRISO\ AND THEN A SIIIRBAUZ GARRISON—THE ISLANDERS EMIGRATE. 575. When the British left Karrak it was handed over to the charge of a garrison from Lar under the leadership of Lutf Ali Khan. But he could not pull on smoothly with his people and his orders were constantly disobeyed by them. He left the place for Bushire, where he endeavoured to raise a band of Shiahs with whom he proposed to fight the Lar Garrison who had disobeyed his orders. He was aided by the public authorities of Bushire and advised by them not to think of abandoning Karrak, but to return to it, and to punish both the troops and the islanders. He of course represented his affairs in the most favorable light, and made it out that he had been turned adrift by a mutiny and rebellion. The Governor of Bushire and the Mujtahid each sent a man to Karrak to dis cover the truth, and to expostulate with the garrison. The garrison having beaten and treated with indignity these emissaries, they were dismissed with a message to their masters, to attend to their own concerns, that Karrak was under the Chief of Lar, and that they could listen to no proposals from the Chiefs of Bushire, that if they sent men to subdue them they should certainly be fired upon, etc. 576. Lutf Ali Khan, supported by the Mujtahid of Bushire, wrote to his Chief in Laristan complaining of the insubordination of his own men and the Mujtahid advised the Lar Chief to send over a body of Shiahs from Bushire to punish the Sunnis of Karrak, both the garrison and islanders. Mirza Abdulla, the Commander of the Lar Troops, and his coadjutor, also wrote to the Lar Chief. 577. In the meantime Lutf Ali Khan sailed from Bushire with about 30 idle Shiahs, whom he bad enlisted at Bushire, and arrived at Karrak in warlike guise. The Lar garrison soon terrified the invaders, who fled on board the boat that brought them, leaving Lutf Ali Khan, their leader, behind them. Nothing, however, was done to molest him. He demanded that he should be allowed to occupy his old quarters in the fort of Karrak and to command his men, but his request being refused, he took up his residence close to the walls. After staying a fortnight there, he one day entered the fort when the gate was open, and having declared that he would cut down any one who refused to obey his orders, a matchlock presented to his breast induced him to retreat. He then took up his quarters in a bungalow beyond the lines, and having one servant, he posted him on a road near to his residence for the purpose of intercepting and bringing to him the unarmed islanders, as they went to, and came from their fields. Some Kharragis were thus taken prisoners, till at length one of them, provided with arms, resisted, a scuffle ensued, and Lutf Ali Khan's man was cut across the head. 577A. Answers were received from the Chief of Lar disapproving of Lutf Ali Khan's proceedings, expressing indignation at the interference of the Muj tahid of Bushire, and intimating to Mirza Abdullah, the de facto Commander of the Lar Garrison, that a relief of the garrison would soon take place, and that a relation of the Chief would proceed to Karrak in command of it, with the most strict injunctions to protect, and not to harass the islanders. The Kharragis were delighted with this intelligence, and seemed to be satisfied that there was every chance of their being able to remain on theil island without fear of oppression. 578. In November 1843 it was, however, reported that the Lar soldiers stationed in Karrak being no longer supplied with provisions from Bushire, had with their Commanders left that island for Laristan and that Lutf Ali Khan remained there alone in occupation of the fort. The Kharragis were represented to be in great alarm that the Buabire authorities or the Prince of 1762 F. D.Part VII—Chap. LXIX. 293 Shiraz would send over a Garrison of Shirbauz who, they feared, would not fail to oppress them, and that their difficulties were greatly increased by the impos sibility of taking to flight at that season of the year, when their supplies of food and dates were now all stored at Karrak. 579. The Government of Shiraz, as was feared, determined to send Shirbauz garrison of about 250 men to Karrak. The prospect of a Persian garrisou settling in the island alarmed the Karragees so much that they made up their mind to emigrate from the place. This resolution they carried out on the 18th September 1843, only a day after the arrival of the garrison. We might quote here the observations of Lieutenant A. B. Kembal, Assistant Resident at Bushire, in his despatch, dated 21st September 1843, to Colonel Sheil, in regard to this emigration and the effect it must have on the British position in the Gulf: — 'The very constitution of the Persian soldiery cause them as a body to become authorized robbers and plunderers in order to obtain the necessaries of life and therefore feared and detested by the peaceable inhabitants of every town in which they may be quartered : their total want of discipline makes them individually wantonly oppressive. The arguments brought forward by the Khargees for supposing that they would be visited by a double share of the oppression and ill-will of Sirbaz may be given shortly as follows:—Karrak previous to its evacuation by the British force had never been garrisoned by Persian troops, which indeed the barrenness of its soil and extreme poverty of its inhabitants would not permit of its entertaining and provisioning. Such revenue as was required (derived solely from the pilots) was punctually and fully paid. They were up to 1838 and have been since 1842 loyal subjects. The nature and strength of the British force was, on its taking possession, such as to set aside all idea of resistance on their part; but it cannot be said that they ever sent their aid in any way or at any time against Persia or its subjects. Persia is now at peace with all the world. What then can be the object of sending so large a number as 200 Sirbaz to garrison a small island containing a population of 300 men, pilots, and fishermen with their families. We can only suppose that they have made themselves obnoxious to the Persian Government by the assistance they afforded in importing provisions in establishing a bazaar, etc., for the use of the British troops and their sole crime is their having bettered their condition under a just and moderate rule, and accumulated small sums which it is intended to extort from them. Their emigration under such circumstances cannot fail, I fear, to entail considerable loss of credit to the British Government in these parts, but not, I hope, any great inconvenience, for as a portion establish themselves on Phelech, an island not much out of the track of vessels proceeding to the Euphrates, pilots will be procurable; and boats for the transport of coals from the shore to the steamers can be towed across from this part and returned in the same manner.^29^ VII—Chap. LXX. CHAPTER LXX. QUESTION OF 8IIEIK1I NASIR'S PRETEXSIOXS TO THE ISLAND OF KARRAK, 1842-1843. 580. In his letter dated 12th December 1842 to Colonel Robertson, Resident at Bushire, Colonel Sheil asked to be informed of the nature of Sheikh Nasir's former tenure over the Island of Karrak ; whether it was his hereditary property, or whether be held the revenue of it as a fief, what amount of revenue he derived from the island or its inhabitants, and whether he has received any equivalent for its deprivation. 581. Colonel Robertson's interesting reply, dated 4ith January 1843, is quoted below in extenso— I havp the honor in reply to the third paragraph of your letter, dated the 13th of December last, to inform you that I can obtain no very precise account of the nature ot: Shelch Ni ^sir 's connection with the Island of Karrak. 2. He possesses neither land nor a house there, and T suppose he cannot consider the fortress as his private property—a garden which the English officers of the Field Detach ment denominated Shekh Nassir^s Garden is not his, but assigned for the support of the tomb of Mir Mahomed, and denominated 'Bin Nassir.' The similarity of the names no doubt gave rise to the mistake of calling it Shekh Nassir's garden. 3. I beg to refer you to the enclosed extract (fifth paragraph) of a letter from Captain Hennell, No. 27, dated the 19th April 1839, to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, as throwing light upon Shekh Nassir's motives for wishing to retain Karrak, and to have it considered as his own property. I also enclose copy of the draft of the letter written by Captain Hennell to Shekh Nassir enclosed in that letter—you will not fail to remark the very extraordinary fact that the reason of the Resident obliging Shekh Nassir to leave Karrak was his dread of its bemg thought we were about to make war on Persia, if we remained on apparently good terms with Shekh Nassir, so decided a rebel as he then was. 4. Captain Hennell in his letter No. 30, dated 31st May 1838, to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, after narrating the cause of Shekh Nassir and his uncle's flying from Bushire to Karrak the previous day, says, 'whether any attempt will be made to wrest the possession of the Island of Karrak from Shekh Nassir remains to be seen, but I am inclined to think that the present authorities of Pars have neither the means nor the energy required for the success of an effort of this description.' 5. I beg to refer you to Captain Bruce's letter to McMorier, dated the 7th of Septeml er 1815, and to its enclosures, as elucidating in some degree the nature of the power whioh ' hekh Mahomed (the grand uncle of the present Shekh Nassir) held over Karrak at that time you will observe that in the second paragraph of his letter, dated 5th August 1815, to the Governor of Bombay, Captain Bruce adverts to Firmans of indemnity having been issued by the Persian Government to Shekh Mahomed's tribe, in consequence of which alone (he said) they returned to their patrimonial Government of Bushire. It would be now expedient perhaps to discover what assurances of rights these Firmans contained; and this you -could probably do at Tehran, as I have no hope of being able to do so here. Some Firman was also issued to Shekh Mahomed when he was conciliated by the Government and returned from Karrak in 1815. 6. The conclusion at which I have arrived from perusing these papers is that Shekli Nassir's ancestors kept possession of Karrak not for the Crown of Persia but to enable them to rebel against it with a certain degree ot security to person and property; a n d that the King of Persia lias not in reality been King of Karrak except by inference or implication, as being the Sovereign of the tribe who claim to be the hereditary Governors of Busuire. 7. Admitting then that Sliekh Nassir is entitled to possess Karrak the question arises— What is the nature of his tenure of it. 8. As I have said above he holds no land there The inhabitants ^re not of his tiibe and are of a different sect of religion. The island was conquered from the Dutch about 70 years ago by Meer Mohunna, a Chief of Bunder Reigh, who defied the power of the King of Persia. This Meer Mohunna became connected with the Great Shekh Nassir not Nassir or Nassir men of whi' h names are descended from him by marriage ] but it was not through that connection that Carrack fell into the hands of the Governors of Bushire and fell out of those of Bunder Reigh (the town on the coast exactly (opposite to Karrack) and I cannot trace any other origin to their acquisition of the island tnan the transfer of it by the Imaum of Muscat to Shekh Nassir son ol Shekh Nawsir a few years after he had conquered it from the followers of Meer Mohunna. Nor can I discover on what terms the Imaum gave it over to Shekh Nasir. Some says he granted it as a present and from friendship j some say Shekh iNasir took it inPart VII—Chap. LXX. 295 farm, and others that he held it in cuptody for the Tmaura. It is probable that it was worth so little in itself to any one that whatever were the grounds of its first acquisition by the Bushire Arabs the Imam never thought proper to claim his interest in it again. It may be incumbent on Shekh Nassir to prove however how his title originated. 9. The nature of Shekh Nassir's title to Karrack is you will observe from what I hav© stated either that of a sovereign, or that of a fief held either trom the Imaum of Muscat or from the King of Persia. 10. I was informed by the Hajee Yacoob when at Karrack that Shekh Nassir was bound to maintain a certain number of Men as a garrison for the island in consideration of paying whom the King gave him the revenues or pilot dues, exigible by the pilots in addition to their own hire. But I have not been able to discover here whether Hajee Yacoob's information is founded on any written provision in the Lease for Bushire, nor indeed can 1 find that any thing is said about Karrack in any way in any Persian docurtient as a dependency of the Persian Crown. On these points I beg to enclose co y of the 3rd paragraph of my letter to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, N'o. 10 of 1842, dated the 1st February 1842. 11. If Shekh Nassir's title to Karrack is that of a Sovereign he may be entitled t 0 indemuification for dispossession according to the pleasure of him who dispossesses him for a s in other cases to take a sovereign's rights is merely to have a longer sword. 12. If Shekh Nassir's title is th it of a hereditary fief frona the Imaum of Muscat he merits on dispossession of it by the King of Persia an annual indemnification equal to the amount of his annual gain on the grounds of its hereditary nature. But if the King of Persia is Lord Paramount of Karrack. and for the good of his Kingdom dispossesses Shekh Nassir of his hereditary fief under the Persian Crown in order to deprive him as a rebel of a stronghold; or in order to be able to maintain the good faith of his Royal pledges to the people of Karrack and prevent the possibility of their being oppressed, both of which eventualities judging from his past conduct may be considered certain, if circumstances called for or allowed of them to be committed by Shekh Nassir, 1 doubt whether he should be considered entitled to have indemnification, for had his conduct been characterized by jjhat of Royalty there would have been no necessity to deprive him of his fief. 13. Should it be deemed necessary however to indemnify Shekh Nassir on account of his receipts and expenditure for a series of years would be the basis probably of the adjustment. The manner also in which Shekh Nassir kept a garrison for the King and the fortress in repair and filled it with stores might be one branch of enquiry. 14. But Persian rules for the attachment of property and persons are so different from those of more civilized countries that to speculate on what a Persian Government may or should do under particular circumstances is perhaps a waste of time. I have the honour, etc., H. D. ROBERTSON, Officiating Resident. Persian Gulf. RESIDENCY IN THE PERSIAN GULP,-) F cshieb, ith June 1S43. ) P.S. —I may here mention that on the present Shekh Nassir's flight from Bushire, 1832, on the murder of his father, he sought refuge in Karrack, and wrote to the Joasmees to come to his aid in attacking Bushire, the plunder of the town being offered to them as a reward. The fear of an intended expedition against him by the Prince of Fars, and want of unanimity in the members of his tribe, induced him to abscond from Karrack, and go to Koweic, just a day or two before the Joasmee fl' j et of fifty boats arrived at Karraek. These allies of Shekh Nassir were prevented from attacking and sacking Bushirp, only by the decision of the Resident and the presence of British ships of war. The Resident considered Shekli Naseir to have been the aggrieved party on this occasion, but he considered it, nevertheless, his duty to save Bushire from ruin if he could. H. D. ROBERTSON, Officiating Resident, Persian Gulf,290 Part VII—Chap. LXXI. CHAPTER LXXI. GOVERXOR OF BUSIIIKE, SHEIKH NASIR. (i) Re-appointmeut of Sheikh Xasir as Governor of Jtushire, 1845. 582. In September 1845, Sheikh Nasir was appointed Governor of Bushire and on his arrival there the Resident and the new Governor exchanged com plimentary visits (Colonel Hennell's letter, dated 9th September 1845). There was every prospect of friendly relations between the Residency and the Persian authorities at bushire for the future. (ii) Proceedings of Lieutenant Kemball relative to a dispute between Haji Abdul Mahomed, the Wulik-ul-Tujjar of Bushire, and Sheikh Hussein Nasir, uncle of Sheikh Xasir, 1849. 583. We have in our records an interesting despatch of Lieutenant Kemball, Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf to Lieuteaant-Colonel Farrant, Her Majesty's Charge D'Affaires at Teheran, dated 15th May 1849, which discloses the feuds of rival factions at Bushire, in which the British Hesideney had to play a part of intermediary. On the 10th May 1849 Hajee Abdul Mahomed, Mulik-ul-Tujjar, sent a verbal communication to Lieutenant Kemball (then in charge of the Residency in the absence of Colonel Hennell on tour in the Gulf) to the effect that owing to the intrigues of Sheikh Hussein Nasir (the uncle of Sheikh Nasir, Governor of Bushire, then at Shirazj who was endeavouring to organize a strong party against him, he considered his life in imminent danger, and he therefore earnestly entreated Lieutenant Kemball either to give him a temporary asylum at the Resi dency in order to assure him a safe and unmolested retirement from the town, or to interpose his influence to check the proceedings of Sheikh Hussein and jescue him from the danger with which he was threatened. Lieutenant Kemball had already understood from various sources that Sheikh Hussein Nasir professing to have received a letter from his nephew conveying com plaints of double dealing towards him by Haji Abdul Mahomed, had publicly made use of expressions most injurious to the latter accompanied with ill disguised threats calculated to give rise to serious alarm in his breast which was indeed manifested by his calling around him most of the principal merchants of the place, who remained in his house night and day pending the adjustment of the quarrel. Sheikh Husseiu Nasir had succeeded in gaining over Sheikh Hussein Saleh, the Acting Governor of the town, and the main grounds of their dissatisfaction were stated to be that the Mulik-ul-Tujjar while prefer ring friendly services to Sheikh Nasir was in fact secretly exerting himself to create distrust and to poison the mind of the Prince Governor towards him with a view to diminish his chance of being restored to the Government of Bushire. 584. Sensible of the difficulty of interfering however indirectly in an affair so purely local without necessarily mixing himself up with matters in which he had no concern, Lieutenant Kemball had to consider how far he should be justified in entertaining the appeal of Haji Abdul Mahomed. Although the brother of an influential merchant of Calcutta, who^e Agent he was known to be and whose passport entitling him to British Consular protection under the hand of the Secretary to the Government of India, he produced—as the Mulik-ul-Tujjar of a Persian Port, Lieutenant Kemball could not of course recognize any direct right in him to British protection. The strongest animosity had existed for a number of years between the parties now at issue, who only lately had appeared very much in the position of principals opposed to each other on the proceedings connected with the attack upon the late Sheikh Yusuf ben Saggar in the summer of 1846, and there was sufficient reason to suppose that Sheikh Hussein, though acting 1762 F. D.Part VII—Chap. LXXI. 297 ostensibly as the adTOcate of his nephew's cause, was really actuated by T p e „ S i of P er f^ al . hostility. Lieutenant Kemball felt assured therefore that the slightest exhibition of indifference on his part would at once seal the fate ot Haji Abdul Mahomed, and under these circumstances he deemed the crisis suffloiently senous to warrant his incurring a certain degree of respon sibility, m order to prevent matters proceeding to extremities and thereby perhaps obviate embarrassment hereafter. 585 Accordingly after some little hesitation he determined to try the effect ot a friendly remonstrance upon the Sheikhs, and he instructed the Residency Mirza to address a note to each, warning him that his desisns had come to his knowledge that in the event of any disturbances beiug the con- sequence, it would be his duty to report the circumstances to Her 'kaiestv's c o, .! r , ' J - ehCTan . an&lt;i that tlle y were sincere in their desire for the return ot sheikh Nasir their present conduct must assuredly only defeat the end thev had in view. ' j ^ On the following morning Sheikh Hussein Nasir sought an interview with Lieutenant Kemball, and on that day and the next, he and the Mulik-ul- Tujjar and Sheikh Hussein Saleh either of their own accord or at the Resident's invitation, paid visits to the Eesidency. On these occasions Lieutenant Kemball uniformly avoided the discussion of subjects connected with the police or fiscal regulations of the place involved in their dispute, and confined himself to impressing upon the parties the necessity of maintaining tranqnillitv to which end alone his^ mediation was directed, as a proof of his decided sympathy in behalf of Sheik Nasir, (who during the latter years of his administration had given general satisfaction); mention was made of the pains Maior Hennell had taken to have his case favorably represented to the Persian Ministers at Tehran as well as m other respects to forward his views, and it was pointed out to the Sheikhs that any recourse to violence on their part even 'id. 'fttpr g rou nds exist than were now urged by them, could not fail to be prejudicial to the best interests of Sheikh Nasir, and perhaps etfectuallv bar his return to his Government, as well as lead to their own ruin. After some conversation Lieutenant Kemball succeeded in eliciting from each a promise M a rv i ^ n0r o all0vv otllers ^ o^r molestation to the 1 u 'Tujjar, Sheikh Hussein Saleh at the same time observin 0 * that in the event of letters being received from his immediate superior at Shiraz authorizing proceedings he would in the first instance give notice of their tenor! 586. On the other hand, Haji Abdul Mahomed assured Lieutenant Kemball with apparent truth, that not the slightest foundation existed for the charge which had been brought against him, that he had it was true received autograph letters from the Prince Governor of the Province (which he presented for perusal) commanding him to give notice to the merchants to suspend payment of Custom House duties until further orders; but that he had declined to act upon them, and finally that his interest as well as his mclmation prompted him to use his best endeavours for the return of Sheikh Nasir to Bushire. As a proof of his sincerity he volunteered to draw out anptishhad Name^ to be addressed to H. R. H. Bahrani Mirza prayin- that the Sheikh might be invested with the usual Khelaat, and be re-appointed to his Government On the night of the 14th May the merchants quitted the dwelling of the Muhk Tujjar for their own homes, and the excitement generally felt throughout the town in consequence of these occurrences was again to all appearances completely allayed. 587. In his subsequent despatch to Lieutenant-Colonel Tarrant, dated 26th May 1849, Lieutenant Kemball reported that notwithstanding his promise Sheikh Hussein Nasir, however, could not bring himself to relinquish his intrigues against the Mulik-ul-Tujjar. A friendly remonstrance from Lieutenant Kemball being without effect, his hostility to that person manifested itself as before, in open threats of violence, concluding by a direct message couched in obvious terms, importing that his absence from the town would be preferable to his further stay, and that his early departure would be convenient. At the same time he took steps effectually to bar his escape by sea suborning his boatmen; and as the event proved, had laid his plans to intercept his exit also by the town gate.298 Part VII—Chap. LXXI. 588. On the 22nd May 1849, the Mulik-ul-Tujjar came to the Kesidency in a state of the greatest alarm, to represent the danger to which he was exposed, and to implore Lieutenant Kemball's protection.- After some time the Assistant Resident succeeded in re-assuring him, but as matters had now proceeded to such extremities, before undertaking to interpose further in his behalf by the exercise of his influence to bring his opponent to reason, he required him to make his communications hereafter in writing. Accordingly on the same evening Mulik-ul-Tujjar addressed the Resident a note, stating that from letters received by Sheikh Hussein Saleh from Sheikh Nasir at Shiraz he had been given to understand the latter had assented to his quitting Bushire ; intimating that he had received a significant hint from Sheikh Hussein Nasir to leave the town, and appealing for advice as to the course he should pursue. To this Lieutenant Kemball replied that his object throughout had been to preserve the public tranquillity and with this view, he would continue to urge Sheikh Hussein Nasir to remain quiet; but that he must be himself the best judge of the measures most likely to ensure his personal safety. 589. The Mulik-ul-Tujjar then wrote representing the impossibility of his remaining at Bushire, and his desire therefore to take his departure for Shiraz via Tungiston—at the same time he communicated the repeated offers of • Dnrinfj th# absence of his Father Banker Ahmed Khan, Acting Governor of the Khan at Shirai. latter place,* to come in with a party of his followers and carry him away and proposed now to apply to that Chief. The expected visit of Ahmed Khan had been exaggerated into a charge by Sheikh Hussein Nasir against the Mulik-ul-Tujjar, of the latter's endeavouring to incite the Tungistun Chief to attack Bushire. That the march however of a body of Tungistunis into the neighbourhood of the town was seriously intended, the Residency was fully made aware by the perusal of a letter under the seal of Ahmed Khan himself; and that Sheikh Hussein Nasir believed it to be so, was sufficiently shewn by his summoning armed parties from Ras Sheho and holding his followers and others in readiness in the town to put down any opposition that might be made on the day fixed for the Mulik-ul- Tujjar's departure. It was moreover subsequently proved by the latter being met at a distance of five or six miles from the gate by a party of about 50 Tungistunis, who advanced thus near to escort him. 590. Mindful of the rule Lieutenant Kemball had laid down for his own guidance at the outset, and looking steadily to the- end he had in view to keep the peace, he at once determined upon discountenancing any appeal to force in the shape of the proposed application to Ahmed Khan. It was evident a collision must ensue on the approach of that Chief which might lead to very serious disturbances, more particularly as a small party of his tribe had already found their way into the town; and it did not appear to him that the chances were at all in favour of Haji Abdul Mahomed's position being improved thereby. In his anwser, therefore, to the Mulik-ul-Tujjar he opposed the measure contemplated, and undertook himself to try and bring about his unmolested retirement by more peaceful and legitimate means. 591. Accordingly Lieutenant Kemball sent to invite the attendance of Sheikh Hussein Saleh, the Acting Governor at the Residency, and during the interview which f )llowed with him, he employed every argument he deemed best calculated to impress him with the expediency of acting with decision, while he had it yet in his power for the purpose of checking disorder. He acknowledged his responsibility, and expressed his willingness to accede to the Assistant Resident's wishes; but so great evidently was the fear of Sheikh Hussein Nasir, which this Chief shared in common with most of the towns people, that he could not be induced to give a definitive reply until he bad consulted his uncle Haji Mahomed. 592. It had been proposed that the Mulik-ul-Tujjar should quit the town in the morning of the 24th, but the hesitation of the parties delayed matters another day which time was taken up by Sheikh Hussein Nasir in maturing his plans for cutting off the escape of his intended victim, and in using his influence to seduce Sheikh Hussein Saleh from the performance of his duty at the time appointed. The latter failed to furnish the promised reply, and it was only in the afternoon of that day, in answer to a note from me sent by the band of the Residency Mizra, that he engaged formally to supply an escort 1782 f.D.Part VII—Chap. LXXI. 299 for the removal of Haji Abdul Mahomed beyond the reach of danger. Sheikh Hussein Saleh relied on the deputation of persons by Lieutenant Kemball to accompany his escort. In consenting to furnish two men from the Resi dency be had afforded the only instance of direct and active interposition on his part throughout these proceedings, and considering the authority of the party by whom Haji Abdul Mahomed's earnest solicitation for such protection was supported bavins: regard to the cowardly attack upon the late Sheikh Eusuf ben Saggar in 1846, and the great danger of a similar scene being enacted on the present occasion, Lieutenant Kemball thought this step was justifiable. 593. The precaution as was shown in the sequel, was by no means ill- advised or unnecessary. At the hour determined upon for the departure of the Mulik-ul-Tujjar, it was reported to the Residency that the gate had been occupied by the G-utni Tribe from Ras Sheho and that the adherent of Sheikh Hussein Nasir in the town had armed in obedience to hi^ call. The two servants from the Residency had already proceeded to the house of the Mulik-ul-Tujjar whom they found possessed with extreme terror ; but the serious risk of a collision at the gate very properly deterred them from moving pending a reference to Lieutenant Kemball who then sent again the Residency Mirza to Sheikh Hussein Saleh with a verbal message to the effect that having committed him so far as to require the attendance of his people, it was too late to retract, and he expected him to fulfil his engagement under the alternative of his receiving Haji Abdul Mahomed into the Residency, and immediately despatching a cossid to Shiraz. This had tlie desired effect. Telling Sheikh Hussein Nasir that he had pledged and must redeem his word to the Residency, he at once proceeded in person with his men to the gate, and cleared a way to the passage of the party, which was permitted to leave without further disorder or accident. ^ The escort from Bushire accompanied the Mulik-ul-Tujjar half-way to Tangistim, where it left him, after he had been joined by a party from that place as already mentioned. 594. The proceedings of Lieutenant Kemball were approved by Lieutenant- Colonel Farrant as most judicious, inasmuch as his mediation prevented the tranquillity of Bushire from being disturbed. Lieutenant-Colonel Farrant hai learnt that the Persian Prime Minister was not likely to confirm Sheikh Nasir in his Government of Bushire, as an admiral, JEsau Khan, had been appointed to proceed to Bushire and assume the command of that port, (iii) Difficulties of the Sheikh Kasir and Major Hennell's advice to him, October 1§49.—Appointment of new Governor of Bushire, Mirza Mehdi Khan. 695. On the 2nd of October 1849, Mahomed Hashem Khan, the nephew Major Hennell'.deBpatch to Lieutenftnt-Colonol of the Haji Kuwaum, Unexpectedly Tarrant, dated the 6th October 1849. entered the town, and proceeding direct to the Residency, requested an immediate interview with Major Hennell on matters of importance. After some preliminary remarks, the Khan put into his hands a communication from His Royal Highness Bahram Mirza, Governor of Fars, the contents of which he (the Khan) proceeded to recapitulate verbally. They were to the effect that His Royal Highness was exceedingly dissatisfied with the irregular and dilatory manner in which Sheikh Nasir transmitted the arrears of revenue due from him, notwithstanding all the favor and protection he had extended towards him, and therefore he had made over charge of Bushire, Khisht and Kumary to Mahomed Ali Khan, the Nizam -ul-Mulk, who had deputed his brother Mirza Mehdi Khan to act as Governorof Bushire for him, whilst Sheikh Nasir proceeded to Shiraz to settle his accounts. That he (Mahomed Hashem Khan) had been sent on in advance to make arrangements for the reception of the new Governor, and to induce the Sheikh to comply with the requisition of His Royal Highness. Tlie Khan talked a good deal about the friendship existing between Great Britain and Persia, and the duty of the several functionaries of the two Governments to assist each other. It was clear the object of his visit was to prevent Sheikh Nasir leaving the place by sea, and possibly occupying Karrak. However, as no direct request was made, the Resident replied in general terms to the Khan s observations. He then left him to wait on Sheikh Nasir for the purpose of delivering his credentials.300 Part VII— C hap. LXxi. 596. In the course of the day the Sheikh himself requested an interview. He came in the afternoon, accompanied only by Sheikh Mahomed, the head of the Dumukh tribe. In his conversation he principally dwelt upon the ungenerous treatment he was now to experience at the hands of the Shiraz authorities, after all the sacrifices he had made—that the attack and capture of Tulisia, and the foray into the Rudhilla districts, which had been stripped of flocks, herds, camels and everything the unfortunate inhabitants possessed, had been executed by the Tungistunis at the instigation of the Nizam-ul- Mulk, Mahomed Ali Khan, whose enmity to him was such that nothing but his (the Sheikh's) entire ruin would satisfy it. That the object of all their aggressions was simply to embarrass his affairs, and by preventing his collecting the usual revenues from the districts, disgrace him with the Prince through his inability to send the quotas of revenue demanded from him. Their intrio-ues he said had succeeded, as, had his districts remained unmolested, be would probably have collected from them a sum equal to the demands existing against him. He had now, he said, come to the Resident in his present unhappy position to ask his advice whether to fly or resist. 597. In reply Major Hennell recommended him to adopt neither of such hazardous and useless plans, but to make up his mind to go at once to Shiraz, where he thought it likely the favorable sentiments entertained towards him by the Prince personally, and other influential persons at his Court, would probably bring about a speedy and satisfactory arrangement of his affairs. This suggestion however Sheikh Nasir positively refused to accept saying that nothing should induce him voluntarily to put himself into the hands of his enemy the Nizam-ul-Mulk, that he would make one more attempt to soften the Prince, and if that failed, he would go away from the place, if leisure were afforded him, but that if he were driven to desperation he would resist. He then asked the Resident whether if called on by the Prince he would interfere. The reply was in the negative , as his instmctions were to abstain from mixing up himself in any way in the local affairs of the place. The Sheikh in the course of the conversation occasionallv referred to the Dumukh Chief for his opinion, and he gave it plainly for fighting as long as they could, and then leaving the place when they were reduced to extremity. He said that the new Governor, Mirza Mehdi Khan was to be accompanied by Bakir Khan, the Chief of Tungistun, as a sort of Wazir. That the late disgraceful defeat experienced by the Tungistunis at Ahmedi, in which they had lost some 50 of their best men, would never be forgiven by their Chief, who would doubtless avail himself of his influence with the Persian Governor, to lay hold of every man of any consequence amon®- them with whom he was now at blood-feud, and make away with him Tha^ their treachery in murdering the Chief of Ahmedi, when they had promised him quarter, showed distinctly how' little reliance could be placed on their pledges or forbearance, and therefore he concluded by saying, they had better die with arms in their hands, than be exposed to the cruelty and revenue of the Tungistun Chief. Sheik Nasir evidently received these remarks with satisfaction, and although he professed his own intention was to leave the place quietly, the impression left on the Resident by the interview was that he would resist vi et armis, the entrance of Mirza Mehdi Khan into Bushire. 598. On the night of the 4th instant, by the Sheikh's orders, Mahomed Hashem Khan with his three attendants and their horses, were embarked in native boat, and taken over to Shif, where they were landed, with a recommendation to make the best of their way to Shiraz. 599. The Bombay Government expressed the opinion that it would have been better had Lieutenant-Colonel Hennell refrained from giving to Sheikh Nasir the advice to proceed to Shiraz, since it might have embarrassed Govern ment had the Sheikh acted on it and met with ill-treatment from the Persian Government (letter dated 30th November 1849). 600. Towards the close of the year 1850 Sheikh Nasir was finally dismissed from the Governorship of Bushire. The grounds on which he was dismissed are explained in the Resident's letter quoted below :— In reply to the enquiry made by Your Excellency in your despatch dated the 15th October last, regarding the ostensible reason assigned for the dismissal of Sheik Nasir, I have thePart VII—Chap. LXXI. 301 honor to state that the very large deficiency in the annual revenue, payable by the Governor of Bushire, for the last two years, is the cause publicly assigned for his supersession. 2. In respect to the latter portion of Your Excellency's enquiry, whether in my opinion, this measure is in any degree connected with the friendship which existed between Sheikh Nasir and myself, I beg to say, that so far as the authorities of Shiraz are concerned, I should be inclined to reply in the negative. My impression however is that an idea has been floating for some time in the mind of His Excellency the Prime Minister, that considering the intimacy which hai for several generations existed between the English and the Sheikh's family, it would he for the interests of the Persian Government that this 'principal seaport of Persia should be under the control of persons wholly unconnected with us, and who would be more immediately subject to the influence of the inland authorities than it was likely any member of the Ali Muzkar family would be. It was probably under some impression of this nature that Esan Khan was nominated to the post of Dureya Besrgee during the time that Bahram Meerza was Prince Governor of Fars, and it is not unlikely that Sheikh Nasir has been summoned to Court on the present occasion in furtherance of this idea : Be this as it may, it is impossible to deny that in the great defalcation in the Bushire tribute, the Persian Government have a plausible reason to justify the removal of Sheik Nasti from the Government of that place. 3. The Sheik may plead with some justice, that the irregular and aggressive proceedings of Bakir Khan of Tungistoon, by depriving him of the revenue of the outlying districts interrupting the trade of Bushire and obliging him to maintain a large garrison at a very heavy expense, have necessarily occasioned a great falling ofE in the amount of his annual payments for the last two years. On the other hand, the reply is not without foundation, that a Persian Governor, being free from all bias, and having no local interests, would not, like the Sheik, be perpetually engaged in feuds and quarrels with his neighbours, and consequently no interruption would be experienced in the regular collection and transmission of the revenue.Part VIIL British Residents and Agents in the Persian Gulf and at Maskat, 1823-1853.' • For previoui history see Farts IV &amp; V.Part VIII—Chap.

Letter Secret, 17th October 1832. 2. 'We find that as early as the 11th o£ June 1827, the Efon'ble M. Elphinstone then Governor in a Minute of that date, subscribed to by the Members of his Council, recorded his opinion of the propriety of abolishing the Residency at Bussorah in the following words ; u The Bussorah Residency might, I think, be easily spared; but I would not abolish it at present because Sir John Malcolm is so much fitter to decide on the necessity of the situation. 'We may take it as a prospective reduction/' 8. With reference to this opinion, Sir John Malcolm in a minute under date 12th March 1828, said—*' Though I still keep in view the prospect of reducing the expense of our Agencies . in Persia and Turkey by another arrangement for their duties, I do not think, at the present moment, when Russia may be said to be at war with the Porte, and when the Imperial forces occupy Aderbijan that we can recall Major Taylor from Bussorah without creating impres- sions very unfavorable to our interests in that part of Asia/' 4. Russia ceased to be at war with the Porte and the Imperial forces to occupy Aderbijan, but her proceedings subsequently in respect to Turkey may have required the continued deten tion of an Agent at Bussorah. 5. In our letter dated 28th July 1830, noticing the postponement we said, that as it ' was solely grounded on the war between Russia and the Porte, we shall be happy to learn that you consider the present position of affairs such as to permit you to resume your original intention/ , 6. The Committee appointed to enquire into the state of the finances of British India in 1830 said—' In the course of our investigation into Eeport dated 26th April 1830, paragraph 43. the rise and progress of these establishments in the Persian Gulph we have been led to compare the charges at Bushire and Bussorah, with which the British Government is now burthened with those that sufficed for the same establishments at periods when our trade and intercourse in that quarter were more active and flourishing than at present, and the result on our minds is that there is no reasonable ground^whatever for con tinuing such costly agencies in the Gulph of Persia as are now maintained/' 7. The Committee recommended that one Agency alone should be maintained in the Gulph and that Bushire should be its station. And with a view to form a correct estimate of the expense which it would require, they remarked as follows:— &lt;&lt; regard to the salary and establishments to be assigned under the proposed modification 0 w to the Political Agent in the Gulph we have advert- Ib., paragraph 47. e( j ^ na t ure of the duties of the Resident and the grounds on which the salary and establishment were fixed by the Supreme Government in 1806 so as to be enabled to form a correct judgment of the comparative business at the former and the present period. And we find by the instructions conveyed by the Supreme Govern ment to the Resident Mr. Smith, that this gentleman was appointed Commercial Resident at Bushire, and vested on the part of the Supreme Government with the political intercourse between the King of Persia and the British Government. We need here only notice the fact that there are now no commercial transactions to be performed by the Resident, and that th« Charge d'Affaires at Tehran is the channel of communication between the British Government and Persia, to convince Your Lordship in Council that so far as these two^ duties aic concerned&gt; the appointment of Resident at Bushire has become altogether nugatory.'306 Part VIII— Chap. LXXII. 8. The Committee then go on to show what further duties remain. They sum them all up in the surveillance of the Arab Chiefs in the 76., paragraphs 49 and 51. Gulph which, they say, the extermination of the system of piracy which formerly prevailed in the Gulph renders now a matter of little diffi culty ; and they conclude in these words ' The duties which will devolve on the Political Agent ia the Gulph by the abolition of the Bussorah Agency will be very trifling/' 9. The Supreiaa Government in transmitting to you this Report informed you that ' the suggestions cmtainel in it had met with their Latter 28th September . entire approba'ion, and that so far as they were able to form a judgment the economical measures proposed were expedient and 3Qdicious. ,, 10. Besides the opinion thus declared by the Supreme Government and the Finance Committee, that the duties to be performed by way of Agency in the Persian Gulph are trifling, there is evidence on record that such was also the opinion of Sir John Malcolm. 11. lu his Minute dated Dapoorea 18fch September 18^8, having supposed the case of the Paragraph 117. abolition of the Bushire Residency, he says, 'that I am satisfied cannot be done at this moment whatever may be the case hereafter evidently resting 1 the utility of any such residency on temporary circumstances, not at all on any permanent grounds j and we are at no loss to ascer tain those temporary circumstances ; they were those assign id in his Minute of the preceding March quoted above, namely, the war in which ttu-sia was then engaged with both the Turks and Persians. 12. In the same Minute Sir John declares an opinion which merits particular attention ; that while we have a political mission at Tehran, another in the Gulph tends rather to evil than good. ft While we maintain ' he says ' a mission at Tehran every minor local authority of Parao-r h 6 0Ur G' ove:rumen ^' ia ^ ^ las a political character must a ' be productive of mor^ evil than good. No caution can prevent the falsehoods and intrigues with which the Prince at Shiraz, the Sheik of Abushire and others will endeavour to convert the English Agent into an instrument to secure or to promote its interest/' 13. He declares-in the same Minutes that it is 'among the petty States in the Gulf Parao-ra h 7 alone, that the influence of a Resident is re- aragiap . quired,' and yet he says in another Minute, 15th September 18-8. dated on the preceding day k with respect to any interference in the local disputes or differences, no better general rule can be given for Major Wilson's Government thau that suggested by the Envoy at the Court of Tehran, who in „ answer to a reference upon this subject observes dge 8a ' ' I should feel inclined to suggest the interdic- Paragraph 2. ^ion of the Resident from all interference in the intestine quarrels of the different chiefs/ ' 14. The views above stated in regard to the duties of the Residency at Bushire appear to us to admit of some qualification. The surveillance of the Arab Chiefs in the Gulf appears to us to be a matter of greater difficulty than was contemplated by the Civil Finance Committee. We shall advert more particularly in a separate letter to the correspondence of Major Wilson while acting as Resident at Bushire which was transmitted with several of your letters dated in 1831 and lh82. A perusal of these interesting papers has led us to attach a higher importance to the surveillance of the affairs of the Gulph than is given to it in the preceding extract from the Report of the Finance Committee. The fact indeed of the destruction of the piratical vessels in 1819, and the General Treaty which Sir W. Keir Grant on that occasion entered into with the Arab Chiefs might lead to an opposite inference hut the case of the Morbut vessel, as described in Major Wilson's letter to you of the 13th August 1829, is of itself sufficient to shew that the disposition of the Arab tribes, to relause into their former habits of piracy, still exists in considerable force. It shews also that this tendency can be checked on the part of the officer stationed at Bushire, only by constant vigilance and by his command of means to follow up every case by an instant application of an armed force adequate to chastise and coerce, 15. We are still, however, of opinion that the Agency in Persian Gulph admits of consider able reduction without any detriment to its efficiency. The officer at Bushtre might be an Assistant to the Envoy in Persia, and such an arrangement while it would secure the presence of an individual competent to the duties of the situation from the opportunity of distinguish ing himself in their discharge, and the prospect of eventual promotion which it might 3 hold out would at the same time possess the additional advantage of placing our interests both in Persia and in the Gulph under one superintendence. To u 3 it appears that the duties at Bushire are evidently in their nature a branch of the duties which the organ stationed in Persia to watch over the interests generally of the British Government in that quarter ou^ht to discharge, and by no other immediate instrument can they be so conveniently discharged We are satisfied that all the proper business of an Agent in the Gulph might, be performed by an Assistant of the Envoy in Persia. The advantages would be considerable in two ways. In the first place, there would be a great saving of expanse, the pay of an Assistant and a very moderate establishment, being all that would be required. And in the next place, there is every probability that all that is useful and necessary in the business would be better 1762 F. D.Part VIII—Chap. LXXII. 307 performed. The relations of the British State with all the Powers in that quarter, small as well as great, all having connections with one another either amicable or hostile, all requiring to be looked at in that one point of view in which they may affect the British interests, would then be comprehended in one plan of superintendence and managed upon a uniform system. We do not think it necessary to enlarge upon these advantages; because all that we should say will occur to yourselves. Without desiring you immediately to act upon these suggestions we desire you to take them into your serious consideration, and without delay to make us acquainted with the result of your deliberations. We shall also desire the opinion of the Suj reme Government on the subject, and shall instruct them to communicate their sentiments to you. If the Supreme Government should agrpe with us in the propriety of the measure it should be carried into effect with all convenient dispatch. 16. In case the officer at Bushire should be converted into an Assistant to the Envoy in Persia, some discretion should be allowed to him in respect to the supervision of the affairs of the Gulf, and to the communications into which he may have occasion to enter with the i'ersian authorities in the vicinity, under such general instructions as he may receive from his superior at the Court of Persia. I' or instance in the case of an act of piracy, like that already mentioned, which w r as committed by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the Morbut vessel in 182.9, it should be competent to him without a previous reference to I ehran to protest at once, as Major V'\ ilson did against the act, to detain the cruisers on their mpnthly visit to the Gulf, and to demand and obtain a restitution of the property by the adoption of measures similar to those which were in that instance taiccefsfully resorted to ; and all this wi'hout committintj the Government to any particular course, in regard to subsequent measures for obtaining such redrets as could not be accomplished by amicable remonstrance. 17. In thus recommending that a certain discretion should be given to the Assistant at Bushire of acting without previous reference to his superior at Tehran, it is not our intention that he should consider himself at liberty to enter into correspondence or have direct communi cation with the Prince at Shiraz or any other Pert-ian authority on matters unconnected with piracy in the Gulf, or with cases affecting the immediate security of the lives or property of British subjects. Even in su^h cases as well as in his communications with the Arab Chiefs under his supervision, the Assistant should immediately report his proceedings to his superior at Tehran, transmitting at the same time, if it weie a case of urgency, a copy of his dispatch to the Envoy to the Governor-General in Council, through the channel of your Government which would then have an opportunity if the occasion were too urgent for the delay of a reference to the Governor-General in Council, of taking on your own responsibility immediate measures, either by supplying the Assistant at Bushire with such instructions as he might require, and the Envoy in Persia had not authority to convey or by dispatching an adequate force to the Gulph. 18. The actual state of the Pachalick of Bagdad and the peculiar complication of cir cumstances in which the relations of the various Powers connected with that part of the world are at this moment involved, put out of the question, as we thiuk, the idea of any change at present in the system under which the Political Agency at Bussora is managed. W e desire, however, that the contemplated measure of uniting the two Agencies, and bringing the entire business of the Gulf under one management, may not be lost sight of, but carried into effect as soon as a change of circumstances may render that arrangement expedient. 19. From the view which we thus take of the duties of a British Agency in the Gulf, and of the best mode of providing for the discharge of ihem, you will anticipate the conclusion we have come to on the project which for fometime has been entertained by your Government, of obtaining the cession of an island in the Gulf on which to station the British Residency. 20. In December 1827 the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Major TVilson, was instructed to visit the several stations in the Gulf, which might be deemed suitable for establishing the Residency in case of its removal from Busliire. Major V\ ilson performed this duty and pointed out the Island of Kharrack, at a small distance from Bushire, as the most eligible situation. And Sir John Malcolm in his Minute already referred to, dated Depooree 15th September 1828, expresses a strong opinion of the advantage which would attend an arrangement with the Persian Government for transferring the Residency to that station. 21 The Supreme Government noticed this Minute of your Resident in their letter to your Government, dated 29th November 182S, Paragraph 131. wor( i s « w ith advertence to the state of affairs in Persia, contemplated by Sir John Malcolm, His Lordship in Council concurs in opinion that it might he an object of great consequence to possess an insuhir position, and safe harbour for our Marine. Previously, however, to instructing the Envoy to Persia to endeavour to obtain the grant of Karrack, the Governor-General in Council is desirous of being furnished with a comparative statement of the expense of the piesent establishment of the Residencies at Bushire and Bussorah and an estimate or every expense attending the acquisition of an island in sovereignty in the Persian Gulr, including of course charges for buildings, maintenance of troops and other establishments. 22. We observe that the sole advantage recognized by the Supreme Government as accruing from this acquisition is its accommodation with respect to the Marine, they do uot seem to have contemplated any advantage of a diplomatic kind.308 Part VIII—Chap. LXXlI- 23. The Finance Committee in 1830 adverted to the project in the following words : Supra, paragraph 41. ' A , s f the i 11 question would probably be attended with great expen se at all events must be preceded by considerable delay, we propose that the Agent should reside at Bushire.' 24. On the 16th September 1880 the Supreme Government were obliged to remind Paragraph 162. y ou they had received no reply from you to the above demand for information as to the expenses of Karrack. 25. On the 4th December 1830 you transmitted a statement of the actual expense of the two Residencies at Bussorah and Bushire, and of what would be the expense of one establishment at Karrack presenting a saving of H59,820 per annum. 28. On the 13th January 1S31 the Governor-General announced to you that, this was Paragraph 178. on ^y P ar t of the information which you had been ^ „ i, * i • .. required to furnish that you had stated only the yet to be supplied.

Ynn ^ rceive the result to which the question, as relates to Karrack, is brought. co elude that the occupation of the island might be followe 1, by a savins of half a lac of rupees per annum in the civil expenses, but that it would be attended'by a mili- r 0 \ P er annum : that is to say, would entail an additional annual expense of one lac and a half of rupees ; besides the immediate outlay of a lac of rupees or uildings and the annual charge whioh would afterwards be required lor repairs. A greater saving in the civil expenses than that which you think might be effectei by the occupation of Karrack, we have no doubt may be effected without it, and the whole of the militiry expense be avoided. After full consideration, therefore, wa do not feel ourselves prepared to give our consent to the project respecting Karrack. p P oO. The Resident at Bushire, alarmed by the appearance of the plague at that place removed with his establishment to the little Island of Co rgo on the 12th March 1832 and returned to Bushire on the 29th June.

Vertlne Re9ldent into au A8si9tant '&lt;&gt; E'voy ot Persia is at variancePart VIII—Chap. LXXII. 309 3. Mr. Blane, as stated in Mr. Chief Secretary Norris' letter of the 4th instant^ having arrived at the Presidency on leave of absence, an early opportunity was taken of obtaining from that gentleman his opinion on certain points discussed in the Honourable Court's despatch, and I have now the honour to transmit for the purpose of being laid before His Ex cellency the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India in Council, a copy of a letter from him containing bis sentiments on the proposed arrangement for abolishing the Bushire Residency. 4. Mr. Blane has resided at Bushire for upwards of two years and a half and has con ducted the duties of the Residency to tin entire satisfaction of this Government ; he has avoided with singular address and management all the evils anticipated by the Honourable Court from an interference on the part of the British political authority at Bushire in the quarrels of the Persian and Arab Chiefs, To Mr. Blane's opinion therefore the Right Honour able the Governor in Council attaches great weight and entirely considers it due to that officer to state, that he doubts exceedingly whether any young assistant sent to Bushire to discharge the same duties would have got rid ot the many perplexing affairs he had to manage with equal dexterity even with the inducement held out to him of eventual promotion as the reward of his exertions. His Lordship in Council is moreover of opinion that business remaining as at present, inefficiency will be the result of the change, and referring, not so much to the quantity as to the quality of the work to be performed, should be very sorry to exchange a Resident for an Assistant of probably less experience and judgment. 5. The Right Honourable the Governor in Council cannot discover one single advantage in placing the Arab and other piratical Chiefs under the supervision of the Envoy in Persia. In the first place, the Envoy has no knowledge of them and takes no interests in their affairs, and in the next place, it is of vital importance that the authority on the spot should be empowered to act on his own judgment and responsibility in order to admit of the instant application of force so justly dwelt upon by the Honourable Court. 6. In considering this subject it is of importance to bear in mind that all the British interests in Persia are at this moment actually placed under one superintendence, that of the Envoy, for the Resident is strictly prohibited from interfering, and in fact never does interfere in Persian politics, and that for many years past the suppression of piracy has been the chief proposed object of the establishment in the Gulph. For suoh purpose in the opinion of the Governor in Council, a Political Officer of experience with an adequate force at his disposal if requisite, for it is hardly to be expected that the assistant could possess the same weight with even the officers of the Indian Navy and still less if the duty as recommended by His Excel lency the Right Honourable the Governor-General, shall hereafter be performed by the Royal Navy. The control over the Naval forca being vested in his superior at Tabriz except in cases of emergency, and as there is a wide distinction between the protection of British trade and the suppression of piracy, these cas &gt;8 of emergenoy will frequently occur, and it may so happen that future embarrassment will be experienced when old Captains in the Royal or Indian Navy shall be placed at the disposal of a young assistant. It would in the opinion of the Governor in Council be better at once to retire from the position we have taken in the Gulph than to run any risk of impairing the efficiency of the present system. 7. The monthly cost of the establishment in Gulph amounts to H4,690 ; the Honourable Court anticipates a large saving by the proposed exchange to this point the Resident's atten tion has been directed and except a prospective saving of about 100 rupees per mensem in the salary of the Treasurer. Should the duties of that office be transferred to one of the clerks on the Resident's establishment no reduction can be made. 8. The Finance Committee fixed the salary of the Resident at B,2,100 per mensem and abolished the situation of Assistant. The Governor in Council is not inclined to recommend either the one or the other, referring to the qualities required of the individual selected and to the inexpediency of leaving that remote station with only rme European officer. A medical officer is absolutely necessary, but possibly hereafter the duties of the Surgeon and Assistant might be combined. 9. I am further desired to state that His Lordship in Council foresees nothing but embarrassment in this Government taking upon itself the responsibility of furnishing the Assistant with instructions as suggested in the latter part ot the 17th paragraph of the Hon ourable Court's despatch quoted in the 1st paragraph of this letter, and has no hesitation in saying that he would feel great repugnance in giving directions to an officer belonging to another Government and not placed under the sole control of this Government. 10. In the event, however, of the Residenjy being abolished the Right Honourable the Governor in Council is of opinion that all the records should be sent to Calcutta and that tins Government ought to have no more communication with the Assistant at Bushire than it has now with the Envoy at Tehran. ] 1. Under the above stated circumstances the Right Honourable the Governor in Council trusts that His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor-General ot India in Council will consent to leave the question at issue to the decision of the Honourable the Court ot Directors. It appears that as a result of this protest, the status quo was allowed to be maintained. £ r 2310 Part VIII— Chap. LXXIII. CHAPTER LXXIII. RESIDENTS AT BUS111RE, 1823 31. 603. We bave seen above (Chapter XXXIV, paragraph 291) how Mr. William Bruce was removed from Bushire and Captain McLeod was appointed in his place. In making this appointment the following minute was recorded by the Governor Mountstnart Elphinstone dated 31st October 1822, in which all the members of the Board concurred :— Poona, 31st October 1822. M inute by the G overnor. It being- absolutely necessary in consequence of Captain Bruce'g removal to appoint a successor without delay, I be^ to recommend Lieutenant McLeod and I have the honor to enclose a draft ol instructions which I would recommend should be issued to him. The known abilities, temper and judgment of Lieutenant McLeod form his best recom mendation. Ihey hive again been strongly brought forward by the Commissioner in a report not yet transmitted to the Board. I should have preferred sending a civil servant but I know no one capable of so arduous an omc,! and quahried for it by standing and knowledge of Asia who would accept the appointment and none even of the junior part of the service who would consent to renounce the advantageous prospects held out by the general line of promotion for the purpose of devoting himself permanently to the duties of the Gulph. On the other hand, it is of great importance that the officer entrusted with this duty should continue to exercise it long enough to complete his experience and establish his character among those with whom he is to negotiate. The importance of the station is evinced by the serious inconvenience brought on us by the mistake ot its present occupant, and it will be increased by the removal of the station at Kisnm which leaves us nothing but the ability of our Resident to depend on for preventing the necessity of new and repeated expeditions. I know no person so well qualified to accomplish this difficult task as Lieutenant McLeod ami l tnererore attach the greatest consequence to his appointment. With respect to Lieutenant McLeod's salary, although Captain Bruce has alreadv represented m a private letter its inadequacy, I think it better to act on the plan alreadv suggested of giving the Resident an additional allowance whilst moving in the Gulph. which it w V ' be ® ne , oura |[ ed to do by visiting the several ports of the Chiefs who are parties to f ier i S fen g ^ P erinanen % at ^1,500; he should therefore be permitted to draw ft500 per mensem when absent from Bushire on duty in lieu of all ^n^ngencies excepting travelling expenses by land or such a remuneration to the Commander o e Cruizer on which he may embark, as the Superintendent of Marine may recommend.

In April 1840, a British Resident was appointed at Maakat to assum e tti e -lojrt charge (under the general superintendence Volume 1174 of 1840, p. 72. of t | e V Resi(ient ^ the Gulf) of the conduct of political relations on the province of Oman and along such portions of the coast as could be more conveniently controlled from Maskat than from Karrak. Captain Bamerton was appointed for the post and the following instructions were issued to him by the Kesident on 13th April 1840 Under the instructions of the Honourable the Governor in Council, I hava the honour to acquaint you that you have been selected for the performance of certain political duties at the capital of His Highness the Imam. The object of deputing you to Maskat, is that you may assume charge (subject to the general superintendence of the Kesident in the Persian Gulf) of our political relations with His Highness in the province of Oman, and along such a portion of the coast as may be more conveniently controlled from Maskat than Karrak. The credentials which in the first instance are now furnished to you, convey little mor e than the assurances of the most cordial and friendly feeling on the part of the British Govern ment towards that of the Imam, and state as the reason of your deputation to his capital that it is thought highly expedient in the present state of affairs, that the close alliance between the two States should be made clearly apparent, and that His Highness should have near his person a confidential and capable Agent, with whom he may consult, or through whom he may fully and instantly communicate with the Government in India in any difficulty. You will of course make it your constant study to cultivate a close, intimate and confiden tial intercourse with the Imam, so as to convince His Highness that the promotion of his rea 1 welfare and interests is considered the primary and important object of the British Government* * Whether it will be consistent with the views of the Government to maintain a British officer as its Agent at Maskat in the event of the Imam returning to Zanzibar, will depend upon circumstances. At all events, it would be highly conducive to the public interests, if you could succeed in establishing a friendly influence with those members of the family of His Highness, who are likely to be left in charge of his Arabian possessions during his absence. I would further remark that the opinion of the Bint-ul-lmam t poeset-ses considerable influence in the Maskat Council, and therefore her good-will would materially promote the objects of your mission. You are already aware that between the years 1800 and 1809 no less than four casualties (probably occasioned by the climate) occurred in regard to the different European officers who were stationed at Maskat. It is however the opinion of the Honourable the Governor in Council that the greater knowledge which we have since gained of this part of Arabia may perhaps admit of your moving about in His Highnesses territories, and should such prove necessary to quit them altogether during the unhealthy season. In adopting the tormei alternative you will of course be careful to avoid exciting the Imam's jealousy and constantly remember, that it is to the influence it is hoped that your personal intercourse with His Highness may enable you to acquire, that we may best expect to forward the views of the British Government. Taking into consideration the climate and the necessity which will exist for you to leavft Maskat occasionally, the Honourable the Governor in Council is pleased, subject to the confirmation of the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India, to assign to you a consolidated allowance of R (800) eight hundred per mensem while employed upon this duty, in addition to which, on embarking in any of the Honourable Company s vessels ot war the established allowance for the entertainment of an officer of your rank will be defrayed by Government. The mode in which your official intercourse with this Residency should be carried on, may be arranged hereafter. For the present you will have the goodness to correspond directly with the Bombay Government, furnishing me with copies of your communications, tor my intorma- tion. , Enclosed, I have the honour to hand you a letter of credentials to His Highness the Imam ot Maskat; its contents on all material points are the same as those detailed m the 3rd paragraph of this letter. Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes having complied with my application by placing your services at my disi osal, I have the honour to request that you will make arrangements with t e Master of the Barque, Sir Herbert Compton, for your convevance to Maskat,; that being the only suitable opportunity for your joining your station, likely to offer for a considerable time. The sum disbursed by you for passa ge money will of course be a public charge. * Captain HHmerton was subsequently created a Consul by the bis Consulate at Zanzibar, where the Imam henceforth principally resided. No British officer was •ppomt d at Maskat until 1861. . m. -r • «. 2 « 9 t The Imam s aunt. S SS316 Part VIII—Chap. LXXVI. CHAPTER LXXVI. APPOINTMENT OF ASSISTANT RESIDENT IN THE PEUSI IN GULF, 1835-1853. 608. On the Gth of April 1835, the Supreme Government recorded a Kesolution, atter a review ot the Bushire Residency to the effect that I „ t' The + 0 ® ce of Assistant to the Resident be abolished, after the resignation or departure of Lieutenant Hennell, the present incumbent, and that after such abolition the charge of the Sur'reou 0 ' 0n ^ emergency, until otherwise provided for, shall devolve' in the 609. In February 1838, the question of Lieutenant Hennell's promotion or resignation having arisen, the Government of Bombay pressed on the Supreme Government a reconsideration of the orders directing the abolition of the Offlco of Assistant Resident. The Bombay Government observed that the state of our relations with Persia might require the presence of the Agent in the interior to counteract Russian intrigues, and that it would be impolitic then to require him to remain on the coast, which he would be compelled to do had he no one to look after the affairs of the Gulf. 610. The duties of the Resident as connected with the affairs of the coast not being of a nature likely to fluctuate in amount, and being the substantial grounds on which the Bombay Government then recommended the retention 21sl o^Ka^y 183 0 8 :- SiStant ^ eXplailie(1 in their ^tter of the principal part of these duties consists in a general sunervisinn of flir. onoot-r, r the embouchure of the Euphrates to the Ras-el-Had, on^helS Z Cat ersian sides of the Gulf ; having for its object the suppression of piracy within these limits • neX rinf 6 e 1 xtreme 1 dl 1 s ^ n 1 ce l at something under 800 miles, this will give a tract of coSt rf eaily 1,600 miles, inhabited by vanous tribes, and governed by different Chieftains With most of whom, as well as with the Native Agents residino-in some of theiV o ^ intercourse .3 maintained for the purpose of speedily adjusting disputes, aSd ot promrtlv ■uppressing every exhibition of a piratical spirit. It is not nossible for R.ST f 7 supenntcud thrs extended wrrespondence which involves the labour of translatino-the numerous letters and replies into English, Arabic and Persian, and to devote that attantlnn ^ fh! general policy of the Gulf which is necessary for the maintenance of peace and trammillitv amongst so many warlike and predatory Chiefs. tranquillity It frequently occurs that questions affecting onr policv or the disnlav r&gt;f o f i disposition on the coaatjcall for the presence of the Resident on the spot, at a time whm the state Of affairs on the south of Persia or on the Arabian Coast in the ipner mrt of h» 0,.lf make it m an equal degree inexpedient that he should be absent from his post, at a dfs ance if perhaps three or fonr or even of seven hundi-ed miles; and the advantages of h ^ine abk to l^ft l a '''f .' n 3 ' ! Assi ' ta ' t who C01 ' M be entrusted to conduct the correspond- requirfcltnf' ^ ' &lt;leSpatehe&lt;1 ^ dutie3 o£ ^ too eviS to 61 1 The Bombay Government further observed that, in the event of th* sudden illness of the Resident, or his absence from any other cause, it was important to have a person on the spot who could take the management p. . al f i t,ic mtneate questions arising out of our relations with the Gulf Chieftains, and that the Residency Surgeon, on whom it was intended by Government of India that this duty should devolve was 'in no way connected with the office and that his duties did not admit of his being sent on detached service. The Government of Bombay proceeded to say— d • ^ ^ ^i 111 ^ es ^ re( ^ state that even if such an appointment had never existod Pn™ in Couocil under the present posture of affairs in Persia, and of our political'relations that country, would have felt disposed to recommend that an Assistant should be .&gt;iveu to the Resident at Bushire. It is conceived that an active and intelligent officer who would acouir* a loca knowledge of the country, a perfect familiarity with the Wnaue an,l « , = 9 I acquaiiitence w.th the Chiefs, the tribes, the men o/influenc' and fhTfSte of Lwon fhtr^^ts^e.' 6 TCry USe£Uny emPl0yed aUd miSbt ^ o£ 'fndTrPart VIII—Chap. LXXVI. 317 612. On this the Government of India yielded, and agreed to the nomina tion of an Assistant Resident ' with reference to the extent of the duties likely to be thrown upon the Residency in the Persian Gulf at the present time.' Lieutenant Edmunds, an officer of the Bombay Army and an excellent Oriental scholar, was appointed accordingly. 613. In September 1841, the above officer having died, the Government of Bombay selected Lieutenant A. B. Kemball to succeed him, without making any special reference to the previous discussion. 614. To this the Government of India replied on the 29th of November -1841, pointing out that the present was a favourable opportunity for ascertaining whether the services of a fixed Assistant could not be dispensed with: that perhaps the Resident might not find it necessary to visit the coast, except on extraordinary occasions, when the Residency Surgeon might carry on the current business and that the Chiefs of the Coast might be communicated with through the Commodore in the Gulf. 615. To this the Bombay Government replied on the 31st of December 1841, forwarding a communication from Captain Hennell, the Resident, and stating that the situation of Assistant Resident ' could not with prudence and safety be abolished' though the salary might be reduced from R817 to R 700 a month. Captain Hennell's views on the subject are given at some length in his letter, from which the following is an extract:— ' Of the extent of the Native correspondence of the Residency in the Persian Gulf, it maj be sufficient to remark, that the surveillance of the political authority extends over upwards of 1,600 miles of coast inhabited by a variety of tribes, and governed by different Shaiks with most of whom a constant communication is maintained, not merely referring to the suppres sion of piracy but also to their own intricate relations and affairs. The translation of this correspondence into English&gt; Persian, and Ai-abic, must necessat'ily occupy so much of the time of a functionary not fully conversant with the languages of the countries; and the political bearings of the various and conflicting interests on the shores of the Persian Gulf, ns to interfere materially with his correspondence with the Government, as well as with those political authorities with whom he is in communication. ' In the above observations I have supposed the Resident to be in some measure conver sant with the Arabic and Persian languages, but cases might occur (as in the instances of Colonel Stannus and Major Wilson) in which that functionary might be entirely unacquainted with them. Under such circumstances the presence of an othcer qualified to act as an interpreter would be absolutely necessary. During the period the two gentlemen above referred to conducted the political affairs of the Gulf, the correspondence was not of half the extent it is at present, but I can state with confidence that while I filled the post of their assistant, the duties of interpreting, translating, copying secret letters, together with the general superintendence of the accounts, and the charge of the treasury, fully occupied my time. 'Taking a general view of the subject, I cannot but think that in the Persian Gulf where the general, sudden and sometimes, fatal effects of the diseases prevalent must be con stantly borne in mind, it is greatly to the interest of Government there should be permanently attached to the Residency an officer, whose qualifications as a linguist and acquaintance with the general line of policy hitherto pursued, and whose knowledge of the relations existing between the different Maritime Chiefs of the Gulf have been sufficiently matured in the subordinate Office of Assistant to enable him in case of the demise or unavoidable departure of his superior, to conduct the important duties of the Residency, without incurring the risk of the Government being seriously compromised by the possible want of judgment or local information, of the individual into whose hands these duties might otherwise tall. ' With reference to the expediency of the Resident dispensing with his t -urs of the Arabian Coast, I would beg with the greatest respect to submit my opinion that at least one visit to the Maritime Chiefs in the course of the year is indispensable. It is the frequent personal com munication of the British functionary with the Arabian Shaiks, that a great part oi his influence has been acquired, and it is to that influence the establishment of the Maiitime Tiuce, which has been productive of such happy results, and the introduction^ of the different engage ments so materially modifying the slave trade, may be attributed. W ere the Resident to gue up his tours altogether the Arabian Chiefs would consider themselves and their interests neg lected, and the consequences of such an impression are too obvious to require dwel mg upon. On ordinary occasions, communications to the Maritime Shaiks may be, and are fiequen y, transmitted through the Commodore in the Gulf, but in cases involving pohtwal interests or requiring close and patient investigation, I consider that the presence of either the Kesiden or a confidential Attache is almost indispensable.' 2 s 2318 Part VIII—Chap. LXXVI. 616. Captain Hennell in one part of bis letter did admit that with bis own local experience and knowledge he might, hy great personal exertion, carry on the duties of the Residency without the aid of an Assistant, but he had on some occasions been glad to avail himself of the assistance of officers, who happened to be present in Karrak, in getting translations of letters made, and in general considerations he con sidered the appointment of an Assistant Eesident indis pensable. 617. On this the Government of India yielded again, and did not object to an Assistant being appointed (only however as a temporary arrangement) on a salary of R700 a month. Lieutenant Kemball was appointed accordingly, and he held the appointment up to the year 1852. 618. In their letter. No. 32, dated 1862, the Bombay Government informed the Government of India that Lieutenant-Colonel Hennell having applied for a furlough to Europe, they had, subject to the Government of India's approval, appointed Captain A. B. Kemhall to succeed him as Kesident in the Persian Gulf. As to the abolition of the office of the Assistant Resident, ordered by the Government of India, the Bombay Government invited their attention to the previous correspondence on the subject, and observed : — 'The offices of Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, and of Resident in the Persian Gulf, are, as has been shown on the occasion of Lieutenant-Colonel Rawlinson's recent absence in Europe, dependant on the appointment of the Assistant to the Resident, for a qualified officer as a locum tenens, in case of any sudden emergency ; for this, and the other reasons enume rated in the letters from this Government above mentioned, the Right Honourable the Governor in Council is of opinion that it will be injurious to the public interests if the appointment of assistant be abolished. This Government therefore trusts that the Govern ment of India will give the subject its favorable consideration. w 619.

Such letters from the Chiefs in the Gulf or such portions of the reports of the Agents at Muscat, Lingah, Shargah, Brymee, Bahrien, and Shiraz as may be of interest or importance, are to be translated and sent to the Secretary to Government in the Secret and Political Departments. Such letters from the Agent (or Reporter) at Shiraz as may contain matters of local or general interest, relating to the affairs of Fars, or the South of Persia, are to be translated and sent to Her Majesty's Envoy at the Court of Tehran, to whom this Residency is subordinate in all matters connected with that country. At the present time there is a Gholam (Allee Reza Be 0 -) of His Excellency's here, who should be sent off with the first despatch for the Mission which may arrive from India. In general a cossid is despatched to His Excellency when a ship from Bombay arrives bringing letters for himself and suite. By such an opportunity the reports from Shiraz are forwarded, but in cases of unusual nature or of importance a special cossid is sent off. On the 10th of each month the monthly mail should be despatched to Bussorah. By this opportunity a concise report is to be made to the Honorable the Secret Committee, in duplicate regardino- events and ge &gt;eral state of affairs in the Gulf and the South of Persia, during the preceding month. One copy of this despatch is seat under flying seals to Colonel Taylor for his information. All other letters on general subjects to Government are addressed in tha Departments they may happen to be in^ the Military, Marine, General, etc., etc., etc., but in every case each subject should as far as possible be kept separate in a letter of its own. The reports of Moollah Houssin the Agent at Shargah may always be relied on^ in respect to facts, if he expresses no doubt on the subject. On the occasion of a piracy ocurring in the Gulf, every exertion is to be made by circular letters to the different Agents and Shaiks, to find out to what tribe or Chief the perpetrators may belono- When a clue is obtained, a demand upon the Chief for explanation should be made and when it is satisfactorily established that his people are the culprits, an intimation should be '-iven that he is expected to afford redress. Should he hesitate or decline to do this, after a reasonable period, he must be eompelled by force : but it has been my practice not to make a final and peremptory demand, unless backed by at least two, but if possible three, vessels o£ war. This always prevents any idea of resistance, fr.im a conviction of its honelessness. The naval force in the Gulf is generally too weak to afford so many ships, but the advantage may be taken of the occasional visit of a war steamer to collect the reonisite number. Of course cases of great emergency may occur, in which instant and energetic measnres mnst be adopted at all risks, with whatever available means may be at hand. . The conditions of the maritime force ought to be carefully guarded, but no interference whatever must take place in the quarrels, feuds and disputes on shore. The trace will expire rbout next May, when it should if possible be renewed. It is not unhke.y the Government inav order this to be attempted for a longer period than one year— —„ ; may m —. On the occasion of renewing the truce it is usual'to make a present of a pair of pi'stols and a piece of cloth to each of the members subscribme: it# In the event of Captain Jopp'.

BT J. A. SALBAUEA B.A., LL.B. CALCUTTA: OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA. 1906.PREFACE. THE history of the Persian Gulf Affairs from 1801 to 1853, which is treated in this Frecis (excluding that of the Turkish Arabia affairs dealt with in the Turkish Arabia Precis, 1801-1905), divides itself naturally and is therefore divided into the following parts :— PART I. British Envoys to Persia and from Persia, 1801-18l4i. PART II. British policy in regard to Maskat and the Maritime Arab tribes on the Persian Gulf, 1801-1815. PART III. Affairs on the Persian Coast and Islands, 1801-1820. PART IV. British Residents and Agents in the Persian Gulf and at Maskat, 1801-1813. PART V. British policy in regard to Maskat and the Maritime Arab Tribes. Vigorous measures taken for the suppression of piracies and for security of peace in the Gulf. Persian Coast and Islands Affairs.—1818-1823. PART VI. British policy in regard to Maskat and the Maritime Arab tribes, 1823-1853. PART VII. Affairs on the Persian Coast and Islands, 1823-1853. PART VIII. British Residents and Agents in the Persian Gulf and Maskat, 1823-1853. An alternative arrangement would have been to treat the affairs of the Persian Coast and Islands on one side, and those of the Arab Coast of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman on the other, separately and chronologically and conti nuously from beginning to end. But the political affairs of both the Coasts and Islands of the Gulf become so frequently, especially during the period from 1818 to 1823, inextricably mixed up, that we had to give up this distribution for the one adopted. So far as the Arab Coast is concerned, we must seek for detailed account of the events in the Bombay Selections» 1856 (No. 24), while the reader will find in this Frecis an ample exposition of the British policy in the Gulf in the extracts from minutes and despatches, especially of the period from 1818 to 1822, when the foundation was laid of our present Gulf politics. In regard to the Persian Coast and Islands, we have had to depend upon the records of the Bombay Government (referred to as ' Volumes ') for weaving together a connected history of the political affairs in those regions. 1285 F.

The account is abstracted from the Bombay Secretariat Records. The circumstances under which Great Britain concluded the Commercial Treaty of 1839 and Prance its treaty of 1844, with the Imam, are not related in either the Bombay Secretariat or the Foreign Department Records. The Treaty of 1839 was entered into by the Foreign Office in London in direct communication with the Imam at Zanzibar, while the Treaty of 1844 was concluded by the Imam with France after consulting the English Foreign Office through Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar, not through the Indian or Bombay Governments—(See Colonel Historical Sketch of Seyyid Said-bin-Sultan of Maskat in the Gulf Residency Administration Report for 1887-1888.

Curzon (now Lord Curzon) in his Introduction to the Adventures of Eajji Baha of Ispahan (Edition 1895), Persia was for a short time the pivot of the oriental interest of English and Indian Statesmen. But little known and scarcely visited during the preceding century, it suddenly and simultaneously focussed the ambitions of Russia ; the apprehensions of Great Britain; the Asiatic schemes of France. The envoys of great Powers flocked to its Court, and vied with each other in the magnificence of the display and the prodigality of the gifts with which they sought to attract the superb graces of its sovereign, Fath Ali Shah. Among these supplicants for the Persian alliance, then appraised at much beyond its real value, the most assiduous and also the most profuse were the British, agitated at one moment by the prospect of an Afghan invasion of India, at another by the fear of an overland march against Delhi of the combined armies of Napoleon and the Tsar. These appre hensions were equally illusory, but while they lasted they supplied the excuse for a constant stream of embassies, some from the British Sovereign, others from the Viceroy at Calcutta, and were reproduced in a bewildering succession of Anglo-Persian treaties. Sir John Malcolm, Sir Harford Jones, Sir Gore Ouseley and Sir Henry Ellis were the plenipotentiaries who negotiated these several instruments ; and the principal co-adjutor of the last three diplomats was James Justinian Morier, the author of Hajji Baba' 2. We had not only ambassadors going to Persia, but also ambassadors deputed by Persia to England or India, Haji Khalil Khan, and Mahomed N ubi Khan that had interesting parts to play in India, the first meeting a tragical end in a souffle between the Persians and Indian sepoys at Bombay with all the fuss that was made over it. 3. It is not our intention to trace here the march and proceedings of these ambassadors from beginning to end. There are interesting accounts published of the doings of the British Envoys, a perusal of which, along with Morier's ' Rajji Baha of Ispahan' is necessary to get a grasp of Persian politics of this period. We must confine ourselves here to the movements of the envoys so far as they bear on the Persian Gulf affairs. 4. The Selections from the State Fapers regarding Persia and the P ersian Gtdf 1600-1800, have made us acquainted with the proceedings of the mission! of Mehdi Ali Khan and Captain Malcolm, and the facts need not be repeated here. We shall proceed with the history of the missions from 1801. 1285 F. D.1 CHAPTER I. HAJI RHALILS MISSION TO INDIA-HIS TRAGIC DEATH AT BOMBAY, 1803. 5. When Captain Malcolm was at Teheran, it was determined that an ambassador should be sent for the formal ratification of the treaties which had been negotiated between the Government of India's ambassador and Haji Ibrahim under the Shah's orders. The choice for this important mission fell upon Haji Khalil, a Persian who had amassed enormous fortune by trade between Bushire and India. Haji Khalil had married a sister of Aga Mahomed Nabi, a wealthy Persian merchant at Basrah and once a Munshi of Harford Jones. Haji Khalil's extensive mercantile connections with India, and his connection with the Persian Court, pointed to him as the most suitable man for the office of ambassador to Calcutta, and his selection met with the approval of Captain Malcolm as well as the Shah. To Persia his deputation cost nothing beyond a Court dress, and grant of the title of Khan and of permis sion to wear a jeka, a piece of jewellery. To the ambassador, the visit to India held out the prospect of a magnificent reception, large allowances and rich presents, besides exemption from payment of duties and customs on his goods, which would bring into his pockets profits of lacs. 6. The Bombay Government placed at his disposal a special frigate, the Ingate, to convey him to Bombay from Bushire; but as it did not arrive in time when Haji Khalil Khan reached Bushire, he appears to have hired an Arab vessel, which was a joint property of Mehdi Ali Khan (Resident at Bushire), and Sheikh Mahomed, a son of Sheikh Nasir. It was alleged by the Resident that from the date of the arrival of the English frigate at Bushire to secret and Poll, the day of his departure nearly four months elapsed all which interval he 0^802, passed there and kept all that time the Hon'ble Company's ship of war lying pp 4951.4953. useless in the roads of Bushire waiting his commands. He had hired the Arab vessel for Rs. 3,300 in all to carry him to Bombay, the Resident's agent being under the impression at the time that the trip would be at most of 40 days, instead of which Haji Khalil vexatiously detained this vessel about seven months without at the same time alio wins: not one farthing beyond the 3,300 rupees. After he had thus detained the vessel for a period of three months the Resident offered him back the sum of Rs. 2,000 he had advanced, but the ambassador wrote back in answer that if the vessel were refused he would send back the King's seven horses and not himself proceed to India, let what would happen, and that should the Resident say a word to the Government of Persia, the weight of anything he might urge would soon appear. So from apprehension of the Persian Government being displeased with him, the Resident allowed the ambassador to take the vessel. The ambassador did not wish to make his voyage in the English man-of- ^^^^Decem- war, but preferred that it should accompany his own vessel. He seemed to b * r 1801&gt; ^ thQ have had, like all Persians, a fondness for show and pomp. Presidency. 7. Captain David Seton (Resident at Maskat) describes the Persian Ambassador's arrival at Maskat in his letter dated 7th May 1802, which No&gt; ^3 of 1802, might be read:— p - 2982 ' I have the honour to address the Hon'ble Board by the Hon'ble Company's Frigate Hombay which accompanied Khadjee Khellel Khan who arrived here the third. The Emam and Seyud Seif were absent and he would not land, but the Emam before going had ordered Tipoo's Factory to be ready for his reception and desired me to order what salutes 1 should think proper. I waited on him the 4th and offered whatever the people afforded, and what he was in want of, I supplied on the Company's account, a list of which shall be forwarded, he requested a spy glass and I got one for him, one of his horses was sick and landed, I offered to replace him.4 Part I—Chap. I, On the sixth, I understood he wished to come on shore and went on board to invite him. He sent to inform me he would land at three and sending his saddle, for he would ride on no* other, prepared a horse for him, and four led horses when he landed under salutes, from the frigate and Duncan of 15 guns each and an Arab vessel of 7 guns the same as for Captain Malcolm ; I met him at the door, as he dismounted from his horse and entertained him with preserves, sweet cakes, fruits and coffee j after sitting about an hour, h« returned in the same state, and on going on board received the same salutes from the ship as at landing, and one gun from the forts. In the conversation I have had with the Khan, his topics are the weather, the production of the Oman, and comparing them with those of Persia and the trade of the two places. The Emam is gone to Soor to settle some disputes of the inhabitants of Jehilan who are fighting among themselves. 8. Two months after his arrival at Bombay the Persian Ambassador was killed in an affray between the Guard of sepoys and his own men, the circum stances of which are briefly as follows :— The delay of six months caused by the lon^ stay of the Persian Ambassador at Bushire, occasioned the irretrievable loss of the fair season, and Mr. Duncan, Governor of Bombay, called upon in the interim into the Deccan, where his presence was required to adjust some affairs in Mahratha country; he was compelled unavoidably to be absent from Bombay, and while he was there engaged in composing certain differences which had arisen, the Persian Ambassador arrived in Bombay. Mr. Carnac, the second, who'had been left in charge of the Presidency did all that was necessary to accom modate and entertain His Excellency in addition to those attentions which were paid by the Mehma-daur, deputed by the Governor-General from Calcutta for the purpose of providing for His Excellency's reception. 9. Two months after the arrival of the Khan, there occurred the death of Mr. Carnac, the Acting Governor, and a few days only subsequent to that event a dispute arose on some very trifling subject between certain individuals belonging to His Excellency's suite and the sepoys, who attended as the honorary guard of his person ever since the day of his landing. Two or three of the sepoys having been wounded by swords, the circumstance was communi cated to Mis Excellency, which induced him to descend from the upper apart ments of his house for the purpose of chastizing in person the misbehaviour of his people and interposing to quell the affray, in which the parties were now engaged with their swords and firearms. In this situation, His Excellency received a ball on the neck and fell dead, and three or four other persons were also shot in different parts of the body. 10. The intelligence no sooner reached the English gentlemen, than they hastened to the spot with every demonstration of sorrow, consternation and distress. When Mr. Duncan was apprized of the catastrophe, he accomplished a long and troublesome journey in the space of five or six days, and on his arrival in Bombay applied himself with all the means in his power to calm the Persians. 11. This violence on the part of the Hindu sepoys would not probably have occurred but for the absence of Mr. Duncan from Bombay and the untimely death of Mr. Carnac, the Acting President. All those concerned in the unhappy affair were placed under the most rigorous confinement, pending their trial. 12. The Governor Duncan had an investigation made by a Commission into the circumstances of the death of the Persian Ambassador, and| despatched a summary of the evidence taken to the Eesident at Bushire with a letter to the Shah bewailing his accidental death. The Resident was instructed to make such use of the summary of the evidence as he thought fit for putting as favourable a light as possible on the sad event and take the necessary measures for the protection of the Hesidency and the British property from Persian attacks. • 13. Erom an account given by Mr. Lovett (who succeeded Mehdi Ali Khan as Resident at Bushire) it appears that the Court's first sensation were those of astonishment and grief, Eor one or two days the King scarcely opened his lips except to order that the subject might not be again mentioned during the celebration of his son's nuptials.
