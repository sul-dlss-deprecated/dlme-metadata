No. 837/22. Adviser’s Office. Manama^, Kovr. 21, 1935. \ Dear Colonel Loch, With reference to the question of the cuts in pay and reductions in the Civil List which we spoke of yesterday. The approximate amount month and to restore the Civil List deductions, »s 3,830/- per month. The cuts in pay affect all government ser The persons affected agreed voluntarily to these reductions owing to the acute financial crisis at that time and I do feel that the considerable increase in this years revenue justifies the re storation of the cuts which were made in pay. When the cuts in pay were made all the employees affected were definitely told that it was a tem porary measure and that they would be restored when conditions improved. Yours sincerely, Lieut. Colonel G. Loch, C.I.a., H.B.M’s Political Agent, § u Bahrain. ^ * required to restore the pay cuts is ?.s 800/- per vants drawing not less than p s 35/- per month.Confide' i tlal . Tio:C/604-4/1. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 12th Becemher 1935• From : - Lieuten nt-CoIonel Gordon Loch, C.I.r., Political Agent, Be; hr a in* To: The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bu shire. RestoretIon of cut in salaries of Bahrain Government officials. vGir, T,r ith reference to our conversation on the no November 1935, I hive the honour to inform you that the Bahrain Govern ment i ropose to restore the reductions in the pay oi Bahrain Government servants, amounting to Rs.800/- a month, and the reductions in payments made under the Civil hist, amounting to Rs*3,8?G/- a menth, all of which were nr-de in connection with the drastic economies in the budget of tne Bahrain Government necessitated by the financial depression of recent years. Tne total to be restored is roundly Rs.55,000/- a year. 2» Owing to the payment of the first royalties on oil, it is known that there will be a surplus in the current year and it is confidently expected that there will be a Urge surplus in succeeding years. There is now no doubt of tne existence of oil in large quantities and, as The Bahrain Petroleum Com any Limited rre engaged on an urgent extension of their drilling activities and are pressing on hastily with the building of a refinery in Bahrain, it is reasonable to su pose /thatthat the Company ho'oe to produce on a Itrge scale, i ven If warketlng difficulties should temporari y supervene, the minimum sum payable annuslly under the Mining I»ense is Ks.15 ., -jO f. I am strongly of opinion that the reduction in the pay of the Bahrain Government servants should be restored forthwith. They are not too veil paid and accepted with gr^ce tne curtail ing of their pay to meet an emergency, and they were told at the time th; t their full oay would be restored to them when the emergency was over. The emergency has now passed and it is most desirable that the restoration of the old rates of pay should be made by the Bahrain Government of their own volition rather than that it should be wrung from them by an agitation, with which all would sympathize. 4. The restoration of the reductions in the Civil ^»ist is on 8 rather different footing, but I am also strongly in favour of it for other reasons. A great mi tty of the bene ficiaries have very small ortions, which can h .raly sustain reductions save ns a measure of emergency. Tie reductions accepted without serious trouble by the Ruling Family oecau.se it was im’ ressed u&gt;?on them that there was in trutn an emergency and because they saw similar reductions made in the pay of Bahrain Government servants and also in the pay of British Government servants. They grumble alrei dy and vill c^rt inuy not understand, the restoration of the old rate of gay to these tvo classes and not to themselves. Moreover, with targe oil royalties coming in, the failure to restore their rtauctions will be a constant and sore grievance, and will be regarded (as, indeed, it would be) as simply due to the British Govern- ment and to no one dse. For cogent political reasons we should /avoidavoid antagonising the Ruling Family on vhose goodvili our position end policy (K vai Base, Air Route arrangements and so on) is buii-t up. 5. I venture, moreover, to think that we should not iBL-ose too rigidly upon Bahrain our own, very alien, ideas of (what I may term) constitutional finance. It is but a few years since the Shaikhs took all they could extract from people; today there is a properly drawn up budget to vdiich the Banr&amp;in 'uovernment strictly adhere. His rxcealency Shaikh air Henu o bin * Isa A1 Khalifah has accepted the principle (though it is by no means firmly established as yet) of dividing the oil royalties in a proportion of one-third to the Ruler and his Family and two-thirds to the Bahrain Government, and if the Ruling Family C£n point to a grievance over the reductions in their c ilOkicJices, it vill make it harder to establish this principle. I do not think that we should be well advised to press for further self- denial by the Ruling Family. After all, ou£ interest in the finances of the Bahrain Itate is confined (a) to not having to iVy vt/vtO come to its rescue with, (b) to seeing that enough Honey io allocated to the Bahrain Government (as opposed to the Ruling F - : mily) to ensure a reasonable standard of administration and to build up a reserve for the future. These considerations are being fulfilled (the reserve has, indeed, already been restored and will be increased) and I, therefore, recommend that, having safeguarded the needs of the administration in the important mrtter of the division of royai-ties, we should avoid, firstly, drawing upon ourselves the odium which mist inevitably attach to preventing e restoration of the reductions mcac to meet a past emergency and, secondly, providing our enemies with /a perfecta perfect advertisement of British interference in the aaminis tret ion, 6. I em anxious that the Bahrain Government should cove in the matter before any popular clamour &lt;* rises and should be grateful, therefore, if I might be given instructions as soon as possible.

STATI MENT OF REVENUE AND EXPI GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST NINE NDITURE OF THE BAHRAIN MONTHS OF THE ARABIC \ \GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. No. 328/3.]?. of 1355 Office of the Adviser to the Governioeiit, Bahrain. Dated, R/Awal, 2, 1355 May 22, 1936 Erom The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information the Budget for the State of Bahrain for the year 1355 and a report on the revenue and expenditure during 1354. This is the eleventh Budget which I have had the honour to present. The annual report on the adminis tration of Bahrain which normally accompanies the Budget is not yet complete. It will be forwarded at a later date. The Administration Report is written almost entirely by myself and owing to pressure of work I have not been able to finish it. The Budget . The expenditure shown in the Budget represents the recurrent expendi ture necessary for the normal protection, administration- 2 - administration and running of the State. The expenditure for 1355 is estimated at Rs 43,000/- more than the corresponding expenditure during 1354 owing to the restoration of cuts and increased expenditure in certain services. The anticipated revenue from all sources other than oil royalty is not at present sufficient to cover the normal annual expenditure, Rs 280,000/- oil royalty, is included in the Budget. In addi tion to the usual Budget a supplementary Budget has been made providing for the expenditure of Rs 1,64,000/- from the surplus at the close of the year 1354 after transferring Rs 2,OQp0O/- (two lacs) to the Reserve Fund. Revenue . Customs receipts, Rs 6,00,000/-. Although in the past financial year there has undoubtedly been an improvement in trade, yet the revenue from customs duties, boat and pearling licenses is estimated during the new year at not more than Rs 6,00,000/- which is Rs 20,000/- more than the amount shown under this heading in the 1354 Budget, and Rs 91,000/- less than the actual amount collected in 1354. Owing to the reduction in the R.E. duty and the continued depression in the pearl trade which affects the yield from boat and pearl taxes, I have not con sidered it wise to assume that more than six lacs will be collected. Royalty on oil . Rs 2,80,000/-. This sum represents the royalty due to the State on oil which has been shipped since the last payment of royalty by the Bahrain Petroleum Company until the end of the year 1354. It represents revenue-3- revenue from oil for three months. Undoubtedly the royalty on oil will be greatly in excess of this figure. Only one payment will be made by the company to the State during the year 1355, the next payment is due in September and the following payment is due at the end of March, probably after the end of the Arabic year 1355. The remaining items of revenue which amount to Rs 57,000/- do not call for any special comment, I have estimated the total revenue from these sources at a slightly higher figure than in the 1354 Budget. Expenditure . Payments to the Ruling Family. An increase of Rs 44,000/- in the Civil List is owing to the restoration of the 12i$ cut which was made in 1350. One third of the oil royalty is paid into the privy purse of the Ruler. The sum which will be received by him will be very much larger than the amount shown in the Budget. State Protection . Rs 1,40,000/-. This item includes the cost of maintaining the State Police Force, which has been increased during the last year and which is likely to be further increased during 1355, the naturs, prison adminis tration and the salaries of Amirs. The amount allocated to State Protection is Rs 15,000/- more than was budgeted last year. Government departments . Rs 1,58,000/-. This item is increased by approximately Rs 15,000/- more than was budgeted in 1354 owing to the restoration of the lOjo cut on the salaries of —-4- of all Government employees, provision for several additional magistrates and Kadis and a slight increase in the clerical staff. Municipalities. Bs 50,000/-. The two municipal councils, Manama h and Muharraq, used each to receive a monthly subsidy of Rs 2,000/- from the Government. In 1350, owing to the need for urgent economy, these subsidies were reduced by ! 50#. Now that State finances have improved the subsidies have been restored to the original amount and in addition Rs 2,400/- has been provided for work in the town of Hedd. This money will be spent by the Muharraq Municipal Council in Hedd. Medical Services. Education. Continpftnnips and Public Works . The allocation under these headings is approximately the same as in the last Budget. Medical services includes the State f s contributions to the pay of the Quarantine Medical Officer, the upkeep of the Muharraq dis pensary and the pay of the Indian doctor. Public wrks consists of upkeep and repairs to existing government buildings but it does not include any major new v\orks. 3. The Supplementary Budget . Anti Malarial measures . On completion of the financial year the State had a surplus balance of Rs 4,75,000/- and a Reserve Fund of Rs 2,00,000/-. From the surplus balance Rs 2,00,000/- was transferred to the Reserve Fund bringing it up to four lacs. From the remainder it is proposed to spend Rs —-5- 1,64,000/- on special projects and the remain ing R$ 1,11,000/- will be set aside for unfor- seen expenditure or to be expended later in the year by another Supplementary Budget. The anti-malarial measures provided for in the Budget consist of draining and filling in areas containing stagnant mosquitoe breeding water. These measures are in addition to the spraying witn oil which is now being carried out by the Police and Municipal authorities. The sewer at Hedd is a long filthy drain running through the centre of the town which is probably the cause of much of the fever in that place. The channel, v/hich is wide, will be filled in and made into a much needed road. The two ponds, one north west of the Fort, the other near the Juma mosque at Jedhafs contain stagnant water which increases and diminishes according to the amount of rain. Last year the Man amah municipality, though very short of funds, spent Rs 4,000/- in filling in some of the v/ater pits south of the town. This year the Government can afford to assist the municipality in continuing this useful work. The money spent on these schemes will all be spent locally on labour and stone. The muni cipalities will be asked by the Government to undertake most of this work. Medical . Until now the Government of Bahrain has spent comparatively little on medical work the bulk of which has been carried out by the —the American Medical Missionaries and the Quarantine Medical Officer. There is a very strong feeling among the Arabs that the Bahrain Government should have its own hospital and medical staff. The question is under consi deration and when funds are available doubtless a Government hospital will be started. In the meantime the Government proposes to open dis pensaries, which will be run on the lines of the Government dispensary in Muharraq, in various places in Bahrain. A dispensary for women and children is to be opened on the western quarter of Manamah, on the edge of the town which it is hoped will be used not only by the people of Manamah but by the people from the near villages such as Meni, Zinj, etc. An Iraqi woman who has worked as a nurse in the Basrah hospital will be put in charge of this dispensary. A dispensary will be opened in Hedd in a building which was acquired by the Government some years ago. A local Arab with considerable medical experience who has worked for the Govern ment on previous occasions will be employed as a dispenser. A similar dispensary is to be opened at Bilad- al-Qadim, which is a fairly central position. The Government is advertising in India for a suitable man to carry out this work. It is proposed that he shall be provided with a car to enable him to visit the neighbouring villages on certain days of the week. All the dispensaries and the medical workers —-7- workers will be under the supervision of the Quarantine Medical Officer. Education . Two small country schools are to be opened, one at Sitrah and one at Burri. These schools will satisfy the demands of the Shias who complain, with some justification, that while government schools have been estab lished in the towns which are mostly Sunni the educational needs of the Shia community have not been provided for. Only reading writing and et simple arithmetic will be taught in the country schools. Efforts are being made to introduce technical instruction in the Mana mah and Muharraq boys 1 schools. There is today in Bahrain a great demand for carpenters and mechanics and if boys could learn work of this kind at the schools it would be of more practical use to them than the type of education which they are getting now. Provision has been made for the possibility of sending six: more boys from the Government schools to Bey rout University. Public Works . A new custom house including a flat for the customs Director is to be built on the shore opposite the open space facing the north end of the Barrett road. The present building is in a dangerous state of disrepair. Originally it was badly built on reclaimed ground and evi dently the foundations were not carried down to the bed rock. It has constantly been repaired with no permanent success. The offices are dark and- 8 - Jh, and inconvenient and the building is oversha dowed by the high new buildings which have sprung up around it. The accomodation in the new building for the public and the staff will be almost double that available in the old office. Barrack room . A second barrack room similar to the one which was made two years ago is to be built in the lort. These two rooms will accomodate all the men who are normally quartered there. The old rooms now occupied by the Police are in a bad state of repair. The main wall of the Port, which is made of mud and stones frequently collapses and needs immediate attention. Palace wall . A wall is to be built in front of the Palace enclosing a large square on the north of the building, ornamental trees will be planted at the south west and south east corners flanking the building and there will be gates at the corners of the wall. By these means the approach to the palace will be improved and it will no longer present an appearance of isolated ugliness. Shop and office . A shop and an office are to be built on the corner of Prior road and Barrett road behind the present customs house. Llanamah Muharraq road . It is pro pcs ed that within the first half of the year this road will be completed as far as the dedp channel. The amount allowed for completion of this work is more than will be required, the balance will be used in the beginning to fill in the channel, one of the advantages9 -9- advantages of this scheme is that all the money is spent locally. 4. The revenue of Bahrain in 1354 has once again reached the level which it was ten years ago and not for a long time has the State completed a year with such a satisfactory surplus. I think it can now be reasonably assumed that the lean years have passed and that a period of financial prosperity is beginning. Neither now nor at any time during the anxious period of financial depression has this State incurred financial liabilities such as loans 0 In the time of prosperity a Reserve Fund ms started and when in spite of all efforts and drastic economies the revenue was insufficient to cover the expendi ture the Reserve Fund was drawn upon in order to carry on the normal administration of the country. 5. The new prosperity is from the royalty on oil, without this royalty it would still be impossible to balance the Budget and to pay for the administration of the country. Oil is an uncertain factor and its production depends not only on the available supply but on the world markets. I consider that it is more essential now than it has ever been before to build up a really large reserve which besides providing a steady income will be available if for any reason the production of oil is restricted and the revenue from oil dwindles to the minimum royalty which is all- 10 - 4 is all that the Bahrain Petroleum Company are obliged under all circumstances to pay to the State.

The total revenue in 1354 exceeded the revenue of the previous year by Rs 4,55,000/- although there was included in the 1353 revenue Rs 1,10,000/- which was the price of the land sold to the British Government. Of the Rs 13,42,000/- collected during 1354, Rs 5,68,000/-was from royalty on oil, the remaining Rs 7,74,000/- was from ordinary revenue. The ordinary revenue during 1354 shows an increase over the ordinary revenue of the previous year of Rs 64,000/-. Of this increase Rs 34,000/- was from customs receipts including boat and pearling licenses and the remaining Rs 30,000/- was an increase in collec tions from all other sources of revenue such as passport fees land rants etc. etc. Notes on expenditure 1354. The total expenditure in 1354 was Rs 2,10,000/- more than the expenditure during the previous year. Of this increased expenditure Rs 1,89,000/- was the one third of the royalty from oil which is paid to the privy purse of the Ruler, approximately Rs 14,000/- was the restoration of the cuts in pay and Civil List which were restored three months before the end of the year. There was also increased expenditure on State protection, unforseen expenditure and some of the public services including medical and education.No. C/267-4/1 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 29th li y 19SCi* © Fro a Captain T.

Dated, J/Awal,15 —1355 August 3, 1936. H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. In continuation of my letter No. 328/SF dated May 22, 1936, enclosing copy of the Budget for the State of Bahrain for the year 1355, I enclose herewith report and statement of accounts for the year 1354, in connection with the working of the Bahrain Governmait Electric Supply Department. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,4 Bahrain Electric Supply, year 1354. The current consumption for the year 1354 shows an increase of 15,991 units over 1353. This is due to extra connected load amounting to approximately 27 kilowatts. The nature of the new load is as follows:- Lighting 302 points, app. 18 kw. Fans — 33 points tf 3 kw. Miscellaneous, (table fans, refrigerators etc.) ' 6 kw. Total — 27 kilowatts. Revenue from connected load during 1354 was Rs 43,827/12 and for 1353 was Rs 36,797/-, an increase of Rs 7,030/12/-. Sixty new premises have been wired during the year, in Manamah, 56 and in Muharraq, 4. Total consumers connected to date 614. Maximum load recorded — 124.4 kw. Total kilowatts connected to end of year, 223. Wiring contracts . It will be observed that sixty premises were wared in 1354 as compared with 65 in 1353, but the total number of points wired was greater in 1354. The revenue from wiring contracts in 1354 was in excess of all previous years, but only a slight profit is made from wiring, as the main object is to promote the sale of energy, by keeping the cost per point wired, as low as possible. In addition to the extra lighting and fan ^and refrigerator) load, the Jufair Naval Base has been added to the system. An overhead, 3 phase, 400 volt —- 2 - 400 volt line has been run from Tf D T? substation (Shaikh Hamad f s palace at Gadhabia) to the Base a distance of approximately 1.8 miles. The average Base load should be, during the sunmBr months, approximately 12.5 kw. The installa tion of the water supply system, both general and domestic, has been carried out by this Department. Water is being electrically pumped • from tw existing wells, to high level tanks for distribution. A land telegraph line has been run by this Department from the Cable House of Cable and Wireless Ltd., near Jabala to their Main Station at Hura to connect the submarine cable from Bushire with the Wireless Station. Temporary uirim . During 1354 the cities of Mian amah and Muharraq were especially illuminated on two occasions. Once to celebrate His Majesty King George’s Silver Jubilee, and once for the anniversary of the accession of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain. On each occasion, some 1500 extra light points were temporarily installed. Municipal Ice Plant . The Municipal ice plant was operated by the Department as usual during 1354 and ran for five and half months continuously. The output of ice v/as one hundred and sixty tons. A new one ton ice plant (with one ton storage capacity) has been ordered from England and will be installed by this department on arrival in the Spring of 1936. It will be erected in an annexe to theto the present power station. Publio Telephones . During the year the telephone systems of Manaman and Muharraq have been connected to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, a connecting line having run between the Manamah exchange and the New Camp of the Bahrain Jtetro le urn Company, a distance of approximately twelve miles. The present Government exchange is loaded to capacity, and a new extension switch board, of 16 line capacity has been ordered and will be installed during 1355. Transmission and Line losses . Transmission losses amounted to 9•66^ of the total energy generated during 1354 as compared with 13.75/b during 1353. This is due largely to the higher power factor obtained during the winter months, the lighting demand having increased. Financial nosition . It will be seen from the annual balance sheet that a profit of Rs 4,819/10/10 was made by the Department after meeting all charges, including depreciation and insurance. This is due to increased revenue from energy sold, larger sales of sundry material, wiring, and other contracts. It might be mentioned that the charges against this department for the year 1354 included the sum of Rs 1,450/- paid to the Bahrain Customs as duty on material imported. Prospects for 1355 . It is reasonable to assume that the revenue from energy sold will increase-4- increase during 1355, as the following extra connected load has been obtained, to date, 1. New one ton ice plant — 5 kw 2. Jufair Naval Base 18 kw 3. Printing press.(Manama) 4 kw 4. New wireless s-cation. (Cable &amp; hireiessLtd) - 2 kw. It is also anticipated that the lighting load will increase at a higher ra^ce than during previous years, as more money is circulating in the State, and the latter is growing rapidly from a commercial point of view. It is expected that, towards the end of 1355, the load will be sufficient to absorb the whole of the output of one set and part of the standby set. Preliminary tenders for a new generating set and switchgear have been asked for.for the period ending K/Awal, , C three months)CONFIDENTIAL.

STATEMENT OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE OF THE BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT FOR THjl FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE ARABIC YEA 135 *) No. ?o 7- s - F - of 1355 Office of the Adviser to the Governioent, Bahrain Dated 29th Rajah, 1355 15th October, 1936. From |i- The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, To His Briftanic Majesty's Political A&amp;®nt, Bahrain* Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information a statement of Revenue and Expenditure for the first six months of the current year, 1355. 2. The revenue is Rs. 53,403/- more than during the corresponding period of last year, and is Rs. 31,068/- less than the amount which was estimated in the budget for six months. The expenditure exceeds the revenue by Rs. 1,04,875/- 3. The deficiency is because the payment by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on account of royalty on oil was not re ceived before the end of this half year. This payment was credited by the Eastern Bank Limited on 30th September, 1936, but the cheque was actually received on 1st October, 1936. In the budget it was estimated that Rs. 2,80,000/- would be paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on a/caccount of royalties during the whole of the current year. The actual amount paid by the Company ( after the first six month’s of the year had expired ) is Rs. 6,92.222/-. Out of this amount Rs. 2,30,740/- is payable to The Ruler’s Civil List being his one third share of royalties. Thus the royalty paid on account of shipments made by the Company until end of 30th June, 1936, considerably exceeded the estimated amount for the whole year. It is expected that there will be further shipments of oil during the second half year of 1355. 4. The revenue from Customs exceeded the estimated amount in the budget by Rs. 1,05,130/-. This includes Rs. 31,444/- collected from Pearling Licenses which was paid during the diving season, so it can not be presumed that the second half of the year will be equally productive. 5. The revenue under various headings sometimes differs from the estimated amounts. The figures for the first half year are not in all cases an equivalent indication of the following six months, because some sources of revenue are seasonal. Apart from oil revenue it can be presumed that the amounts estimated for under various headings will be collected by the end of the year. 6 . The expenditure for the first six months amounted to Rs. 5,42,307/- which-3~ which is Rs. 1,52,325/- more than during the corresponding period of last year; and it is Rs. 73,807/- more than the amount allowed for in the original budget, but includes Rs. 90,211/- spent on schemes and works under Tt SIIPPLEI^NTARY tT budget. The estimated expenditure under supple mentary budget is Rs. 1,64,000/- for the current year. 7. The Civil List during the first half of year 1355 amounted to Rs 2,23,321/- which was Rs. 35,179/- less than the budgeted amount and represents 51)6 of the total revenue. 8 . The amount spent on account of His Excellency The Ruler f s visit to England will be made up after the Advisees return.

Lieut.-Colonel Cordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahr a in.From No. 435/SF. of 1356 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, R/kml 21, 1356 Hay 31, 1937. To C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your infor mation a copy of the Budget for the Arabic year 1356 (March 13, 1937 - March 3, 1938) and a statement of revenue and expenditure for year 1355 (March 24,1936 - March 13, 1937). This is the twelfth Budget which I have had the honour of presenting. 2* The Budget * Revenue. The income from the oil royalty has now super seded customs receipts as the chief source of revenue. In taking into account the revenue from oil I have included only the actual royalty due to the State from shipments already made until the end of 1355. The revenue from this source will undoubtedly be very much greater than the sum I have estimated. I have anticipated one lac more revenue from customs receipts than the amount which I expected in thethe Budget for year 1355 but this figure is more than two lacs less than the realised customs revenue for 1355. It can be assumed that the customs department will more than fulfill my expectations. I come now to other sources of revenue which together only total Rs 60,000/- in the Budget. Actually last year over Rs 80,000/- was collected from these sources but without increasing any of these taxes which consist mostly of fees and licenses, it is unlikely that there will be any considerable change under these headings, except from the interest on the Reserve which I hope to be able to increase. I am confident that if it was necessary more revenue could be obtained from several of the earning depart- EBnts such as the Land, Passport and Judicial Depart ments where the fees and charges now levied are very low in comparison to similar institutions elsewhere, but though the country is much more prosperous than it was a year or two ago I do not think it would be reasonable to increase any form of taxation. The total estimated revenue is Rs 22,10,000/- this is about eight lacs more than the most prosperous year in the history of Bahrain 1 s finances when the pearl industry was flourishing before the years of depression. 3. Expenditure . The expenditure is divided into two parts, recurrent expenditure, which is the cost of adminis tering and protecting the country and maintaining the Ruling Family and Special Projects which includes the new -—the new kospital, the proposed new palace and various projects some of which, have already been commenced. The largest item of expenditure is Rs 9,20,000/- which is the Civil List and the one third of the total oil revenue which is paid to the Privy Purse of the Ruler. The last item varies according to the amount of royalty and as I have stated the royalty will certainly be much more than the amount I have estimated. The expenditure on Government Departments, Protection, Medical, Public a/orks etc. has been assessed at slightly more than in the last Budget in order to cover expansion in certain directions and certain proposed increases in the Government staff. The total recurrent expenditure, includ ing the Civil List but not including l/3rd royalty is only half a lac more than the actual revenue in 1355 from all sources other than oil revenue. Assuming that the non oil revenue for 1356 is not less than during 1355 it is evident that the State could be administered, as it is now, without the oil revenue. I can count upon there being a surplus of three and a half lacs at the end of the year and 1 am confident that this surplus will be greatly in excess of my expectation. 4. Reserve Fund. At the end of year 1355 the Reserve Fund was increased from two lacs to four lacs. At the beginning of 1356 the State had a balance of-4- of Rs 4,79,000/- in addition to the four lacs Reserve Fund* Out of this balance Rs 4,11,752/— (£30,000/-) has been invested in Wjo British War Loan which increases the Reserve Fund to approxi mately Rs 8,12,000/-* 5. Notes on 1355 revenue . Customs revenue was Rs 1,83,000/- more than during previous year* The satisfactory increase reflects the improved condition of trade in Bahrain which is mainly due to the oil industry. During part of the year as many as 5,000 labourers were in the employment of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and most of their earnings were spent in the Bahrain bazaars. The influx of Europeans and highly paid Asiatics has stimulated the import of highly priced luxury articles such as photographic material etc* etc# The revenue from liquor alone during the year amounted to Rs 14,841/-. The oil royalty was over a lac more than dur ing the previous year. The re maining sources of revenue show no noticeable change except a large increase under motor taxes which is due to the number of vehicles and drivers employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The actual revenue during 1355 exceeded the estimate in the Budget by seven lacs, this was because the customs receipts and oil royalty considerably exceeded my expectations. Notes on 1355 expenditure. The normal recurrent expenditure during 1355 which is the cost of administering and protecting the country and providing the Civil List was appro- ^-5&lt; approximately Rs 9,22,000/- sligktly less than the sum allowed for this purpose in the Budget for 1355. In addition to this Rs 58,000/- was spent on the visit of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad to England, this expenditure was not provided for in the Budget as when the Budget was made the visit had not been definitely decided upon. The Expenditure of Rs 1,64,000/- was pro vided for in the Supplementary Budget for 1355, but actually Rs 2,33,000/- was spent. The pro bability of this further expenditure under this heading was envisaged in my report on the Budget for 1355, page 5, paragraph one. Of this amount Rs 56,000/- was spent on the new customs house and enlarging the pier space, Rs 88,000/- was spent on completing the Man amah - Maharaq road upto the channel including a certain amount of filling in the channel, Rs 15,000/- was spent on road construction including the new Manamak - Budeya road, and Rs 49,000/- was spent on building shops on government land in the bazaar, on two new dispensaries, a barrack room at the Fort, a wall round Manamah Balace, reclamation of the sewer in Hedd and various smaller buildings, repairs and extensions. The cost of the Public Works Depart ment establishment was Rs 12,900/-. Filling pits at the back of Manamah, which during part of the year collect stagnant water and breed mos quitoes cost Rs 7,000/-. 6 . Almost all the money expended during the year with the exception of the visit to England has been spent locally and undoubtedly most of it has —-6 kas been circ\ilated by tke earners in tke bazaar benefiting skopkeepers and merchants and stimulating trade* This is especially true in the case of money spent on the Mfinamah Muharraq. road which is the cost of stones purchased from the owners of small boats* This work provided employment for numbers of men, during the months when there was no diving, who would otherwise have been unemployed. 7. In my opinion it is incumbent on the State to share the money which it is getting from oil with the people of the country, this can best be done by giving employment to Bahrain subjects on public works such as road making, new buildings and schemes such as the Manamah - Muharraq road* I think this is a more satisfactory and direct method of benefiting the public, especially the people of the country, than by reducing taxation.

I regret that I nave been unable to comment be fore on the budget as I had not the necessary file v/ith me on tour at Sharjah and therefore delayed a careful investigation until I returned to Bahrain* S* Please refer to paragraph 5 of Ml'. Belgrave’s ^ letter No. 435/SF dated the 51st May 1937 forwarding the Budget Estimate, 'Notes on 1355 Expenditure'. It will be seen that out of the budgetted expenditure in the 1355 Budget for Ks. .3,36,000/- an amount of Rs*9,22,000/- has been expended. In addition to tnis there has been a further expenditure of Rs. 1,64,000/- for which pro vision vif&amp;s made in the Supplementary Budget for Special Projects of the ye r 1355• There is, however, a further expenditure of Rs» 69,000/- for which no budget allotment was/-- 2 - v;as mde in 1355. ^r. Belgrave points out that on page 5 of his Budget Report for 1556 he envisaged a further expenditure under the head Suppler nt^.ry Bud get. A reference to his statement at the top of page 5 of the Budget Report for 1355 (forwarded with W letter Ho* C/267—4/1 dated the Biitii iSny ado6) s.hov/s that a sum of Hs. 1,11,000/- was set aside for unfore seen expenditure or to 'be expended rater by another Supplementary Budget, and presumably this sum of hs. 60,000/- has been expended from that suau A sum of Hs. 1,11,000/- is much too -targe a sum to set aside for unforeseen expenditure and when it was intended to expend a sum of Rs* 63,000/- from tnis a ount a further Supplementcry Budget should have been prepared. With regard to the Item of Rs* 50,000/- ’Milch was spent on the new customs house and enlarging the pier space, I note that in the Sup pie sent ary istimate ^or Special Projects for 1355 under Public Works a sum of only Rs* 35,000/- was estimated for the new customs house. The amount expended, tLerefare, shov.s an in crease of Rs. 21,000/-* This amount should have been foreseen as it is an increase of 60^ on the original buuget allotaont. There is an item of hs* 49,000/- which was spent on building shops on Government land in the bazaar, on two new dispensaries, a barrack room at tne Fort, a wall rouna the Manama pal;- ce, reclama tion of the sewer in Head and various other works* According to the Special Projects X.stimate, the only items budgetted for appear to be the barrack room at the Fort, &amp;he Palace wall, three dispensaries under Medical , and the building of the sewer at Hedd. The total/-total aiBDunt buagetted for for these projects amount to Hs» 22,500/- whereas an Item of Hs* 45,000/— as prevl^us- iy pointed out has been expended. There is again a tre mendous increase of expenditux*© over Estimate. Ihere are various other items of like nature 'Milch could be pointed out but I think the above illustrate a point which I shall make later in this letter. 4 # rurninj to the statement of Revenue and Expenditure for the year 1555 which forms an enclosure to wy letter under refsi’enee it v/ill be noted under Expenditure — State Protection, there is an expenditure of Rs. 1,67,356-3-11 whereas the budget allotment under this item for 1355 was Ks# 1,40,000/-. There has been an increase of Rs. 27,356-5-11. Similar increases c n be noted under such heads as Customs Department, Medical Sei'Vices, Contingen cies, etcetera. I could find no note in i£r. Belgrave*s Report to explain how these increases have occurred and on what the money has been expended* 5. For a Budget to be of any value it should show as nearly as possible the i:js33unt that it is expected to re ceive from income and the amount it is anticipated will be spent on the general running of the State* There must necessarily as two forms of Expenditure i*e* Recurring Ex penditure ana Ron-recurring Expenditure and I think that these two categories should be kept apart so that it should be possible to see at a glance exactly how much it is ex pected will be re. aired for the norms! running of the State and hovs much it is intended to spend on Special Projects. In the present Budget it is true- that the Sped, 1 Projects have been put together at the bottom of the page which deals with Expenditure for 1356 but there seems to me to be/--4- («0J be a tendency to incidcie speciai vjorlis in the current expenditure* For inst; nee, there is no iaGicttion that the sffiount of Ks. 1,67,P56/- Milch has been expended on State Protection is solely a Hecurring Expenditure. It Is possible that the inc ec*ses already noted in my npara- graph 3 may be a hon-recui*ring Expenditure or it may be that the increase is due to an increase in personnel. Again it may be noted that the expenditure on St te Pro tection is now estimated to be Hs* 7,356-3-11 less o-an it was in 1355 ,.nd there is no explanation why this is so# I consider that tne Bug get as at present submitted is not satisfactory and there appears to be a tendency on the pert of the Bahrain Government to depart from tne Budget figures on tr.r slightest excuse whereas Budget fi gures should only be departed from after careful consi deration and for matters of extreme urgency. The Budget should be much more accurate than it is at the mo mint and when a report is submitted regarding the Expenditure of the previous year and the estimated Expenditure of the present year it should clearly show vari&amp;tions which have occurred in the previous yearns expenditure and should give cie&lt; r .explanations of the causes thereof and at the Sc me time t iere should be an explanation of any estimated increase or decx’euse in Expenditure for the cur enfc ye: r. 6. I have not discussed this matter with Mr* Belgrave before ddressing you on the subject as I thought it desi rable to put my point of viev; to you before raising it with the Bahrain Government. % own inclination would be to return the present Budget asking for explanations for the variations in expenditure over estimated expenditure for the/--5 the ye-ir lc55 and clso requesting the Bahrain GoTern- iaent to explain the increases or decreases in one pre sent year’s Budget. At the tiae I think it would be desirable to point out to the Bahrain Government that they shouxd consider very carefully the question of departing from the Budget Estimate. In previous years when Lae Revenue was small it was probably neces* sary to have a very elastic Budget but now when the Revenue is increasing, all tne expenditure under recur* ring aechs can be accurately foreseen and I see no reason why the Budget should not give a fair estimate of the amount that it is intended to spend during the current year under the various heads. In view of the yearly increase in tne Oil revenue it is not possible fox* the Bahrain Government to forecast with any degree of accuracy '-he gross income. I have the honour to be, oil'.

There seems to be no process - (a) for watching progress of actuals against allotments; (b) fcr securing sanction to excess expenditure; (c) for audit generally; Or is the new Treasury Officer to do all this ? With the vast increase of prosperity in Bahrain, reflect ed in budgets which suggest that expenditure will be hard put t it to keep place with income, it seems essential to get Banrai n finances strictly overhauled and placed on a more regular ystem. Sir Trenchard Eowle touched on this in a conversation with Mr.Belgrave and myself just before his departure on leave, and I will try to make an opportunity for sane discussion with Mr. Belgrave during tne coming months. The point to remember is that there is perhaps more peril, though of a different sort, in bursting money-nags than in empty ones. One sugges tion was to put an Officer wiith experience of tne control of finance in Indian States on special duty to overhaul the Bahrain administrative organization.

Subject.Foraatlon of a Reserve rXind for Bahrsliu o O o (a) 'occluding the possibility of nevj oil deposits being found at greater depths than the present pro ducing wells and of other deposits in the Unallotted Area| we must first make a guess at the possible yield from the axis ing Bapco Field* Bapco people are very chary of offering any estimate t hut we have the following t- (i) A Haflnery is already working, capable of dealing with roughly one million tons of oil par annum, and it seams to be the general impression that it will be working for fully 16 years. Actual ly the indications are that more then one million tons of cnida oil will pass through the guagee this yaar, ami consequently a million tona a year la pro bably a minimum figure. It is believed that the Com pany has sunk £4 millions, and they would not have done that if they feared any possibility of an early dry-up. Thus allowing for a ninirom yield of one million tona for 16 years, royalty on 15 million (allowing for deductions for local use) can be put at Ba. 440 lakhs. (ii) In January 1937 Colonel loch was told by ;.r. Herron, President of Bapco, that the estirated amount of oil available waa 100,000,000 barrels. Tfw.irt.ntvny he himself estimated the life of the field at 16 to 20 years, confirming the aasunption made in (i) above. Again allowing for local use, wa might convert I r. Herron's figure into 12; mil- tons paying royalty. Thia again gives a rough total of 440 lakhs of rupees in royalty. (b)(1)/Present Invest* ••nts yield 3^R.

It is clearly impossible for any progress to be made so long as these matters are dealt with in a haphazard fashion without any definite objective, and without a clear realisation of the amount of money that may become available from time to time# I have, therefore, recorded the attached note wUicn is intended to be a preliminary effort to clear the air. I have throughout taken the most pessimistic view pos sible and I have little doubt in my own mind that the sums which will come to the State in the form of royals ties will very greatly exceed the figures ub.j&amp; adopted. In the first place the estimate of a lo year life for the oil field *liC its present boring depth is, I believe, far behind the expectations entertained by the Company themselves| though it is impossible to in duce anyone in the Company to offer anything like a firm opinion. Quite apart from this, even Mr. Deacon is pre pared to admit that the deep boring so far undertaken is really hopeful, and I understand tliat three more deep bores are be undertaken hew in the near future. Then again I have made allowances for local consumption of oil (on which royalty is not paid) fa in excess of the average quantity so used up-to-date. Similarly I have assumed as an average future State income from sources/-sources other than oil a figure lower than any reach ed in the past; and it is hard to believe that condi tions will ever be quite as bad as they were round about 1932. Finally I have as Burred a rate of interest from investments which should be exceeded by at least and possibly without touch difficulty. 1 mi^t further mention that at the present moment there is a sun of 3a. 10 lakhs in the no-called Conaolidatad Fund (a sort of Treasury Heserve), which together with the royalty in^fix^ment^ due before the end of the financial year will make it possible to invest at least Hs. 15 lakhs more this year, making a total investment for the first 'effective' year of no less than Ha* 20 Iflkhs* 2* I contemplate| therefore f that within a cofnpa«- ratively shont space of time it will e possible to revise my flgure$ upwards quite considerably* Never theless I have thought it desirable for immediate purposes to take extremely conservative figures, and as will he seen, even these show as much money as can be comfortably handled to begin with. 3. Once some estimates have received official or even semi-official approval, it will be possible to eamend them to the Bahrain Administration and to press them to undertake the preparation of a consider- ed scheme of expansion of their pu’d 'c services, as I have eug ested above it is hopeless to attack the problem piecemeal and in a haphazard manner, parti cularly here in Bahrain where the Administration is accustomed to living more or leas from hand to mouth and where the habit of spending generously though wisely has not yet been assimilated. It is at the same time essential that the Adviser should have an AaalstantA— 3 — Assistant with the least possible delsy in order to relieve him o£ routine detailf which at present oc cupies an absurdly high percentage or his time* It is most important that he should have sufficient lei-* Mire to enable him to prepare intelligent pro ^racimes of expansion and to ensure that real value is obtain ed for the very considerable sums of money which must be expended in the immediate future. I under stand that an offer has been made by India of a Police Officer for this purpose and I need only say here that I trust there will be no undue delay till he arrives to take up his duties in Bahrain. 4. I should have mentioned above that I have discussed my figures with L'r# Belgrave and that he is in substantial agreement with my estimates. 22nd November 1937#From Adviser TO THE Bahrain Government. Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Novr*. 21, 1937. Dear Weightman, Thank you very much for your note on Reserve Fund which I have read with great interest. I had worked it out myself on slightly different lines with the same re suit. I enclose one or two notes on the sub ject. I do not suggest that they should cause any alteration in your note but they may be of interest to you. I entirely agree with the suggestions about the method of building up the Reserve. Yours sincerely, H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S. , H.B.M(s Political Agent, Bahrain.-2- Subject:- Formation of a reserve fund for Bahrain. Data. (a) I have been informed, though unofficially, and it has now been stated in the press both in America and Europe, that the deep well on which the Company has been working for some time has reached another oil producing horizon, 2000ft. below the present field and 4500 feet below ground level. This well is stated to produce 250 barrels a day of oil which is almost gasoline and which is described as 'far more valuable than any yet found in the near or middle East. ' (i) The figure now given as being the amount of money expended by the Company is four million - pounds. (b) (i) In 1554 estimated revenue (without oil) was Rs. 6,55,000/- but the actual revenue was - Rs. 7,74,000/-. In 1552 actual revenue (without oil) was - Rs. 6,71,000/-. This was the lowest revenue - obtained during the worst years. My estimates during those years were invari ably a good deal lower than the actual revenue obtained. I think one could safely assume, on the basis of past actuals, that the lowest probable future revenue would be 6j lacs, not 6 lacs only.The State’s present investments hear interest at the rate of 3^6. (b) Existing investments and deposits which together form the Reserve Fund, now amount to 18 lacs, not 8 lacs. An additional sum was invested after the last oil payment. The 18 lacs are made up as follows Cash on Fixed Deposits 5 lacs £65,000. British War Loan £35,000. India 3j$ stock ) approximately 13 lacs In addition to this a sum of 10 lacs is now in the Consolidated Fund. In March it should he possible to invest another 15 lacs. III. It is estimated that 9 lacs is the prohahle revenue from other sources than oil under present conditions. In this year’s Budget customs revenue and other revenue is estimated at Rs. 7,60,000/- of which Rs. 7,00,000/- is customs ( , licenses and fees. Actually the revenue from customs etc. has already reached Rs. 7,11,000/- and there remain® four months of the year. It can reasonably he assumed that revenue, other than oil, under exist ing conditions could he sa-fely estimated at - 9 lacs per annum.No. C/881-4/1 Political Agency, Bahrain, 30th November 1937* To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain* Subject:- Formation of a Reserve Fund for the Bahrain Administration.

Memorandum: - With reference to your memorandum No. C/85-4/1 dated 29tn January 1^3^ I am giving below my comments on the items where there is some substantial variation from budget figures. (1) State protection . The present excess is owing to the increase in the strength of the police by about 19 men also the purchase of new tents for which no allocation was made in last year f s budget. The expenditure under this heading will show a considerably greater excess over the budget figures by the end of the year as it will include the cost of the^rifles and ammuni tion amounting to over Rs 40,000/-. (2) Secretariat Department . Provision was made in the last budget for the pay of an Accounts Officer and a Pactor to His Highness for the whole year. These two persons were- 2 - not enlisted until about four months ago. Provision was also made for some additional staff which was not engaged. The shortage under this heading will be partly adjusted by the end of the year. (3) Medical services . The allocation for cost of medicine etc was much in excess of the actual amount spent. when preparing the budget allowance was made for expansion in medical services which, owing to lack of staff, did not take place to the extent which was expected. The shortage will be somewhat reduced if the cost of the malaria expert is paid during the current year. (4) Contingencies . This item normally covers stationery, office equipment and furniture, printing and revenue stamps etc. In addition to normal furniture etc. the government purchased steel filing cabinets for dj || the law courts and the Land Department and j L' government offices to replace loose wooden . shelves, costing approximately Rs 5000/-. Dur ing the year all proclamations have been printed instead of being hand written or typed. The excess under this heading is likely to be about Rs 5000/- at the end of the year. (5) Unforseen expenditure. This includes cost of auditor Rs 4000/-, certain bills outstanding in connection with his Highness f s visit to Lngland, Rs 3500/-, cost of a new launch used by the quaran tine Medical Officer Rs 4700/-, grants made by the GovernmentGovernment for building the new Juma mosque and Has Human mosque Rs 3000/-, payment of cost of land acquired from an individual and included in land sold to his Majesty’s Govern ment Rs 8200/-, and certain sums paid by order of His Highness as compensation to persons whose property and belongings were destroyed in (^atar, this amount was approximately Rs 23000/-. (6j Special projects and public works . One lakh was allocated for the construction of a new palace and one lakh for new hospital. No work was done on the palace but work on hospital was commenced after the 9th month of the year. As it was decided that the palace should not be built certain other public works were commenced including, two flats above the law courts, school workshops, Hudeya school, a new girls’ school in maharaq, transport garage, additions to old customs building now converted into a Hest House and police station, rebuilding tower and walls of the Fort. The shortage under this head will be less at the end of the year than as shown at present. (7) Transport Department . This consists of the new government garages in charge of a motor engineer who now deals with all government and municipal motor vehicles including the fire engine, roller etc. Previously all vehicles were attended to by local motor dealers which was most unsatis factory. With reference to your paragraph 3. Pearl-Yearling licenses, boat licenses and miscel laneous revenue collected by the Customs department are shown under one heading as n Customs collections”. The total shown in the budget for revenue from these sources is Rs 700,000/-. Reference paragraph 4. Since the state ment for the nine months was compiled a further Rs 200,000/- has been invested increasing the amount invested during the current year to Rs 15,00,000/-. It is proposed to invest a further Rs 300,000/- before the end of this year. Adviser to the GovernmentC/100-4/1. ConfidentM “IS®.

To His britannic majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your in formation a copy of the Budget of the Bahrain State for the year 1357. The Annual Beport containing full details of last year’s revenue and expenditure and notes on all Departments, Diving Industry, Law and Order, etc., is not yet complete but will be sent to you as soon as possible. I regret the delay. 2. This is the thirteenth Budget which I have had the honour to present. 3. There are certain items in the Budget which may now require some explanation as the detailed notes do not accompany it. (aj On the revenue side the item Oil Gau- ging Beceipts represents payments made to tfee Government by the Bahrain Petroleum Company in return for the services of kr. Purber, the Bah rain Government’s Official Oil Gauger, who in addition to gauging oil for royalty purposesgauges and tests oil wnich is exported. (b) Heserve lund . In this Budget the Rese rve Bund is shown as being Rs 18,00,000/-. Interest is assumed from a further Rsl4,00,000/- which is to be invested during the year. Half of this amount is to be invested at the beginning of the year and half is to be invested six months later. Of the Rs 14,00,000/- the sum of Rsl2,00,000/ is to be obtained from the 1357 annual revenue as shown in the Budget and the remaining Rs2,Q0,0QQ/- is to come from the surplus existing at the end of 1356. In actual fact during the first mohth of 1357 the sum of Rs 11,00,000/- was added to the Reserve ihmd, increasing it to Rs 29,00,000/- and it can be reasonably assumed that before the end of the year the total contribution to the Reserve ?und will amount to considerably more than the Rs 14,00,000/- which is anticipated in the Budget. 1 have the honour to be Sir, Your most Obedient Servant. Adviser to the Government.No. C/323-4/1. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 19th May 1938. From H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter No. 557-21 dated the 15th May 1938 received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, together with a copy of th© Bahrain State Budget for the year 1357. Lf [ 2. In the absence of the report on last year* s Revenue and Expenditure and the note on the activities of the various departments it is a little difficult to criticise the Budget in detail, but I make the following preliminary remarks, which will be subject to revision on receipt of the Adviser’s annual report. 3. In the first place it will be observed that the Budget heads have been changed somewhat, and I think it is undoubt edly a change for the better, since they serve to set forth more clearly the different sources of income and the services and objects on which the income is expended. The totals on both sides of the Budget are almost fantastically in excess of previous figures due to the great increase in receipts under Oil Royalties, and to the consequent expansion of the public services. 4. So far as the main heads of the Revenue Budget are concerned, I have not much to say. I consider that the figure taken for Oil Royalty is quite considerably under estimated, since actual receipts from the last two half yearly/-yearly royalty payments have aggregated Hs. 34,34,000/-, and I should be surprised if the next payments showed a de cline. Revenue under head II. Customs Receipts is estimated some Rs. 3,40,000 more than last year, but judging by the monthly average actuals for the first nine months of 1356 the estimate of Rs. 10,00,000 is more than fully justified. I venture to suggest that the figure taken under the head Customs Duty should be of particular interest to the Govern ment oi India as indicating the existence of an expanding market in Bahrain, of which India might well take fuller advantage t ban it has done hitherto. 5. The Expenditure Budget is obviously an expansion bud get. With the single exception of the figure under headICb) Allowance to the Ruling Family — Civil List, where there is an unexplained increase of Rs. 36,000 I see no cause to cri ticise any of the figures taken on the ground that they are too high. Ify only fear is that the Public Works programme may not be completed within the 12 months, and were it not for th.it apprehension I should have felt it my duty to ad vise the Bahrain Government to increase their budget allot- « ment under the head 'C - ROADS - Metalling of Roads in Mana- mah” in the Schedule of Public Works. I do not, however, exclude the possibility that in the course of the year part of the Public Works funds under the Schedule head 'A - WORKS - MAJOR' may be diverted to this particular sub-head. The increased provision under major head II Adminis trative Services reflects the increased activities of the Bahrain Government and is not in my opinion excessive for Present requirements, though in due course I anticipate that it should be possible to e ffect some reduction under this head/--3- head when new seinrices and departments reach equilibrium. Similarly the figure under major head III Public Health includes a considerable sum for equipping the new hospital and consequently does not represent the true cost of the Medical Department. I should anticipate that the ultimate recurring cost of this department will b e in the neighbourhood of Ks. 1,00,000, this being on the assumption that the anti-malarial measures now in prospect are suff. ciently successful to justify comparatively small future expenditure under this head to maintain pennanently the stand ard of immunity which it is hoped will result from these mea sures • Under major head VI Education there is a very large increase in the funds provided. I find it difficult at this stage to make any forecast of normal expenditure in future and I must content myself with observing that improvements in Education are being financed on a generous scale. In regard to the provision under major head VIII Pub lic Works I need only say that the list of works detailed in the Schedule contains no single item which is not urgently ne cessary. This remark applies even to the first item of Hs. 1,30,000 for a new Palace. As you are aware His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad has never been enamoured of the Qudhaibivah Palace and there can be no doubt that very adequate use can be made of that building by the State if another palace is built more to the liking of the Shaikh. The programme of work listed for the current year is, I think, within the capa city of the existing Bahrain Government organisation, though there can be little doubt that in the near future it will be necessary to call in outside advice and assistance in dealing with the closely inter-related problems which must necessarily arise/-arise in regard to irrigation (i,e. production of water), control of water so used (i.e* anti-malarial measures), and drainage both in urban and rural areas. The investigations so far made by the Malarial and Agricultural Experts lent by the Government of India have convinced me that the en gineering work to be done must be taken as a unified pro ject if the maximum advantages are to b e derived, and such a project would be beyond the resources of the Bahrain S+^te Services. 6. In examining the Budget now presented in the light of my Note of the 22nd November 1937 in regard to the forma tion of a Reserve Fund, I find that the programme postulated for that Fund has been fully provided for. As is shown in the final paragraph of the Adviser's letter there is every reason to hope that the minimum sum of Rs. 14,00,000 to be placed to Reserve will be exceeded, and there is the more reason for this expectation in that I believe that the re ceipts anticipated in the Budget from Oil Royalties are much under-estimated. On the other hand a sum in excess of the amount I had anticipated has been taken from Oil Royalty re ceipts for expenditure during the year. In considering the true State Budget for the year we should exclude on the Re venue side the following*- (a) Oil Royalty ... Rs. 30,00,000 (b) Oil Gauging Payments ••• Rs. 45,500 thus reducing the Revenue proper to Rs. 11,56,500. On the Expenditure side we can omit the following*- (a) ^ Oil Royalty to the Ruling Family ... Rs. 10,00,000 (b) Oil Gauging ••• &lt; ... Rs. 18,000 (c) Loan to Electric Department ••• ... Rs. 60,000 (d) Reserve ••• ... Rs. 12,00,000 TOTAL ... Rs. 22,78,000 This/-This reduces the Expenditure Budget proper to Rs. 19,24,000. Thus the State is expending Rs. 7,67,500 from Oil Royalties during the year, as c ompared with the sum of Rs. 6,50,000 which I had anticipated. Though this in itself is not a serious matter since it is already clear enough that normal (i.e. non-oil) income is a great deal more buoyant than had been presumed in my Note, it is nevertheless necessary to coiv- sider whether developments now in progress will not invo3 i a higher ultimate recurring Expenditure Budget than was antici pated a few months ago. Without going into details I think it can he deduced from the Expenditure Budget presented this year that, aTter excluding oil altogether, normal annual expenditure will tend to average closer to Rs. 14,00,000 than to Rs, 12,50,000 which at first seemed a probable figure. This in turn will necessitate an increase of some Rs. 40,00,000 in the State Reserve, and if we continue to assume that royalty payments should remain steady for a period of 15 years it seems desirable that the Bahrain Government should be advised to increase their minimum annual transfer to R e serve to Rs* 15| or iK^lakhs. I am satisfied that this is well within the bounds of possibility, since, as observed above, non-oil re venue is considerably more buoyant than anticipated, and even the conservative figures taken in my earlier Note of N 0 vember 1937 showed a probable balance after meeting all requirements • item 6 in paragraph IV of Note of 22nd I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, of Rs. 49,00,000 (c November 1937.)

Infonnation which has reached me in the last few days indicates that the supply of Crude Oil from the Bahrain Petro leum Company* s Field is considerably less than the Refinery capacity. This is due to anxiety in regard to encroaching water in the shallow horizon and disappointing results from drilling to the deeper horizon. It is, therefore, likely that there may be some reduction in the total figure for Oil Royal ties this year, though on a rough calculation there is good reason to hope that the figure will not be below Rs. 3l£ lakhs. Since there is still a possibility of improvement in Crude pro duction I do not wish at this stage to revise the remarks made towards the end of my report on current year*s Budget.

Some years ago when Loch was Political Agent at Bahrain,at his suggestion we approached Shaikh Hamad and suggested that out of the oil royalties, which were then beginning to come in, he should give a certain proportion into the Government Treasury. We did not suggest any special, proportion but the Shaikh not only agreed to the principle, but agreed to give quite a considerable fraction to the State. I do not recollect what this fraction was, and as I am writing this letter to catch the mail by Hows on, I have no time to look the correspondence up in my files. Am I cor*ect, however, in saying that the Shaikh*s present income from oil revenues is about £.250,000/- per annum, of which he gives £.200,000/- to the State and keeps £.50,000/- for himself ?

The arrangement is that the Shaikh retains one third of the oil royalties, and hands over two thirds to the State. (The Shaikh's share is, of course, in addition to the Civil List which comes to about 4^ lakhs annually)* 3. The oil royalty for 1938 was Rs 35,02,184, or just over £ 260,000; of this the Shaikh takes £ 87,500 and the State gets £ 172,500.

Weightman, Bsquire, I.C*S#, Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Reeident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to the fact that the Bahrain Gov ernnent Annual Report for the year 1357, (forwarded with my Printed Letter No,C/455-8/9, dated the 26th July 1939) contains a review of the Revenue and Expenditure for 1367, i,e, March 1938 - February 1939 and also the Budget proposals for 1358 i,e, February 1939 to January 1910, I regret that in the stress of Oil negotiations etcetera I over looked. the non-arrival of the State Budget, but I have now requested the Adviser* tc ensure in future that his Budgets are sent to the Agency at the proper time, 2, The year 1357 was most satisfactory financially, receipts being considerably in excess of budget expectat ions and enabling no less than Rs%19 lakhs to be added to the Reserve, On the Expenditure side there were large excesses under (1) Allowances to the Ruling Family, duo solely to increased oil royalties, of which one third is paid to His Highness the Shaikh, (2) Public Protection, . / since (on my recommendation at the time of the abortive ,WS &lt; ' Bahrain an addition to the strength of the Police was made. At the same time it was decided to re arm/■ - X / arm the Police* (3) Unforoeen* due largely to the purchase / (\&amp; of lands from Persian ^subjects lander the terms of the Bahrain^ Property Law* There were large savings under the following heads*- (1) A°ublic Health* ¥Glnlj r due to the fact that no large- scale anti-malaria measure 3 were undertaken, and the new hospital was not ready before the end of the year, thus reducing establishment charges* I may add that 1 have taken steps to ensure that more effective anti-malaria measures are carried out this year* (2) Public Works* Mainly because the project for building a new Palace for His Highness has been temporarily abandoned. It will be observed that the Public Vorks programme underwent considerable revision during the year* I do not consider any grave objection need be raised on this score, since elasticity is essential in a period of rapid development, and the Department has still much to learn in framing estimates for work in Bahrain. 3. In the result Revenue exceeded estimates by roughly 6 lakhs and expenditure (excluding sums placed to Reserve) exceeded estimates by 1 lakh. The invested Revenue at the end of the year amounted to Rs*40 lakhs. 4. In regard to the estimates for the current year, I have the following comments to make* lam** (1) 2 have no doubt whatsoever that Oil Royalty receipt* will exceed estimates by 10 % at least* I need not give detailed reasons for this view which is based on existing production and knowledge of the Company’s policy for the immediate future* (2) Customs Receipts are also much un&amp;ex'**estimated* That the opening of Has port on the mainland will gravely affect collections on transhipped cargo is undeniable, but it cannot afi'ect collections on goods imported for consumption in Bahrain* I expect receipts to exceed the estimate under this head by not less than Rs.2 lakhs, since trade is — and has been/-3 - been — very fair, (3) The receipts under Interest on Reserve Fund are already beginning to reach a very pleasing figure, I understand that even His Highness was impressed. Expenditure . (1) Administrative Services, The increased expenditure here is fully explained by the Adviser, I regard this as inevit able in view of the expanding activities of the Bahrain Govern ment* (2) Public Health^ I sincerely trust that the estimate of Rs* 61000 /- for Anti-Malarial Measures under this head will be greatly exceeded, I have made it my business to ensure that a comprehensive programme of work for the elimination of mosquito-breeding areas is inaugurated and the Adviser has undertaken to provide funds generously as they may be required. Otherwise this head of the Budget* in conjunction with the Medical share of the P,W,D, budget* is one on which Bahrain may congratulate itself, (3) Public Protection, No particular comments, Bquipment charges are hi^h owing to the increased size of the Police Force, I have considered whether* in view of the increased Police strength* a part of the Natur Force might be reduced* but have come to the conclusion that this would be an error in policy* at any rate for some years to come, (4) Education, As you are aware* Mr, Vallanc© has recerttly visited x kahraln to conduct a critical examination of education in Bahrain, This report is expected shortly and will almost certainly involve increased expenditure. It Is futile to attempt to forecast how great this increase will be* but it should be anticipated that the Budget Allotment will be exceeded Non-Recurrent Expenditure is exhibited separately in this budget* and calls for the following comments, A, Investment in Reserve Fund, The provision of Rs*ll lakhs for this purpose is inadequate* particularIjr in a year when a Special/lyM Special Keceipt of Be.4 t 00,000 A is expected ae the result of Oil •Concession NegotiatiopKi* Xts 5.nader}U©cy is oartly due to the heavy cost of the Budget to complete the Manama-Muharraq Causeway (the Advisor*a figure for this is an underestimate) and partly to over-conserve tive estimation of Revenue, it is true that there is a balance of Rs ,3 lakhs from 1357 for investment In ths current year, which brings the total anti cipated investment to Ba# 14 lakhs but f quite apnrt from this, I am convinced that the state can and should invest Rs,15 lakhs at least during 1358. I propose, unless otherwise instructed, to take up this matter with the Adviser when 0 months* actuals are known, B, Ag stated above the c ost of the Manama-Muhrirraq Bridge will exceed the Budget figure, but in all probability the aajor part of the expenditure will come next year. The contractor* will start work in October and since they will be unable to finish this task before the end of the Arabic year they will, presumably only draw running bills, C, An extensive Public Works progra&lt;jrte is again contemplated, Ch the experience of last 3 -ear I doubt if the Bahrain P,W,D. will be able to complete it. 5, As framed the Budget appears to indicate the beginning of p decline in prosperity in Bahrain. In the light of my re marks above, however, it will be evident that thsro is little cau«e for anxiety on this score. Ifevartheless it iv becoming more -nd more apparent that ril previous estimrtes of anti cipated normal expenditure on the administratioR of Bahrain require radical revision: ©ni frerh sources of income must be found. The whole problem may be simplified by new oil discoveries in (or rather below) shoal waters, but such optim ism makes too heavy demands on a beneficent Providence, and the development of other industries is becoming en urgent necessity. As I have indicated in demi-official correspond- \.W S ence/correspondence I believe that other industries can be developed here* Investigation proceed# and I shall revert to this whole problem on a later occasion* I have the honour to be f ■Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Sd.

ITT) refer to Loch's letter No. C/449 dated the 28th April 1934). The two sons themselves would also much rather be on the ordinary civil list which they regard as guaranteeing a greater degree of permanence* r' ^ 3.

How he has the lakh a month, and sure enough he is always overdrawn. We can go a step further and say that even if he nad a crore a month he would still waste the lot and be always short of ready money* 4. So far as the specific issue of the two sons* allowances is concerned I have told Helgrave that if the shaikh pursues the question (and he may vexy easily forget all about it) he should remind His Highness that he has an agreement with the Agency not only to keep nis share of the oil money down to one-third of the total royalties but also to pay )a*ij (at any . rate) out of this share, and that if he wants to xollow up ton’ ble Ueut-Colonel C-G* Prior, C.I.K*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buahire *the matter he must address me. I think it would be as well to decide now the attitude we should adopt if he does address me and also to consider rather more broadly the whole question of the Shaikh’s share of the oil royalties* In theory there is no very sound reason why Da’ij’s and also Ahmad's allowance should not go on the regular civil list, but this merely means that there will be another Rs 7000 or 8000 a year to go do*n the drain via Shaikh Hamad* It is not a serious sum of money in these days in Bahrain, but waste is waste whether the sum be large or small. pb'v 5t Belgrave has written to me saying that the senior Shaikhs constantly talk to him about the whole money question, and that 'they all disapprove of the way His Highness is spending money but are all agreed that none of us can mention the matter to him without making him very angry. They talk freely about the enormous sums of money which he is spending on boys — cash presents, cars, houses, land on which he pays for labour etc •, etc •, and they and his sons resent this even more than they resent his increasing and misplaced generosity to undeserving Bedu from Qatar and elsewhere# There is quite a lot of local feeling about these Bedu outside the Khalifah family. Local people who are some times deserving are given nothing but no Bedu goes away empty-handed'• 6. I cannot really say that resentment either inside or outside the Family at Shaikh Hamad’s wastefulness has yet produced a serious situation in Bahrain, but I should hesitate to say that it will not do so in five years' time# Without going into details I should estimate that Shaikh Hamad takes in something over Rs 13 lakhs a year# Of this he pays out as a regular thing close on 3 lakhs a year to the Al Khalifah Plus some unspecified portion of his old civil list allowance of Rs 1^ lakhs a year. I suppose it costs him about Rs 3 to 4 lakhs a year for household expenses, upkeep of properties, entertain-^entertainment of distinguished guests and so onf and the rest is wasted on Bedu and undesirable young men. 7 # So far ©a Da 1 ij and Ahmad are concerned I should have suggested making a bargain with him by v/hich they go on the State civil list and he meets some other charge* but I cannot think of any bargain he is likely to accept. I suggest, there fore, that if he does follow up this question our attitude should be one of hurt surprise that he should even think of going back on an agreement with us and a blunt statement that he can very well afford to pay two of his sons# 8# The main question however to my mind is whether we should sit back and watch the best part of £ 50,OCX) being wasted every year. At the time v/hen the agreement was negotiated that he should retain one-third of the oil money and pass two-thirds to the State I am pretty certain that no one anticipated that royalties would reach their present total. I think I am right in saying that Bahrain was expected to produce somewhere round 10,000 barrels of crude oil daily whereas it has averaged about double in the last three years and will probably continue at a rate between 18,000 and 20,000 for many years to come. My own feeling is that sooner or later we ought to get the Shaikh, whoever he m^ r be, to reduce his own share to one-fifth. (One ought of course to contemplate a reduction to about one- tenth, but that is, in the circumstances of Bahrain, a dream of tJtopia) • The question on which I cannot make up my mind is whether we should aim ©t this in Shaikh Hamad* s lifetime or whether we should wait and develop our attack on his successor# If I could foresee how long Shaikh Hamad v^ill be v/ith us I could answer the question, but with a diabetic it is useless to guess# Any suggestion to Shaikh Hamad that he should reduce his income would of course uroduce a tremendous explosion; he has worked himself up into the belief already that he is hard up and you can imagine the puzzled resentment he would feel if I suggested to him that he should deliberately cut his own income by about' (0 • 4 • four lakhs a year* On the oiiher hand we do not want this one-third and two-thirds proportion to continue for ever, partly because it is wrong in principle for us to connive at waste and partly because there will sooner or later be trouble about it in Bahrain. 9* It sounds like shirking the issue but on the whole I think we might hold our hand for the moment while carefully watching for any signs of increased resentment in Bahrain at wasteful extravagance, and while simultaneously starting on propaganda with one or two of the senior members of the Family (you will realise why I am not more explicit) in pre paration for a formal proposal that the next Shaikh should signalise his succession by reducing his own share of the royalties to one-fifth. Kven if Shaikh Hamad lasts longer than one might expect and local ill-feeling about waste and extravagance grows more rapidly than I personally believe it will, we shall still be in a better position to exert influence if we can manage to convince the senior members of the Family in advance that a change must come, in their own interests* Yours sincerely, r K.Translation of a letter from His Highness.

Es 10,000/-. Passport receipts last year produced Es 18,000/- but this income will not be maintained* Stricter enforcement of regulations, especially in the case of Persians resident in Bahrain and the cancelling of steamer passes for visitors to mail boats will reduce this source of revenue very considerably. 4. Judicial Receipts. Es 8,000/-. There is no basis on which to estimate this revenue which depends upon the type of cases made in the courts. 5 0 Motor Vehicle Taxes. Es 35,000/-.

M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- Reference your memorandum No. C/289-4/1 dated 7th April 1940 I forward herewith final revenue and expenditure figures for 1358 and notes thereon. * Enel.... S.Z.Note on Expenditure 1358. Estimated expenditure i'or 1358 was Rs 31,41,000/-, actual expenditure was Rs 36,75,000/-. The difference between actual and estimated expenditure is mainly owing to the following reasons. His Highness bhaikh 5ir Hamad gave Rs 4,00,000/- to the British Government towards the cost of the war. The Bahrain Government purchased a large supply of rice, half of which was sold during the year. The value of the remainder at the end of the year was Rs 1,36,000/-. Although this sum is included in expenditure for 1358 it may be regarded as an item of revenue for 1359 and has been shown in the estimated revenue for that year. The expenditure on public protection was appro ximately Rs 41,000/- more than the estimated cost. The oil royalty amounted to more than the anticipated sum and therefore the one third which was paid to His Highness’s Privy Purse was more than was provided in the 1358 budget. In spite of heavy unexpected expenditure the Reserve Fund was increased by Rs 10,00,000/-. Allowances to the Ruling Family. Rs 15,16,663. One third of the oil revenue paid direct to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad amounted to Rs 10,78,437/-, the remaining Rs 4,38,335/- represents Civil List pay ments to the Ruling Family. The total amount was about Rs 1,00,000/- less than last year owing to decrease in oil revenue. iidvisenate. Rs 66,499/-. Expenditure was approximately Rs 7,000/- less thanthan the amount which was anticipated. Provision was made for an ^sistant Adviser but the appoint ment was not made until after the beginning of the year. Customs Department. Rs 80,903/-. Several vacant appointments in the customs staff were not filled and expenditure was approximately Rs 5,000/- less than was expected. Judicial, Awakaf and Minors Departments. Rs 54,177/- Expenditure was less than estimated but approxi mately Rs 7,000/- more than last year. The Minors 1 Department which was started during the course of 1357 had to be paid for during the whole year in 1358. The salaries of the Bahrain Court Magistrates were increased during the year by one third. Public Works Department. Rs 33,273/-. Expenditure was Rs 6,000/- less than the budgeted amount but Rs 4,000/- more than 1357 expenditure. Land Department. Rs 40,172/-. Expenditure was as estimated in the Budget. Passport Department. Rs 13,344/-. Expenditure exceeded the Budget by approximately Rs 1,000/- and was approximately Rs 2,000/- more than during the previous year. Oil Gauging. Rs 13,530/-. Expenditure exceeded the budget by Rs 2,000/-. Transport Department. Rs 5,66l/-. Expenditure was less than the budgeted amount. Public Health. Rs 1,36,160/-. Expenditure was Rs 7,000/- more than the budgeted amount. Special additional expenditure on anti--3- anti-malaria measures was sanctioned during the year. Education. Rs 84,677/-. Last year it was proposed that certain new schools should be built and provision was made for them. The matter was postponed. The Inspector of education was discharged at the end of the 1357 school year and there was a saving in respect of his salary. Expenditure was approximately Rs 15,000/- less than the budgeted amount. Municipalities. Rs 60,807/-. Expenditure was Rs 3,000/- less than the amount provided. Agriculture. Rs 16,346/-. Expenditure was almost double the estimated amount. The experimental garden was enlarged and new land was put under cultivation. Departmental expenses. Rs 14,305/-. Approximately Rs 7,000/- less than the estimated amount. Unforseen. Rs 4,37,315/-. Included under this heading is the sum of 4 lakhs gifted to the British Government. Public Protection. Rs 2,93,833/-. Expenditure was Rs 1,000/- more than during last year and approximately Rs 40,000/- more than the amount provided. This covers the cost of special defence measures and additional transport, motor bicycles etc.firmaments and Equipment. Rs &lt;d9,956/-. Expenditure according to budget. Transport. Rs 6,833/-. Expenditure according to Budget. King Ibn Saoud’s visit. Rs 38,101. Not provided for in the budget. Food Supplies. (Rice). Rs 1,36,186/-. Not provided for in the budget.Public Works. The sum allocated to Public Works in the 1358 budget was Rs 7,70,600/-, the actual expenditure was Rs 6,35,300/-, of this amount, Rs 5,91,000/- was spent on works which were included in the budget, and Rs 44,000/- on new work approved and sanctioned during the year, but not provided for in the budget. In most cases the expenditure exceeded the esti mated amount but this was frequently due to additions to and extensions of the original plans, especially in the case of the hospital buildings and the pier extensions. 1. Manamah-Muharraq Swing Bridge. Rs 59,463/-. The contract was made during the current year, a sum of Rs 3,00,000/- was provisionally included in the budget before it was known how much the bridge would cost. The contract price was Rs 3,83,000/- of which Rs 59,000/- was paid during 1358. A sum of Rs 35,000/- was budgeted for extending the two ends of the sea road to the pier terminals. The work was done by the Manamah and Muharraq munici palities and the cost was Rs 61,376/-. Each side cost approximately the same amount. 3. Hospital Buildings. Rs 3,35,000/-. The amount provided in the budget was Rs 3,57,000/-. The dispensary was entirely completed, the women 1 s hospital and staff quarters were almost finished and considerable progress was made with the men T s hospital. Foundations of the administrative building were finished and various additional buildings such as boiler house etc. were completed. The cost of building was very much more than waswas estimated owing to the need for deep founda tions, in part of the ground it was found necessary to build twelve feet deep before reaching solid ground. The work which is still to be done consists of completion of men’s hospital, the administrative block which includes operation theatre etc. and various walls and outhouses. Manamah pier extension. Rs 1,01,588/-. The explanation of the additional expenditure add work is given under Public Works Department. \ | Pier Trolley Lines.

With one exception the actual receipts from all sources equalled or exceeded the estimated amounts. The sum of Rs 4 , 00 , 000 /- which was expected during the year on account of the oil concession over the addi tional area was not received during 1358 ; customs receipts however amounted to Rs 4 , 38 , 000 /- more than had been anticipated and the oil royalty produced Rs 3 , 35 , 000 /- more than the estimated revenue. Total revenue was Rs 3 , 33 , 000 /- less than in 1357 . The oil royalty decreased by approximately Rs 3 , 00 , 000 /- and customs receipts were Rs 60 , 000 /- less than in 1357 . None of the sources of revenue requires particular explanation except Land Revenue, Rs 75 , 000 /-, which is abnormally high owing to the receipt of Rs 34 , 000 /- from the Air Ministry on account of outstanding rents of the aerodrome and the price of land at Muharraq, sold to the Royal Air Force of which the price of government land was approximately Rs 18 , 000 /-.^tdentlal • D.O.No•C/322-4/1.

Notes by the Adviser on Revenue and Expenditure /yT - for the same year. - | B. 1. Revenue and Expenditure Budget figures for the year 1359, together with a schedule of public works* ^ t»«7 2. Notes by the Adviser on ^xpected Revenue and Expenditure. ^ f ^ 2* In regard to last year’s figures I need have little to say. On the Revenue side Oil Royalty and Customs receipts greatly exceeded Budget expectations,^as^I forecast they would in paragraph 4 of my letter No.C/456 of the 26th July 1939. In point of fact Oil Royalty receipts were slightly less than I had anticipated as production had to be rather more rigorously controlled than originally expected in order to prevent the undue inflow of edge water. On- 2 - ' (0 &gt;^y the other hand neither the Bahrain State nor I foresaw that the approval of His Majesty’s Govermient to the draft lease for the Unallotted Area would be so greatly delayed thet the consequent payment of Rs. 4 lakhs by the Company would not be made before the close of the year. Abnormal receipts under Land Revenue are explained in the Adviser’s letter* On the Expenditure side the main items calling for comment are the following s- (a) Public Hefilth The excess here of roughly Rs,11,000 was largely due to anti-malarial measures taken in the second half of the year. The excess was foreseen in my letter referred to above and would have been greater but for the departure of the State Medical Officer before the close of the year, fib) Education There was a saving of rather more than Rs.l5,C00* During the year Mr. Vallance visited the State to examine educational methods and necessities in Bahrain, and develop ment was wisely delayed pending the receipt and examination of his report. An unsatisfactory Inspector of Education was discharged and not replaced. The temporary halt in expenditure and progress is however fully compensated during the current year. (c) Public Protection The great excess over the Budget figures here (roughly Rs.41,000) was mainly due to special defence measures taken on the outbreak of war and to the purchase of essential equipment to put them into operation. This special equip ment was in addition to the rifles and ammunition for which Budget provision of Rs.30,750 had been made under the head Non-recurrent Expenditure - State Protection - Armaments. (d) Kina Ibn Baud 1 s visit The expenditure of Rs. 28,000 on King Ibn Saud’s visit requires /-requires no comment except to note with some satisfaction that this visit involved the State, as apart from His Highness personally, in so little expenditure. (e) Coat of Rice Hs. 1,36,000 vac an item of unforeseen expenditure incurred at the outbreak of war when there was doubt whether foodstuffs would continue to reach Bahrain in normal volume. The State has however been able to sell this rice during the current year. (**) Public &gt;yorkg The variations between budget figures and actuals under the head Public works are, with one exception, fully explained in the Adviser’s notes. This exception relates to the cost of the Manamah Customs Pier Sbctension, which exceeded the estimate by close on Hs.-34,C00/-, due mainly to excessive subsidence and the need for providing a greater wharf area than originally contemplated. The State Public Works Department has now gained some experience in framing estimates and these should in future be rather more accu rate. The aain items on which expenditure was incurred but which had not been contemplated at the time of the budget were (a) the construction of a new rifle range, which was rendered necessary by the purchase of machine guns and (b) a Police Post, Jail and Tower on Jedda Island to provide for the better guarding of long term prisoners and for certain defence measures. 3. In commenting on the budget figures for the current year one must necessarily allow for the fact that budgeting in wartime may be rendered entirely nugatory by circumstan ces beyond local control. In the Revenue Budget for in stance one would expectthe Oil Royalty and Customs receipt figures to be exceeded if the war goes well, but it must be /-IV. /- - 4 - v be recognised that tanker shortage may gravely affect the former. Roughly 75 % of the oil exported from Bahrain has hitherto been carried in Norwegian and Danish tankers, and at the moment the future of the tanker fleets of these two nations is obscure. Similarly an extension of hosti lities might gravely affect shipping in the Gulf and there by render the estimates under Customs totally illusory. One may however express the pious hope that the item 'New Oil Concession - Rs.4,00,000' will mature this year. 4. On the Expenditure side, I make the following remarks on the assumption that there will be no major interference with the normal administrative life of Bahrain. II. Administrative Services . The provision made here is likely to be in excess of requirements. For instance if the Air Ministry perchance re$ch a decision on the suggestion to employ Captain Byard as Defence Officer the post of Assistant to the Adviser will become vacant and need not be refilled during the war; it may well be unnecessary to fill certain vacant posts in the Customs Department; while the provision under (c) 'Judicial, U'akfs and Minors Departments' includes a sum of Rs.10,000 for remuneration to a legal expert to codify law in Bahrain, and this sum will, I believe, be found excessive. III. Public Health. Tjhe provision here greatly excddds last year*s budget partly because it allows for the staff required for the new hospital and partly on account of increased pro vision for anti-malarial measures. I think it is unlikely that the former will be required in full and I fear it will involve considerable effort to ensure that the latter is fully expended.5 - IV. Public Protection . In providing Ks.50,000 for special defence measures i.e. for a special police force to guard the Oil Field and Refinery, the Adviser has not taken into account the reduction in strength which might w£Ll be ma&amp;e in the normal State Police and Ifatur strength. I have drawn hes attention to this and my personal belief is that expenditure under this head should not exceed Rs. 3 lakhs, even allowing for the increased cost of rations in wartime. V. Kducation Sub-head (a) includes the Bahrain Government’s share of Mr. Vallance's pay and sub-head (b) provides for a very desirable expansion of the Technical School. I shall be reporting separately and more fully on the pro gress of education in Bahrain shortly. VI. Public Works I have no particular remarks to make on the schedule of public works though I feel bound to say that I shall be surprised if the full amount provided for hospital buildings is expended during the year. 5. It will be seen that the Budget allows for a surplus for investment of roughly Rs. 13 lakhs, which ordinarily I should describe as an inadequate investment, particularly in view of the expected receipt of Rs. 4 lakhs due on the completion of the J^ease for the Unallotted Area and of the investment of only Rs. 10 lakhs last year. 1 be seen from the remarks in toy letter No.0/45 he 26th July 1939 under the head 'Investment in Reserve Fund' I anticipated that a total of Rs. 18 lakhs might be invested last year. The expected receipt of Rs. 4 lakhs forthe Unallotted Area did not however accrue and the war cost Bahrain in one way or another roughly Rs. 5l lakhs. Consequently /-. Mi- *Consequently last year*s investment of Hs* 10 lakhs was 6 - a most praiseworthy addition to the Reserve. This year, provided oil shipments are maintained and provided there is no interference with customs receipts as the result of the war, I should anticipate the Revenue to he close on 4 lakhs more than has been anticipated while Expenditure may well be from Rs. 1 lakh to 3 lakhs less than the Budget figures. It is conceivable therefore that there may be Rs. 18 or 19 lakhs for investment this year and this possibility will be borne in mind for discussion with the Adviser later in the year.

As far as Da’ij and Ahmad are concerned I agree with the proposal in paragraph 7 of your letter, if we mention *■ the agreement, the Shaikh will probably be slightly puzzled as his memory is always weak when it is in his interest to forget, but he is unlikely to pursue the matter further. 3. As regards the v/ider question, i entirely agree with you that it is unpleasant to think of so much money being wasted in such a way and on such undeserving people, i think, however, that we should feel our way carefully before we try to get the Ruler’s quota reduced, for at the time it t v/as considered that the Shaikh was being rather generous in giving such a high percentage of the royalties to the State l i Of course, as you say, no one anticipated that they would reach their present figure. 4. As regards reducing the Ruler’s share to one-fifth, I entirely agree with the proposal in paragraph 9 of your letter. We should get little support for an immediate attack on Shaikh Hamad’s one-third, but v/e ought to tie down the next Ruler in advance by getting letters from the senior members of the Family saying that they think the Ruler’s share ought to be one-fifth of the royalties. If, then.

His Highness the Shaikh has said no more about Da^j’s and Ahmad’s allowances and there is now a good chance that this particular trouble will die a natural death. 3 . I tiiink it would be an excellent idea if you would write to Shaikh Hamad as you rxropose in paragraph 5 of your letter. I wish it were possible to go a little further and to suggest a sort of Shaikh’s Fund which he and his successors should create by periodical invest- ments, the proceeds of which would be for the sole use of the Shaikh at the time, and which would descend from Shaikh to Shaikh undiminished by gifts, legacies or divisions by Share law. However I am afraid this is not a practical idea in Shaikh Hamad’s time. 4 . I propose, unless you see any objection, to make your letter to Shaikh Hamad the opportunity for opening my discussions with the senior members of the family. I doubt if I will be able to get letters from them saying that they think the Ruler's share should be one-fifth, but if I can get them to agree to the principle it will probably be sufficient to tell then that I am communicating their views to you by letter.

Should be handed over to him/ Belgruve nas done his best to resist this and has reminded His Highness that this sum of .* 4 lakhs is shown as a revenue receipt not only in the current State budget but also in la.it year 1 s budget (when it was / expected it would accrue). He has reJBi.nded Kis Highness that both these budgets were passed by him and that the last one at any rate h-S actually been published. He has further reminded His Highness that the gift of 4 lakhs to His Majesty 1 s Government for war purposes was to be covered by this particular receipt. His Highness has become more and more /- |,l) ie Lieutenant-Colonel C. G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. onmore impatient and ill-tempered and yesterday sent Sir 2 - Abciullah and Salman as his 'Ambassadors' to Bslgrave to settle the matter. Both of them fully appreciate Bclgrave’s points, hut in true Arab manner say that perhaps half the total sum of is 4 lakhs might be handed over to the Shaikh 'to make his heart glad'. Belgravt managed to talk out the discussion yesterday but it will no doubt be resumed. As a last resort, if pressure is maintained, he proposes to advise His Highness to discuss the matter with me and to this I have agreed. 3. If His Highness does discuss the question with me I shall of course repeat Belgrave f s arguments - perhaps in more forcible language than Belgrave could afford to use. I intend to remind him that although he is constantly pleading poverty he has in fact enormous riches, sums far beyond his wildest dreams a few years ago. I snail remind him that the whole honour and glory of the gift of &amp; 4 lakhs to His Majesty’s Government accrued to him personaiiy and that his present demand in effect means that that gift will be charged solely against funds wnicn are intended to be expended for the benefit of his peo ple. I will teii aim that when His Majesty tne King makes a gift he pays for it from his own privy Purse and does not ask the Government to meet it. And finally I will remind him that tnough he claims to be hard up he has nevertheless managed to loan &amp; 2 lakhs to the Qosaibis, servants of Ibn Baud, which he will probably never see again, and is at the moment tuinking of a loan of its 1 lakh to H&amp;ji Yusuf Kunoo which will most cer tainly never be repaid. 4.

Dated the 7th October 1940. Vi ^ Will you please refer to the correspondence regarding the possible reduction by the next Shaikh of th share he retains of the Bahrein Oil Royalties. (I regret I ca v not quote the refenence as my file has not yet arrived from India). On the eve of Hamadhan I had a further long discussion v/ith Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad. I reminded them of our previous discussions and said I hoped they had given the matter careful thought. It was evident that they had not thought about it much, but they seemed to be in a malleable frame of mind. After I had repeated ray previous arguments at full length and had discoursed on the necessity of being at least one jump ahead of the critics at all times| they remarked that the major difficulty was the appalling drain which Arab customs of hospitality and &lt; aid to old friends and adherents ifemnose on a shaikh* s finances. They thought that economy might be effected by preparing an annual 'Privy Purse Budget' which would contain a definite, limited provision for Musa'adat (the Bahrain Shaikhs are inclined to confuse a Budget with Actuals, and to forget their propensity for ignoring it once it is framed). I encouraged this idea which at least has a certain amount of promise in it, but developed the theme that a provision of Rs. 1^ lakhs for Musa*adat was ample. I then pointed out that the existing Civil List (apart from the share in Oil Royalties) amounts to almost exactly 4-1/3 lakhs annually, The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel including /- C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.including the Ruler*s old personal allowance of Rs. l£ lakhs. I know that Shaikh Hamad gives the whole of this /u* 4-1/3 lakhs to the A1 Khalifah, whether in fixed allowances or in additional •'dollops’*, and I did not imagine that any future Ruler would satisfy the Family with less. But Oil Royalties should average round about Rs. 32^ lakhs at a conservative estimate, and one fifth of this is Rs. 6^- lakhs. Deduct the Musa'adat provision of Rs. l£ lahks an - Lhe Ruler is left with Rs.5 lakhs for his own personal enjoyment and gratification. How many AX Khalifah Sha^Jfcs had ever been able to rattle 5 lakhs in their pockets, knowing that not only the Family but also the honoured guest and the importunate beggar^ we ’e provided for separ ately ? It was evidently a startling thought, as was the follow-up that a confident Shaikh could reply to unconscion able demands on Shaikhly generosity - 'I an giving my people 26 lakhs every year from Oil Royalties. I give them tranauility and good order within my state (N.B. I had pre viously bean discussing the reorganisation of the Police); I give them a well-devised scheme of Bducation; I give^ them a high standard of Public Health: I give them good roads and a pure water supply in their houses (N.B. a now not too distant rospect); I give them (almost) free trade; I give them a fair administration and a freedom almost unknown in the Middle East from the tyranny and exact&gt;*iis of petty officials. Go, then, and make what you will by your own honest effort*'. High-flown possibly, but unquestionably palatable. Less comforting, but not without effect was a reading of the article sent to me with your V VPp' D.O.No.C/330 dated the 2nd September. By the time the Shaikhs were becoming somewhat exhausted (we had already discussed other subjects) and Shaikh /-- 3 - Shaikh Salman, in asking that they might go, delivered a somewhat obscure speech which appeared to indicate that while they fully understood the need for change in a changing world,and that the Huler of Bahrain could undoubtedly do very well on a much smaller incore, changes must be gradual. The new Shaikh, when his time came, must settle himself in ( an interesting remark in the light of other correspondence on a cognate subject) and when secure should unquestionably proceed on the advice which I had given in these two discuss- I am afraid that owin^ to the brief interval between my return from recess and the beginning of damadhan I cannot claim to have brought the affair to a definite conclusion. But I believe that it could now be clinched without undue trouble if you yourself would be prepared to receivedShaikh Abdulla and Shaikh Salman for a final discussion on your next visit here. My successor might not find it easy to embark on a discussion of such delicacy until he has been in Bahrain for some months and it would be well, I venture to suggest, to strike the final blow while the iron is still warm. ions.

Dated 1.0 th. C-Otaher—19 4 .0 Reference to previous correspondence: Description df Enclosure. Suxnmary of Revenu the first half and Expenditure for of year 1359 - (March - August, 1940)P.A Ref: 4. The Statement of ’revenue* does not appear to be a correct statement of the finances of the Bahrain Government in view of the fact that a sum of R s .1,33,043-2-2 was received in royalties for the first six months of the year 1935 and only a sum of Rs.88,696 has been accounted for. This is due to the fact that in accordance with the arrangement with the Shaikh royalties received are to be divided into the proportion l/3rd to the Shaikh and 2/3rds to the State. From an accounts point of view and also to keep a record of the distribution it may be considered desirable to ask the Adviser to show the full amount received from, the Company under revenue and to show the disbursement of l/3rd to the Shaikh in the expenditure statement. In the event of a detailed audit of the Bahrain Government accounts at a later date such an entry may raise doubts and objections. For orders please.
