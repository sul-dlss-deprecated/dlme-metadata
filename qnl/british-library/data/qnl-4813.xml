It shall be the duty of the above-men tioned head of the guard to keep order in the areas in his charge to such extent as the Company may order him, he shall have no right to interfere in any disputes among the Company’s servants unless asked by the Company to do so. The Company hereby agree that so long as the provisions of Bahrein Orders in Council 1913 and 1922, or any Order in consolidation thereof or in substitution therefor or supplementary thereto, remain in force, and jurisdiction over certain foreigners in the State of Bahrein is exer cised by His Britannic Majesty, the provisions in the second paragraph of this Article V shall not apply in respect to commissions of any acts of theft or damage by any person (1) if, on such person being arrested, it is found that he is a foreigner over whom jurisdiction exercised by His Britannic Majesty under the said Orders in Council has been extended, or (2) if, in the event of no arrests being made, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Company, or if necessary, the Political Agent, that the offender is such a foreigner as above mentioned, and that he has left the territory governed by the Sheikh and has not to the knowledge of the Sheikh or his officials returned thereto, and that no arrest could therefore be made. Article VI. IN case of misconduct the said guards are subject to dismissal or fine by the Company.
