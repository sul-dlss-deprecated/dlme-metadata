Dear Sir, SUPVEYOR Please refer to your letter No. 324-3/31 dated 2nd February, 1948 regarding the appointment of Mr, J. F. Gornall to survey craft belonging to Messrs. Gray, Dawes &amp; Co., Ltd., and Messrs. Gray, MacKenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., incidental to their registration as British ships at the Port of Londoi^. We notice however the number of craft now me#irloned is eight, i.e. two tugs, two lighters, two steel barges barges GM 29 and 30 whereas in your letter No. 3808-3/3 dtf^ed 6th December', 194? tonnage measurements were requested for two barges only. Also according to information received from Mr. J. Allcard of Messrs. Gray, MacKenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., only two of these craft, the two tugs, are at Bahrain. It will be appreciated therefore that what appeared to be a simple job in the first instance and which Mr. Gornall was prepared to do in his own time, has developed into a task of some magnitude, and there is the further complication that the craft are not all situated in Bahrain. We have discussed the matter with Mr. Gornall and whilst the Company has no objection to his making the surveys in his own time, it is regretted, leave of absence cannot be given to allow him to perform work elsewhere. His own opinion is that as it will be presumably necessary to appoint a surveyor who will be able to travel to the various locations, it might be an advantage to leave it to the person appointed to complete the whole of the survey. Mr. Gornall also points out that whilst he was willing to undertake, in his own time, the non-lengthy job of surveying two barges as originally intended he does not feel disposed to agree to take on a job that will entail a great many hours of work.

Yours faithfully, for Political Agent The Manager, Grpy Mackenzie &amp; Co.Ltd., Bahrain.Th® Jnited Overseas Petroleum Company on behalf of Caltex Shipping Company required a survey of the 'Karzakan 11 and the 'Muharraq' for tonnage measurements needed for British registration. As the tugs are at Bahrain the Ministry of ^hipping asked Mr. Gornall if he would survey them on their behalf. ministry telegraphed through F.O. and Residency sent copy of t-elegram direct to Mr. Gornall. Bapco replied stating that ^ir. Gornall agreed to undertake the survey but required a certificate of appointment under the Ilerchant Shipping Act 1894 and the forms and instructions for his guidance. Residency informed F.O. to this effect in their telegram -.301 o^ 3.4/1.2/4:8) to wfiiich no re^ly has been received to-date. papers net pass through ii r.

''nen he calls on us.;or, with and 'Muharraq'^in the sam separately by the other a Mr. MacGregor, wit|n whom I have had four or five telephone conversations rjg^arding this case, came to see me this afternoon. I have had difficulty in sorting the matter out because (1) Mr. Russell Brown opened it with me as a confidential case and there was at the seme time a file going in the E.O. - no one is however to be blamed for this. (2) Bapco dealt^^ith the cases # on one hand of 'Karzakkan' * e letter while they were dealt with uthorities, i.e. Unopet, the-Registrar of Shipping, Hong Kong, ahd the Ministry* of Transport. - The reason why the letter S.34 was not connected with the correspondence in th5 C.O. seems to be that the Superintendent (who took over after its receipt) was unaware of its existence when the C.C. asked him whether anything about this subject had come from Hong Kong. The fact that the Residency took it upon- itself 1 to indulge in the most extraordinary correspondence With Mr. Gornall by sending him a copy of a Foreign Office telegram - added further confusion. •The following action is required now and for the fore seeable future. (1) The C.6. and the Superintendent should both see this note so that they will be familiar with the cases and alle to • deal witl^ any correspondence concerning it coming into their respective offices. (2) Confidential pppers should be put on the E.O. file and the matter should in future be dealt with there. w '■ n 1 - . ■ . &gt; . ^ (3) Mr. MacGregor^(who is dealing directly with the case) tells me that for the purpose of survey of 'Karzakkan' and 'Muharraq', Mr, Gornall may need to correspond with the Ministry of Transport, London. H^ has a query regarding 'the application of Rule 1 or 2'. * I have told Mr. MacGregor that it would be better if this correspondjence is done through us, and if a telegramor other communication is to te sent concerning such a query, a reference should be given by us to the number and date of the letter at S.37. (4) As regards 'Hidd' , the letter at S.S4 says that the . carving and marking note must be signed 'by an officer ap pointed by you 1 (i.e. the Political Agent); but it is clear from the carving and marking note that it can be signed by the authorities there named: and it will do very well if signed by Mr. Gornall and countersigned by A.P.A. or myself. The Certificate of Registry of 'Hidd' can then be handed over to the Master of the vessel or to Bapco. I will take up the matter-regarding the cony of Foreign Office telegram to Mr. Gornall with the Residency ^ / myself. 5M'. 19-r-49.
