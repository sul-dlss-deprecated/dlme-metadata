'•Bandra'* was kept in an uproar till 4.30 a .m. by a party of drunken Americans returning from leave in Persia, and last night an even greater disturbance was caused by a body of intoxicated Americans proceed- -ing on leave who behaved in a disgraceful manner until an even later hour. if you are unable to guarantee the behaviour of your American employees on British vessels, it would be better if you arranged to ship them on your own steamers in future. As I cannot say whether the men at fault were employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company or the Calif or- -nia Arabian Standard Oil Company! enclose a copy of this letter for the Manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company.

Mo American employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company have been on leave in ?er sia - f or ^? ver . ^ he so the men you referred to who were creating the distu^banc on the night prior to the 15th were not from our organisation. As for the men leaving on the vessel the night o. the ^th 'Peoruary, there were no Americans from this organisation but one British subject was going on short leave to India. Of the total of 225 employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company we average from 4C to 5C Americans and we endeavour to arrange that they do not leave or arrive in Bahrain in large groups. ^&lt;rv^ i will guarantee the behaviour of the American; employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to the test of my X ability and will take steps to discipline any member o. the Staff of this Company who is guilty of sucl acts or rowdyi sm. I will also bring this matter to the attention of our Directors in Mew York and ask them to be more cautious in the selection of Americans they send abroad. i greatly appreciate your calling thi ® ^ vi attention and although the occurrences were not to any employees of this organisation 1 dc feel that these ^on. -ditions cannot be allowed to continue and i. wi^ ao a-tl within my power to correct such an embarass:ng situation. lours bery truly, sdp.
