Iiy dear Uo.■/, ijiate^aiai .n ote to rae the otnar day explaining how it ivae impoasibla for 14a a a an Gamaiyeh to separate himself iroia hi a ago omit Books and send them here as called upon b y you to do. ^a a matter of fact, a never intended that they should be sent here; I ordered -aaaan to produce them and warned him that i. oould not proceed witn the case until he did, and all I really wanted was that Agha Badr should let me ivnow when tney were forthcoming. The caae will have to be continued on the spot aa soon aa i can arrange. 0 1 expect to have to come dov/n Ciulf aoon and will call for tiie purpose. Will you kindly explain to Agha Badr, 1 do not want you as V.O. to have anything to do with the abu i^usa caao, or with the Bamaiyeh's in that connec tion, so please do not take any action at Agha Badr,'a sug gestion without reference to me. The reason is that we do not want to do anything to give a handle to the Germans to bring the case into Persia and try and work through Legation. As long as we deal with it as^a Trucial Coast matter under the jurisdiction of the Resident, we are on raufih stronger ground. Yours sincerely, Sd/- P. Z. Oox.(Original on p^go 350 flle Voi _ vi _ ^ July Slat 1912. Dear Dr. Listemann, Please see your reference of the 21st July regarding Hassan Samaiyeh's Account Books. .-iien I enquired into his claims I found that, accord ing to him, the details were based mainly on his account books, which were not forthcoming. They had not been in hii possession for several months; were not in Lingah and he could not ascertain whether they were in Bushire, Basrah, or Europe. I miormed him that I could not proceed with the case until he produced them. I did not mean that he must produce them here (unless they turned out to be here already) and it was a misunderstanding on the part of the Residency Agent when he asked Hassan to send them here. I have explained to him that I did not want them here. Understanding that Hassan is now ready to produce them, I will proceed with the enquiry at the first opportunity. &lt; I have had to make a reference to Government regarding your letter Ho.315 and will reply on getting their answer.
