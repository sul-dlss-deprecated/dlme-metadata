Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I-E. C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Dep; Department endorsement No. 1251, dated 3rd July 1911, in connection with Captain Shatespear’s recent meeting with Abdul Aziz “ Bin Saud ”, at which 2. The subject was last in evidence in 1906-1907, and was then reviewed in Foreign Department despatch No. 28, dated 21st February 1907, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State. At that time the Government of India inclined to the view that it might be expedient in our general interests not to ignore altogether the advances of Bin Saud; but His Majesty’s Government felt unable to modify their former attitude towards’ the question, and I was ultimately directed to let Bin Saud know through the third parties who had approached me, that his proposals involved considerations which it was impos sible for His Majesty’s Government to entertain, and that no other answer than this must be expected. Since then Bin Saud has made our Political Agent’s personal acquaintance, in the course of two visits to Shaikh Mubarak at Kuwait; and in March last at a chance meeting in the hinterland, when Captain Shakes- pear was on his usual spring excursion, unburdened himself again to our represen tative. 3. During the five years which have elapsed since the situation was last examined, the Porte has not felt in a position to make the slightest attempt to re-establish its footing in Nejd, while, on the other hand Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud has greatly increased his personal prestige and the sphere of his influence and control. In fact, Captain Shakespear tells me that he now asserts himself north wards to a point more than half way between Buraida and Ha*(, while on the south he collects tribute as far as the Wadi Dowasir. He thus feels no doubt that he is in a stronger position than ever to recover Hasa and Katif, if only the sea were closed to the Turks. 4. Meanwhile, our own point of view seems to be somewhat affected by the fact that we are, or are likely to be, at issue with the Porte in regard to our respective rights and interests in the Persian Gulf, in connection with which the Porte seems disposed to be intractable, and it may be considered that we can not afford to ignore, without mature deliberation, any indirect means ready to our hand, for putting such pressure on the Turks as may be likely to make them more amenable. So long, however, as our diplomatic relations with them are satisfactory, or at all events correct, we seem to be no more in a position now than we were five years ago, to enter into any understanding with Bin Saud, whether open or secret, which would envisage the expulsion of the Turks from Hasa and Katif, and the resumption by the Wahabi Chief of these former possessions of his family. On the other hand, we have excellent and natural reasons for being desirous of maintaining cordial, if distant, relations with Bin Saud; at any rate for not wishing to create in him a feeling of soreness and ill-will towards us. Granting that the friendly sentiments which he evinces for us are mainly promoted by a consideration of his own material interests, yet the treatment receive a British representative if he ever got down to the coast, seem to give us reason for pause before again rejecting his advances absolutely. At all events, it seems incumbent on Captain Shakespear to send him a direct and friendly reply, even if it be a disappointing one. 4. The present expediency or inexpediency of coming to any friendly and innocuous understanding with him, hinges upon the attitude of the Porte in I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with the latter renewed his former overtures for closer relations with the British Government. accorded by him to Captain Shakespear, the latter’s impressions of the Arab’s fine personality, and the phenomenon of his frank and spontaneous offer toregard to our various interests in the Gulf, a consideration regarding^which I have no information which would justify me in making recommendations. I can, therefore, do no more than indicate arrangements which would appear to me to be conceivably feasible, if consonant with the policy of His Majesty’s Government. In return for a nominal sibsidy or occasional present, Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud might be willing to undertake in writing— (z) to oblige his subjects to observe the Maritime Truce and to send no armed dhows to sea without our concurrence ; and not to allow coast under his control to be used as base for piratical exploits (such as we experience from individuals like the outlaw Ahmad bin-Salam) ; (ii) to maintain friendly relations with Chiefs and principalities in relations with the British Government; L i (m) to prohibit by Notification the import of arms by sea, by his depen dents. It might be explained to him that his observance of the above innocuous conditions of agreement, especially the last one, would furnish us with some grounds for objecting to the disturbance of the present status quo by the Turks, which status quo would be considered to involve the retention of Hasa and Katif by the Porte and the independence of Nejd under its Arab rulers. It is quite conceivable that Abdul Aziz wants no half measures and would prefer to be left unhampered if we cannot respond in the way which he would like, but if we offered him terms somewhat on the above lines, he would at all events be left with no further grounds for dudgeon at having his friendly advances ignored; while the terms themselves would seem to be innocuous and to admit of diplomatic justification. 5. As between ourselves and the Turks, the fact of our having put pressure on Bin Saud to prohibit the import of arms by sea, should give us reasonable grounds for objecting to the Turks taking advantage of the fact and sending troops by sea to coerce him: while, if our relations with them became sufficiently strained, we might usefully remind them that they only retained control of Hasa and Katif, thanks to our pacific and deterrent influence over Bin Saud, and that were that influence withdrawn, their position in those districts would not be worth a month’s purchase. I have ventured with much diffidence to offer the foregoing suggestions to the Government of India, in case they may be considered to possess any element of practicability.■Min f- rtp Copy of a demi-official letter dated 30th August 1911 from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* v' 1 ' 71 ^ / Please refer to your letters Nos. 1019 of the 20th April \ and 1825 of the 23rd July, and to our endorsement No. y-. 1251-15.A., of the 3rd July, about relations with Abdul cl Aziz, Bin Saud.

The Turks besides are convinced that some kind of understanding actually axisla between the As-Band and the British Government and this belief# is one of the reasons for their ropes.ted efforts to make him renounce his pres- -ent complete independence* -He himself is willing to make public any definite understanding with us for the fact of its existence would relieve him of the Turkish menace* Tin- -less he is fortified by some understanding with the byi. -llsh Government which, however nebulous it might be, won3d make the Turks hesitate from attacking him gratuitously, he would always be subject to Intrigues; though at prese&amp;t allied to the other important chiefs in Arabia he could not hope that such alliances will anduro for ever and any differences would be exploited to the utmost by t&amp;o Turks, while h3 felt able to hold his own against Ibn Rashid or other Rulers and even against combinations among them he was aware that the addition of Turkish troops to assist MC entfemies would probablv be his mdoing* Consequently he was ■ &gt;»****** ' T nr~yr’vn.s trlTon sithe? to fo:r British 'protection of aomo a/ s^.oia kind as wo had accorded to Kuwait and to other Shel&amp;m as a reanli of oil friendships and relations or to trust in Ms own sword and Prowidonco* i?o was detsrroinsd sooner or later to turn out the T^rks from Has a and Katif and if it conld not he managed hr diplomacy « it *onXd ha done by rescrt to arms# H© eomld foresee no better ornortnnity than its present 'ayt he fore proceeding to ertfemi ties be wisbod tc obtain some idea of what attltr.de we mh.OT.ld take np • On iMs 1 told Mm at one® that if be did. proceed against hasa, I was smre that we should certainly not en* -danger our relations witL Turkey on bis beha? f for we had not hitherto in any way disputed the Turkish position in.

The unrest and desire for emancipation from Turkish rule is not confined to Nejd, The Press contains accounts of similar movements for self-government in Syria, Beyrout , Baghdad and %sra , In Basra I am informed that the new Wall on his arrival a few days ago was bluntly told that unless he fall into line with local notables ha had better re-embark at once for Constantinople , 10 .

Ko• C|V7, Dated 25th hay 1913. The expulsion of the Turks froia Tejd and Al Kassa and the signature of the draft ^nglo-Turkish Convention are two facts of a somewhat irreconctliable nature. It is not known to me whether His ?la t iostg'c Government intend to o.dviB© the Ottoman Government in any way or prefer to allow matters to adjust themselwes. By the terms of the Convention v/e seem to have just committed ourselves afresh to recognise the dominion of the Turkish Government over Nejd, but if on the other hand the de facto ruler of the province is to be Bin Gaud, it io essential in view of our interests and work in the Persian Gulf, that definite and friendly relations should be established with him as soon as possible. Would it not conceivably be possible for us to induce the Turks to face the accomplished fact and with our assistance to devise some satisfactory solution of the difficulty which could then be included in the Convention? Such an arrangement might be based on the recognition of v$ Bin Saud as the autonomo^ ruler of Nejd under the suzerain ty of the Turkish. Government, and on the grant to Great Britain of the right to o.ccredit an Agent to him and, with the knowledge of the Turkish Government, to make agreements with him in virtue of his position as a maritime ruler in respect to the suppression of piracy, the arms traffic, and slave trade, and generally in connection with the du ties we have undertaken In the Persian Gulf. If would, of course, be more satisfactory if H#jd were completely freed from the Turkish yoke, but it seems that we are too far committed to the Turkish Government to permit of it being countenanced. On the ground that urgent consideration of this matter may bo necessary, I have ventured to communicate the above observations. Cox.No. 1668, dated Bushire, the 26th May (received 2nd June) 1913. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla.

Agent, Kuwait, in connection with the NrL^dafed.'tfhM'a,^' 1 ' ReSiden '' aimS a ' d d ° ia g a Abdul Aziz 'Bin Saud. ” 2. The second enclosure merely relates in detail the account which had reached _ Kuwait of Bin Saud’s proceedings in expelling the Turks from Hasa and Katif, and calls for no special comment. 3. Enclosure No. 1 is an interesting report addressed to me before Captain Shakespear had heard of the fall of Hasa and Katif. It is no doubt somewhat awkward from our point of view that Bin Saud should_ have proceeded to extremities at the present stage of the Anglo-Turkish Negociations, and so soon after a friendly meeting with our Agent, but however inconvenient the coincidence of events may be, the juncture was obviously an ideal one for Bin Saud to choose, and it would seem that the only course, whether for ourselves or the Turks, is to look the practical position in the face. It is difficult to see how the Porte with an empty Exchequer and with trouble brewing simultaneously in the Basrah Vilayat, can hope for some time to come to undertake punitive operations against Bin Saud. In any case, if any attempt is made to operate by sea, we shall at once be faced with the question as to whether our policy in the Gulf will admit of our acquiescing in such a course, which in all probability would prove abortive and leave to us a legacy of bitter resentment on the part of Bin Saud. It seems to me urgent that, if at all possible, we should endeavour to bring about a bloodless solution of the difficulty, which might conceivably be effected in time to be brought into the Convention now under negotiation, and I have therefore ventured to telegraph suggestions in that sense to the Government of India. 4. As regards Captain Shakespear’s references to past history and to certain putative agreements between the British Government and the Wahabi Amir, I think one of the letters to which he refers is probably that addressed by Colonel Felly to the Amir on 6th January 1866 in which he alluded to “ Your Highness’s Saldanba’s Gazetteer Piecia. “ Nejd” page 25. Governor of Khatif , but this and all such correspondence as there is, is on the record of the Government of India, and I do not think I need do more than indicate it.

No. C.-io, dated Kuwait, the 15th May 1913. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, LA, Political Agent, Kuwait To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. / « 4 1 have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 528, dated the 16th February 1913. 2 In the course of my recent tour in the Kuwait hinterland this sprino- I again met Abdul Aziz “Bin Saud ”, the Amir of Nejd, and spent four days in his camp. He and his brothers were all apparently very glad to renew our old C25FD2 acquaintance and my reception in the camp was every whit as friendly and hospitable as on the former occasion in March 1911. -The Amir was anxious to hear the latest news of the Turko-Balkan war as well as an account of its course as he said that he was unable to believe the accounts which reached him from either Turkish sources or Egyptian newspapers, for although these contained descriptions of many Turkish successes, the Turkish troops always seemed to be giving ground and he had heard from Kuwait and Bahrain that the Ottoman army then held only the Capital, some forts within a day’s march, and a few other isolated towns, the whole of the rest of European Turkey having been absorbed by the Balkan Allies. I give him such information as there was (news of the fall of Adrianople had not then been received) and was surprised to find that so far from a pro-Turkish spirit being evinced, the contrary was expressed knd the Amir, his brothers and the Nejd notables in camp all seemed to consider that Turkey’s misfortunes and present weakness furnished the best opportunity for Nejd to rid itself of all shadow of Ottoman suzerainty and to drive their troops from Hasa and Katif. ^ 3 * &gt; 3 I would here invite a reference to my report No. C.-17 of the 8th April 1911, as much of the conversation I had with “ Bin ^aud ” on the present occasion was merely a recapitulation of what I have already submitted two years ago. I will endeavour now only to show what effects the events of the two years since elapsed, the Italian war in Tripoli and the Turko-Balkan war have had on the Amir’s opinions and ambitions. He spoke with even greater vehe mence of his hatred of the Turks and was manifestly disappointed that I give him no encouragement nor even the faintest hope that his ambitions have the approval, tacit, disguised or otherwise of the British Government, at pains to explain that we were on friendly terms with the Turkish Government, were in negotiation with them over certain matters regarding the Baghdad Rail way and the Persian Gulf and that the present of all times was most unsuitable for us to embark on any championship of his claims, even if we were willing to do so, which so far as I could see was not the case. 1 hough disappointed he showed no annoyance or resentment but merely remarked that some day we would be forced by circumstances to take up his case. vehe« could would I was 4. The Amir said that smce he had last spoken of the matter to me Turkey had been through two wars in both of which she had shown her incapability in military matters and that the Arabs consequently felt equal to evicting the Turkish troops from Hasa and Katif with the greatest of case. They were all agreed that no opportunity is ever likely to offer better than the present when with her army broken and disorganised, her finances crippled and her Arab subjects in Iraq and Syria all demanding reforms and self-government, Turkey would certainly be much too occupied in her other Asiatic provinces and in recuperating after the war’s conclusion to despatch a serious expedition to Hasa or Nejd. He said, moreover, that it was firmly believed by Arabs that the Turkish reverses were the judgment of the Almighty on a people who, calling themselves Musalmans, had for years neglected their faith, oppressed their subjects, embezzled religious endowments, broken every ordinance of the Koran and subverted the Khilafat. He averred that the present Sultan was in no sense the Khaiifa, holding his throne as he does as the puppet of a clique of politicians in Constantinople whose only object was the filling of their own pockets and who would be ready to find another Khalifa tomorrow if a change should suit them better. The Arabs were not blind and they could not help contrasting the justice, truth, equity, material prosperity and religious freedom which obtained under the rule of other nations and more particularly under the British flag, with what they saw under Turkish government. Sentiments of the above descrip tion were not expressed secretly nor do I think especially for my benefit but such speech was held openly at almost every gathering of the Amir and his headmen and I certainly formed the impression that Turkey’s misfortunes had induced no sympathy for herself as a power but had rather been taken as conclusive proof that as the Turks had neglected their religion so had the Almighty abandoned them and therefore it behoved all good Wahabis to rid themselves of all inter course with such backsliders and reprobates. Such briefly appears to have been the effect on the minds of the more educated and responsible men of Nejd.3 # 5 . In discussing his own ambitions “ Bin Saud ” said that the moment had tiow arrived when he must chose his definite policy for the future. By the Grace of God his power in Central Arabia had increased until he no longer feared any of its Shaikhs or Rulers, he was moreover in alliance with all of them excepting only one, ft*'#., the Sharif of Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz had therefore allied himself with the Turks. The As-Saud were prepared to hold what they had recovered during the last fifteen years of their ancient dominion in Arabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the menace of Turkish aggression, only possible from the east by way of Hasa and from the west by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both directions they felt was beyond their strength and to render secure their eastern borders, thus making their full force available for the defence of their western boundaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the Turks from Hasa and Katif. Another most important one was that the posses sion of these rich districts with their ports and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source of revenue to what was at present an extremely poor state. Moreover the As-Saud had other grounds and just ones for their claim to Hasa and Katif; one was that these districts formerly belonged to their house, another was that the Turks themselves in a document given to Abdulla bin Faisal by Nafiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha’s expedition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed by Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had only recently come into his possession and on his return to Riadh he wmuld send me a copy. Another document of which he had heard but so far had not succeeded in tracing was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the As-Saud family would be recognised as the Shaikhs of the Katif district. This document he said w r as the result of negotiations after the naval action at Katif and Dammam (in 1865) when four men named Mahomed bin Ma’ana, Abdul Aziz bin Umr, Saleh al Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim were sent by Faisal As-Saud as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives with which to test the accuracy of the Amir’s assertions, but I find a Declaration printed on page 156 of Aitchison’s Treaties, Volume XII, as No. XXVIII which seems to bear on this transaction. 6. Of late years and particularly during their wars with Italy and the Balkan States Turkish officials have been pressing Abdul Aziz to assist them practically with men and money and to show himself a loyal subject of the Sultan, (a) by sending three of the As-Saud family to Constantinople for education and service in the Ottoman Army, (b) by acknowledging Turkish suzerainty openly in the acceptance of a Turkish title with a firman from the Sultan appointing him Governor of Nejd, and {c) by handing over to thern all letters and documents which may have passed at any time between British officials and the As-Saud family, particularly that referred to above. Hitherto he had refused in as polite language as was possible knowing that once the Turks gained any hold over him he would in truth eventually become a Turkish subject, which he did not admit himself to be at present and then there would be ,no security for himself or his house. He was, however, beginning to feel the pressure, for all the Arab leaders, Ibn Rashid and the like, had rejected similar Turkish overtures with the answer that they were prepared to comply as soon as they saw “Bin Saud” doing so, for they had as little cause to love the Turks as he had himself, and desired to maintain their present independence. Thus it would be seen that Arabia might be said to be awaiting his lead. 7. The Turks besides are convinced that some kind of understanding actually exists between the As-Saud and the British Government and this belief is one of the reasons for their repeated efforts to make him renounce his present complete independence. He himself is willing to make public any definite understanding with us for the fact of its existence would relieve him of the Turkish menace. Unless he is fortified by some understanding with the British Government which, however nebulous it might be, would make the Turks hesitate from attacking him gratuitously, he would always be subject to intrigues; though at present allied to the other important chiefs in Arabia he could not }4 hope that such alliances will endure for ever and any differences would be exploited to the utmost by the Turks While he felt able to hold his own against Ibn Rashid or other Rulers and even against combinations among them, he was aware that the addition of Turkish troops to assist his enemies would probably be his undoing. Consequently he was driven either to ask for British protection of some such kind as we had accorded to Kuwait and to other Shaikhs as a result of old friendships and relations or to trust in his own sword and providence. He was determined sooner or later to turn out the Turks from Hasa and Katif and if it could not be managed by diplomacy, it would be done by resort to arms. He could foresee no better opportunity than the present but before proceeding to extremities he wished to obtain some idea of what attitude we should take up. On this -1 told him at once that if he did proceed against Hasa, I was sure that we should certainly not endanger our relations with Turkey on his behalf for we had not hitherto in any way disputed the Turkish position in Hasa and he must know that we could hardly do so when or after he had brought the matter to a head by an unprovoked attack. Of course it might be possible for him to eject the Turks for the time being since they did not maintain a very large garrison but it would probably mean a severe fight and then he had to contemplate what would be the subsequent course of events. Any action on his part against Hasa would inevitably bring retaliation which might develope into a war like that lately waged in Yemen and finally might lead to a further Turkish advance into Nejd in the course of which he would lose all he now held. There was no denying the fact that he would be trying conclu sions with a world-power which could, if it exerted itself, crush him utterly and to me it seemed a foolish enterprise of which every possible advantage was far outweighed by the heavy risk, almost amounting to certainty, of his losing all that he now possessed. As his friend I could not let him labour under so serious a misapprehension of Turkish strength, even though the course of the Balkan war seemed to warrant it, and though it might be unpalatable it was as well he should know how we regarded the matter. 8. From all that I heard in his camp I have no doubt that some day an attempt will certainly be made on Hasa and Katif, most discussions pointing to the fact that the Arabs despised the Turkish troops of the garrisons as quite useless, that they were certain of their immediate success and were mainly concerned as to how it might be brought about in the most complete, and if possible bloodless, manner as they felt that then they might be able to enlist British sympathy. 1 felt it necessary to point out what seemed to me to be inevitable, viz., severe reprisals from the Turks and the absence of interference on our part in the As-Saud cause, and did so whenever the subject came up. 9. There is no doubt that the Arabs of nearly all Arabia have now come to despise the Turks so much that they consider themselves quite able to deal with them ; for this collapse of prestige the two wars are responsible while distrust of and contempt for the Turks has been intensified by the exposure, which every day becomes plainer, that so-called victories were only falsehoods deliberately circulated by the Government to cover their own failures and weakness. The unrest and desire for emancipation from Turkish rule is not confined to Nejd. The press contains accounts of similar movements for self-government in Syria, Beyrout, Baghdad and Basrah. In Basrah I am informed that the new Wali on his arrival a few days ago was bluntly told that unless he fell into line with local notables he had better re*embark at once for Constantinople. 10. I venture to submit this report in the hope that serious attention may be directed to “ Bin Saud ” and Central Arabian affairs. The man is a ruler of the best Arab type and his personalty is one which is likely to lead Arabia should any extensive combination come into being among its tribes, an event which to me seems exceedingly probable in the near future, unless some radical change takes place in Turkish policy towards the Arabs. As soon as some such combination occurs and perhaps even before, I do not think that there is the least doubt that “Bin Baud’s ” first move will be on Hasa and Katif, and when that happens it seems to me that we shall be forced into relations with the Amir of Nejd, how ever much we may desire to avoid them. At present he is most friendly and inclined even to bind himself m some degree, for he has already expressed asmuch in his letter to me regarding the capture of his arms at Shargah, forwarded with my letter No. C.-y of the 29th April 1913. How far he would go in putting this desire into the words of a documentary agreement is uncertain but I am inclined to believe that it would be a very long way if he had reason to think that we would assist him in effecting the removal of the Turks from Hasa and Katif. That we would ever find a method to assist him diplomatically in this direction I confess does not seem possible at present, for our success hitherto in a somewhat similar case, the evacuation of the Umr Kasr and other Turkish posts on Kuwait boundaries, where we had far stronger grounds for exerting pressure on the Porte, has been infinitesimal. On the other hand to reject the Amir’s overtures will assuredly cause a feeling of resentment which may re-act upon our interests along the whole Arabian littoral of the Gulf, perhaps not at once, but in the near future as “ Bin Saud’s ” power increases, for increase it will so long as Abdul Aziz and his brothers are alive. 11. Exactly what have been our relations with the As-Saud family past, for want of early records I do not know and whether they would any move in the direction desired by the Amir I am not in a position to l am aware, however, that we had frequently to take punitive measures the Wahabis for interference with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrain, but connection now I am convinced that “Bin Saud” would be only too furnish us with any undertaking we desired for the maintenance of the quo ” in the future. In conclusion I have the honour to solicit your support for a re-considera- tiori of the whole question of our relations with the Amir of Nejd for I cannot avoid the impression that the matter will become an urgent one before long and that it will be to bur advantage to have reached beforehand some definite decision in regard to our future relations with “ Bin Saud in the warrant suggest, against in this glad to “ status No. C.* I2 ; dated Kuwait, the 2oth May 1913. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Pobtical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. A /V With reference to your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 1522, dated the 13th May 1913, forwarding areport from Bahrain of the occupation of Hasa by “ Bin Saud ”, 1 have the honour to submit the details of the incident which have now reached Kuwait. 2. The news which was received with the greatest surprise in Kuwait, was first supplied by passengers and letters from Bahrain arriving here by last mail on the 1.5th May. From this source there were various accounts which it is unnecessary to recapitulate for in the morning of the 17th May special messengers with letters from '* Bin Saud ” reached Kuwait overland. 3. I saw Shaikh Mubarak in the afternoon and the course of events appears to have been as follows:—“ Bin Saud ” collected a very large force of Nejd townsmen and marched rapidly from Riadh accompanied by some, though not many, Bedouin, until he arrived within five hours of Hofhuf in the forenoon of the 27th Jamadi-al-Awal (4th May 191 3). Here he assembled his head-men and explained to them how, owing to Turkish ineptitude the Bedouin tribes near Hasa were always raiding, how bad characters whom he desired to punish took refuge in the Hasa villages and the Turkish officials were obstructive and shielded them, how he was weary of the want of security in this district and how he had for years received invitations from the Hasa Arabs and now, having arrived within 5 hours of Hofhuf, he asked his Shaikhs to state whether they agreed with him that the Turks should be turned out for good and all or not. * The headmen and Shaikhs replied that they were prepared to follow him. In the afternoon “ Bin Saud ” intimated to his Shaikhs that he required only 300 picked men for the actual attack and when these had been selected the party started. On arrival at a spot about an hour or less to the west of Hofhuf itself shortly after sunset the camels and horses were left parked, ropes collected and other preparations made j “ Bin Saud ” and his men then proceeded on foot until Vf6 close to the walls. At about two hours after midnight the party proceeded to scale the walls, the ropes were quickly taken to the top by men climbing upon each other’s shoulders and as soon as a good number were over the wall a move was made to open the western gate for the remainder. It was not until this moment that the Turkish sentries became alarmed. On the alarm being given some firing took place near the gate, probably with the gate : guard, in which eight Turks and four of “ Bin Baud’s ” men were killed. The Turks all retreated to the central fort known as Kut, while the population 1 'came out and welcomed “ Bin Baud “ Bin Baud ” then sent envoys accompanied by some of the Hasa notable to the Mutassarrif and Commandant pointing out the futility of opposition and offering them a safe conduct if they would surrender immediately and agree to remove themselves and their belongings. He also undertook to allow them to keep their arms and to provide them with transport to the coast, but insisted that the troops must leave at once permitting only one or two days’ grace to those Turks who had families. The Mutassarrif surrendered at noon on the 5th May and so far assisted “ Bin Baud ” as to send messages to outlying detachments also to surrender. Within the Government buildings in the Kut “ Bin Baud ” obtained treasure to the extent of 40,000 dollars, 12 guns of different calibres, 2 mitrailleuses and a large quantity of reserve rifles and ammunition. 4. Messengers were also sent to Katif accompanied by Shiah notables and the chief Shiah Mujtahid in Hasa with a letter from the Mutassarrif to the Kaimakam ordering him to surrender, with what result has not yet become known. “ Bin Baud” has also occupied Ojair, and replaced the Turkish Customs staff by his own men. He appears to have insisted on every i urkish soldier and official leaving at the earliest possible moment. 5. Kuwaitis are surprised at the boldness and success of “Bin Baud’s” coup and opinion is divided as to what steps the Turkish Government will take, the general idea being that Turkey will be too occupied with her own affairs in Basrah to be able to spare any troops for Hasa at present but that later on she may be expected to send an expedition by sea against “ Bin Baud Shaikh Mubarak himself seems inclined to think that the Turks will make the best of a bad job and dub “ Bin Baud ” Mutassarrif of INejd, leaving him to govern alone as he chooses, for the Hasa province has never paid its way, all Customs receipts being swallowed up in doles and subsidies to petty Bedouin Shaikhs in a vain endeavour to make them desist from looting caravans and threatening Turkish detachments. 6. I confess I am surprised at the suddenness of “ Bin Baud’s ” attack, for while I expected it to come sooner or later I gathered the impression that he would wait to see what effect the movements for self-government in other Arab provinces would have on Turkish policy before actually committing himself. From other aspects it seems clear he could hardly have selected a better moment or managed the affair more deftly as he appears to have secured the support of the responsible men of Hasa itself.

It is alleged that Bin Saud has written to the Otto man authorities in Busreh saying that the action which was tahen was forced on him by tho complaints of the inhabitants that they wore being oppressed by the Turkish subordinate officials. He added that he would willingly represent the Turks as wall and that he would undertake responsibility for the tranquility of the district. (2) . Contrary to expectation the steamer n John 0*Scott* did not sail from Bahrein but made various excuses for lingering on there. Three officers, 50 men and 2 snail guns arrived from Al Bida on the 25th instant, and on the following day Major Hurls Bey with about 500 men and 2 guns set out for OJair and Katif In native boats giving out that it was proposed to come to an understanding with Bin Saud. The 'John 0*Scott w is still hanging on at Bahrein, under on© excuse or another, and a Turkish Colonel who has arrived from Busreh has her at his disposal. (3) . I have received a report from Fao today to the effect that podding the expected arrival of the Kamidleh from Aden and the Marmaris from Bombay, orders have been issued to the Turkish force at Bahrein to eke out the time, it is report ed that the Turkish Consul at Buahir© telegraphed to his Minister yesterday saying that Katif had been retaken by the Turkish troops, but I find it difficult to accept this statement as correct.

With reference to my tefeegram I have received a report from the Political Agent Bahrein dated June 1 st in which he states that the force under the Turkish Major proceeded not to Katif hut to OJair where the Major landed 110 men and effected the capture of a small fort losing ten men in casualties in the course of the op eration. Sixty men were then left in the fort and the Major with the remainder made their way back to the boats to fetch some guns. On arrival at the boats, however, the men declin ed to go back and the Major was obliged to embark and aban don the sixty men in the fort. The latter subsequently surrendered to Bln Baud who sent them over to Bahrein having first relieved them of their arms. As already reported, the whole force then embarked on the 'John 0 f Scott' and pro ceeded to Buoroh* It is pointed out by the Political Agent that the use mad© of Bahrein by the troops as a base for operations and their presence there has been a immm source of annoyance and embarrassment to Sheikh Eg a, and is calculated to bring him into the dispute. The Political Agent sitggests that wo should now consider the advisability of lodging a protest and urges that we should, in any case, warn the Turkish Government that if any further operations are contemplated by them, they are not to make us© of Bahrein but to carry them out betv/een Buoreh and some point on the Mainland.

Bin Saud is reported to have called a meeting of Mullahs and told them that he was their Amir and that they should re- -port all crimes such as drinking wine, adultery, theft etc. to him when he would punish the .offenders strictly according to Shera. He warned them of the ill consequences of hiding crime Besides their Being answeraBle to G-od. (KATIE). 171. Hitherto Bin Baud's interests in Katif have teen entrust ed to one Atdur Rahman tin Atdullah tin Suweillim. It is said that Bin Saud has dictated the following terms to the Residents of Katif :- 1. That the residents should give him in writing that the place belonged to the ancestors of Bin Saud. 2. That 14 nobles of Katif should go and meet Bin Saud and contribute money according to their means,. 3. That each village shall give 10 men for help - these ' to remain in the fort ready to fight: \ 4. That export of vegetables to Bahrain will be stopped. • U The Sx residents are delaying in carrying out these orders , and in the meantime Bin Saud is expected to arrive at Katif shortly with a considerable number of men. 172. Atdullah tin Hassan Dosiri took a letter from Sheikh Jsa to Bin Suweillim at K atif for recovering certain runaway divers The divers hearing of this ran from ^atif to Anich and took bast with a negro who belonged to Bin Saud. The negro re- -fueed to obey Bin Suweillim's order to surrender the divers, and Atdullah tin Hasan had to return empty handed with a pro- -mise made by Bin Suweillim that the latter would refer the matter to Bin Saud. x x x X xTelephonic message.

Towards the end of May, Atdul Aziz tin Saud had sent a letter to Sheikh Isa from Ojair, apparently giving him an ao- -count of the fight at Ojair (vide para 162). A quarrel arose Between two of Bin Baud's messengers Muhammad tin Abdur Rahman and another Bedouin as to which of them should present it to the Sheikh, apparently because they anticiapted a handsome pre- -sent for the bearer. The letter got torn in the dispute and was therefore thrown into the sea and Muhammad tin Atdur Rahman went and informed Bin Saud ^xtxxsxsaxd^ that it was lost on the way. Truth however came out later, and Bin Saud (it is said) sentenced Muhammad tin Abdur Rahman to death, tut subsequently commuted the sentence on the intercession of the man's relatives and others to one of 400 strokes. This punishment appears to have teen inflicted on the man who was put on a donkey with his face blackened and 180 lbs iron on hisx neck and taken round the bazars. 179. It is reported that one of the servants of Bin Saud false- -ly reported to the latter that he was strung by Muhammad tin Saleh el Mulhem - a friend of the el Araifs (referred to in para 185 below). Bin Saud sent for Muhammad tin Saleh and, it is said, pulled out his beard and mauttache with his own hands. Bin Saud then ordsred his men to strike him with the sheaths of their swords and to put him in chains. Reports of drastic punishments etc. inflicted by Bin Saud are very rife here, probably there is considerable truth, tut some no doubt must be taken 'cum grano sails'. 180. Bin Saud has married a daughter of Sadun in Hasa. 181. Bin Saud has removed the two most serviceable of the guns he captured from the Turks in Hasa to Riadh and has also sold by auction everything of the Turkish garrison left there.

With reference to my telegram No. 1150, dated 27th June 1913 ,1 have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a translation of the letter from Abdul Aziz bin-Abdur Rahman al Faiysal es Saud, dated 13th June 1913, with regard to his past and future relations with His Majesty’s Government, Department (Translation.) Dated 8th Rajab 1331 (13th June 1913). From—A bdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Faysal es Saud, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. After enquiries after your esteemed health. We beg to address your Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grand father Faysal—may God forgive him—of the period of which fifty-five years have elapsed and fifty-five years still remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have now-a days conquered the country of our fathers and grand fathers {viz), El Hasa and El Qatif, as well as their dependencies and spared the soldiers remaining there, sending them over to Bahrain because it was more convenient for them to make their way to Basrah from that place. When they reached Bahrain, however, they were assisted by some one from your side and he afforded them the necessary facilities and encouraged them to stay at Bahrain and to cause trouble in our side. We received the news of this but w T e did not believe it because your wisdom and justice would not agree to this. After a few days they set out from Bahrain for El Qatif, but they returned in disappointment and remained for several days, having no supporter but your subjects and dependents. A few days afterwards they pro ceeded towards El Ojair and on their arrival there they experienced such a disas ter at the hands of a small party of our dependents as had not crossed their minds and they returned disappointed and repentant. Praise and thanks be to God that we do not attach the least importance or significance to them—or rather to them and to the party to v^hom they are connected. Yes, we, the Islamic and Mohammedan Arabs, will rise to uphold our honour and will recover our rights with the last drop of our blood and we are doing this wuth confidence in the One Single God and also in all our Moslem brethren. We all have joined hands and there is no difference between us, we having been joined together by the cause of Islam and by the Arab sense of honour. In view of my friendly feelings I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors and (1 desire that those terms) should exist between me and you after them, (my ancestors). If the relations are as before and if it is incumbent upon both the parties to protect the subjects, we bind ourselves to you in regard to those who are in our side and to what concerns your subjects, and we will respect their honour, protect them and be responsible for them—because there remain certain people in our side who are against you and your subjects, and we ask for similar treatment from you. If this be really the case in view of the past friendship and of laws, please give us an intimation accordingly, and if the conditions are changed and the situation is not as we expect, then please warn us, so that we may be cognisant of the same. And thanks be to God, the Lord of both the Worlds and may his peace be on our Lord, Mohammed, his posterity and companions. Greetings. C38FD —44——GCBP SimlaNo. of 2[913.

Secondly, I am to explain that your expression of friendly feelings towards them is appreciated by the British Government, but that they do not see their way to intervene in any way in the dispute which has arisen between Your Honour and the Turkish Government.

During the last few days information has been re ceived about Bin Baud of which a summary is given below. (1) . From Bahrain. He addressed the Shaikh of Qatar, while he was at Qatif, demanding that the Turkish garrison should be driven out from A1 Bida*. (2) . From Kuwait. Qasr-as-Subaih has been occupied by him. (3) . From the Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast. A conference has taken place between the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Cibai, who are of the sa e tribe, and the for mer, whose porition has become paramount in Baraimi and the vicinity since the Wahhabis withdrew, considers it certain that the activities of Bin Saud will be directed towards that locality. Fearing this it has been decided by the two Shaikhs that they will mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakht Matti, (Reference is invited to Lorimer’s Gazetteer page 1200) and take the initiative against him. I should not think bhat Bin Saud would consider it was worth vdiiie to alienate His Majesty’s Government by taking such a course as there was nothing of an unfriend ly nature in our reply to his communication; but at the same time, if he wishes to do so, an extremely favourable opportunity is afforded to him hy the present state of Oman. The Shaikhs are being warned by me that such a de velopment is improbable, and deterred from making themi H Mi* m first hostile move, but, if it is feasible, I should be glad to reassure them as to the attitude towards a possible enterprise such as this on the part of Bin Saud which would be adopted by His Majesty’s Government Cox, '? ■ &amp;y.

I note that a more benevolent standpoint is assumed and I appreciate the pettinence of the policy indicated therein to the full 5 but as regards the Foreign Office letter I venture to urge that adequate cognisance is hard ly taken of the fact that no control can be exercised by the Porte over Bin baud at any rate for a long time to come, and that In the meantime his position affords him an opportunity of causing a very great amount of inconve nience to the Indian Government in Oman, on the Trucial Coast and in Qatar, which would be obviated by a harmless modus vivendi, which could be arranged, if necessary, with the knowledge of the Turkish Government. li o question ari ses of any desfcre to interfere in Central Arabian politics. Bin Laud is now at the coast, and a new menace threatens • our interests in the Gulf sphere; it is necessary for us either to render it harmless or to take steps for our pro tection against it. Uirely no logical reason exists why, because the Turkish Government is incapable of control ling one of hor proteges, the interests of ours should suffer severely. Perhaps His Majesty’s Government could be moved to a further consideration of this aspect of the question, if my apprehensions are shared by the Government of India. in the Secretary of State 1 s telegram dated 3rd of Guly CoxTelegram - P* From - Foreign, To - Heoident, Sushire. Ho. 384-$. With reference to your telegram Tlo.1337, dated 30th of July, In regard to Sin Baud; on August 10th the Secre tary of State was telegraphed to as follows Some difficulty is experienced by us in expressing our sideration of the policy which has been explicitly laid down by His Majesty’s Government regarding Bin Baud. e consider, however, timt it is our duty to lay before Hie Majesty's Government the very strong objections to which, in the changed state of affairs, a rigid adherence to that policy is, in our ssst opinion, open. Prom th© relations which exist between Bin baud and th© bhaikh of Al Qatar and the recent reports regarding the apprehensions of the Chiefs of tho Trucial Coast, it la clear that he is assuming as over increasing prominence in the politics of the Soast ^he Persian Gulf, and has thus brought him self ifithin tho sphere in which lie our Interests and in fluence. ^in Baud could be ignored with impunity as long as his operations were confined to Al Eaaa* We do not, however, think that it is safe to pursue such a policy now that there is a possibility that h© will interfere in Qatar, with tho chiefs of tho Trucial Coast, and even, it may bo, in Oman where an opportunity of encroaching on tho territories of th© bultan may be afforded to hin by the rebellion* It appears to us, therefore, that hio conci liation or estrangement must now be decided upon. Tho latter effect cannot but be produced if Bin Baud is dated 6 th of August opinion on the telegram from Cox, dated duly 30th in con threatenedthreatened without further parley with forcible expulsion if he makes any attempt to interfere in the affairs of AX Qatar, while we should be compelled to undertake military operations, a -consummation -rich it is very desirable to avoid, if h© were to ignore our throat* Unless som© mu tual and amicable agreement can be arrived at with the Amir who has up to th© present displayed a friendly spirit towards us, it is probable that we shall force him to take up an attitude of permanent hostility which cannot but react on the chiefs of th© Gulf Coast in an unfavourable manner* Under these circumstances we strongly advocato, not any definite treaty with din Saud, but a friendly in terchange of views in the course of which it would be in timated to him that we should expect him to forbear from intorferenca with th© territories of chiefs on the Gulf littoral with whom we have treaty or other relatione* No reason is apparent to us why we should run any rick of offending Turkish susceptibilities or arousing their sus picions if this were don© with th© full knowledge of th© 'Turkish Government to whom a clear explanation of our in tentions could be given. Tiie Trucial Chiefs might be seriously warned not to take any provocative action against the Amir; and also be informed that our relations with th© Amir are such that they have no grounds for their fears of aggression on his part; wo suggest this Instead of any assurance of immunity from him which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him.

H. I. Shakespear, I.A, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report herewith the substance of a conversation which recently took place between Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah and myself, as it may be of interest in view of the Anglo-Turkish Convention so lately concluded and of the Porte s declarations therein recorded. The Shaikh may perhaps have exaggerated what actually passed, 1 pour so faire vuloir' ) bat I see no reason to doubt that the story has a foundation of fact. -d 2 ' j^ 0rne ^ en da y s a S° the Shaikh’s agent in Basrah, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr, was summoned by the Acting Wali and after much eulogy of Shaikh Mubarak together with adjurations to secrecy, he was requested to inform the Shaikh that the Grand Vizier and the Minister for the Interior desired to discuss some secret matters personally with the Shaikh over the telegraph wire and that if the Shaikh could see his way to fix a day and time when he would be present in either one of the Turkish telegraph offices at Fao or Basrah, the ministers named would converse direct with him from the Porte. Abdul Aziz replied to the Acting Wali that he was sure the Shaikh would be averse to the suggestion unless he could be given some indication beforehand as to the subject of the intended discussion. On this the Acting Wali said the matter was secret but seeing that Abdul Aziz was already in the Shaikh’s confidence he supposed he might divulge the outlines of the proposed discussion. The Porte intended to appoint a Wali to Basrah at an early date, and the post might be conferred on the^ present acting incumbent or another but in any case the Porte particularly desired to obtain the closest co-operation between the Shaikh and the Wali, more especially in matters concerning the desert tribes and Nejd ; it was also intended that the Wali should be given orders to consult Shaikh Mubarak in any and every matter likely to cause controversy whether in Basrah itself or in the desert: in short, the Wali would be required to consult the Shaikh of Kuwait in all matters relating to the Basrah Vilayet and the Arabs in Arabia and would be expected to conform to his suggestions. Abdul Aziz is said to have replied that from what he knew of the Shaikh he thought it most improbable that Mubarak would agree to mix himself in matters so far beyond his range, and which might lead to his becoming entangled in serious difficulties with the desert tribes, apart from the tax on his time and resources which an acceptance of the position indicated would entail; he would, however, inform the Shaikh of the conversation. The Acting Wali then closed the interview with more eulogy of the Shaikh’s loyalty to and friendly relations with the Porte, pointed out the great honour conferred on the Shaikh by the trust reposed in him and the Sultan’s desire to ~ ±obtain his co-operation on so extended a scale and particularly requested that the matter should be kept secret even from the Shaikh s bosom friend, Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan. ^ In relating the story to me Shaikh Mubarak said he had no intention of agreeing for the suggestion seemed obviously a manoeuvre designed to shift to hfs shoulders the unpleasant burden of controlling the desert tribes, m which the Turks had failed so lamentably, whilst he personally would remain always ready to their hand, should the Turkish authorities require in future an excuse or a scape-goat on which to fasten any further consequences of their own inaptitude. Belaid he had requested Abdul Aziz bin Salim to convey to the Acting Wall his appreciation of the honour conferred in inviting his co-operation and to say that he regretted he had his time very fully occupied with the administration of his own territories, people and tribes, that he was an old man, and that he coul not presume to advise the distinguished officials the Porte might appoint to the charge of the Basra Vilayet, who would naturally be better informed regar ing matters in their own province than was possible for the Shaikh, living as e did at a distance. 4 I thanked the Shaikh for his frankness in telling me the story and contented myself with observing that though the scheme theoreticany might have advantages for the Porte I could see none in it for the Shaikh of K^wart, but rather a probability of unending difficulties with the desert tribes, Ibn Rashid and the Amir of Nefd, the almost inevitable result of the equivocal position in which he personally would be placed ; that, as he well knew, the prosperity of ids port and people depended very largely upon his maintaining good and amicable relations with the chiefs of the interior of Arabia.

He having informed me that he would be returning coastwards after Resident to Foreign, telegram No. 1791 , dated 23 rd the Id^ul-Haj (10th November) I Wrote 0cfcober - to him on the 27th October saying that I intended to be at Bahrain on or about the 18th November and hoped he would make it conveniePt to meet me at Ojair on or about the 21st, and that I would expect news of his movements on arrival at Bahrain. The same day that I reached Bahrain however a messenger came in from Bin Sand with a letter saying that my letter had found him in Qasim at too great a distance to admit of the possibility of reaching Ojair by the 21st November, but that he was hurrying in and begged me to meet him on the 10th Muharram at Ojair. This it is impossible to do without missing the mail by which I have arranged with the permission of Government to proceed on leave, but if this meeting is to take place at all it is urgent that it should be brought off as soon as possible, and I therefore instructed Major Trevor verbally to undertake it in my behalf accompanied by Captain Shakespear. I beg to attach a copy of my letter in that connection to Bin Saud and of the ,f sailing directions ” which I have handed to Major Trevor, and I trust that higher authority will see nothing in them to which exception can be taken. 3. I also enclose for the information of the Government of India a copy of a report from Captain Shakespear stating No. C.- 24 , dated isth November. according to current rumour, the nature of the terms which the Porte hopes to make with Bin Saud. It seems to me that the final item, if the report proves well-founded, is one to which we should take exception, if it is contemplated to leave Bin Sand in control of Katif and Ojair, and I therefore venture to recommend that a timely decision be arrived at as to the course we should take for the protection of our interests in case the present report, in regard to this item, is confirmed. The Government of India will not have forgotten the correspondence which has passed in recent years regarding the representation of our commercial in terests at Katif and the continued desire of British Indian traders to settle there. Our right to be represented has been recognized in principle and, apart from the capitulations, there seems no reason we should tolerate and fresh an un friendly compact between the Porte and Bin Saud, to the continued prejudice of our rights and interests in this connection. Memorandum setting forth the position as regards Bin Saud for guidance at the time of the contemplated meeting with him. It is highly important to have in mind to start with a clear understanding the policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Turkey resulting from recent developments of the general political situation in Europe and the Middle East; on which policy the attitude of Government towards the question of Bin Saud and his relations with the Turks is based. The family having been relegated to Central Arabia for the last 40 years odd, the present (Amir ?) has lately ejected the Turkish garrisons from the Al Hasa sanjak and coast and descended to the shores of the Persian Gulf where he is in de facto control of the ports of Katif, Ojair and other small posts. As long as he continues in that position, practically independent of any control, heM is a danger to our general interests in the Gulf and to our relations with the Arab Principalities, unless we have a working understanding with him. This is recognised by His Majesty’s Government. Thus the Secretary of State for India addressing the Poreign Office on the subject on 13th August, last wrote “ * * they (the Government of India) cannot afford to make him their enemy and they propose to enter into a friendly exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position. “ It must of course he realised that Bin Saud, in return for a friendly attitude towards us, may ask for our support against the Turks. It will b e necessary then to make it clear to him that His Majesty’s Government, whil® willing to use their good offices to bring about a reconciliation, cannot under take to support him, but must maintain the strictest neutrality.” A few days later as the result of deliberation between His Majesty’s India and Poreign Offices, the following instructions were telegraphed to the Govern ment of India by the Secretary of State (on 21st August) “The Amir must be made clearly to understand, if he asks for our support against Turkey, as a quid pro quo for complying with our wishes, that while we are willing to do our best to reconcile him with Turkish Government, we are unable to support him (i.e., against the Turks P. Z. C.) and are bound to keep a strictly neutral attitude Later still, this time in connection primarily with the general subject of Pailway enterprise within Asiatic Turkey, the Government of India in making comment on certain aspects of the negotiations, telegraphed to the Secretary of State on 8th September, as follows :— “ * * * There can be no doubt from the point of view of Indian in terests, that a strong and reformed Turkey in Asia will act as a safeguard to India from interference on the part of Poreign Powers from the west, and might even in an indirect manner result in the maintenance of Persian integrity. Now that His Majesty’s Government have come to terms with the Turkish Government, as regards their respective interests in the Persian Gulf, they have nothing to fear from Turks and every advantage to gain from friendly relations with the Porte. * * * * The Government of India are there* fore strongly of opinion that His Majesty’s Government should spare no effort to avoid any measure likely to contribute to the partition of Asiatic Turkey either at the present time or hereafter and that His Majesty’s Government should pursue a consistent policy of reforming strengthening and maintaining the Turkish Empire ”, The above extracts indicate the policy of Government sufficiently clearly. .As regards Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud and the imminent meeting. It is apparent from the correspondence with him that on his part he is primd fade anxi ous to establish relations with us, but seeks a more definite exposition, of our attitude in regard to his relations with the Turks than mere expressions of good-will and the declaration of neutrality. It has been suggessted to him that he should explain more fully in what way he would expect us to evince our good-will and in response to this he has replied that he would like to have a meeting with a British representative and discuss the position with him in person. It seems therefore to rest with Bin Saud to open the discussion by stating frankly in what direction it is that he desires the expression of our good-will or our co-operation. On our side we have explained to the Porte that now that Bin Saud has come down to the shores of the Gulf and controls certain Gulf Ports, he must be regarded by us as having entered the sphere of Gulf politics and we cannot ignore him but must find a modus vivendi with him for the protection of'our own interests, wffiile at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral attitude in regard to the estrangement prevailing between Bin Saud and the Porte. It would also appear that we have expressed our willingness to promote a reconciliation if desired to do so.Hakki Pasha to whom the communication was made appeared to be grati fied rather than offended by it, and later on, apparently at the beginning of Enclosure to Foreign Department Endorsement 0ct ° ber thanking His Majesty’s Gov- No. 26 ;i 7 -E. a., dated isth November 1913. eminent for their friendly offer, he stated that the Porte was actually in negotiation with Bin Sand and would not fail to avail itself of their help if necessity arose. It may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our mediation if possible—meanwhile the meeting between Bin Sand and a British representative will be taking place. It is probable that in course of discussion Bin Sand, referring to Resident's letter No. 338 of 11th September and to onr desire that he should refrain from interfering in the territory or politics of other Arab Principalities on the Coast, and co operate with us for the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, will revert to his previous suggestion and enquire whether, if he gives us satisfactory undertakings under these heads, we shall be prepared to guarantee him immu nity from attack by sea. Our recent warning to the Porte that they would not he allowed to use Bahrain as a base for attacking Bin Sand, amounts indirectly and practically to a partial substitute for such a guarantee, and if Bin Saud makes a bargain with the Turks by which he is confirmed or left in his present de facto position and if we can also reach an understanding witjb. him, with the cognizance of the Porte, providing for ; (i) Non-interference in territory or politics of other Arab Principalities in the Gulf including Katar. (ii) Co-operation for preservation of Maritime Truce and suppression of piracy. (iii) Co-operation for suppression of the illicit arms traffic. (iv) Admission of British Indian traders to Katif as of old, and accept ance if necessary of a Residency Agent to look after them, it is possible that His Majesty’s Government might see their way, especi ally in view of the fact that Bin Sand's co-operation in suppression of arms traffic prevents his arming himself, and of the practical impossibility of the Turks putting troops into Katif without using Bahrain/to obtain an undertak ing from them not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Saud’s control without a previous exchange of views with us,the result of which would probably be that we should be able to compose the quarrel. Lastly, it is possible that the question of Katar and the status of Bin Thani may come up in course of the discussion. In this connection I think it will be well if the text of a portion of the article of the Anglo-Turkish Conven tion relating to Katar is translated to Bin Saud :— “ The Imperial Ottoman Government having renounced all claims concern ing the Peninsula of El Katar, it is agreed between the two Governments that the said Peninsula shall, as in the past be governed by Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his successors. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declares that it will not permit the Shaikh of Bahrain to interfere in the internal affairs of El Katar nor to encroach upon the autonomy of the country nor to annex it”. It might be added that as the result of this agreement the present Turkish garrison will be withdrawn in due course. Dated 22nd November 1913 (= 22 nd Zilhijjeh 1381 ). From—-L ieutenant-Colonel Sib, Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T 0 —Amib Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Faisal al-Saud. After greeting and enquiries after your health. I beg to inform you in continuation of my letter dated 26th Zilqadeh that, thinking that it would not be possible for an answer for you to reach me atBushire before my departure, I came to Bahrain in the hope that ^ you would be able to come to the coast about the time indicated. Oa my arrival at Bah rain I saw your messenger Abdur Bahman Bin Muhammad and received through his'hands your esteemed letter dated 11th Zilhijjeh. I have under stood your remarks about it being impossible for you to arrive before 10th Muharram 1332. I am very sorry flat it will thus not be possible for me per sonally to have an interview with Your Honour as it is inevitable for me to leave Busbire by the mail leaving on that date and it is not possible for me to delay. But it makes no difference. Inshallah an interview will take place on the date asked for by you, between Your Honour and Major Trevor, British Agent at Bahrain and*Captain Shakespear, British Agent at Kuwait on my behalf, and they will be ready at Bahrain about that time, and will await news from your side from Ojair. In conclusion, Ibid you farewell with regret and trust that a meeting may take place between us sometime in future, and that your affairs will prosper in the meanwhile. (Usual ending). No. C.-24, dated 18th November 1913, From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report for your information that the following rumours are current in connection with the desire of the Turkish authorities to come to terms with Abdul Aziz “ Bin Saud and, Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Sabah appears to believe that they are well founded. V 2. It is said that the Porte is prepared to recognise ‘ Bin Saud ’* as ruler of Nejd and Hassa, to give him a formal appointment to that post, and to allow him to collect the revenue, paying to the Porte a fixed sum per annum for the privilege, but it is understood that two of the primary conditions which they hope to make good as part of the above arrangement are:— (1) that “ Bin Saud ” should admit Turkish troops to the coast towns of Ojair, Katif as before; (2) that he should bind himself absolutely to refer all matters of foreign politics to be dealt with by the Porte and to allow no foreign merchants nor agents in his territory as now recognised.

No action seems possible at the present time, but the letter amplifies the remark made in paragraph 11 of the enclosure to my letter No. 24 , dated the 4 th January 1914 , while for an earlier notice of Bin Sand's relation to the arms trade I would refer you to my predecessor's letter No. 1669 , dated the 26 th May 1913 .

I have the honour to report that in the course of a conversation at Ojair on the 16 th instant. Bin Baud asked me if I could give him a pass authorising him to procure from Muskat, for the use of his forces, 4,000 Martini Kifles and Carbines, of which 1,000 should be Martini Metfords, with 400 rounds of ammunition per rifle. 2 . In reply, I informed him that I had no power to grant such a pass, but that I would refer the matter to you. Bin Baud enquired when a pass or an answer to his request could be obtained. I replied that as the number of arms applied for was a large one, it was probable that the question might have to be referred to the Government, which would naturally entail some delay in getting a reply. I also added that it was possible that the answer might also be delayed by the question whether such a pass could be granted at the present moment, in view of his diffi culties with the Turkish Government, and of the neutrality of the British Government in the dispute—possibly the grant of such a pass might be considered an infringement of neutrality. 3 . I am not, of course, in a position to make any useful remarks on this point, but I think that Bin Baud’s request shows that he wishes to co-operate with us in respect of the Arms Traffic, and (leaving aside the question of neutrality), I would respectfully suggest that it would be advisable to encourage Bin Baud to obtain his arms in a legitimate manner. Otherwise, he will doubtless attempt to smuggle them by sea or overland from Muskac if he can obtain any there, or he may get them from Jibutil to some port on the Red Sea and thence overland across Arabia. 4 . Bin Baud stated, and Captain Shakespear confirmed the statement from personal experience, that modern small bore magazine rifles are useless to Arabs in the desert, as the sand speedily makes the mechanism useless. There is also the objection of the impossibility of re-charging the cartridges for such weapons. For these reasons Bin Baud requires Martinis for his men, and for the Same reasons the considerable number of magazine rifles recently captured from the Turks are practically useless to him. 5 . I may add that Bin Baud gave me most explicit assurances that the arms were required solely for the use of his armed forces, and were not in any way for trade purposes and would not be sold. 6. If the pass cannot be granted now, I venture to suggest that it might be given when the negotiations between Bin Baud and the Turkish Government are completed, or are in a fair way to settlement.

In continuation of my predecessor^ letter No. 4005 -M. of 2 nd December 1913 , ixr rr ^ * /i omi. t\ ^ imo I have the honour to submit a Report by No. T.-805, dated the 20th December 1913. -tat,*,* J Major Trevor, Political Agent, Bahrain. 2 . In forwarding this report to the Government of India, I would remark that our position between Bin Saud and the Porte is somewhat difficult. On the one hand we have recognised as belonging to Turkey the province of Hasa, which Bin Saud at present governs as an independent ruler, and which he wishes to retain. On the other hand, it would be imprudent to shape our action on the assumption that Bin Baud's retention of Hasa will be permanent or indeed more than tempo rary. At the same time it is impossible, regard being had to the local interests of British subjects and proteges, that we should continue to treat Hasa as a region politically derelict and having no administrative head with whom we can deal in matters affecting British subjects. 3 . Every free bargain has two sides and must contain, if it is to be accepted, some element of advantage to both parties. With due regard to this principle a mutual arrangement seems not impossible, in regard to certain points, between ourselves and Bin Saud ; but in respect of the practicability of an accommodation between Bin Saud and the Turks, and the outlook is less promising. 4 . Bin Saud is willing that British subjects should reside and do business in Hasa. He would protect them and would, in practice at least, recognise our right to represent their interests. It appears to me that, if our subjects who are desirous of trading in Hasa take advantage of his present disposition, a valuable point will have been gained by us, and that Bin Saud will himself benefit, and will be conscious of benefiting, by the mere fact that subjects of ours whom we trust him to protect reside in his territory. He cannot but be aware that he lays us under an obligation by encouraging them and that we on our part will seek every means of maintaining a situation more favourable to our people than that which existed under the Turkish regime. British subjects who are desirous of proceeding to Hasa are now being permitted to do so, and I am authorising the Political Agent in Bahrain to enter into such correspondence with Bin Saud as their concerns may hereafter necessitate. In this way, perhaps, one part of the Bin Saud problem will be solved without further discussion, and in a manner making it difficult for the Turks, should they subsequently reoccupy Hasa, to resume their former attitude to British subjects there. To consolidate the position, I I recommend that a Native Agent be at once posted to Katif to act as medium of communication between the Political Agent in Bahrain and Bin Sand’s local governors. The Turks could hardly obtain the removal of this agent if, on recover ing Hasa, they found him holding ah established position in the province. 5. Other matters which, it seems to me, might be settled directly with Bin Saud at the present time are that of his relations with the Shaikhs of Katar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settle under their protection. ■ &gt;; These questions arise from Bin Baud’s own position as an Arab Chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Bin Baud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Shaikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to induce them to restrain or expel refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence was shown to be injurious to Bin Baud’s legitimate interests. A reciprocal arrangement of this nature should now, I venture to think, be proposed to Bin Saud through the Political Agent in Bahrain. 6. The crux of the present negotiations is Bin Saud’s virtual request that we should intervene between him and the Turks in order to secure to him the govern ment of the province of Hasa on an assured, autonomous, and probably hereditary basis. Here it seems to me that, the views of the Porte and of Bin Saud being at bottom irreconcileable, there is small prospect of our interposing with success, and that we should, therefore, in the interests of good relations both between our selves and him and between ourselves and the Turks, not be too forward in our inter position. Bin Saud is, from the Turkish point of view, a very recent and only * 4‘1 momentarily successful rebel, and nothing can be offered to the Turks on behalf of Bin Saud, so far as I can see, which would appear in their eyes at the present moment an advantage worth purchasing by the concession to him of a single point. There can be no doubt that the Turks hope and expect to drive Bin Saud out of Hasa by force of arms ; if not now, then in the course of a few years. The best line of action for them is undoubtedly to maintain their claim to Hasa as a province of the Ottoman Empire and to postpone attempting to enforce it until they feel them selves stronger,—a line which they will in all probability follow. As time passes, however, if Bin Saud remains in adverse possession of Hasa, the Porte may become disposed to negotiate with him, possibly with our assistance. Three-cornered negotiations may then perhaps take place with some hope of a settlement accept able to both parties being reached, but at present circumstances are not propitious. 7. In short the most expedient course for His Majesty’s Government is, I venture to think, to take in hand at once, as indicated above, the questions which seem capable of direct settlement between their Political representatives and Bin Saud, at the same time informing Bin Saud that his position in Hasa is a question in which they can only mediate between him and the Turks with the consent of both parties, but that they will do their best to support him in this manner. In fulfilment of this promise if authorised an effort might now be made to obtain, in the words of Sir Percy Cox’s memorandum enclosed in his letter No. 4005-M., dated 2nd December, 1913 “ an undertaking from them {i.e., the Turks) not to take hostile action by sea against the coast left in Bin Saud’s control without a previous exchange of views with us.” In making these recommendations, I do not lose sight of the fact that Bin Saud, if left to himself, may conclude with the Turks some arrangement unfavourable to British interests in Hasa ; but, should he do so, it will be open to His Majesty’s Government to take such action as is required for vindicating the in terests threatened. No. T.- 805 , dated Bahrain, the 20 th December 1913 . From— Major A, P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to Sir Percy Cox’s letter No. 3669, dated the 2nd December 1913 , instructing me to proceed to Ojair in company with Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Kuwait, as soon as Bin Saud arrives on the coast, and to interview him there ; in reply I beg to submit the following report of our proceedings. 2. As already reported in my diary I had heard (through Shaikh Isa) that Bin Saud would arrive at Hasa about the middle of Moharram, so that when Captain Shakespear arrived on the 7th December, having been kindly given a passage on the flagship by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, I knew that there would be some little delay. 3. On the 12th December a special messenger from Bin Saud arrived with letters for Captain Shakespear and myself, explaining his delay in reaching the coast and saying that he would be at Ojair on Monday, the 16th Moharram (15th December 1913). I at once replied by the same messenger stating that Captain Shakespear and myself were ready waiting in Bahrain and that we would start for Ojair on the morning of Sunday, the 12th December (15th Moharram) and if the weather was favourable would reach there on the same night. 4. Having obtained a “ boom ” through Abdullah al-Gasebi, Bin Saud’s agent at Bahrain, I accordingly left Bahrain on the morning of the 14th December, but, owing to being becalmed for several hours en route, we only arrived outside the reef off Ojair about midnight. The next morning (Monday, the 15th December) when making our way into the port a little before sunrise we saw Bin Saud’s camp being pitched on the sand-hills about a mile east of the Custom-House and Serai (the only buildings or habitations of any description at Ojair), and gathered that Bin Saud had already arrived. I landed with Captain Shakespear at about 8 a.m., and we were received by Bin Saud with great politeness on the shore outside the f (no)4 Serai. After a short interview in the Serai Bin Sand called for horses and we rode to the camp with him accompanied by a large crowd of horsemen, who on the way gave us an “ ardtha ” or welcoming ceremony, which consists in galloping furiously to and fro in front of honoured guests, shouting, brandishing swords, firing off rifles, etc. 5. Bin Saud told us that he had arrived about half-an-hour before we did and was exceedingly cordial and friendly. The friendly personal relations existing be tween him and Captain Shakespear, resulting from their meetings at Kuwait and in the desert, put us on good terms at once, and made our subsequent interviews easy. On arrival at the camp we found that Bin Saud had caused a very large tent to be pitched for us, and done all he could in other ways to make us comfortable, inter alia by getting one of the best cooks in Bahrain over and entertaining us sumptuously in Arab style during the whole of our two days’ stay. 6. On the day of our arrival and the greater part of the next day, Tuesday (16th December), we discussed with him the points mentioned in the memorandum attached to Sir Percy Cox’s letter under reply. The result of these discussions is set forth in Memorandum I attached to this letter. After we had discussed these points Bin Saud raised the question of the policy of the British Government in Katar and Trucial Oman with special reference to their attitude in regard to enemies of his who might take sanctuary in these states and then use them as a base for intriguing against him, or as a retreat after inciting some Bedouin tribe to revolt against him. He said that of course he had not the slightest objections to fugitive^ from his wrath taking refuge with the neighbouring Shaikhs in accordance with the usual Arab custom, provided that they did not use their sanctuary as a base for intrigue ; but if they did so he would be compelled to take steps for his own safety. The gist of this conversation is recorded in Memorandum II attached to this letter. 7. After business had been concluded at the final interview Bin Saud volun teered to show us in confidence the conditions which had been proposed by the Turkish Government and himself as a basis for settlement of his future position. The document he produced and read out to us was in the form of a draft agreement containing 11 articles, five of which had been suggested by Bin Saud himself and the other six by the Turkish Government. The terms proposed by Bin Saud in sisted on complete autonomy for the region actually controlled by him, special reference being made to his right to the coast-line and to the appointment and control of all local officials. The terms proposed by the Turkish Government laid down a partial autonomy for Bin Saud under the suzerainty of the Sultan with the following conditions :— (1) The re-instatement of the former Turkish garrisons in the Hasa pro vince. , , (2) Kazis and other judicial officers to be appointed by direct “ firman ” by the Sultan. (3) The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents of Foreign Powers. (4) All communications frem Foreign Powers or their representatives to be referred to the Turkish authorities for disposal. (5) The payment of an annual revenue of £T.3,000. (6) No concessions to be given by Bin Saud to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car services. 8. A propos of condition (6) above some conversation took place, from which we gathered that Bin Saud would not be averse to giving concessions under British auspices, should his position be regularized or in some way assured through our good offices. 9. I would add that during the discussions, on more than one occasion, Bin Saud made it clear that he would prefer that any reconciliation between himself and the Turks should be carried through under the auspices of the British Govern ment, because he had no faith in the permanency of an}' arrangement made direct ly with that Turkish Government. 10. Before leaving Bin Saud sent instructions to his Deputy at Katij that he should permit British subjects to enter and trade and open shops, should they arrive5 at Katif and should piotect them ; and that he should communicate with the Poli tical Agent at Bahrain regarding them should any questions arise. 11. In all the formal arid private discussions which took place Bin Saud was most friendly ; he seemed very much in earnest and most anxious to do whatever he could to meet the wishes of Government and to obtain their support. We repeatedly told him that the British Government could not give him any assurance that they would keep the peace, as he expressed it, on the Hasa coast; this of course is what he wanted, but he realized that it was impossible. The tangible results of our interviews with him were that he at once agreed to accept and protect British traders in Katif (and no doubt in other places on the coast should they want to go there) and to postpone making any settlement with the Turks until he marches north in the spring, i.e., for three months. Bin Saud also stated in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast states, and I think that Memorandum II shows that he has no desire to act con trary to the wishes of Government in these regions. Further, I am of opinion, and Captain Shakespear shares my view, that there is not the slightest doubt that should His Majesty's Government consider it desirable to use their good offices to effect a settlement between Bin Saud and the Porte, by which he would remain “ de jure ” ruler under Turkish suzerainty of the territories cf which he is at present ‘‘ de facto ’ ruler, Bin Saud \tould be only too glad to make a formal arrange ment with the British Government cn the remainder of the four points men tioned in Sir Percy Cox's memorandum, viz : to co-operate in the suppression of piracy and the arms traffic, and in the preservation of the Maritime Truce. In connection with the Arms Traffic question I may mention that Bin Saud has made an application to be allowed to import rifles for the use of his troops '.this is being dealt with separately in my letter No. 806 of the 20th December 1913 , but it shows, I think, that Bin Saud means to work with the British Government in the matter. 12. In the course of our conversations with Bin Saud we gathered indirectly that he would probably accept autonomy under the suzerainty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan with the payment of a trifling revenue (or tribute) to Turkey if necessary, as an acknowledgment of the suzerainty. Should His Majesty’s Gov ernment see fit to try and effect a settlement between Bin Saud and the Turkish Government, it would seem desirable, I respectfully submit, to take some definite steps within the next two months, i.e., —say before the 1st March,—of which at least a hint could be communicated by me to Bin Saud before he goes north in the spring in crder to save him from making some arrangement with the Turks which might be hostile to our interests. In the meanwhile if one or two British subjects who have been pressing me to allow them to go to Katif are permitted to go there, it will strengthen our position in resisting the conditions regarding the exclusion of foreigners, which the Turks particularly desire to impose upon Bin Saud. 13 . In conclusion I would observe that only Bin Saud, Captain Shakespear, and myself were present at any of the interviews at which politics were discussed, and I should like to say that the exceedingly friendly and cordial attitude of Bin Saud at the meeting was due to his friendly feelings towards Captain Shakespear. The latter’s knowledge of the language and ways of the Bedouin from Central Arabia was also most helpful and his presence was mainly responsible for any favourable results which may follow from the meeting. I,.—Memorandum of interview with Bin Saud on 15 - 16 th December 1913 . In order to make his position clear Bin Saud began by giving an account of the history of Nejd, from his point of view, of vvhich the following paragraph is a resume:— His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for gene rations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself was an Arab Chief whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European Powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighing the merits of different Governments as they live as nomads, and when oppressed move off to another lo cality. When Ibn Bashid attacked the Bin Saud family, the latter eventually wonthrough, in recent years he (Abdul Aziz Bin Sand) himself has been able to consoli date his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Katif. As is well-known these places originally belonged to his family and did not pass into the hands of the Turks by fair conquest, but by stratagem, viz., by fomenting dis- cord between two members of the family, Abdulla and Saud, the sons of Faisa l, and by supporting one against the other. Eventually when Abdulla was successful the Turks, in return for their help, Retained their garrisons in the Hasa province, and actually took over the government of it, though Abdulla was made titular governor. After a time the Bedouin Arabs finding that the local Turkish Government was weak and impotent took to indiscriminate raiding, thereby causing great chaos and want of security, while the more respectable and responsible portion of the po pulation became dissatisfied with the Government because it was unable to put a stop to the reign of lawlessness. In the meanwhile he (Abdul Aziz Bin Saud) was approached by Arabs, not only of the Hasa province but also of Baghdad, Basra and other places who were equally dissatisfied, and became convinced that the whole Arab world scorned the Turkish rule. Finding that the province of Hasa, where our word runs,” was being oppressed and bled by the Turks, and having been asked several times by the people of the province to intervene, he eventually determined to take the bull by the horns, re-occupy the province and ask for the support of the British Government. 2. At this stage it was pointed out to him that our first object in arranging this personal inter view was to find out precisely in what way he wanted the assistance of the British Government, seeing that he was aware of the friendly relations between the British and Turkish Governments and of the neutrality of the former in res pect of the differences between him and the latter. In reply Bin Saud stated that what he was concerned with was his honour, the honour of his house, and the pre servation of his ancestral rights. He desired to renew and maintain the ancient friendship between his family and the British Government and to have his position secured. He was led to ask the British Government for assistance because he had seen how that Government had dealt with Kuwait, Bahrain and other places and had realized that they were to be trusted. Bin Saud added that he wishes to have nothing to do with any other Power although he has already been approached by the Turkish Government. He feels that he must make some terms with them to safe guard his position, if the British Government disappoint him. He wants to know definitely what their expressions of goodwill really amount to, in order to be able to secure his own position. 3. At this point he was asked to explain himself rather more clearly. He re plied that all he wants is to be left in peace, and he sees that the British Govern ment keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf except in this small section—the coast of the Hasa province;. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the Maritime Peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as ‘‘defacto” ruler, he would be satisfied; if not he would have “to trust in his own sword,” He feels convinced that the British Government could secure this result by diplomatic means if they so desired. 4. At this point it was explained to Bin Baud that we could give him no such assurance, and moreover we were convinced that the British Government, in view of their friendship with the Turkish Government, could not do so either, as any such assurance at the present time would obviously be directed against the Turks. 5. He said that the Turkish authorities had written to him proposing that he should come to terms ; the draft conditions laid down that the ‘‘ status quo ante” should practically be restored, that he should not accept any representatives nor subjects of Foreign Powers in his territory, and that he should not hold any com munication with any Foreign Power except through the Turkish authorities. He said that he thought the Turks would be ready to drop all the conditions in the pro posed agreement except the questions of the conduct of foreign policy and of the admission of foreign agents and foreign subjects. These, he thought, were their principal demands, and if he conceded them, the Porte would probably agree to leave him m peace as de facto” ruler—how would the British Government view such an agreement'? 6. It was pointed out that P he continues to be the ‘‘ de facto ” ruler of the Hasa coast, it would be absolutely necessary for the local British authorities tohave direct communication with him and his local officers for the settlement of various commercial, pearling and other disputes, which constantly arise, not to mention the apprehension of fugitive offenders and absconding divers. The British Government, therefore, would in all probability have to take up the question of the prejudice to their rights and interests which the existence of any clause excluding their representatives and subjects would entail. 7. In the discussion which followed Bin Baud said he would be glad to co-ope rate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic, and in the maintenance of the Maritime Truce, and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Katar and the Trucial Coast, and to admit British sub jects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurance mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this, and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all impor tant matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated to him that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. 8. In the course of his remarks Bin Baud pointed out that, though he claimed the Trucial Oman and Katar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Katar, and possibly Trucial Oman, after he had occupied Hasa and Katif was his desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government. 9. Bin Baud pressed the urgency of making a definite reply to the Turkish pro posals at an early date, and said that correspondence had already been going on since Bamzan last (August 1913 ), but that he had delayed doing so in the hope that the proposed meeting with the Besident might result in some understanding. 10. It was then suggested to him that, as we were not in a position to state the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the proposals made to him by the Turkish Government, it might be still possible for him to delay a definite answer until His Majesty’s Government have had an opportunity of considering the report of our meeting. Bin Baud pointed out that the mere fact of the meeting would draw upon him a certain amount of opprobium from the Turks and thereby prejudice the progress of the negotiations already instituted by them. We explained that this meeting was necessary in order to find a basis for a working arrangement to settle local disputes and questions arising between his officers on the coast and local British officials. In fact, we ii formed him, the necessity of such a meeting is recog nised and so far back as the middle of September (Shawal) last His Majesty’s Gov ernment had informed the Turkish Government (through Hakki Pasha) that as he (Bin Baud) had reached the shores of the Persian Gulf, the British Government would be unable to ignore him indefinitely, and for the protection of their own inter ests would be compelled to find a modus vivendi with him, while at the same time maintaining a strictly neutral attitude and desiring a speedy reconciliation between him and the Turks. M 11. Second day.—Bin Baud reverted to the concluding portion of the previous day’s discussion, and we further explained that the primary object of our visit was to ascertain his views with the object of enabling the British Government to find a modus vivendi with him on the lines already suggested. It was further pointed out to him that the commercial and pearling relations between Bahrain and the coast of the Hasa province were very intimate, and that British subjects who had pre viously been in Katif had several times pressed the Political Agent, Bahrain, to allow them to return, but that he had refused to agree, pending the regularisation of Bin Baud’s position or a clearer idea of his probable attitude towards them. Bin Baud then said that he had no objection to British subjects coming to Katif provid ed that their claims against local people received adequate investigation before settlement, and that, subject to this proviso, he would afford them every protection. He appeared to be under the impression that British officials might perhaps uphold and press all claims of their nationals, irrespective of the correctness of such claims. We reassured him on this point, and he then said he would gladly admit and pro tect British traders. 12 Bin Baud then reverted to the question of replying to the overtures of the Turkish Government. He said that he realised that the entire exclusion of foreign enterprise and commerce from the Hasa coast was impossible at the present time. ~ —-r.-' * s8 Cj) in fact it has already existed for years. Accordingly he proposed to reply to the Turkish overtures that the questions between him and the Turkish Government ap peared to him to be matters which could be better discussed at a personal interview, that he would be moving to the northern end of his territory in the spring after two or three months, and that he suggested that the Wali should meet him then some where in the neighbourhood of Basra. He would add (and would also inform , his agents in Basra and Baghdad) that his recent meeting with British officers at Ojair had its raison d'etre in the necessity for making some arrangement to faci litate communication between his officials on the coast and the neighbouring Bri tish officials in regard to the settlement of commercial and pearling claims and cases arising between British subjects (and proteges) and the local people; the apprehension of fugitive offenders; and the co-operation of his local officials in cases of piracy. 13 . As Bin Sand was frank enough to tell us the lines of his proposed reply, we ventured to say that its terms seemed to us unobjectionable and asked him whether he had any objection to our communicating its general tenour in ouy report; to this he replied that he had no objection, but that he hoped that the British Govern ment would see therein an earnest of his sincere desire to arrive at a modus vivendi with them, and would exercise their benevolent good offices on his behalf. memorandum, has been compiled were translated to Bin Saud, and he agreed that they were an accurate resume of our discussions. asked us what was the policy of the British Government in regard to Katar and the Trucial Oman states. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters; in the case of the Tru cial Chiefs we had certain agreements of long-standing regarding the Maritime Truce, the Slake Trade and Arms Traffic to which we held the Shaikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Katar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo-Turkish Convention, and said Bin Saud said that there was a possibility that enemies of his might take re fuge in some of these states and plot against him and foment trouble—he instanced with a view to getting the point settled as soon as possible. He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people it might be necessary for him to take reprisals and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid. 18 th December 1913 .

It was reported here that this vessel was also bringing ammunition for the Turkish Government. The agent of the vessel, Mr. Konoff, informs me that the “ Saratoff ” is not coming to Basrah. The Ambassador also says that General Sulaiman Pasha, former Governor of Assir, is about to leave for Basrah, and that a certain Sami Bay has been appointed Mutessarif of Nejd. It is stated here that Sulaiman Paslia is coming to Basrah as Vali and that both the acting Yali, Izzet Pasha and Momtaz Bey, the newly-arrived Commodore, have been placed on the v :sion list. &lt; 7 , . /Ur ' ' • .

In view of the probability of early negociations between Bin Ba’ud and the Turks and the possibility of some settlement being arrived at which might include a clause excluding foreign merchants and Agents of Foreign powers (vide para 7 sub section (3) of my letter No.T-805 dated the 20th December 1913),I would observe that,if the proposal to appoint a Native Agent at Qatif is approved,it would appear advisable to expedite the matter and send the selected man to Qatif without delay. nTel©gram.R.

Bin Sa'ud has addressed Political Agent saying that the three months,during which he agreed to postpone any settle ment with the Turks (vide paragraph 11 of the Political Agent’s letter No.805 T. of December 20th 1913),have nearly expired,and that it is not possible for him to 'keep them off for more than the known time,so that I may look after my interests'. Political Agent has replied that he has no news but will communicate with the Political Resident and request an early reply. i Here please refer to the correspondence ending with my telegram No.256 of March 1st; 800 troops have by now reached Basrah; also Basrah local press has made many comments on the recent meeting of our officers with Bin Sa’ud. It would be most useful if Trevor and myself could know the intentions of Government as soon as possible. Otherwise Bin Sa’ud will probably commit himself with the Turks to some agreement hostile to our interests. „ (End of R) The fourth paragraph of my predecessor’s letter,mentioned above,is quoted by the Political Agent in this connection,and he urges that,should the appointment be approved,the despatch of the selected Agent should take place without delay.

The Shaikh fold the Bin— -bashi plainly that this was out of the question. The latter then asked him for a letter to take into Nejd introducing and recommend- —ing him to Bin Saud. Sir Mubarak replied that all he could give would be a brief nhte devoid of recommendation of any sort. The envoy replied that such a communication would be of no use. (He has since had other interviews with Sir Mubarak but so far as the Poli- -tical Agent has information has received the same answers^; Sir Mubarak asked the political Agent on the 20th instant whether he approved of the replies given to the Binbashi and was told that in the opinion of H.M's Representative he was wise in declining to be mixed up in matters which did not concern him. The Binbashi is to return to Basra via ^ao with Shaikh Khazal whose departure is at present being delayed from day to day by the absence of suf- -fioaent water at high tide to enable Sir Mubarak's launch to make her exit. There dsea not appear?! to be any truth in the reports which have reached the political Agent, Bahrain, vide para 85 of his diary for the week ending 14th March 1914. Sir Mubarak who has received no recent communication from Bin Saud is strongly of opinion that the anti-Turkish feeling among the Arabs of Nejd is so strong that Bin Saud will not find it possible to make any compromise with the Ottoman Government even if he wished to do so.(1) .

I laid stress on this point when I interviewed Bin Sa*ud in December last, but as I reported at the time, it did not make much impression on him.

My telegrams 20 and 21 of March 23rd and 24th to Embassy were repeated to you and I have no more information at present but will of course keep you informed of all devel opments. I do not at present see signs of preparation for an ex pedition to Hasa. The troops at Basrah, including the 796 (of whom 17 were officers) who came in the Saratow, number under 1200. About 150 of these are in hospital. The ar tillery consists of 4 Pompoms, 2 machine guns, 2 field pieces and a mule battery of 4 guns. These are regularly exercised on the desert but no guns fired to my knowledge. The troops are also exercised and drilled daily. Orders were received in February to send a force to Ha^sa but no steps taken to carry them out. The matter was left over till the new Wali arrived and since I have seen no indications of movement. Officers formerly stationed here have been removed or pensioned and many of the officers of the Hasa garrison have been sent to Baghdad to be court martialled. I asked Erskine on March 20th to keep me in formed of any troops despatched here from Baghdad but he has reported no movement. It was rumoured here that more were coming. Erskine writes to say there is nothing in it. He does not think there are 1200 in Baghdad all told. If a force goes to Hasa it will have to be a large one. a«5? // a brigade at least I suppose. They will not take on the job with the 1200 men here, many of whom would not be available. Besides they would not entirely denude Basrah.Turkey. Confidential. ' ; ^ (h £2t&gt; March 9. Section 1. (10569). No • 1. Memorandum communicated to Hakki Pasha, March 9, 1914 BIN SA’UD. The subject being a complicated one it has seemed more convenient to draw up an informal memorandum for the per sonal information and use of His Highness Hakki Pasha. In August last it was explained to His Highness that Bin Sa’ud, by the fact of his assumption of control at Qatif and , 0qair and the coast-line of the Hasa province, had now * entered specifically into the sphere of Gulf politics and comraercej and that important British interests and obliga tions in the Gulf (e.g. in connection with the maintenance of the maritime peace, the suppression of piracy, and the arms traffic; the settlement of pearling and s slavery dis putes) made it impossible for us to Ignore Bin Sa f ud and pretend to treat the province and coast of Hasa as politi cally derelict. We must necessarily have relations with some one in de facto authority, and the T^urks having evacuated the region we must deal with Bin Sa’ud and were glad to explain the position to them. The above communication was an obviously frank and friend ly act prompted by our desire to act with them in a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation. HakkJ Pasha received the communication very favourably /&gt;d«- Ve J and received that the Porte was already in negotiation with Bin Sa^d and that if occasion for our mediation arose it would be taken advantage of. In spite of this friendly response by His Highness we know2/S’ know from reliable local information that just after this exchange of communications, or conceivably just before it, the Ottoman Government were endeavouring to arrange terms with Bin Sa’ud, some of which were clearly directed against the British Government and British interests* Thus, according to our information, the following are the conditions which the Porte are endeavouring to impose on Bin Sa’ud as the price of his partial autonomy 1. The readmission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hasa as formerly. 2. The appointment of Qazis and other judicial officers by direct 'farmans” Issued by the Sultan. 5. The payment by Bin Sa’ud of annual revenue of £ T 5,000. 4. The reference of all commuhications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal• 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6. An -undertaking from Bin Sa^d not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or raotor-careservices. Incidentally, the Minister of the Interior has since in formed His Majesty’s Ambassador (1st December 1913) that the Ottoman Government had decided to recognise the recent fait accompli in Najd (Hasa) by nominating Bin Sa’ud as Mutessarif of that district. The first three of the six conditions above quoted refer to matters with which we are not immediately concerned, but considering thefrank communication made to Hakki Pasha in August by His Majesty’s Foreign Office, it would not be unnatural that His Majesty’s Government should be greatly surprised at the terms of the latter three, esrecially 4 and 5 and, if the information proved to be correct, should feel constrained to protest strongly against them. The only explanation of such conditions would appear to be m-?/6 be that the Porte mistrust the assurances already offered Of our readiness to co-operate, and that they fail to ap preciate the difficulties in which w© are placed by the continuance of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs between themselves and Bin Sa’tld* W© fully recognise that Najd is an Ottoman province, and have no desire to interfere in it, but for the reasons already given we cannot ignore Bin Sa^d now that he is in occupation of the coast-line. There is no secret regarding our requirements. What we require of him, for the maintenance and protection of our interests is:- 1. That he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Qatar. g. That like other Shaikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf he should co-operate for the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce, i.e. the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of inter-tribal hostilities by the passage of armed dhows at sea. 3. That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic. 4. That British traders should be freely admitted to Qatif, and properly treated while there. There is nothing in these conditions to which either Bin Sa*ud or the Porte can take the least legitimate objectionj at the same time it is only natural that while expressing his readiness to accept the obligations involved. Bin Sa^d should in turn desire the friendly offices of the British Government in the composition of his quarrel with the Turkish authorities, and should ask us to deter Shaikhs in relations with us from harbouring tribal enemies of his. W© had no wish to intrude ourselves, but the terms of the conditions which, as we hear, the Port© now seek to impose on Bin Sa’ud, show so little friendliness toward ourselves, anr-' are MMIffHWare so impossible of acquiescence, that we are obliged to return to the subject. We are primarily concerned to see the last three condi tions withdrawn, but w© should also be glad to see a satis factory arrangement come to with Bin Sa f ud by the Porte, under which as a corollary of their decision to regard Bin Sa*ud as ex-officio Mutessarif of Hasa, they should approve and take cognizance of his undertaking to comply locally withjpufc four desiderata above detailed, and, while reserving the right to take in the last resort whatever action they may deem necessary, should, by way of friendly co-opera tion with the British Government for the preservation of peace and good order in the Gulf, agree to refrain from hostile action by sea against the Hasa coast, without first consulting us, and giving us an opportunity of friendly mediation if such be possible. Foreign Office, March 9, 1914. VA copy of a letter dated the 10th March 1914 at Camp XX?III at Rladh, from Captain Shakespear, to the Political Resident Bushire* Please observe the address aboveJ I got hero yesterday with my carnets nearly done out owing to want of grazing as the whole of my route was through country which had had no rain before I reached it. My trip so far has been full of interest geographically. From Kuwait to Rigal, thence along the whole course of the Batin until Ajibba (not in map/ but) on the Buraidah road. I shall be able to tell you all about the Wadi ar-RumaM connection with the Batin now - then south and east to Zilfi. So far this route has not been travelled before. From Zilfi to Majraa’a along an untravelled route, froir Majma*a the ordinary route through the Sadair villages to Hasi thence unexplored via Baubem to Riadh, where I comped by the Shaikh’s gardens to the north of the town. I am having a sort of Royal Duke’s progress and if the pres nt state of affairs continues I shall soon be able to set up as a Bedouin Chief on my own with quite a respectable flock of sheept The Bin Sa’ud are overwhelming in their kindness, fore thought and friendliness. I had not been canned an hour before two huge buck-niggers stationed as police to drive off inqui sitive small boys etcj loads of firewood, green stuff for camels, sheep, rice etc for the men all r*±xx arrived in about another hour with a mare for me to ride. After a wash and change I rode in in the moonlight into the town by the big East Cate and got as warm a welcome from ’Abdul Aziz and his brothers as I could possibly have wished.. This morning I was taken to call on Bin Sa’ud*s father, the Imam ’Abdur Rahman whomI found a delightfully courteous and friendly old was gentleman, arther a surprise as he/supposed to be a very austere and sever© type of Archbishop. It is bad luck but I can’t attempt anything further southand shall go north again by the Dariyah Tharmidah, Shaqra, Wadi-as-Sirr, road to Anaizah and Suraldah; most of the road through ?/aohm is unexplored I believe* Why I can f t go south is (a) my camels are so done out that days they must have 4 or 6/complete rest with high feeding and than only short marches until I can either change them in Qasim or strike good grazing there, (b) Bin Sa’ud ha© called out all his southern raiding contingents (o) Bin Sa f ud himself is leaving on the 12th March to join the whole of his forces in the desert east and north, somewhere in the Bahana near Judah, and (d) the desert south in Eaut&amp;h, and Aflaj has had no rain and is as bare as one’s hand* It is bad luck but can’t be helped and I must try and make up for it by exploring else where - as it is I have a heap of new material. Bin Sa’ud has called out his raiding parties, ostensibly for hio usual Spring raids on Bedouin, but really as he told me in confidence because he does not want to be caught napping by the Turks at Qatif or f Oqair*The reason is that he has had information (a fortnight after I left Kuwait) that a Russian steamer which must have arrived in Basrah now was bringing out 1600 European Turkish troops \7ith the new Wall Suliraan Uathif - that these troops sdrtfc may be intended for a dash on Qatif and Haoa. I pity them if they do land and are not covered by a nan-of-war’s guns as Bln Sa’ud has about 6000 or 6000 more or less trained men, besides clouds of Bedouins and he will probably pin them to the coast and then suddenly wipe them out* Anyway he is taking no chances* He is awaiting an answer from Govomnent most anxiously anent the conference we had at \ Cc l a ^' r in December, and if I may venture to suggest it, it will be well worth our while to give him some sort of reassuring hint as soon as possible* He tried to pump me as to what would be our line, were he to agree to the Turkish request for the exclusion of foreigners and all direct relations with them or their Governments* I told him I was on leave and knew nothing of our probable at tltudeattitude, but as a pal It seemed to me unwise on hie part to bind himself so irrevocably, because should ho agree to this or similar conditions, presumably as an honest man, he would be bound to adhere to it; moreover the Turkish Government would probably inform us officially of it and request as to correspond with their Basrah authorities in all matters touch ing the Hasa Coast, a request with which, in the circumstances we should be compelled to conform. Supposing this situation to have been created w© would be no forwarder in the matters Trevor and I discussed with him than at any time while the Turks held Hasa and he himself would probably have stifled any chance he had of freeing himself from Turkish interference# I suggested that he had no cause for hurry or impatlance at present, and certainly I could see no reason why he need bind himself until at least he was seriously threatened by the Turks. In any case, should he give the undertaking required by the Turks I failed to see how in the natural course of affairs it could have any real permanence or how it would bring him the peace and security from interference which he desired to much. I trust this will not be disapproved alto gether, but if so our position is correct enough as I told him repeatedly I had no authority even to discuss these things being on leave and out to see the world and all I said would be open to disavowal by our Government. One suggestion which I venture to make privately owing to my own liking and opinion of Bin Sa*ud and perhaps because of my distance from the Coastl is that, should there b© any truth in the rumours of a Turkish descent on Qatif and Ojair, could we not send a man-of-war or two to Bahrain at the physicolo- gical moments, ostensibly to see that the troops did^ not use Bahrain as a base and really with the hope that it might have the same effect as the despatch to ships to Kuwait did at the time (was It 1894?) when Ibn Rashid said to be supported by Turkish troops from Basrah contemplated an attack on Kuwait -.22 / viz prevent the move* I am sending this letter by one of Bin Sa’ud© posts to the ooast and under flying seal to Trevor, as it seems advi sable he should have accurate and early information to counteract the effect of any bazaar gossip there may be in Bahrain as to Sin Ba , ud f s movements or intentions.7th April 1914 Many thanks for your demi-official letter of 27th March 1914 about Ibn Rashid and Turkish troops at Zubair. I think this must be the exercising in the desert to which Crow refers in the demi-official correspondence of 4th March which went to you by last mail. I don f t read quite the same meaning into the words f ’independent action ,, in Foreign Department tele gram No. 166 D.S. dated 17th March. The general trend of the correspondence shows, I think, that what Foreign feared was not so much warlike operations as that Bin Sa’ud should be entangled into some agreement with the Turks wherein our interests might suffer. With both parties engaged in preparations for war and the Turkish preparations apparently the least efficient, I hope we need have no apprehensions on that score. As Crow is nearer Zubair and his news is a day later than yours, I have not wired to Foreign. Your report NoC.ll dated 2nd April will, of course, go on. Lieut-Colonel W.G.

I am not inclined to share the views expressed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, in the last portion of his letter regarding the advisability of asking the Porte to defer action pending the result of the discussion of Bin Sa , ud , s position with His Excellency Hakki Pasha. The fact that such a communication was made could not well be conveyed to Bin 3a*ud, and would not therefore earn his gratitude, and, from the general trend of the correspondence, I gather that the 'independent action” against which the Secretary of State desires Bin Sa'ud should be warned is not so much warlike preparations to repel a possible invasion as some form of entangling alliance which might injuriously affect BritishBritish interests. T7ith both sides engaged in warlike pre parations, which, from recent reports, seem unlikely to lead to active operations, it may be hoped that the pos sibility of/an understanding between Bin ga’ud and the Turks is a remote one and, so long as active hostilities do not result and this eventuality is being carefully watched, it would seem, from our point of view, that both parties could not be better employed. such I have the ho our to be Your most obedient servant.

I beg to enquire whether I should comply with Bin Baud's wishes and meet him somewhere on the coast.

I am not inclined to share the views expressed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, in the last portion of his letter regarding the advisability of asking the Porte to defer action pending the result of the discussion of Bin Sa’ud’s position with His Excellency Hakki Pasha. The fact that such a communication was made could not well be conveyed to Bin Sa’ud, and would not therefore earn his gratitude, and, from the general trend of the correspondence, I gather that the “ independent action ” against which the Secretary of State desires Bin Sahid should be warned is not so much warlike preparations to repel a possible invasion as some form of entangling alliance which might injuriously affect British interests. With both sides engaged in warlike preparations, which, from recent reports, seem unlikely to lead to active operations, it may be hoped that the possibility of such an understanding between Bin Sa'ud and the Turks is a remote one and, so long as active hostilities do not result, and this eventuality is being carefully watched, it would seem, from our point of view, that both parties could not be better employed.

Letter from His Excellency Saiyid M. ’Arif bin Yusuf, Wali of Suriya. 2. Letter from Binbashi Saiyid ’Umar Fauzi bin’Arif. 3. Letter from His Excellency Anwar Pasha, War Minister of the Ottoman Government. 4. Letter from His Excellency Sulaiman Shafiq, Wali of Basrah. 5. Letter from Sayid Talib of Basrah. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, translations of the marginally noted letters which have recently been received by the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with the present state of affairs in Nejd. 2 . Saiyid ’Arif, the writer of enclosure No. 1 , was formerly Wali of Basrah and is well acquainted with Sir Mubarak and his family. Saiyid ’Umar, his son, the writer of No. 2 , arrived in Kuwait about 15th March and left by the mail of the 25th idem. While here he spent much time in discussion with the Shaikh, he and his secretary having been closeted with him for an hour or two daily, but he did not obtain the access to Bin Sa’ud which was the object of his visit, Sir Mubarak declining either to give him any letter of recommendation or to take any steps to arrange the desired meeting. Enclosures 4 and 5 arrived from Basrah two days ago, and they will receive replies to the effect that Sir Mubarak does not see his way to assist either side and must decline to be drawn into the matter or to give any advice, as although he sympathises with the desire of both sides to avoid blood shed or anything which would produce enmity among Muslims he must be faithful to his longstanding friendship with Bin Sa’ud. 3 . It appears that a Turkish force of 1,000 men with five guns has recently been encamped at Zobair, and that the Basrah authorities had written to Ibn Rashid calling for his help on receipt of which they intended to proceed against Bin Sa’ud. Sir Mubarak informed me yesterday that this force had returned to Basrah, a satisfactory reply not having come from Ibn Rashid. The latter is said to have accepted with thanks three thousand rifles which had been sent to arm his men, and C48FI)2 to have replied with promises of future help when he should have the power which he does not possess at present. 4 . Referring to Foreign Department telegram No. D.S.-166 of 17th March to your address, it may perhaps be observed that Bin Sa'ud will be more likely to accept with gratitude and readiness any arrangement which we may make on his behalf with the Turks if they, as well as he, are asked to defer action pending the result of the negotiations. Captain Shakespear, who was at Riadh on the 10 th ultimo, informs me that Bin Sa'ud had then already heard of the Turkish attempts at mobilisation, and it will naturally be more difficult to restrain him unless such preparations on their part are suspended. Letter from His Excellency Saiyid Muhammad ’Arif bin Yusuf, Wali of Suriya (Syria), to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak as Sabah, dated 12 Habi-ul- Awwal 1332 (9th February 1914). Aftek compliments, &gt; The bearer of this letter is my son, Binbashi Saiyid ’Umar Fauzi, who is sent to you by His Excellency Anwar Pasha, the War Minister of the Ottoman Govern ment, to discuss with you that which concerns the welfare of the countries and peoples, and, by your means, to come in touch with Abd-ul-Aziz bin Sa’ud. So it is hoped that you will furnish him with your advice and supply him with a letter to the person referred to, saying that this, my son, is the confidential agent of the Minister alluded to for the discussion of all matters relating to those parts (Nejd) : also that meeting him is meeting me, and to trust him is to trust the Government and the Minister above-mentioned. And I pray that God will give you (Mubarak) prosperity and success in what lies before you, you will then gain from this affiir great future reward, universal praise, and the approval of the Sultan. Please give my regards to your sons, and salaam. 4 # Letter from Binbashi Saiyid ’Umar Fauzi bin ’Arif, representative of the Ottoman War Minister, to His Excellency Sir Mubarak as Sabah, dated 21 Rabi-al- Akhir 1332 (19th March 1914). After compliments, In addition to what Your Excellency has learned from the letters which I placed before you when I arrived here and that which I have represented to you verbally, I beg to lay before you (in writing) the special mission in which I am employed by the Minister for War, Anwar Pasha, namely, that I should meet His Excellency the Amir Abd-ul-Aziz as Sa’ud and discuss with him in a friendly manner measures to terminate the present difficulties which are not hidden from Your Excellency : and my hope from you is that you will write a letter to the aforesaid Amir asking him to come to some place which you consider suitable for our meet ing and conference, which may be close at hand to enable me to communicate with the War Minister by telegraph. I have hopes that you and I may agree in this matter, so that through us the shedding of Muslim blood may be avoided, and thereby you will gain future reward from Heaven and praise from our Muham madan brethren, and salaam. Letter from His Excellency Anwar Pasha, Ottoman War Minister, to His Excellency Sir Mubarak as Sabah — undated. After compliments, Know, oh brother, that the Moslem world is at the present time attacked by enemies from all sides and places and that it stands among them all practically without a helper or supporter. Moreover her own people have deserted her, and the enemies have come in between her and them by means of tricks, lies, and decep tions. Now we, her friends, in obedience to the Divine command and the incum bent service of the revealed religion, have decided upon guarding zealously what is left to Islam and collecting those who profess the unity of God as proclaimed byt lie prophet, hoping that every zealous and religious Muslim will extend to us the hand of help and faithful service in the cause of religion and will act according to the saying of the great guide (Muhammad) “ The Faithful in their mutual affec tion, sympathy, and cohesion, are like a human body all parts of which cry out if any limb complains And since you are numbered among Muslims we call upon you by this letter to take these matters to heart! and God is the witness and on looker : there is certainly no permanent value in Government, property, or anything of these perishable things, the object of all is to do the will of Heaven and to exalt the Divine creed in Divine territory “ if there is good knowledge of God in your heart good will come to you even from what is taken away from you ” (Koran), and salaam. I ♦ Lettter from His Excellency Sulaiman Shafiq, Wall of Basrah, to His Excellency Sir Mubarak as Sabah, dated 1 Jamadi-ul-Awwal 1332 {March 28,1914). After compliments, Saiyid ‘Umar Fauzi Beg Binbashi has returned from Kuwait deeply grateful lor your kindness to him and obliged for all the friendliness you showed him. He has been appointed as my Staff Officer in Basrah, and we hope for success (in our affairs). It is not hidden from Your Excellency that the exalted Government is occupied with the settlement of Nejd matters, and their chief object is to avoid bloodshed and the rise of hatred among Muslims, and we have to ask help from honoured persons, such as yourself especially, as we ought to be working together in this matter, seeking for Divine favour that our efforts may be crowned with success. We hope for your valuable opinion and profitable help according to what you see to be advisable, and trust that you will disclose to us how to get to the root of the matter so that we may succeed in the affair. When I see you I will speak upon the subject, meanwhile I hope for an answer from you, and salaam. Letter from Saiyid Talib, Basrah, to Sir Mubarak as Sabah, dated 1 Jamadi-ul- Awwal {March 28th, 1914). After compliments, Saiyid 'Umar Fauzi Binbashi has returned grateful for your favours, and this is only what is expected from your noble quahties, as Your Excellency is as a father whose fatherly kindness to, and deep affection for, his children is gener ally admitted. May Heaven prolong your life! The settlement of Nejd affairs has been committed to His Excellency the Wall who has written to Your Excellency a letter which I enclose, and since you are of the first of those whose opinions are profitable, you are requested to help energetically in this important matter so that it may be carried through with great success.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, LA., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C.-ll, dated 2nd instant, I have the honour to report further on the subject of Bin Sa’ud and the Turkish Government 2 . Yesterday Sir Mubarak received a letter from Bin Sa'ud enclosing a Enclosure 1, c °py of that recently addressed to him : r , . mr cn -11 , , by the Political Agent at Bahrain andask- mg for advice. ^The Shaikh asked me what reply he should give. I said that inn pa ud should be told to continue to act in conformity with the advice given to him by Major Trevor, and to abstain from further action for the present His Excellency then told me clearly that what Bin Sa'ud desired was the same^ position as that assured to the Shaikh of Kuwait under the recent Anglo- Turkish Agreement, viz., autonomy with British protection under Turkish suzerainty, and added that, in his opinion, any other arrangement would result in endless trouble in the future for the Arabs, for the Turks, and for ourselves I replied that the question had been referred to His Majesty J s Government, and that Bin Sa’ud’s best chance of obtaining a solution which would be satisfactory to himself would be implicitly to adhere to the instructions which he hadreceivpd To this Sir Mubarak agreed. cia received. 3. Further letters also arrived yesterday from the Wali of Basrah and Saiyid Talib in which Sir Mubarak was informed that the Ottoman Government had signified their intention of conferring upon him and upon Sir Khazal Khan of Muhammerah the decoration of the Osmanieh in the first class, and the Wali expressed a wish to come to Kuwait for the purpose of investing Sir Mubarak with the insignia thereof. His Excellency asked me what I thought of this. I replied that as he^ had already expressed to the Turks his regret at not being able to act as an intermediary in their negotiations with Bin SaMd he need feel no awkwardness in accepting this mark of favour at their hands. He remarked that the presence of the Wali of Basrah in Kuwait at the present moment would be likely to lead to misunderstandings, as his object would certainly be to use this place as a base from whence to carry on negotiations with Bin SaMd, and asked whether it would not be better for him to borrow my launch—his own being hors de combat at present—and proceed to Fao for the investiture, explaining to the Wali that this course would save him trouble and the inconvenience of prolonging his journey. I can see nothing objectionable in this proposal from the local point of view, but it appears better that I should ask you to telegraph to the Government of India asking whether for any reason it would be well to allow the Wali to come to Kuwait, and if you see no objection I hope you will do this and ask for a reply at their earliest convenience. 4 . I append a translation of a letter recently written by Bin Sa'ud to Saiyid Talib from which it will be seen that he has no intention at present of entering into any agreement with the Turks. He is now some distance north of Riyadh, but his advance is not intended as a hostile demonstration. 5 In letter No. 39902-13, dated 2nd October last, from His Majesty's Foreign Office to India Office, it is stated that Hakki Pasha, in thanking His Majesty's Government on behalf of the Porte for their friendly offer of good offices in the6 difficulty with Bin Sa’ud, adds that if the necessity arises the Porte will not fail to avail itself of them. Sir P. Cox, in his f ‘ memorandum of guidance”, for Major Trevor at his meeting with Bin Saffid in December last, observes that “ it may be taken for granted that the Porte will be anxious to avoid our media tion if possible and the local state of affairs at the moment leads me to fear that, notwithstanding Hakki Pasha’s apparent readiness frankly to exchange views at the discussions which have recently taken place in London, the replies of the Porte to the representations of His Majesty’s Government may be purposely delayed pending the result of the efforts which are being made locally to effect a settlement with Bin Sa’ud, a settlement which, whatever its exact terms may be, will certainly be opposed to our interests, and fatal to the future peace and prosperity of certain regions adjoining the Persian Gulf. Translation of a letter from Abd-ul-Aziz Bin Sa’ud to Saiyid Talib of Basrah, undated. After compliments, I was very pleased to receive your letter signifying your devotion to the Exalted Government (Porte), which devotion I share, as you know, brother, that I am the first in wishing well to that Government and country. And it is with great grief that I have to ask you to represent to the persons charged with the business that although I do not waver in allegiance to Islam or turn from obedience to the Porte there are things that I cannot do. Please present my good wishes to Anwar Pasha, the present war minister, and assure him that I also desire the union of Islam and the binding together of separated hearts, and moreover that I am grate ful to him for having sent His Excellency Saiyid ’Umar Fauzi Beg for the establish ment of friendly relations and for the latter having brought a valuable present in the shape of the noble Koran. But it is not hidden from you that the affairs of our country at the present moment are in a very strange condition, of which indeed the description is impossible, and that I am not responsible for this. If the Government’s intentions are really to protect the country from various dangers and to gather Islam together in obe dience to the Khalifate then this can only be done by diplomatic measures followed rr. hit ■ i. ? / p 'i 4 -• , i by a proclamation, and it is for the Porte to *His Ma estys Government is meant here.

And as for the valuable present, I accept it, and hope you will convey my excuses, and salaam. - { G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C-48 F, —L3-4.14,—38—B.A.C onf iciential.

[7th March.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. 10241 No. 1 . Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, Sir, 7th March 1914. With reference to previous correspondence respecting Bin Saud and his relations with the Ottoman and British Governments, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a minute by Mr. Parker recording a conversation with Hakki Pasha. I am to state that, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, the fact that information regarding the recent meeting between British officers and Bin Saud has come to the knowledge of the Ottoman Government renders it necessary that the utmost care should be exercised in regard to any future communications with that chief, as it is clear from the language of Hakki Pasha that such com munications do in fact tend to give rise to grave suspicion on the part of the Ottoman Government. Sir E. Grey is further of opinion that, in view of the language of His Highness, the utmost caution should be observed at the interviews which are to take place with Hakki Pasha next week, in order that the Ottoman Gov ernment may be reassured as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Sir E. Grey believes that the Ottoman Government, if treated with frankness, will show themselves prepared to meet the reasonable requirements of His Majesty’s Government, but he is anxious to dispel any erroneous impression which may have arisen that British policy is directed towards weakening the Ottoman authority in Nejd, as such a policy would be inconsistent with that of upholding the integrity of the Ottoman Empire to which reference is made in your letter of the 13th September ItHS. I am, &amp;c., W. Langley. Enclosure in No. 1 . Minute hy Mr. Parker. I called on Hakki Pasha to-day with reference to the Turco-German nego tiations, and he took the opportunity of saying to me, under instructions, that it was persistently reported at Basra that His Majesty’s Government had, through their agents in the Persian Gulf, entered into direct relations with Bin Saud. This had created a very painful impression at Constantinople, for the British Government had solemnly recognised that west of the blue line attached to the Convention signed on the 29th July 1913, and to the north of that line, excepting Kuwait, the territory was Turkish, and formed part of an Ottoman province; the Turkish Government was, therefore, greatly* concerned to hear that such communication had been made by us direct to an Ottoman subject in territory recognised as Ottoman, and that any communication should not have been addressed to the Ottoman Government. I said that curiously enough this was the very subject about which I wished to speak to him, and that the appointments I had already fixed for him at the Poreign Office on Monday and Wednesday were in order that he might have a full and frank interchange of views with Sir Percy Cox who was shortly going to India, and with Sir A. Hirtzel and myself. We felt that it would be of great value for such an exchange to take place about our mutual interests in the Gulf, and about Bin Saud in particular.The meeting to -which he had referred had in fact taken place. Hakki Pasha would recollect that some months ago I had spoken to him about His Majesty’s Government being able to use their srood offices in order to effect a reconciliation between him and the Turkish Government, and His Highness had, after reference to Constantinople, expressed bis Government’s apprecia tion of our offer, which, if later need should arise, they would be glad to avail themselves of, but that they were themselves in negotiation with Bin Saud and they hoped soon to reach a satisfactory settlement. Now, however, no substantial progress seemed to have been made with Bin Saud by the Ottoman Government, and meanwhile there had been great un rest on*the Trucial Coast and near Maskat, there were fears that Bin Saud, if His Majesty’s Government treated him with coldness, would retaliate by forc ible action against the tribes under our protection, and we could not face with equanimitv the prospect of having to send a large expedition to quell any disturbances which might arise. This, and the fact that our merchants were damaged in their interests by being excluded from El Katif, made it necessary for us, from the force of circumstances, to address some communications to Bin Saud ; but we were so far from wishing to undermine the Ottoman authority, or depart from an attitude of strict neutrality to which His Majesty’s Govern ment intended to adhere, that we had already arranged with Sir P. Cox to meet Hakki Pasha in order to have a full discussion. Hakki Pasha said he had no authority to discuss the position with Sir P. Cox, but he would agree to meet him provided it was understood that the discussion should be tentative and non-committal. The Ottoman Govern ment meant to re-establish their garrisons in El Hasa, and they would deeply resent it if Bin Saud received any encouragement from us. I repeated that we were and would remain neutral, but we bad certain interests to protect on the Trucial Coast, and we must also insist upon our merchants having access to El Katif as to every other portion of the Ottoman Empire : we bad, however, heard it stated that the Turks wished to exclude us from El Katif even for purposes of trade. Hakki Pasha said he could not think that this was really the case, but he impressed upon me that the Ottoman Government attached great value to our formal and binding recognition of the Ottoman province of Nejd, for Parliament was soon meeting and they would have to make full use of this in justifying the many concessions they had made to us, with ragard to El Katr, the Aden delimitation up to the Buba A1 Khali, and the Turco- Persian frontier j and if now they found that we did not in fact recognise Turkish authority in Nejd the agreements with us would be most unpopular: in fact, the Ottoman Government would be bound by their engagements to us, and we should evade our own to them. I impressed upon him very clearly and repeatedly that there was no ques tion of any such evasion—a situation of fact had arisen and ^ must be faced, and for this purpose we wished to meet him in friendly discussion. If we had not wished to deal with the matter in this open and friendly way, we should not have proposed to him in the summer to use our good offices to effect a recon ciliation. The discussion was quite friendly, but I feel that the situation is delicate, and that unless it is carefully handled the Turks may make difficulties. Foreign Office, 7th March 1914.(Received on the 30tli March 1914 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 11, dated the 13th. March 1914.) TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. 10569 [9th March*] Section 1. No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Uakki Pasha, 9th March 1914. BIN SAUD. The subject being a complicated one it has seemed more conirenient to draw up an informal memorandum for the personal information and use of His Highness Hakki Pasha. In August last it was explained to His Highness that Bin Saud, by the fact of his assumption of control at Katif and Ojair and the coast-line of the El Hassa province, had now entered specifically into the sphere of Gulf politics and commerce j and that important British interests and obligations in the Gulf (e.ff., in connection with the maintenance of the maritime peace, the suppression of piracy, and the arms traffic j the settlement of pearling and slavery disputes) made it impossible for us to ignore Bin Saud and pretend to treat the province and coast of Hassa as politically derelict. We must necessarily have relations with someone in de facto authority, and the Turks having evacuated the region we must deal with Bin Saud and were glad to explain the position to them. The above communication was an obviously frank and friendly act prompted by our desire to act with them in a spirit of mutual confidence and co-operation. Hakki Pasha received the communication very favourably, and replied that the Porte was already in negotiation with Bin Saud and that if occasion for our mediation arose it would be taken advantage of. In spite of this friendly response by His Highness we know from reliable local information that just after this exchange of communications, or conceivably just before it, the Ottoman Government were endeavouring to arrano-e terms with Bin Saud, some of which were clearly directed against the British Government and British interests. Thus, according to our information, the following are the conditions which the Porte are endeavouring to impose on Bin Saud as the price of his partial autonomy: l re-admission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hassa, as formerly. 2. The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers by direct “ farmansissued by the Sultan. 3 . The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of £ T. 3,000. 4 . The reference of all communications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5 . The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6 *. An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor car services. Incidentally, the Minister of the Interior has since informed His Maiesty’s Ambassador ( 1 st December 1913) that the Ottoman Goyernment had decided to recognise the recent accompli in hlejd (El Hassa) by nominating Ihn Saud as Mutessarif of that district. The first three of the six conditions aboye quoted refer to matters with which we are not immediately concerned, but considering the frank communication made to Hakki kasha in August by His Majesty s Foreign Office it would not be unnatural that His Majestj s Government should begreatly surprised at the terms of the latter three, especially 4 and 5, and, if the information proved to be correct, should feel constrained to protest strongly against them. The only explanation of such conditions would appear to be that the Porte mistrust the assurances already offered of our readiness to co-operate, and that they fail to appreciate the difficulties in which we are placed by the continuance of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs between themselves and Bin Saud. We fully recognise that Nejd is an Ottoman province, and have no desire to interfere in it, but for the reasons already given we cannot ignore Bin Saud now that he is in occupation of the coast-line. There is no secret regarding our requirements. What we require of him, for the maintenance and protection of our interests, is— 1. That he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab prin cipalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Katar. 2 . That like other Shaikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf he should co operate for the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce ; i.e., the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of inter-tribal hostilities by the passage of armed dhows at sea. 3. That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic. 4. That British traders should be freely admitted to Katif, and properly treated while there. There is nothing in these conditions to which either Bin Saud or the Porte can take the least legitimate objection; at the same time it is only natural that while expressing his readiness to accept the obligations involved, Bin Saud should in return desire the friendly offices of the British Government in the composition of his quarrel with the Turkish authorities and should ask us to deter Shaikhs in relations with us from harbouring tribal enemies of his. _ We had no wish to intrude ourselves, but the terms of the conditions which,^ as we hear, the Porte now seek to impose on Bin Saud, show so little friendliness toward ourselves, and are so impossible of acquiescence, that we are obliged to return to the subject. We are primarily concerned to see the last three conditions withdrawn, but we should also be glad to see a satisfactory arrangement come to with Bin Saud by the Porte, under which as a corollary of their decision to regard Bin Saud as ex^ officio Mutessarif of El Hassa, they should approve and take cognisance of his undertaking to comply locally with our four desiderata above detailed, and, while reserving the right to take in the last resort whatever action they may deem necessary, should, by way of friendly co-opera tion with the British Government for the preservation of peace and good order in the Gulf, agree to refrain from hostile action by sea against the El Hassa coast, without first consulting us, and giving us an opportunity of friendly mediation if such be possible.

In contiuation of the correspondence ending with my letter No. 314, dated the 21st March 1914, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of a letter which I have received to-day by special messenger from Bin Sa’ud from which it will be seen that he expects to meet a Turkish Envoy somewhere round about Kuwait at an early date. His messenger is coming to discuss the matter with me to-morrow, but I shall not be able to give him any information which will be acceptable to Bin Sa’ud. In fact it looks probable that unless something definite can be communicated to him very soon, Bin Sa’ud will make his own arrangements with the Turkish Government, and such arrangements may very likely be hostile to our interests. As the mail steamer has been delayed till to-morrow by a shamal, I hope to catch her with this letter which is written in haste, and the translation of Bin Sa’ud’s letter has also been done somewhat hastily. Should you have any news to communicate to Bin Sa’ud after next mail for Bahrain leaves it would probably be easier to communicate with him through Kuwait. Translation of a letter, dated the 6th Jamadi I, 1332 {2nd April 1914) from Shaikh ’Ahdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al Faisal, Amir of Najd, to Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter No. 512 of 1914 and to say that I have understood what you mentioned there, specially you inform me that instructions have reached you to let me know that the British Government is making efforts so as to make arrangements with the Turkish Govern- ment and the discussions are progressing, it is, therefore, not advisable that I should take independent action in the matter. I beg to say that I am obliged for that and it is the very object of mine and that I would not change from what I spoke to you verbally. Inshallah presently I expect continuous negotiations from the British Government about what may please the heart. I have further to inform you that on 11th of the current month I will reach to the desection of Jubail and this time I recceiyed information from the Turkish plenipotentiary who has come from Constantinople directly and his name is Binbashi Saiyid ’Omar Fauzi Beg Mardini, formerly Vali at Basrah, now Vali of Suria. He has with him some message and letters and intends to settle between myself and themselves. He has arrived at Basrah and apparently will come to Kuwait or might have come already. He is bound to see me and I will meet him very soon at the direction of Kuwait if God decrees so. I did not like to see him till I had informed you, so that you may let me know what is required and in,97 what form it should be. You know of course that I adhere to my w0 ^ firm on the matter that may near me towards the freindship of the Bntis Government and may check my nearing the Turks except in case I connot help, then I will tread a way good for myself Now Inshallah you may let me know whatever is necessary, though your first word I had taken by the eye of accept ance, but you know that a man of business desires to know the reality and to settle his case and intention is known to you. I request you to let me know through my protege Yusuf whom I have trusted in order to negotiate with your honour so that I may (be able to ) look after my interests. May you be preserved and salaam.

In continuation of my letter No. 383, dated the 6th April 1914 (which did not after all catch the last mail steamer before she left and will reach you with this letter), I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of my reply to Bin Sa ud s lettter. Bin Sa’ud sent a confidential messenger with this letter who had an interview with me. He said that Bin Sa’ud would like to have another meeting with me, and asked if I could arrange it. I replied that I should like very much to see Bin Sa’ud again, but I did not think it would be advisable for me to go and meet him now, without sanction from superior authority, as possibly, in view of the pour parlers going on in London, such action might be open to objection. In any case I could not add anything to what I had said at the former inter view and in my letter No. 514 as I knew nothing further. The messenger said that Bin Sa’ud had received a letter from Shaikh Mubarak suggesting a meeting with Binbashi Saiyid ’Omar Beg at Kuwait. I said that, as far as I was aware, there did not appear to be any immediate neces sity to arrive at a settlement, and recommended delay. The messenger, however, seemed to think that Bin Sa’ud would feel called upon to go if he received another letter. My impression is that Bin Sa’ud intends to go and have a meeting in any case, and is naturally very anxious to know first whether the British Govern ment has been able to do anything for him. I beg to enquire whether I should comply with Bin Sa’ud’s wishes and meet him somewhere on the coast. If so, provided I receive permission at an early date, I could, no doubt, make the trip either in the R. I. M. S. “ Palinurus ” or on the S. L. “ Bahrain ”. If it is not possible to communicate with me soon I do not suppose the meeting will be possible as I think Bin Sa’ud will soon go on towards Kuwait. If so, no doubt he will have ah interview with the Political Agent there. I am attempting to send you the gist of this letter by telegram from Henjam, but the mail is late and possibly you will not get it much sooner. Translation of a letter No. 614, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to Shaikh Abdul ’Aziz bin ’Abdur Rahman bin Sa’ud,'Amir of Najd. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated 6th Jamadi 1,1332== (2nd April 1914) and in reply I have to say that am afraid I have no further information which I can give you, as I have heard nothing further since my letter No. 514 was written. Your letter under reply has unfortunately just missed the mail to Bushire, but I will communicate with the Resident at the first opportunity. Should I receive any further news I will communicate with you. In the meanwhile there does not seem to me to be any very pressing hurry, and I would advise you to wait. If you are going up towards Kuwait, I beg to suggest that you might communi cate with the Political Agent there before actually having the meeting. 1 have had a talk over the whole subject with your messenger Yusuf.

As reported in my telegram 35 of April 28th last, the Commission appointed to effect a settlement of the Hasa question with Bin Sa’ud left Basrah in the Shaikh of Kuwait’s launch for Kuwait on the morning of the 28th ultimo. The Commission consisting of Saiyid Talib Bey Naqibzadah as President, Major Beha ad Din Bey Chief of the Baghdad Staff, Major r Gmar Fauzi Bey Chief of the Basrah Staff, who had previously visited Kuwait and Sami gffendi Mutassarif of Hasa, was accompanied by Eumer Bey a Basrah lawyer Muhammad al Na’raa, Arab notable and landed proprietor and ’Abdul Wahab Mandii and ’Abdul Latif Mandil; the latter are Arab notables and landed proprietors and represent Bin Sa’ud at Basrah as agents. I understand that the instructions to the Commission are to settle the question in a friendly way and that they will meet Bin Sa’ud at Kuwait. The 1st class of the Osmanieh has been conferred on Shaikh Mubarak by the Sultan and, as the decoration had not arrived at Basrah, an order was borrowed from Saiyid Talib Bey, presumably the same, and sent to the Shaikh by the hands of Barhan ad Din Bey, Public Prosecutor of the Basrah Appeal Court and Hilmi Effendi Director of Public Instruction. These gentlemen travelled with the Com mission on board the Shai'h’n launch. On receipt of the de coration from Constantinople it is to be handed to SaiyM Talib in return for the one he lent. The judicial authori ties were very loth to part with the Public Prosecutor, whose services are required in the Courts where much business awaits him. A letter addressed by the President of the Court to the Vail pointing out the inconvenience caused by the Public Prosecutor’s absence from his post and the consequent^ consequent delay to the business of the courts was not well received and^ the Vali explained that it was only fair to the Public Prosecutor to give him the chance of mazing a little money* Some irritation seems to have been caused in the Serai by this observation.Confidential Do diet Telegram, From Loch, Assistant Resident, Bushire.

Cn the 13th September lest, as you are aware, a letter was addressed to this Department by the direction of the Secretary of State for India, enclosing a telepram from the Viceroy, which contained the following passages •There can be no doubt, so far as India’s Interests arc rneci, that the existence in Asia of a strong Turkish rf er, friendly and reformed, will be a safeguard against iterference with India from the west; it might even be the '.direct means of Persia’s integrity being maintained. We /e nothing to fear from Turkey, now that we have reached ^eement with her in the Persian hulf, whereas we have rything to gain by keeping our relations with her ’’India’s interests cannot, as we are fully aware, cirely govern policy of His majesty’s Government towards Turkey, but it would be a serious prospect for India if partition of Turkey eventuated. Cur responsibilities would be incfeased thereby, and Greet Britain, it may be observed, would have to bear a share of the increase. n It is our strong opinion, therefore, that every effort should be made to avoid action likely to lead to the partition, either now or in the future, or Turkey’s Asiatic possessions, and that His Majesty’s Government should pursue consistently the policy of maintaining the Turkish Bhrpire while reforming end strengthening it”. I am to request that the despatch Mo.193 of March 18th from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople of which a y was sent to you on the 30th ultimo, may be read in the ‘ht of the above statement of policy; and I am to observe Foreign Office, April 1st, 1914 lendlythat, in view of the importance of a successful rettlerarnt being reached of the negotiations now taking piece between the Ottoman Government and Bin Baud through the 3heikh of Koweit # Sir E, Or^ey on consideration has grove doubts as to the wisdom of conveying to Bln Seud a warning, as prop' ed in the telegram of torch 16th to the Viceroy, against acting independently of His Majesty’s Government, It la true that directs* negotiations have, in a vary informal manner, taken place between His Majesty’s Covern- rnent and the Ottoman Government; but 3ir E. Grey feels that this art does not, in existing conditions afford sufficient justification for an Intimation being conveyed to s Turkish subject that he should not negotiate '1th his own Government, especially hav^ing regard to the terms of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of so recent r date as July 29th, 1913. If, as the Government of India may apprehend, terms are agreed between the Ottoman Government and Fin Seud which , c arepijbneistent with British rights, or unfair to Briti'' commercial interests, or opposed to the political duties of Greet Britain in the Persian Gulf, the remedy, in Ur E* Grey’s opinion, would lie in eirect negotiation ,j lth the Ottoman Government. The adoption of this procedure, and the discontinuance of direct communications of a ouestion- feble nature with Bin 3' ud may possibly, 3ir E. Grey holds, cause some minor local inconvenience in the Persian Gulf; but such inconvenience would in probability be of short duration and it is desirable to incur it rather than to run the risk of the graver dangers bo forcibly portrayed in the Viceroy’s telegram of last September.

The telegram is not quite clear as to whether it is intended to repeat to Bin Saud the intimation given to the Turkish Government regarding Bahrain. I laid stress on this point when I interviewed Bin Saud in December last, but as I re ported at the time, it did not make much impression on him. In fact, from his point of view I do not think it amounts to much, having regard to the frequent visits of the “ Marmaris ” to Qatar and the ease with which a flotilla of native boats could be conveyed direct from Basrah in the fair season.

Sir, With reference to ray letter of the 1st instant regarding the relations between Bin Baud and the Turkish Government, I ara directed by Secretary Sir £. Grey to invite the attention of the Secretary of State for India to the telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople on trie same subject, No.214 of April 2nd, of which a copy was sent to your Office on the same day The Under Secretary of State, In view of Talaat Bey’s statement, as reported in that telegram, that a direct understanding between the Sublime Porte and Bin Baud is expected, it appears to Sir S. Grey essential that the intimation which it had been proposed to convey to Bln 3aud, warning him against acting independently of His Majesty’s Govern ment, should be held back, if not cancelled. India Office(COPY). P. 1278. Sir, India Office, Whitehall, London, 3.W 4th April 1914. 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ho.12320 of the 1st instant regarding the relations of Bin 3aud with the Ottoman Government. The Marquess of Crewe fully appreciates the force of the considerations stated in the telegram from the Government of India which was quoted therein, hut v saw nothing inconsistent with them in the policy of endeavouring to effect between the de facto ruler of Nejd and the Ottoman Government an arrangement that should be consistent with the interests of all parties. His view was that the integrity of Turkey was more likely to suffer if Bin Saud were left to negotiate uncontrolled by His Majesty^ Government, for if the negotiations took the form (as was likely) of an attempt to coerce him, they would almost certainly result in calling into being the Arab Confederacy to which Sir L. Mallet has referred. . iM. LordLord Crewe wag further anxious to prevent an inconvenient situation from arising. He believed that if Bin ^aud # disappointed of our good offices, were to throw himself into the arms of Turkey, and to adopt a hostile attitude to British interests - whether hy placing obstacles in the way of trade or by intriguing ntx with, or even attacking the Trucial Chiefs - the in convenience that would result could not be localised in the Persian Gulf, but would certainly lead to serious friction with the Ottoman Government itself. And, judging from the past, he felt sure that it would not be of short duration. In fact, the same reasons that have led to the conclusion of a convention with Turkey safeguarding British interests in those regions appeared to him to indicate that His majesty’s Govern ment should by some means be a party to the negotiations between tne Ottoman Government and Bin Baud, tnougn the position of the latter as a rebel might make formal British participation impossible; and these were, His Lordship understood, the reasons for the opening of informal discussions with Hakki pasha. When once those discussions had begun it seemed to Lord Crewe dangerous if Bin Baud were to negotiate independentlyindependently with local Turkish authorities who might not he cognisant of what was taking place in London, and he therefore sent his telegram of the 16th March. Since that date, however, the discussions with Hakki pasha nave made no progress, and it appears that the Ottoman Government are approaching Bin Baud through the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammera, both of whom are sensible men, friendly to British interests. His Lord- ship is therefore disposed, with Sir £. Gray*8 concurrence to instruct the Government of India that, if this is true, there is no objection to Bin Saud negotiating on his own account, and that His Majesty's Government have made the Ottoman Government aware of the nature of the settlement that they favour. But LoBd Crewe would prefer that the Sheikh should not be encouraged actually to conclude a settlement until His Majesty's Government nave satisfied themselves - whether through him or through the Ottoraan Government - that its terms do not conflict with their interests. In the meantime His Lordship is of opinion that if the Turkish authorities at Basra make any prepara tions for the actual despatch of troops, one of His Majesty's ships should be sent to ensure that the territorialterritorial waters of the Bahrein islands He regards the reef of Fasht al Yarim, to north-west of Bahrein harbour* as farmijftg islands, and the territorial waters* therefore, as extending three miles north of the northernmost point of the reef.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Sdward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant P.1278 regarding the relations of Bin Baud with the Ottoman Government. With regard to the draft of the telegram which the Marquass of Crewe proposes to address to the Govern ment of India, I am to state that in Sir S. Grey’s opinion it would be judicious to substitufle at the end of the first paragraph for the words 91 he may now negotiate* some such words as 'he is free to negotiate' in order to avoid the risk of creating in the mind of the Turkish Government the impression that His Majesty’s Government have hitherto actually prevented Bin Baud from negotiat ing with the Portd. with reference to the second paragraph of the telegram Sir E. Grey considers that it Should be omitted, but as regards the alternative suggested in the enclosure to your letter under reply, Sir E. Grey fears that, in the present suspicious state of mind of the Turkish Government,Government, it would hav/e a very bad effect on Anglo- Turklsh relations if Hie Majesty’s Government ware to put forward a demand implying tnat t'aey have a right to be consulted as to the terms of any agreement between the Porte and Bin Baud. The circumstances would in Sir 3. Grey’s opinion. The be met if the Turkish Government were informed that if they enter into any stipulations with Bin 3aud affecting British subjects or Interests, His Majesty’s Government will expect to be advised of their terms in good time. It will then be open to them, if there be occasion, to make representations to the Turkish Government on the subject. I am, etc,, SdA Syre A. Crowe.Confidentle.l. Sir Edward Grey to Sir L.

I leave it to Your Excellency's discretion whether to express to Ottoman Government the hope that they will not precipitate any military operations against him without first allow ing Hie Majesty's Gorernnent to use their goos offices in order to promote a settlement satisfactory to Doth parties. We wish not to secure any political advantage against Turkey, but merely ho prevent disturbances and bloodshed, which would he likely to affect seriously the security of the coast districts, where we have special rights, and. which coiild in all probability be easily averted by judicious and unofficial mediation. If Turkey takes forcible action against Bin saud there will be widespread unrest throughout Bfi-G tern Arabia. We learn that armed motor-launches have been shipped to Basra by Thomycroft for Ottoman Government.P. 14,73. Immediate. Sir, INDIA OPPICE, ■WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W. 16th April 1914. With reference to your letter No. 15023 of the 6th April, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of telegrams that Govt, of India, 7th April. From do. 9th 11th and l*tth April. ) have been exchanged with 1 the Government of India regarding the relations between the Ottoman Government and Bin Saud. Sir E. Grey is aware of the reasons for which the Marquess of Crewe is very unwilling to create in Bin Saud's mind the impression that His Majesty's Government are indifferent to him, and, as will have been seen from Mr. Abrahams' letter of the 4th instant, it is only the supposed fact that the Turks are acting through such tried friends of His Majesty's Government as the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammera, that has seemed to His Lordship to justify the policy of leaving him to negotiate direct. If the Government of India's enquiries should show that there is no foundation for this supposition - and it would appear from their telegram of the 11th instant that the Sheikh of Koweit is unwilling to commit himself - Lord Crewe is of opinion that before any farther communication is made to Bin Saud, Hakki Pasha should be asked informally if he has yet received the views of his Government. It will be remembered that the conversa tion with His Highness ms interrupted in order tnat he might obtain them, and the apparent loss of interesi in The Under Secretary of State, / Foreign Office.3&gt; J ' 7 j*u in the subject on the part of His Majesty*s Government may even have produced a stiffening in the attitude of the Ottoman Govermient towards Bin Baud. With reference to the Government of India* s telegram of the 14th instant. His Lordship is inclined to doubt whether any purpose would be served by making representations to Hakki Pasha f and to allow matters to take their course. But he would suggest that if a Turkish decoration is conferred on the Sheikh of Koweit the bestowal of the British decorations approved in your letter No. 41531 of 15th September last should not necessarily be postponed until the King’s birthday. As regards the last sentence of this telegram it seems desirable that the Sheikh should be acquainted with the British requirements, the innocent nature of which will disabuse his mind of any idea that His Majesty* s Government contemplate a forward or anti- Turkish policy.

The Turkish representatives did not come to Kuwait last week as had been arranged. By the mail of the 22nd instant Shaikh Sir Mubarak received a letter from Saiyid Talib stating that he had written to Constantinople for more precise instructions in regard to the terms which he was to make with Bin Sa’ud, and that he had heard in reply that the question was still under discussion but that instructions would be furnished to him. The party has arrived this morning in Sir Mubarak’s steam launch “ Mishrif ” which has been for the last month or so lying at Mohammerah. 3. On the evening of the 26th instant Bin Sa’ud arrived at Subaihiyah with a large following, and early on the morning of the 27th the Shaikh sent his Secretary to inform me that he had written asking the Amir to come to Malah, which is about half way between Kuwait and Subaihiyah, for the purpose of meeting me there. During the day the R. I. M. S. “ Lawrence ” arrived with your endorse ment forwarding for necessary action by me telegram No. 256-S. from the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, and I explained to Shaikh Sir Mubarak in the afternoon that portion of its contents which concerned himself. Late in the evening came a reply from Bin Sa’ud to the efiect that he would be at Malah on the following morning and hoped that I could come out then as he was anxious for a meeting as soon as possible. I accordingly went out .yesterday taking with me the telegram above referred to. 4. After the usual polite enquiries I commenced the interview, at which nobody else was present, with explaining to the Amir that portion of the telegram of the Government of India which was intended for his information. I could see that he was disappointed, and at first inclined to think that he had been allowed to foster hopes which were not to be reahsed, but I had no difficulty in removing this view by the explanation that it was the Turkish Government who had declined our offer of mediation and that His Majesty’s Government obviously could not force upon them assistance which they did not desire. I informed him as instructed that there was now no objection to direct negotiations taking place between him and the Turks, and that the views of His Majesty’s Government had been conveyed to the Porte. 5. In reply, the Amir said that he did not intend to make an independent arrangement with the Turks unless he were forced to do so because they were never faithful to their engagements and in a very short time, it might not be more than two months, things would be as bad as ever in Hassa. He asked me what were the views of His Majesty’s Government which had been conveyed to the Porte. I replied that they concerned the provisional undertakings into which he had enteredCONFIDENTIAL.

I attach a translation of a letter from Bin Sahid to Sir Mubarak which the latter handed to me during an interview on Monday. It represents an interesting piece of oriental diplomacy, the original document will be shewn to the deputation by the Shaikh with the remark that he has done what little he can but this is Bin Sakid’s reply; his face will thus be saved vis-d-vis of his guests while the attitude of Bin Sa’ud remains unaltered. 4.

In agreeing to approach (Kuwait) I have obeyed your instructions as regards obedience and submission to our Government, but you know well with what con tempt and disdain the officials of Government have treated me, and you have seen the patience with which I have submitted to their conduct all these years not with standing that I never once experienced anything from them which could console me. And now, Heaven be praised, I am in a position to do great things even as far as Iraq, were it not that I do not wish to be the cause of (further) decline to the Government and (additional) revolt on the part of the Arabs. Now I have recovered my own country as you are witness Oh Mubarak ; and it was you who went to Hassa with a force to protect me and afterwards betrayed me, you and the soldiers ! I ask you,’is it or is it not correct what I say about all the difficulties which have been brought upon me by the officials and the submission and patience which I have shewn. As to your urging me now to submission to the Government—I did not disobey you formerly that I should do so now, so if the matter which will guard my rights is granted and I and my affairs secure protection— then submission will certainly be incumbent upon me.

In continuation of my letter No. C.—16, dated 29th April, I have the honour to report further on the subject of Bin Saud and the Turkish Govern ment. 2. As stated in my last letter, the Turkish deputation headed by Saiyid Talib, son of toe Nakib of Basrah and Enclosure No. 2. Saiyid Umar Pauzi Beg, Chief of the Staff at Basrah, arrived in Kuwait on the 29th ultimo in Shaikh Sir Mubarak’s launch “ Mishrif ” which had been placed at their disposal. The same day the Order of the Osmanieh was presented to Shaikh Sir Mubarak without ceremony and in the presence of a few persons only. During the morning of the 30th the Shaikh sent for my Agency Mulla and asked him to let me know that the deputation were pressing him to accompany them on the occasion of their visit to Bin Saud. I replied through the Mulla that, as I had already informed him, His Majesty’s Government had no objection to his good offices being afforded to assist in the negotiations; and, to put his miud at rest, addressed to him the official letter which forms enclosure (1) to this report. The Shaikh replied to me the following day as given in enclosure (2). 3. During the whole of 30th April and 1st May the deputation were engaged in discussing the terms which were to be put before Bin Saud, and on the morning of the 2nd instant they proceeded to Subaihiyah whence they returned on the 4th. 4. I called on Sir Mubarak yesterday and he informed me of what had taken place. His version, which is confirmed generally by reports which have reached me from other sources, is probably substantially correct. The Turks first announced to Bin Saud their scheme for settlement, which was that he must first of all accept the reposting of Turkish garrisons in Katif and Ujair and their reinforcement by additional posts in Hassa: that all the xorts in Ujair and Hassa must be surrendered to them ; that all cannon and small arms captured must be made over to the Turkish troops; and that he is to have no connection whatever with any foreigners or foreign Power. In return for these conditions they agreed to recognise his autonomy; to allow him to collect all taxes, &amp;c., and to give him verbal, though not written, per mission to retake Katar and Trucial Oman when he chose. Bin fcaud’s scheme was then stated to them; it was that he should retain Katif, Ujair, and Hassa under Turkish suzerainty: should pay them £T3,000 per annum as tribute money; and should be at the disposal of Turkey, with his men, in the event * of armed assistance being required. The subsequent discussions turned upon the reinstatement of the Turkish garrisons : the deputation insisted upon this condition and Bin Saud refused to give way. After some time harsh words passed between him and Saiyid Umar, the latter was rash enough to say that if Bin Saud would not accept this condition he would be compelled to do so, whereupon the Amir started up and half drawing his sword ordered Saiyid Umar to leave the assembly, and any possibility of successful negotiations appears to have been at an end from that moment. The Turkish deputation returned to Basrah in the Shaikh’s launch on the night of the 4th instant, and are to report to Constantinople the failure of their negotiations.5. Sir Mubarak has from time to time made to me explanations of his position in connection with this matter, and summed them up during our interview yesterday. He regrets not having been able to accept the invitation of His Majesty’s Government to take part in the negotiations, but informs me that in any case nothing could have induced Bin Saud to accept the condition regarding the return of Turkish troops to what he regards as hia ancestral domains. He adds moreover that he has had experience of the Turks all his life, and that he cannot seriously urge Bin Saud to submit to them without a guarantee from us. In regard , to the Turkish deputation he felt obliged to assist Saiyid Umar Fauzi Beg to a certain extent, first because he was the representative of a foreign Power with whom his relations are friendly, secondly, because he was his guest on the occasion of his visit to Kuwait, and thirdly, because of the friendship which exists between himself and Saiyid Umar’s father. He did not want the Yali of Basrah in Kuwait as it might have been difficult to refuse to him that which he could decline to do for Saiyid Talib, and he had felt all along that he could not help in the negotia tions. I received in silence this statement, with part of which at least it was impossible not to feel sympathy. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosures direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to save time. *! || Dated the 5th Jamadi-ul-Akhir 1332 (30th April 1914), From—The Political Agent, Kuwait, To—S haikh Sik Mubarak-as-Subah.

And His Majesty’s Government has already informed the Turkish Govern ment of these desiderata. This is what was requisite and may you be in peace and safety. II Dated the 6th Jamadi-ul-Akhir 1332 (1st May 1914). From— Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah, To—The Political Agent, Kuwait.

With regard to the Turkish deputation to interview Bin Saud, they are at present with me and will go to meet him. A^d they have requested me to go with them to the meeting with Bin Saud and I have asked them to excuse me. As to mediation between them, I have positively declined it as I explained to them before. Regarding the desiderata of the Glorious Government from Bin Saud that he should not interfere in the Arab States on the shores of the Gulf including Katar, and that the subjects of Government should trade in Katif and go even aas, ,.L% to Hasn, your officers have informed him verbally regarding them, and I will follow the wishes of Government and inform him regarding them also as von direct. 1 am, as I say, obedient to all the desires of Government and if Bin Sand takes the right course he will also follow the wishes of Government in what you have asked of him. And I will also tell him that, and perhaps Bin Sand will visit me and I will come to you and we will inform him together. But as to mediation between him and the Turkish Government, I must positively keep away from that and have informed the deputation accordingly. This is what is necessary and may you be in peace and safety. INo. 1350, dated Bushire, the 10th (received 18th) May 1914. From— Major S. G.

Enclosure. Extract from a letter from F. E. Crow, Esq., C.M G., His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to Hisl Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, No. 28, dated the 2nd May 1914. As reported in my telegram 35 of 28th April last, the Commission appointed to effect a settlement of the Hasa question with Bin Saud left Basrah in the Shaikh of Kuwait’s launch for Kuwait on the morning of the 28th ultimo. The Commission consisting of Saiyid Talib Bey Naqibzadah as President, Major Beha ad Din Bey, Chief of the Baghdad Staff, Major Omar Pauzi Bey, Chief of the Basrah Staff, who had previously visited Kuwait, and Sami Effendi Mutassarif of Hasa, was accompanied by Burner Bey, a Basrah lawyer. Muhammad al Nama, Arab notable and landed proprietor, and Abdul Wahab Mandil and Abdul Latif Mandil; the latter are Arab notables and landed proprietors and represent Bin Saud at Basrah as agents. I understand that the instructions to the Commission are to settle the question in a friendly way and that they will meet Bin Saud at Kuwait. The 1st class of the Osmanieh has been conferred on Shaikh Mubarak by the Sultan and, as the decoration had not arrived at Basrah, an order was borrowed from Saivid Talib Bey, presumably the same, and sent to the Shaikh by the hands of Barhan ad Din Bey, Public Prosecutor of the Basrah Appeal Court, and Hilmi Effendi, Director of Public Instruction. These gentlemen travelled with the Commission on board the Shaikh’s launch. On receipt of the decoration from Constantinople, it is to be handed to Saiyid Talib in return for the one he lent. The judicial authorities were very loth to part with the Public Prosecutor, whose services are required in the Courts where much business awaits him. A letter addressed by the President of the Court to the Yali pointing out the inconvenience caused by the Public Prosecutor’s absence from his post and the consequent delay to the business of the courts was not well received and the Vali explained that it was only fair to the Public Prosecutor to give him the chance of making a little money. Some irritation seems to have been caused in the Serai by this observation. • *«*•**Confidential. Docket Telegram. From Loch, A*R. Bushire. To Grey, P.A. Kuwait. No. /773 Dated ^* 6.14.

On the other hand, the Political Agent, Kuwait has never heard any such story and apparently discredits it; I wag myself inclined to do so on first hearing it, as I did in directly before Shaikh hajbil reached Bahrain, when he was on his way from Kuwait. However the Political Agent, Kuwait, writing on the 16th June, agrees that further correer&gt;on&amp;ence has undoubtedly taken place between the Turk* and Bin Sa # ud but Shaikh Sir Mubarak professes that he knows nothlhg on the subject* A Kuwait report says that the Turks have agreed to leave Bin Sa*ud in possession of Hasa and Qatif on payment of a yearly sum of money* As far as on© can venture to make any prophecy on these conflicting rumours, it would seen that the Turkish envoys have failed to arrive at any definite understanding with the ♦Amir but have patched up some vague truce with Bln Ba»ud, which the latter will be free to abide by or neglect as he pleases and which they have misrepresented to Constantinople as a binding agreement * The next few weeks shoul 1 ' how whether the * Amir will show any hostility to British traders and the only matter that affords me any concern lest the 'status quo' should be altered to the detriment of British interests is that Shaikh fir Mubarak bin Bub ah is not very communicative.

Sir LoMallet to Sir Edward Grey. * (Keceived Mayl8). (No. 335). Constantinople, May 12th, 1914. Sir, In his telegram dated the 8th May, which I repeated to you in my telegram No.281 of the 9th instant, His Majesty’s consul at Basra reported the return from Koweit of the Turkish mission charged with the negotiations with Bin Saud. The moment appears to me an opportune one at which to review the Question of His Majesty’s Government’s relations with Nejd from the Turkish Government’s point of view. The policy of His Majesty’s Government, eg I under stand it, has been directed to three ends only, namely, (1) to secure to British subjects free access to and proper treatment in Nejd, and more especially in the coastal regions; (2) to avert developments in that region which would disturb the general peace ofthe Gulf and the perfor mance of British duties there; and (3) to prevent, or at least postpone, anything which might lead to a general Arab outbreak, and so endanger the integrity of the Turkish dominions in Asia. His Majesty’s Government having, by the agreement of the 29th July last,- recognised the entirely Ottoman character of Nejd and the El Hassa coast, it appears to me that the three aims just described can only be pursued consistently with that agreement by allowing the Porte to impose on Bin Saud, in fact, in so far as the El Hassa is concerned, the position which, as between ourselves and the Turkish Government, he is admitted to occupy in theory; in other words, to require either that he shall administer El Hassa as a Turkish officer, or allow the Turks to administer ^ it themselves. So far as the first an* aim is concerned, Bin Saud might or might not, as an autonomous potentate, treat British subjects more favourably than the Turkish1 3 SC? a V Turkish Government would do. As for the second* there may he rival advantages in both alternatives* hut I consider that there is something to he said in favour of having to deal with a Government which has now recognised our special position in the Gulf* should that Government he able to assert effective control over SI Hassa. Turning to the third object, it is obviously impossible to foresee the course of events in the Ottoman Arab world generally, but I think, on the whole, that the chances of an upheaval might be increased rather than diminished if an influential and centrally placed chief like Bin Baud were 5 to consolidate his power and extend it permanently to the seaboard. I have analysed what I conceive to be the objects of the general policy of His Majesty*s Government in regard to Nejd, because it appears to me that recent British action may give rise to apprehension in the minds of the Turkie T Ministers that His Majesty*s Government are in reality pursuing another object^, namely, that of establishing relations with Bin Baud which will in some sort reduce him to a state of semi-dependency on Great Britain. It must be remembered that a series of coincidences have occurred which might encourage this suspicion in the Turkish mind, A month before Bin Baud's descent on K1 Has the British agent at Koweit visited him in the interior* Early in the present year he was visited by other British officers, with the result that Hakkl Pasha was instructed to make a complaint in London. In March an endeavour of the Porte to enter into dire negotiations with Bin Baud through the emissary Omar Pau?' was foiled owing to the coldness ^ the Sheikh of Kowei British protege. At the beginning of April the commercia. interests of the British India Company made it seem desirat that the British agent at Bahrein should give them a written recommendation to Bin Baud, a step which, however innocentinnocent the objects oX the mission, was again open to misconstruction. Finally, when Bin Baud eventually agreed^ to meet the Turkish Commission, it was arranged that the meeting should take place at Koweit, and he was visited twice by the British agent there while the negotiations were in progress. When to these is added the lively interest which His Majesty^ Government have openly expressed, the contents of their memorandum of the 9th March to llakki Pasha, in which, inter alia, the Porte was reproached with asking Bin Baud to conduct all foreign relations through the Turkish authorities, and the repeated suggestions of mediation, it can only be expected that our attitude will be viewed with nt no little misgiving. It is not forkie to say how well founded the Turkish I suspicions may be, even if they exist, hut it appears to me that, having concluded the agreement of &amp;&amp;&amp;£ July last, which secures us solid advantages in return for certain definite concessions to the Porte, we are for the time debarred from doing anything which may be calculated to uphold Bin Baud as against the Ottoman Government. I think that, so long as there is any prospect whatever of the Turkish Government arranging matters with him by the dilatory and obscure methods of Oriental diplomacy, we should leave both sides severely alone, at any rate in appearances, and should only intervene diplomatically if it became clear that the Porte are contemplating military measures, which luil Talaat Bey assures me is not the case. As a matter of fact, I believe the Porte will strain every diplomatic resource in order to secure a settlement on the lines of practically recognising Bin Baud’s independence in the interior while regaining control of the El Hassay coast. Bo far as I myself am concerned, my principal reason for urging the desirability of refraining from further intervention of any kind for the present is that I consider it impossible to expect the Turkish Government to believe in@) in the innocence of our motiveskiM intentions. If we speak to them of a new situation of ^act they will say that the new situation dates from before our agreement with them of July last. If we say that our only desire is to promote peace in Arabia and the integrity of the Empire, they will say, or rather, think, without saying it, that for us#' to treat Bin Saud in a way which he and all his neighbours will construe as a sort of recognition of his de facto 5 independence is a ^Singular way of helping them to keep their Empire together. If we say that we have axes to grind in the Ottoman world in Turkey, and foresee no profit to ourselves in an upheaval, they will receive our c- assurances with the politest incredulity. Other events have recently occurred which, taken in connection with the affairs of the Gulf, may have increased the Turkish suspicions of the trend of British policy. The Aziz Ali agitation, which moved Arab opinion over a wide area, and in connection with which rny action was purely humanitarian, was rendered liable to misconstruction by the c- indisreet violence and partisanship of the ’'Times ,, . It was the conviction of the Grand Vizier that Aziz Ali had been employed by the Khedive in connection with his endeavours a, to pejsude the Sheikh of the Senoussi to make peace with fa the Italians, and it is not impossible that the Turkish Government rno.y have some sort of evidence to support this supposition. Being at peace with Italy, they could not &lt;*. object openly to such action on the part of Aziz Ali, but they have certainly resented the Khedive’s intrigues with the Senoussi if the violence of the Grand Vizier’s language respecting His Highness is any index of his feel ings in regard to them. It is permissible to assume that some members of the Turkish Government suspect that His Majesty’s Government or, at any rate, the Egyptian Government, were privy to His Highness's activities, which they may regard as a further indication of British interference in Arab politics. II do not wish to exaggerate the risk of arousing Turkish suspicions, hut itjmust not he forgotten that there are people here whose interest lies in maintaining an atmosphere of distrust between Great Britain and 'darkey which makes it additionally important to atooid any cause of offence .

Correspondence has appa— -rently tai^en place between Bin Baud and the Sharif of Makka and Ibn Rashid, in which the object is said to be merely the esta- -blishment of friendly relations among themselves. This may have led to the supposition that Bin Baud was trying to persuade other Arab Shaikhs to submit to Turkish rule or', the latter explanation may have been added by Turkish officials in order to emphasise the extent to which they had induced Bin Baud to fall in with their wishes. It is not believed here that Bin Sa.'ud has sudden- -ly become an ardent pro-Tuxk or that he has ceased to regard his own interests as paramount. Referring to Foreign Department telegram No. 428 S dated 16th July the settlement therein detailed does not conflict with ■that reported in ay letter Ho.

The messengers sent from here to Riadii, vide my letter above quoted, have gone to Bhaikh Sir Mubarak via Muhammerah, but he has not held and declines to hold further direct communication with Bin Baud on the subject of his arrangement with Turkey. He denies the existence of coldness between himself and Bin Sa’ud, but is obviously disappointed at the solution arrived at; and complained to me at the last interview we had before he left Kuwait that Bin Ba’ud had deceived him in coming to terras without his know- -ledge.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir T ,. Urey to acknowledge tho receipt of your letter P. POPS of the £7th ultimo on the subject of the relations of Sheikh Bin Baud of Hejd with the Ottoman Uovernnent. 1 an to state in reply that recent despatches from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople have impressed him with the importance of avoiding at this particular Juncture any action of a starve likely to lend colour to the suspicions already strongly entertained at Constatinople that His Majesty's Government are supporting Bin Sand’s policy of making himself independent. It seems to him essential that His Majesty’s Govern ment should proceed very cautiously. The situation has been informally but carefully explained to Hakki Pasha, and it has been suggested by His Highness to his Government that he should be authorisec 1 to discuss the cuestion here with the view to a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at here. In these circumstances Sir H. Grey considers that nothing should be done until tho result of Hakki Pasha's sugges tion is known. I am to add that point ’d* in the viceroy’s telegram of May 23rd to which your letter calls special attention does not appear to Sir E. Grey to be open necessarily to the interpretation that the Turkish conditions definitely preclude any connexion or intercourse between Bin Baud and foreigners; the condition v;ould seem merely to provide that any connunication between Bin Baud and foreign powers or their agents should take place through the^ authorities, a view which appears to Sir E. Grey entirely correct, and one in regard to which His Majesty’s Governmert would not be justified in encouraging resistance on the part of Bin Saud, a Turkish subject, and specifically recognised as such by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 29th, 1913. Sir E. urey is, inin faot, convinced that it would not he compatible with our engagements that Bin Baud should he treated otherwise, or that independent oonmvinicatloiffiwith him should be held except in cases where A Cftfmot he avoided; and he trusts that instructions in this sense will he issued. Prom a recent hut informal communication made by Hakki Pasha, there appears to he little doubt that the Ottoman govern ment are persuaded that Bin Sand would cone to tsaaqk terms with them were it not for British influence and the hope of British support. Sir E. orey fully recognises that arrangements must he made to protect British interests, hut only subject to the sovereign rights of Turkey. Sir E.

It will be observed that no mention whatever is made in the terms of the agreement of foreigners of the interests of Foreign Powers. 3 . It is known that Abd-ul-Latif Ma n dil has recently visited Bin Saud in Riadb, but this solution cannot be accepted until some confirmation of the report has arrived from Bin Saud himself. Sir Mubarak is much disturbed at the thought that Bin Saud could have concluded a formal agreement without consulting him, and has sent off a messenger to Riadh to ask for details. Unfortuntely he cannot return for some ten or twelve days, but I will inform you as early as possible of the reply. 4 .

Knox, C.I.E , Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to state that reports received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, writing under date the 25th July, mention that Bin Saud has paid to Saiyid Talib at Basrah through Abdul Latif Mendil a sum of Rs. 20,000. This is in addition to a sum of Rs. 40,000 given to Saiyid Talib in Kuwait. Presumably these sums were paid for Saiyid Talib’s assistance in the nego tiations with the Turks. The execution of the Qatif merchant, Abdul Hussain bin Juma, has already been reported in my summary for the month of July. Dr. Harrison who has only just returned from A 1 Qatif confirms the account that Abdul Hussain’s letters to the Turkish authorities were sent to Bin Saud by Said Talib. It is perhaps needless to say that Dr. Harrison’s visit to A 1 Qatif was in no way encouraged by the Political Agent, Bahrain, who does not appear to have been consulted. Dr. Harrison, according to his own account, w r as very well received. He is enthusiastic about the improvements already effected in Qatif by the Amir’s officials. Several old springs have been reopened and cultivation has increased. To a letter however in which Dr. Harrison sought permission to travel in Najd, no reply has been received from Bin Saud.

Sir, I have the honour to request that you will favour me wi a report showing, so far as information in your possession goes,what will be the attitude of Bin Sa*ud towards British authorities and British interests as the result of his receu settlement with the Turks. For instance. Does he realise and appreciate the fact thatT^the^sa11 sfact ory character of the settlement as regards himself and his local autonomy is the result of our friendly representations to the Turks or, Does he consider that we left him in the lurch and resent our supposed neglect accordinglyf In this matter. Shaikh Mubarak's views will be of interes I have noted that Shaikh Mubarak is none too pleased with Bir Sa'ud at present and it will be necessary to accept his opinions with some reserve. I am not altogether satisfied with Shaikh Mubarak's rather scanty explanations of his own dis content at Bin Saud's consenting to accept, even if only in name, the position and status of a Turkish official and would be glad to know if, in your opinion, there is any further explanation. It occurs to me as possible that Shaikh Sir Mubarak may be offended at the Amir consenting to accept any settlement at all without Shaikh Sir Mubarak’s concurrence and that his vanity may be touched by his failure to obtain the position^ 277 £%% position he no don.bt hoped for by both sides appealing to him to arbitrate between them. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Major, Offg: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.CONFIDENTIAL. f sin 4 Dated the 26th June 1914. From —Captain W. H. I. Shakesfeak, To— Sir Arthur Hirtzel, K. C, B,, Secretary, Political Department India Office, London. I have been through the papers which you were good enough to have sent to me and apparently some of the information which I sent to the Political Resident at Bushire from Riadh has never reached Government—the reason may be that, as I wrote to Mr. Lorimer privately, the letter may have been destroyed on reaching Bushire some six weeks after his death. I reached Riadh on the 9th March and found active preparations being made for the collection of a large force by Bin Saud ; I stayed and travelled with Bin Saud until the 15th and during this time had many opportunities of ascertaining his feelings and intentions. I would add that being on exceptionally intimate terms with Abdul Aziz and his whole family he fre quently showed me the confidential correspond- * ence passing between him and other Arab* Chiefs, amongst them Sayid Mahomed al-Idrisi, the Imam Yah yah of Sana’a^Bin Sha’alan, the premier shtikh of the great Anaizah tribe and others of lesser importance/as well ai his communications with the Turkish authorities. I did my best to discourage his confidences seeing that I had no official status, but as he insisted they may now be useful. Bin Saud was aware of the advent of Turkish troops and the new Vali of Basrah, Suliman Pasha, in Riadh before I met him in March, and fearing that the troops were intended for a des cent on Katif, Ojair and Hasa he had issued orders for a general mobilization of his troops (i.e., townsmen and villagers as distinct from the nomad Bedouin, who do not count for much). This mobilization only called up a small proportion of the available fighting strength of each village—some 30 per cent, was my estimate after many enquiries—but even then Bin Saud had anything from 5,000 to 7,000 well-armed and mounted men ready to his hand. The military efficiency of Bin Baud’s arrangements will be realized when it is understood that some of the villages are nearly 150 miles from Riadh, that the mobilization was practically complete within a fortnight, and that 1,000 men were despatched and posted in the coast villages (particularly Katif) within the first week. Bin Saud told me that he was forced to make these preparations as he could not risk allow ing the Turkish troops to effect a landing on the coast unopposed. He intended no aggressive action but was determined on a vigorous defence. He was exceedingly anxious as to whac reply* he would receive from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to his lettert of the M_ Ba i ,i - ath - Thani 1332 and what steps, if any, would be taken by His Majesty’s Government in the event of the.. Turkish troops making for the coast. My position did not permit of more than counselling patience, deprecating any hostile movement and suggesting that in any negotiations which might be attempted he should be careful to remember that he had given us (when he metj Major Trevor and myself at Ojair in December) certain provisional assurances regarding the Trucial Chiefs and British traders on the coast. He said he had no intention of committing himself definitely to the Turks so long as he had any chance of arriving at an arrangement with the British Government or at least of obtaining our support or good offices in his negotiations with the Turks, but at the same time he could not wait indefinitely and continue to maintain ? large force in the field ; and, unless he could obtain some sort of assurance he would be compelled to make his own arrangements in order to obtain a temporary respite at least from having to remain continually on guard. He told me then that the two conditions upon which the Turks would certainly insist would be (a) the re-establish ment of their former garrisons, and (b) the exclusion of all foreigners; the former he would never agree to whatever happened, and thought that by accepting the latter he might be able to buy his desired respite, though he saw that such acceptance would probably close the door to any further negotiations with the British Government, much as he desired an understanding with them. The reports of the subsequent negotiations in April near Kuwait show that Bin Saud has not wavered in his resolve, nor do I think that he will so long as he can fence with the Turks, and continues to cling to his hope of drawing His Majesty’s Government ipto any arrangement which he may make with the Porte. *So much for Bin Sand’s own attitude which I am convinced will not alter until he lias ;paired of obtaining the countinuance or good offices of His Majesty’s Government in his orts for an arrangement with the Turks. One reason, and that the most cogent for Bin Sand’s determined attitude, is that he feels uimself strong enough to oppose the Turks especially if he can keep the other great Arab Shaikhs firm in their resolution not to permit any further aggression or encroachment in Arabia by the Turks. During the past year there has arisen a loose kind of confederation or alliance between the following Chiefs—Bin Sand, Imam Yahyah, Saiyid Mahomed al-Idrisi, Bin Sha’alan and the Sharif of Mecca, with only Ibn Rashid, the Shammar Chief, left outside the coalition. The basis of the alliance is that the allied Chiefs should endeavour to settle their differences by agree ment or arbitration as war between them only weakens all parties as against the common enemy (viz., the Turks), that in the event of any aggression by the Porte upon any one of these Shaikhs all should combine for resistance and mutual help. Ibn Rashid has been left out of the con federation because the present ruler is a boy who cannot be trusted, who is hand in glove with the Turks and has no real authority over his own tribesmen. Whether the Turkish Govern-/ ment is aware of this-combination or not I do not know, but I presume that it is for it has- been at great pains to strengthen Ibn Rashid with arms and treasure within the last six months Before I left Kuwait on on the 3rd February I had heard rumours of large consignments of arms being despatched to Hail for Ibn Rashid from Damascus ; at Riadh Bin Sand told me that he had certain information to the same effect and that they must be intended by the Turkish Government for use against himself; in the north-central desert the news was confirmed ; and finally I was informed in the vicinity of the Hedjaz Railway by Chiefs in a position to know, that some 30,000 rifles (all magazine arms of Mauser or Mannlicher pattern) with bayonets had been railed from Damascus to the station (? Tebuk) on the Hedjaz line for Teimah, that hundreds of boxes (accurate numbers were not obtainable) of ammunition accompanied the arms together with three breech-loading mountain guns (each said to be accompanied, I think, with some 500 shrapnel shell apiece) and that the consignment filled three large Railway waggons ; further that three Europeans (probably European Turks) had taken a motor-car by the same route to Hail at about the same time (I think in Januarv) who might be artillerymen for the mountain guns. In the northern desert it was common report that these arms were intended for Ibn Rashid and that he would probably make a move against Bin Sand within the year, perhaps in the autumn. Bin Sand may have received accurate information later of the quantities and description of arms and of the plans concerted between Ibm Rashid and the Turks, and it is some such knowledge, I think, which prcbably accounted for his uncompromising and somewhat truculent attitude at Kuwait towards the Turkish deputation sent to interview him. It is action of this kind in the face of correspondence of the descrip tion reported* by the Political Agent at Kuwait in April which causes Bin Sand to view any Tuikish proposal with the greatest suspicion. From all that I heard throughout Central Arabia I feel convinced that the old methods of Turkish intrigue, of setting up one Arab Shaikh against another, will no longer have the success of past times in maintaining even that shadowy semblance of Turkish sovereignty over then*, which has hitherto passed unquestioned ; throughout the country I was struck by the contempt with which the Arabs all regarded the Turkish Government, its troops and its civil officials. In attempting to show of what little account in Arabia Turkish authority really is, I am only endeavouring to explain that present Turkish methods invite further disasters. I am aware that His Majesty’s Government are committed to a policy of supporting and maintaining a strong Turkey in Asia and if such a desirable result can be brought about in Arabia so much the better. Unfortunately the Turkish Government appears to have no concep tion of its own weakness in Arabia, nor of the power and strength of the Arab Chiefs, nor does it appear to realize what are the probable consequences likely to ensue should forcible measure s. have to be resorted to in the end. The reports from Kuwait describing the course of the negotia tions with Bin Baud I think sufficiently bear out the above view. The nearest parallel to the Turkish difficulties with Bin Baud which I can draw is our own case in Somaliland, only exaggerated ten times worse. Knowing something of the country, its difficulties in transport, supplies and the like, I would hesitate to suggest that less than two divisions, completely equipped for a long desert war, would be able to re-establish and maintain effectively the former Turkish, occupation of the Hasa province. The Turkish occupation before May 1913 was not effective in anv sense, and only existed because Bin Baud was more occupied elsewhere. He could have carried out his coup of May 1913 at any time in the last five years. So far as my limited knowledge goes the Turkish Government does not appear to be in a position at present to undertake any expeditions in Arabia, nor indeed for many years to come. It must also be remembered that any future campaign against one Shaikh is exceedingly likely to raise the whole of Arabia against the Turks. It may be argued that the Arab tribes have not the necessary cohesion to maintain for any length of time a united front against the Porte.J7&lt;7 To a certain extent this is true, but at the present moment years of falsehood, intrigue and o' A pression on the part of Turkish officials combined with the disastrous loss of Turkish prestig resulting from the Tripoli and Balkan wars have had their effect. Moreover, the Arabs hav now found a leader (Bin Saud) who stands head and shoulders above any other Chief and n whose star all have implicit faith. The other Shaikhs of the Arab alliance refer all kinds o matters to Bin Saud for his advice, more especially those affecting their relations with the Porte. I am convinced that present Turkish methods in Arabia, if persisted in, will end in disaster— Turkey has not the power to coerce Arabia and should matters, with Bin Saud in regard to the Hasa province for instance, come to a head, the probable result will be a combination of all the Arab tribes, the expulsion of Turkish troops and officials from the Hedjaz, Yemen and Asir and the establishment of an independent Arabia with a loose form of confederation of which Bin Saud will be the head, while the holy cities of Mecca and Medina will pass under the absolute rule of the Sharif's family with the consent of Bin Saud. I admit that it is always rash to pro phesy, but I have heard the subject discussed so often in Arabia on these lines and by so many widely separated Chiefs that I cannot avoid the conclusion that the Turkish Government is at present riding for a very bad fall in its present Arabian policy. If the British policy of a strong Turkey is ever to be realized in Asia the Porte must be convinced of its mistake, however unpalatable the process may be. The only solution which I can see is a radical change on the part of the Porte towards a more straight-forward and honest policy with the important Shaikhs. Most of them are quite willing to accept Turkish suzerainty so long as it is one only in name and does not import meddling in their affairs In the case of Bin Saud for instance—all he desires is to be left alone as the ruler of Nejd, which he is now in fact, allowed to collect his own taxes and custom s and to administer the Shara’s Law in the old time-honoured wav. If the Porte would nominate him Mutaserif or Vali of Nejd on these conditions he would be willing to pay it a nominal tribute in a lump sum per annum, and I feel sure would loyally keep his part of the bargain as a Turkish vassal. He has no ambitions to become the Khalif of Arabia, and though his commanding influence will no doubt lead all the other Chiefs more or less during his lifetime, I do not think he would ever embark on a campaign to set himself up as Sultan of all Arabia. It may be said that any solution on the lines suggested above will leave the whole of Arabia open to the exploitation of Foreign Powers, Great and otherwise. At present no Great Power has any real interests in Arabia with the exception of Great Britain, whose interests are confined to the coast-line, though I believe Italy is said to be trying to develope interests in Asir or Yemen. The discussion of this aspect of the subject requires more accurate and more extensive knowledge of recent events than is available to me ; therefore it is with diffidence that I venture to suggest for consideration that with the Porte recognized and supported by His Majesty’s Government as the Suzerain Power in Arabia and provided that the Turkish Government dealt frankly with His Majesty’s Government in matters regarding Arabia no Foreign Power would find it an easy pro position to make good a footing in the country, apart from the fact that along nearly the whole littoral British influence is paramount and of very considerable account even in those portions actually administered at the moment by Turkey. To sum up, the difficulties of the problem in Arabia are :— (а) The utter inability of the Porte to coerce Arabia at present or for many years to come. (б) The strong position in a military and geographical sense with which Nature has endowed the Arabs. (c) The probable coalition of all Arab tribes in the event of attempted coercion. 0 % (d) The desire of His Majesty’s Government to promote a strong Turkey in Asia without detriment to legitimate British interests. The remedies, so far as I can venture to suggest them, seem to be :— (1) The acceptance by the Porte of the de facto independent status of the great Shaikhs whilst maintaining a nominal suzerainty. (2) A franker and more honest attitude by the Porte towards the great Shaikhs. (3) Less suspicion on the part of the Porte towards British policy in Arabia with recog nition of the special position which Great Britain there enjoys, j (4) A frank invitation by the Porte for British co-operation in Arabian affairs.I) Da bed the 26tli June 1914. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, To— Sir Arthur Hirtzel, K.C.B., Secretary, Political Department, India Office London. In the papers you had sent to me and also in others which came to me officially in Kuwait, I have noticed that Saiyid Talib of Basrah seems to be regarded as a ‘ deus ex machina ’ or solver of all local ills in Arabia and Mesopotamia. I cannot understand how he has acquired this position, or rather how he has managed to maintain it in the reports of our own officers. The man is a strong, wilful, utterly unscrupulous character, usually heavily in debt and consequently importunate. He has a dozen or more murders to his credit and holds Basrah in the hollow of his hand by means of a band of armed men who occupy his house there like a fort, issuing thence to execute their master’s behests in the matter of replenishing his exchequer when required. No Vali at Basrah is ever able to carry on his administrative work unless he first agrees to be the willing tool of Saiyid Talib. Bin Baud, Shaikh Mubarak, and Shaikh Khazal all subsidise him with a regular monthly or annual salary solely to protect themselves from continual extravagant demands accompanied by threats. Not one of these Chiefs, however, would trust Saiyid Talib with any negotiation on their own behalf- Saiyid Talib generally induces the Central Government to depute him as their envoy for the solution of their difficulties in Mesopotamia, the local Vali generally being his strongest supporter for the simple reason that unless Saiyid Talib is allowed some of the pickings always available on these occasions, matters usually pome to a deadlock through his instru mentality.

To The Hon*bl 0 Lieut-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.P.,C. .I. : Foreign Secretary t the Government of India in the Foreism and political Department, S I M L A. Sir, The attitude of Bin Saud towards British authorities and British interests as a result of his recent settlement with the Turks is a subject of sufficient Interest to make it unnecessary for me to preface a report thereon with any long preamble setting forth the reasons that have in duced me to submit such a document. 2. I have recently requested the views of the Political Agents of Bahrain and Kuwait on this question and their reports have now reached me. The Political Agent, Bahrain, expresses the opinion that Bin Saud does not consider that the settlement he has made with the Turks is due to our friendly representations. The Amir, he thinks, prides himself on having skilfully played the British off against Turkey and, by causing Turkey to imagine that he was considering the advisability of applying for British protection and guidance, extracted better terms than he would otherwise have obtained. The Political Agent, adds that, if he has guaged correctly Bin Saud f a attitude of mind, the latter will certainly not consider himself beholden to us, nor that he has anything to fear from us. He proceeds w In matters concerning our interests in Al Ilasa, Bin Saud will probably endeavour to steer a safe course between offending us by obstruction, and locallocal susceptibiiitias, (to which I would add, Turkish 3 %$ suscapti'bilities) by appearing to be subservient to our wishes.” 3§9 The Political Agent, KmYait, on the other hand, re lying ohtBfly on tlio opinions delivered by Shaikh Sir ku- barak bin subah, hazards the following indications as to Bin Baud 1 s probable attitude;- ”Bin Baud f s feelings towards the British are un changed. He considers that all questions, concerning foreign traders In, or visitors to, Hajd and A1 Hasa, are to be settled by him alone without reference to Constanti nople* This view would appear to be correct, provided that the requests of such persons are in accordance witn treaty provisions, vide the coiQ ? uni cation from Hat V i T ash a, detailed in Foreign Department telegram No.428-S* dated 10th July last* It is unlikely that Bin Baud attributes his settlement with the Turkish Government to our previous efforts on his behalf, though he may perhaps be aware that the satisfactory terms he has obtained fr® are in part due to our presence in^the field. The arrangement between Bin Baud and Turkey is not likely to be of long duration according to the specific expectations of the former, who is not believed here (i.e. at Kuwait) to have become a pro- Turk, to have been in the least affected^pan-Islamic sent- of* iments/Anwar Pasha or to have ceased to regard the interests of himself and his people as paramount”. 3 . It will be seen that tha Bahrain and Kuwait views differ little, though the latter is slightly more pro- English and anti-Turkish than the former. This is only natural as tinged with that violent hatred of the Turk which is so marked a characteristic of the Shaikh ot Kuwait* My personal opinion Inclines to the vu?. r ait view, and I look upon a reconciliation of Turkish and Najd interests as im possible. Whether it will be more easy to reconcile British and Hajd interests is to my mind unfortunately almost as doubtful. The first rook on which we shall split will be QatarQatar and the Qatar problem appears to me as insistent as^v any we have to deal with for the moment on the Arabian shores of the Gulf. It is not, however, easy to see how leisure can be found ^ust now to deal with tills petty but intricate problem. Fortunately up to the present, no con firmation has been received of the rumour reported under the heading 'Qatar 1 ’ in Bushire summary for the period ending with the 31st August* and it may, therefore, I hope oe di - credited# There 'is no doubt that the death of Shairh Ab dullah bin Jasiin would but add to the difficulties of a solution# 4 . While I have no wish to appear to run counter to the policy declared from home of not adding to Turkey’s diffi culties nor of running the risk of severing Arabia from the Empire, I cannot refrain from pointing out the danger of leaving Bin Gaud and the Shaikh of Qatar entirely to kn-Oxi own devides, a policy which, it seems to me, can only result - and at no distant date - in our being presented with a 'fait accompli' in the annexation of Qatar#. 5. From Qatar to the Trucial Coast is but a stop and, however difficult it may be to keep Bin Baud out of Qatar, it will be doubly difficult to turn him out of Qatar once he is there,and such an undertaking would undoubtedly em bitter our relations with him permanently and would, the. for, be greatly to be regretted. 6 # The present turn of affairs In Europe, so favourable to the Slavs and so destructive of German Influence, to which the young Turk party have recently been looking as their strongest support against the hostile elements which they imagine - not without reason - to threaten them, en courage me to hope that a strong reversion to Anglophile feeling may be the next feature of Turkish policy. It might, therefore, be possible, even at some risk of excit ing Turkish suspicion, to proceed quietly with our settled policy in the Persian Gulf of preserving, so far as is humanly possible, the status quo and therefore the independ ence3S7 j\ ©nee of Qatar. In this policy. It is of cours© needless^ to remark, no hostility to Turkey finds a place. 7 , X therefore make bold to solicit the permission of Government to proceed with the steps advocated in corres pondence ending with my Ho.Of.52 dated 21st July last, and also that the political Agent, Bahrain, may be directed discreetly to pursue the policy of keeping in touch with events in Al Uaaa and Bin Baud’s subordinates in that pro vince. It is even worthy of consideration, I venture to suggest, whether a warning might not be addressed to the Amir implying that Govemmant had seen with much concern that there were discussions in the family of the late Shaikh jasim bin Abdullah bin Than!; that the new Shaikh,Abdullah, the eldest son and lawful heir of the late Shaikh, had, in accordance with universal custom, succeeded to the Shaikh— dom; that his maintenance in that position and the inde pendence of the Shaikh of Qatar were objects of their solicitude and that they hoped that any malcontents of his family who were shortsighted, enough not to perceive that their true interests lay in the enhancement of the dignity and position of the head of their family, would receive no encouragement at the hands of the Amir or from his offic ials. 8 . I hope that a letter on these lines would make the Amir pause and that such a communication, combined with closer relations on our part with the Bin Than! family, would go far to prevent a break in the fst&amp;Mdly relations wi til’Bin Baud which must, for some time - and we may hope permanently - for^the cardinal feature In our policy in that quarter of the Persian Gulf.

However you must remove these suspicions from your mind and by God we are as what we were before. You have said that we are trying to shelter and harbour the Ajaam.

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE HISTORY OF TRIBAL FIGHTS IN THE SHAMI- YAH DESERT. Compiled from Arab reports recorded by A. P. 0. Zobeir. Human nature being what it is and at bottom the same in the Arab as in the European, pugnacious, ambitious and covetous, sometimes loyal but mainly treacherous, occasionally enlightened but always restless, the tribal fights in the Shamiyah desert may be expected to exhibit the same to and fro change and interchange, of alliances as may be found in the history of the relations between the various nations which compose Europe. The redeeming feature of the picture is its comparative bloodlessness. Normally an Arab fight means the taking of an enemy by a surprise raid and the casualties may be in some cases more, in other rather less than those of an American football match. As a rule no prisoners are taken. By that it is not meant that they are killed, ill-omened as the phrase is to us more barbarous Europeans. A man who surrenders gives up his rifle, his horse, and even his clothes except the bare minimum that will save a blush. He is then let go. At a time however the fight is waged without respite and without mercy, and considering the numbers engaged with sanguinary results. The history of these fights has its own intrinsic interest apart from any lesson it may convey as to the possibility of relating the tribes together under the influence of an external power. For those concerned the story has landmarks as great to Bedouins as are Has lings and Waterloo to us. What to Ibn Bashid and Ibn Suwait are Hastings or Waterloo compared with the battle of the Heeds or the Battle of Neba ? We will begin from the time when Sad'un Pasha the Muntafik Chief had been driven back from north of the Euphrates and made the Shamiyah desert his own particular “ dira ” and sphere of influence. The great Muntafik family of Sa’dun—not native to Iraq by origin, for they boast themselves descended from the nobles of Mecca—had built itself a ring of wells and forts extending from Chabashiyah through Chabdah and Shagrah to Abu Ghar and Neba’, a ring of defiance to any attempt of the alien Turk to reduce their proud souls to subjection. The great Sa’dun had once carried his arms to the very walls of Basrah itself. When the disciplined forces of the Turks at length drove this unruly element into the desert, Sa’dun Pasha set up his standard f-here and virtually proclaimed himself king of the Shamiyah. But there was another enemy beside the Turk. These desert forts were both a defence against the inevitable raids of Arab enemies and a base for their own raids. The Beduin has no work and no play. His only work and his only play is the ‘Chazzu’ or raid The fashion was set and sealed by that2 arch raider, the prophet; and though a raid appears to us in the light of mere theft, to the Bedouin it is a legitimate ebullition of spirits, albeit it has rules more binding with them than the rules of International Law with us. To return to Sa’dun, if one man could be regarded as king of the desert more than another, it was Ibn Bashid the great Turkish Amir, His traditional enemy, Ibn Sa’ud, Emir of Najd, was at this time at the lowest ebb of his power. There was no one to contest Ibn Bashid s supremacy. When, therefore, Sa’dun Pasha set up, his standard in the Shamiyah, Ibn Bashid said: “ this cannot be. There cannot be two standards in the desert. ” Whether his or Sa’dun’s actions were influenced by secret encour agement from the Turks, it is difficult to say. At any rate some sixteen years a^o rumours came to the environs of Khamisiyah that Ibn Bashid was prepar ing a great raid on Sa’dun. Sa’dun, therefore, collected his forces^ and made all ready to repel the attack. Besides Atuntafik tribes he had with him the Dhafir, a Bedouin tribe part of which comes orginally from Hijr, north of the Hedjaz who had long ago been driven out and had settled in the district between Kuwait, the Shammar, and the Euphrates. This tribe in its day has been as strong as any in the Shamiyah. In the time of the present Shaihlfls grandfather Sultan Ibn Suwait, or of his brother, JaTan, its easily dissolved elements were united by the personal influence of the Shaikh. Without such personal influence, the temptations to disunion are obvious from the position of the tribe, situated as it normally is between Shammar and Muntafik, and therefore requiring to have influence with both sides. On this occasion a number of the Dhafir were with Sa’dun. Many of them did not enter into the affair at all. The Muntafik and the Dhafir together were ready for all emergencies. But no raid came. Thinking they had been collected by a false alarm, the tribes to a great extent dispersed Sa’dan himself remaining encamped east of Khamisiyak by the reeds. This was Ibn Bashid’s chance. And one day Sa’dun’s followers observed a mys terious cloud of dust on the southern horizon. They sent out the usual scouts who returned to report the coming of a nost of Shammar. It was too late for all Sa’dun’s followers to flee. He himself escaped towards Sakhariyah. The Chammar easily defeated the rest and captured a great booty of horses and camels. This w^as the well-known battle of the Beeds, Al Bariayah. Ibn Bashid encamped for a time at Tell-al-Jibarah and then retired to his own country. Sa’dun Pasha, desirous of avenging his defeat, took advantage of a quarrel between Mubarak Ibn Sabah, Shaikh of Kuwait, and Ibn Bashid to ally him self with Ibn Sabah. A famous merchant of Kuwait, one Yusuf al Ibrahim who had seceded from Mubarak after his act of fratricide (he had killed his two brothers Muhammad and Jara) went over to Ibn Bashid. Mubarak, angry at his defection, employed some of his wealth in the arming of Ibn Sa’ud and readily accepted the invitation of Sa’dun to join forces against the common enemy This time JaTan ibn Suwait, Shaikh of the Dhafir, refused to join the confederacy. The three, Sa’dun, Ibn Sabah and Ibn Sa’ud joined forces in the Najd. But Ibn Bashid was too strong for them and defeated the confederacy with ease in a battle known as £&lt; Al Turafiyah ” from the place where it was fought, this took place the year after the Battle of the Beeds. Prom this, time there appears to be a gap in important events. Though there w r ere continual raids, there was no fight of any importance. Ultimately a quarrel arose between Ibn Sabah and Sa’dun. A section of the Dhafir, called As Sa’id, consistently friendly to Sa’dun captured a number of Ibn Sabah’s camels. Ibn Sabah asked Sa’dun to procure their return. He refused and his refusal led Ibn Sabah to call in aid from Ibn Sa’ud, Ibn Sa’ud was not strong. Two of his tribes, the Mutair and the Ajman, had left him. Hence it was only a meagre force he sent to the help of Ibn Sabah. Such as they w'ere, their forces reached Arkhaimiyah where they w r ere surprised by a mixed body of Dhafir, Zayyad, and Muntafik (including the Budur) under Sa’dun. The Zayyad are not a Muntafik tribe. They belong to a confederacy known as the Beni Muchaim and dwell south and about Samawah. But their friendship with the Dhafir dates back to many years ago and bodies of them continuallyappear in Shamiyah fights There was no real battle on this occasion. forces of Ibn Sabah and Ibn Sa’ud were captured without a struggle hence this ‘ That such events are possible distance and peace that can be is only intelligible to those who know the accomplished by Arabs intent on a raid. The ‘ Hadiyah ’ took place in the spring nine years ago. The following summer Sa’dun went to Baghdad on a visit to the Wali Kadhim Pasha. The Mutair, a Najdi tribe, normally of the following of Ibn Sa’ud heard of this, and judged it a good opportunity for a raid. They came to Ibn Sabah and said “ Now that Sa’dun has gone to Baghdad, there is great chance of booty from the Dhafir and the Mantafik. Let us make a raid upon them. ” Not loath to attempt revenge upon the Dhafir for his late disaster, Ibn Sabah and the Mutair made a considerable raid on the Dhafir at Shagrah and succeed ed in capturing much booty. News of the raid came to Sa’dun at Baghdad and was reported to the Wali. The Wali offered to establish Sa’dun in the position of Emir of the ‘ Iraq tribes and Kuwait if he would overthrow Ibn Sabah. Sa’dun always ambitious, agreed to the project, and set out to collect his forces. Among others he took with him the Dhafir. His forces arrived as far as the Ash gag, between Safwan and Jahrah to the west. Ibn Sabah hearing of their approach, and always in touch with the Dhafir, to the extent even of allowing them to take ‘ Khawa ’ on goods going from Kuwait or paying them a certain sum to forego their ancient practice, got into secret touch with the leasers of this tribe. The mare of a Sa’clun noble, Yusuf-al- Mansur, was killed by them and made a ground of quarrel, with the result that the Dhafir quietly deserted Sa’dun and frustrated the enterprise. Sa’dun gave up his quest, but though still nominally friendly with the Dhafir deter mined to take revenge for their treachery. He wrote secretly to Ibn Kashid- inviting him to co-operate in the punishment of the Dhafir. Were he to agree to this, he was to appear with a following at the Dahanah, the sandy desert in the middle of Shammar territory. Meanwhile, Sa’dun himself would take his following including the Dhafir to the Dahanah. Ibn Kashid fell in with the plan, and the parties met at the Dahanah. Ibn Kashid called the head men of the Dhafir to him and asked them for an explanation of their conduct. There seems to have been no excuse for them, and Ibn Rashid fined them 500 camels. The Dhafir were fairly trapped and had to submit to this imposition. But Sa’dun knew them too well to let Ibn Rashid depart without taking further safeguards against the future conduct of the tribe. Hence it was arranged that five of the Dhafir chiefs should go as hostages with Ibn Rashid. So the parties dispersed. But the Emir’s chiefs, whether of their own free will or under the secret persuation of the captive Dhafir, came to the Emir and represented the harshness of his judgment. Had not the Dhafir already paid their fine of 500 camels ? Was it just further to take captive five of their chiefs ? The Emir was convinced by their arguments and released the hostages two days after he took them. As might be expected, the liberated chiefs hastened to their tribe, intent on revenge, collected their ‘ Khail ’ and ‘ Jaish, ’ and overtook and routed Sa’dun and his following south of Shagrah at A1 Jaraibyat. Sa’dun retired to Khamisiyah while the Dhafir settled in the environs of Zubair at Safwan and Shwebdah. One section of the Dhafir, the Sanid, were at the time with the Shammar, but now came to join Sa’dun at Khamisiyah. Sa’dun and his following with the additions of the Saiid moved to ’ Alowi. This was within easy distance of the Dhafir, who straightway collected their forces, drove Sa’dun out, and returned to their tents. The Turks had chosen this time to send agents to Basrah and to approach Sa’dun on the question of making him Emir of the dirat al Muntafik on the Shatt al Hai, Mubarak Ibn Sabah was then at Muhammerah and had got into touch with Saiyid Talib. It is said that he offered Saiyid Talib 3,000 liras to persuade the Government to seize and imprison Sa’dun Saiyid Talib agreed and represented to the Turkish agents how fatal a policy it would be to make a turbulent spirit like Sa’dun head of a combine of tribes notorious for its unruliness. “ Let me only bring Sa’dun to Basrah” he said “and the rest is easy.”What follows is famous in Arab history. The Turkish agents complied w T ith the infamous proposal of Saiyid Talib. Sa’dun was invited to his house, the well-known bait al Naqib, accepted the invitation without suspicion, and duly appeared. By arrangement of Saiyid Talib, Sa dun was to sleep secure for the night, and was next morning to be invited to a repast while Saiyid Talib was to excuse himself on the plea that he had business in the karani. When Sa’dun had eaten, the Turkish agents sent men in the guise of emissaries of the Wali to invite him to appear before the Wali at the Sarai. The plan was successfully carried out. Sa’dun left bait al Aaqib with the supposed emissa ries of the Wali. When, however, they reached the Sami, they were told that the Wali had gone to Ashar. Sa’dun still unsuspecting ? was taken to Ashar in a bellam and from there straight to a Turkish gunboat where he was informed he was a prisoner. The boat left quietly in the night, and on his arrival at Baghdad Sa’dun w T as taken to Aleppo where he remained a prisoner and ulti mately died. Brom the time of Saiyid Talib’s signal act of duplipity, the great Muntafik chief passes out of history, and his place is taken by his second son, ’Ajaimi. ’Ajaimi was at this time besieged by the Budur in a fort north-west of Nasiriyah, at Maiyah. The Turkish agents secured his release and let him go. He fled to the Ghazzi. But the Shaikh of the Ghazzi, IbmHubiyib, w^as not prepared to take the onus of protecting this restless spirit on his shoulders, and ’Ajaimi was compelled to seek protection elsew T here. Isolated but not despairing, he mounted his dhalul, rode almost alone to Hail, and knelt his camel before the great Emir. “ I claim your protection, O Emir,” he said, “ and your help to avenge me on my enemies, this you owe me as a right. Eor it was while under your protection my father, Sa’dun, w r as set upon and defeated by the Ehafir.” At Hail he stayed for sometime until at length Ibn Kashid consented to help him attack the Dhafir. ’Ajaimi w r ent to call in help of Juwarin. Ibn Bashid on the first occasion he met the enemy^ fled and brought in the help of Dhari Ibn Tawalah and the Aslam. Ibn Bashid return ed to the fight and attacked and defeated a combined body of Dhafir and Budur between Shagrah and Abu Ghar. ’Ajaimi arrived one day late. Ibn Rashid returned to Hail and left the Mutair, whom he had also called to his help as a protection to ’Ajaimi. This was in the spring of 19 . Next winter the Dhafir and the Budur returned from their summer quarters north and wnst of Nasiriyah. ’Ajaimi was still able to call in the Mutair, but fearing he was not strong enough to repel attacks, he appealed to the Muntafik sympathies of sections of the Bani Malik and drew r a body of them to his side. The opposing forces met somewhere between Shagrah and Arkbaimiyah. But before they met, the Budur had entered into secret negotiations wdth the Bani Malik, for the Budur too are a Muntafik tribe. The Bani Malik either fled or offered only a weak resistance, with the result that ’Ajaimi and the Mutair were routed, and their effects and animals were captured. ’Ajaimi fled with his scattered forces to Safwan, where he remained until the summer. He then removed to Ghabashiyah, where he perpetrated a ruthless act of robbery upon an unoffending relation. His father’s cousin, Mazyad came to settle w r ith him and deposited in a build ing known as “ Mazyad’s treasury ” the sum of 60,000 liras, ’Ajaimi appro priated the whole vast sum and moved to the Shatt-al-Hai. Another winter arrived and the Dhafir as usual began to move south east towards their w^ell-known settling places, Diraisiyah, Dafinah, Abu Ghar and Sulaibiyah. Mazyad who had been looking about him for opportunities of revenge went to the Dhafir and appealed to them for help. Meanwhile, ’Ajaimi too crossed the Euphrates with the idea of revenging himself for his late defeat. Alw 7 ays generous with his money, whatever its source, with the sum he w as able with the sum robbed from Mazyad to attract a band of 400 mercenaries from various directions. His force consisted of some Mutair, some Shammar, some Bani Malik and other miscellaneous mercenaries. With these he invaded the Dhafir district and brought up against the Dhafir and the Budur at Naba. Then ensued one of the bloodiest fights in the history of tribal warfare in the Shamiyah desert. The Dhafir and Bud ur infficted a severe defeat on Ajaimi and his following*t killed ' 6 t0 kiUed n&lt;!arly 300 ° f them - theil ' own losses be “S The following day Mazyad, overjoyed at the result, mounted his hor«e and galloped and curvetted before the victorious Arabs. This incongruous act wr!tri h sA S r a i? Ur a 1 'l th i e T 80f Nemesis ’ and the unfortunate old man—he was then 80 fell and broke his neck. ’Ajaimi was now at the end of his resources and was reduced to making peace with es enennes. Hence he invited Humud ibn Suwait, Chief of the afir, to ]oin up with him near Chahdah. Humud consented and settled alongside of him with some fifty tents. The rest of the Dhafir repudiated his overtures Whether Ajaimi originally meditated treachery or was driven to what he did by the unfriendliness of the rest of the Dhafir, it is difficult to sav. At any rate he quietly sent word to the Mutair, acquainting them with this snlen- did opportunity of revenge. ^ The Mutair arrived, all out for a raid. Humud ibn buwait protested to ’Ajaimi against this gross act of treachery, and ’Aiaimi repenting attempted to dissuade the Mutair, but the Mutair were inexorable. They had come for a raid or a fight at ’Aj Ami’s express invitation and were determined to carry it out ’Ajaimi had to submit to his own arrangement, and reverted to his original intention in callino 1 up the Mutair—“ Q alab a ^ a Suwait,” as the Arabs say, that it turned round agamst him. ^ Humud and his 50 tents fell an easy prey to the Mutair and this affair is since known as the Qalbah. A speedy revenge overtook’Ajaimi. News of the event soon reached the Jiudur, ancient friends of the Dhafir and their refuge in time of trouble And two months after the Qalbah the Dhafir and the Budur defeated ’Aiaimi at Shagrah. As the fiercest of Arab fights cannot permanently weaken a tribe in- asmuchas prisoners are normally released and live to fight again another day there was no hope that ’Ajaimi was put out of court for good and all. So little depressed was he by his late defeat that not more than two months later he engineered a _ raid by Ibn Rashid on the ’Arail Section of the Dhafir at Tugayyid, while he himself and the Mutair defeated the Suwait Section at A1 Qasair. Meanwhile, greater events than any tribal dissension were loomnm over Arabia Turkey M declared war on Great Britain, and the Turks who were joined by ’Ajaimi with 250 sowars were gradually driven from Fao and Basrah. But other events, not of such significance to the world at large, though the greater purport to the Jazirat al Arab, began to make their appearance events which introduce us to elements and dissensions not within the scope of this account, which concerns chiefly the Shamiyah desert. But it will be useful to describe one great struggle so as to explain certain elements which can never be altogether out of relation with the Shamiyah. This is a famous fight between Ibn Sa’ud and Ibn Rashid. The events which led up to it are somewhat as follows Ibn Sa’ud delivered an ultimatum to the Mutair, who are really one of his own tribes, though they had of late joined Ibn Rashid or ’Ajaimi indifferently when they offered occasions for plunder. He demand ed their return to his suzerainty on pain of permanent hostility. The Mutair were willing to return to their old allegiance, and celebrated their decision by pilfering a caravan of thousand camels which was on its way from Zubair to the followers of Ibn Taw r alah, Chief of the Aslam Section of the Shammar. They were then ready to return to their own country and join forces with Ibn Sa’ud. At the beginning of their war with Great Britain, the Turks had tried to persuade Ibn Rashid to attack Ibn Sa’ud in force. Ibn Rashid nothing loath, collected his forces ; meanwhile the Turks changed their minds. It occurred to them that if they could persuade Ibn Rashid to keep them in the ‘ Iraq and Ibn Saud to attack Kuwait, they would at the same time completely overawe the Arabs of the Iraq and overthrow a great stronghold of British influ ence. It was accordingly decided to call upon the notorious Saiyid Talib to proceed on a mission to Bin Saud to induce him to co-operate. At that moment Saiyid Talib was occupied in offering us his services on extravagant terms and while he was still hesitating to abate his demands, the sudden declaration of war preeepitated mutters and placed him in a dangerous situation from which the6 mission to Bin Sa’ud offered him a providential means of escape. On reaching Ibn Sa’ud he placed himself in communication with the British authorities and was allowed at his own suggestion to proceed to India via Kuweit. Meanwhile, when the possibility of Turkey’s entry into the war had become likely His Majesty’s Grovemment had decided to send an emissary to, Ibn Sa’ud in our own interests in the person of Captain AV. H I. Shakespear, formerly Political Agent at Kuweit, who was then in England. By the time he had reached the Persian Gulf, war had already been declared, but it was none the less desired to maintain touch with Ibn Sa’ud and if possible to get him to move up towards ’ Iraq in our interests. Captain Shakespear accord- ingly proceeded from Kuweit on this mission and found Ibn Sa’ud with a large force moving towards the Shammar country to attack Ibn Rashid, and very confident of success. His force included contingent of the Ajman tribe, a redoubtable though at the same time disreputable tribe from the A1 Hassa district who had long been estranged from their overlord but were still under his suzerainty and obeyed the order for a general union of forces. The Mutair too were on their way to join and in the circumstances, it was believed in the desert that Ibn Sa’ud was bound to defeat his traditional enemy for, in addition to the large numbers of his fighting men, he had with him three or four Turkish mountain guns with trained gunners. But there is one factor in any Arab fight which is outside prophecy and that is treachery. It is believed that there could have been no doubt as to the result, had it not been (according to the tales of the Bedouin) for the treachery of the Ajman. They are said to have turned upon their own side at a critical stage of the conflict, killed large numbers, confused the rest, and made off with a large booty of camels. Adherents of either side naturally give very different versions of what occurred, but there is no doubt that while both parties suffered severely from the shock of the encounter and from the depradations of the Ajman and other marauders after it, Ibn Sa’ud was the hardest hit and was for the time crippled. It was in the course of this action that Captain Shakespear, who insisted on being present as an interested spectator, though pressed by his friend and host to remain at a distance, met his lamented and untimely end. No two accounts give the some version of the precise circumstances of his death, and until the clouds of war have passed over and reliable sources from both sides can be reached under conditions of peace, it is hardly possible that they can be ascertained with certainty. But to return to the fight. The Mutair were some distance away when the fight began. AVhen they drew near and heard the sound of shots, they worked round the fight for south and finally came up right behind the Sham- mar to where they had left their camels. These they seized and made of with and secured large booty. They then returned to their own country and to the defeated Ibn Sa’ud said : “AVhy did you fly ? See, we have captured the very dhulul of Ibn Rashid himself. ” As indeed they had. But nothing could compensate for the reversal of fortune created by the treachery of the Ajman, And to this day Ibn Sa’ud cherishes the hope of wiping them out to a man. Only their repute as fighting men—and it is often said there are no Arabs their equals—has preserved them from extinction. For they have many enemies and no friends. Arabs themselves say that of Bedouin the stoutest fighters are the Ajman, and of the Muntafik the Budur. The Shammar too are redoubtable, as are the Zayyad, who occasionally appear to the help of the Dhafir. Less reputable fighters, though famous raiders, are the Mutair and the Dhafir. There is no tribe to touch the Dhafir for what seems to us mere thieving, though it is dignified by the Prophet under the name of a raid. It will be noticed in this brief history of tribal dissensions that the Budur continually saved the Dhafir from disaster. And indeed the Dhafir owe everything to the Budur. Certain tribes like the Azairij are distinguished fighters on their own ground but helpless for a field. It is not so with the Budur. At home or abroad they display the same consistency of valour, and they have a quality almost peculiar to them the quality of always rallying to the standard of their head chief in the face of a common enemy, notwithstand ing their internal quarrelsomeness and a certain reputation for ruffianism. It %7 is different with an another similar tribe, the Juwarin, who certainly at the present time find no chief round whom they will readily rally at need. So wdth the Zayyad, who belong to a western confederation known as the Bani Huchaim. Brave enough as fighters, they are split up into so many ill-united sections that one cannot concieve them rallying to one standard. Most of the Shamiyah tribes have taken part on one or other of the many raids and fights xecoided in this history, Dhafir, Budur, Juwarin, Ghazzi, Zayyad. But the protagonists are the Dhafir and the Budur. It is a curious alliance, Bedouin and camel with Muntafik and donkey tribe, originating in a blood feud against a common enemy ’Ajaimi. TJniil the latter is eliminated from Shamiyah by inducement or force, he will remain, though of no military importance, a chronic source of intrigue and centre of unrest and as such a nuisance to us and a valuable asset to 'the hurks. So much so that Ibn Bashid is said to resent ’Ajaimis competition for their favours and at this moment their relations are definitely strained. It may be too that it was because they realised the incompatibility of these two ele ments^ that the Turks after inviting Ibn Bashid to sit on our flank in the Shamiyah desert finally asked him to return to Hail and await a more favour able opportunity for a second visit to the ’Iraq. Bor ’Ajaimi had gradually won the powerful Zayyad tribe to his side, and the Zayyad cannot tolerate the Shammar at any price. It says much for ’Ajaimi’s ascendency that thousrh Ibn Bashid has departed, the elements he has left behind with us are in closer touch with ’Ajaimi then they are with their ancient overlord. Even Dhari ibn Tuwalah, who should know ’Ajaimi seeing that he was with him only a year ago, reluctantly pays a tribute to’Ajaimi’s perso nality. ’Ajaimi is a ‘ nafar,’ as the Arabs say of him, an individual, a man who counts.

I thank you very much on behalf of Army Commander and myself for your kind congratulation on the success of this Force and the conquest of Baghdad. Your letter to His Excellency the Viceroy is being forwarded to its destination, I feel sure that the news of the conquest of Baghdad must have been a great source of belief and rejoicing to yours&amp;lf and all the Arab leaders who are in alliance with the British Government and are supporting the common case of the Arab nation. The proclamation which was issued by the Commander of the British Forces on our occupation of Baghdad of which you will have received a copy convincing you of the loyal policy which the British Government is following in the support of the Arab case and it will give you fresh stimulation to direct your utmost efforts to complete the expulsion of the Turks root and branch from Arabia. You may rest assured that I will do my best to be-friend the Najidis whom I may meet within Baghdad. I am in frequent communication with Shaikh Saiyid Mahmud Sakri A1 Allusi. He begs me to send you his compliments and assure you oi nis welfare. As regards Bin Kadhal your letter tcjme will reach in due course. Meanwhile his Agent has been to see me and I am endeavouring to get in touch with him. In the matter of the leakage of merchandise from Kuwait it is not hidden from me that the evil has been very serious in the past but on the one hand Shaikh Salim is now making special efforts to put down smuggling and on the other hand all possible strict ness is required from Your Excellency to ensure that the smuggling isis not assisted by dependents of yours at distant points in your territory. I sure that you are doing your utmost to guard against this. You will I hope understand that during this advance the burden of my'daily work has been very heavy and it has been impossible for me to do all I wish in the writing of letters and so you will pardon my silence on this account.

Moreover I see from the original Aden report that passage of money referred to is said to have occurred 'before 1 the outbreak of hostilities in the Hejaz'. If that is the case the report has no practical bearing.on Ibn Baud's attitude since his public announcement.of his adherence to us in November Inst. It is possible however that report may refer to mission reported, in my telegram No.766 dated January 31st to Bureau address!

On my writing to him to beware of Abdulla Yemani he replied proposing to send me a representative to give filler information. I + seems clear from comparison of dales that Abdulla Yemani and party never came in contact with Ibn baud himselx as they had passed through Qasim before the latter-reached Biadh.If as is quite possible a consignment of Turkish notes and. some thousand liras got through it must have been due to slackness or connivance of Ibn Baud retainers in Qasim on whose complete loyalty he cannot depend. In above connection it will be realised from what follows that Ibn Baud has a very difficult task in present condition to keep his tribes together. Some 1' ' ■ —^ Some weeks ago he sent in urgently to Bahrain asking us to send him out a Doctor as there was a suspicious Epidemic prevai ing in Riyadh. No British Doctor being available (in force) Americd ^n Doctor Harrison to whom I have confidence having offered to go I agreed to his doing so. He has now returned and following is summary of his news:- . * Ibn Saud appeared quite satisfied with what we have done for him and had only praises for us bpt he is greatly hampered and preoccupied by the difficult task of making his tribes pull together and he thinks we do not fully realise this.They resent prolonged stress of war and the severe restrictions placed upon their trade and consequently public feeling in Nejd is not really for us;and. though oaring to loyal attitude of Ibn Saud there is no overt talk against us yet there is no word spoken in our- favour, incidentally our failure (for obvious reasons) since our occupation of Baghdad to open pilgrimage routes and allow free trade is not understood and has caused disappointment and adverse comment. Another difficulty for Ibn Saud is that the money lavished on tribes by the Sheriff form our handsome subsidising has righted market for Ibn Saud who cannot compete and. finds it difficult to keep his chiefs contented. Ibn Saudis potential value from military point' of view has never been over estimated here and he himself has always maintainec that unless assisted with artillery and. personnel he was not in a position to attempt to capture Hail. In January last I think we were all agreed that it would have been mistaken policy to push him into any project beyond his powers in which he might have suffered disaster; and though it is true tint we have presented him with three machine guns and two mountain guns yet we were unable to give him any personnel from here and. without ±% they are of doubtful use. in short it is clear that if we require to make more military use of him we must really approach suojecu seriously and lend him an Egyptian or Indian battery with personate to't,'; ‘,tr\ ri'ih, : mm mfoMk to run it for him. I myself doubt whether game would he worth the candle hut Egypt may have other views. In aiy case non ever I think it would, he for the common good if we were now to send a mission to him consisting of a Political Ctiicer from here and one from Egypt in whose opinioil Sheriff would-have confidence together with a Military staff officer preferably a gunner who could see the country and make proposals in accordance with practical possibilities. Short of giving him such material assistance and personnel we may depend on his loyalty doing his best on the allowance that we make h* ' to keep his tribes together and. to harass and seduce Ibn X • Rashid's adherents as opportunity offers but I d_o not think we can expect much more.

In the present world war the Arab is only indirectly con cerned, but he has been forced to take sides and to show by the weight of his resources whether he wishes one Euro pean Power or another to be the paramount influence in his part of the world. Both England and Germany have their champion in the interior of Arabia, and the two Powers have been able to make use of the feud which has for so long existed between the house of Ibn Rashid, backed by the powerful and numerous Shammar tribe, having its capital at Hail, and the house of Ibn Saoud, backed by the rest of the Nejdi tribes,.and having its capital at Riadh. It was comparatively' easy for the Turks, under German guidance, to win Ibn Rashid to their side, if only for the reason that Ibn Saoud seemed to be leaning towards the British. They could promise him unlimited supplies by way of Damascus, and, in the early days of the war, by way of Baghdad and Mesopotamia. Now, however, that Baghdad and Busreh have come under British control, Ibn Rashid can receive little or nothing from Mesopotamia, and Damascus remains his only certain source. Ibn Saoud, on the other hand, is absolutely dependent on the ports of the Persian Gulf; and, indeed, since his cap ture of the province of El-Hasa from the Turks, in 1912, his own territory is now washed by the waters of the Persian Gulf. Germany has spared no effort to keep the friendship of Ibn Rashid, sending him with liberal hand both money and munitions. She has also endeavoured to wean Ibn Saoud away^from England, but her intrigues in this direc tion have met with no success. On the contrary, some of Ibn Rashid’s best men are leaving him and coming over to England’s side, a sure indication on their part that they believe that England will win this war. There is no doubt that in proportion to the vigour with which the Mesopota mian and Egyptian campaigns are prosecuted, will it be come increasingly difficult for Ibn Rashid to get any benefit out of his alliance with Turkey and Germany. The man of strongest personality in Arabia to-day is Abd-el-Aziz Ibn Saoud ; and his loyalty to the British, in a country where self-interest is the first instinct, is un doubtedly equal to considerable strain. He is a man who has only of recent years come into prominence, and prior to 1897 was an emir without a dominion, for Ibn Rashid held his capital, Riadh. But in that year Mohammed Ibn Rashid died, and Ibn Saoud, backed up by Sheikh Mubarek of Kuweit, who furnished him with fourscore camels and riders, seized Riadh suddenly one night, com pletely overwhelming its defenders. From that time Ibn Saoud’s star has been in the ascendant, since in force of character he far surpasses the successor of Mohammed Ibn Rashid ; and to-day he is the strongest man in Arabia and the man of the hour. It is now nearly three years since I first met Abd-el-Aziz Ibn Saoud. He was at that time in camp some twenty miles west of Kuweit, near a small town called Jahreh, and had come up from El-Hasa, which he had conquered from the Turks some two years previously. He wanted to discuss the then burning question of British and Turkish relations with Central and Eastern Arabia. He could not be per suaded to accept Kuweit’s hospitality, most probably fear ing Turkish treachery ; for there were several Turkish agents in the town at that time, and Ibn Saoud’s head was a tempt ing prize. In his own camp, however, he was absolute master, and could protect himself. In response to an invitation from the Sheikh, I went out to his camp to treat him and some of his people professionally. Having come up from malaria-stricken Hasa, many of Ibn Saoud’s men were down with fever, and needed the benefits of modern medicine. His camp was a fine sight, and the two hundred odd glistening white tents made a brave show in the strong sunlight of a May morning. I was rather sur prised to find white tents, but “ the black tents of Kedar ’ are going out of fashion among the aristocracy, and the “ house of hair,” the true Arab tent, is now the dwelling of the Bedouin only. As a matter of fact, the true Arab tent has been much overrated by travellers ; for when it is a little bit old, it leaks like a sieve in a shower of rain. 31 The Sheikh’s marquee was at the end of a long avenue of tents pitched much truer to line than one expects in this part of the world, where no one has a straight eye. On my arrival I was at once conducted into the presence of Ibn Saoud. He rose to welcome me as I entered, and pointed me to the seat of honour beside him. The tent was fur nished in the typical desert style. Persian carpets covered the floor, and, for pillows, camel saddles overlaid with sheep skins were ranged along the sides of the tent. A pleasing dash of colour was added by the gaudy camel housings which hung from the tent poles ; but the air of comfort was toned down by rows of exceedingly good rifles which were hung up ready for instant use. The minute Ibn Saoud stood up, I was struck with the personality of the man. In stature he is a good six feet, and with his broad, powerful shoulders presents a truly athletic figure, clean cut and symmetrically developed. He has all the graces of a polished Arabian nobleman, and, in addition, his open countenance invites confidence. As he talks, you feel that he is sincere; there is a ring of truth in all he says. His frequent gestures accentuate the beauty of his shapely hands. Our conversation touched upon many subjects, but perhaps the following instance shows up the man’s character in all its desert ruggedness. We were talk ing of the opening up of Central Arabia to the white men. He said : “ They will be welcome, but on one condition only, that they do not interfere in religious matters. In Central* Arabia, we are not only one religion, we are all one sect. In many parts of the Mohammedan world you have all the principal sects living together—Hanifi, Maliki, Shafi, Hanbali. In Central Arabia we ai'e all Hanbalis, and there is absolute harmony in consequence. Introduce new faiths, and there will be an end of peace.” (The Sheikh’s idea of peace, when one considers the endless raiding and petty fighting for which the Arab is famous, is obviously relative.) “Ours is the true religion,” he went on, “but we must follow the teachings of the prophet Mohammed, on whom be prayers and peace. Only recently people have been inviting me to join my interests with theirs because they are Moslems.” (The Sheikh mentioned no names, but was no doubt referring to the Turks who had been using the cry of Pan-Islam in order to induce him to come into their political schemes.) “But are these people Moslems? They have thrown aside all of the Prophet’s ordinances, they neither pray nor fast nor give alms nor make the pil grimage. They murder, they oppress, they lie, they steal. They have forsaken the old religion, they are infidels. I will have nothing to do with such people.” ‘ ‘ Listen ! ” he cried, and he sat up straighter, and his eyes glistened. “I will tell you a story. By the orders of the angel Gabriel, a large idol was set up just outside the gates of Paradise. Presently a believer came along and was about to pass into Paradise when the idol’s attendant stopped him and said : ‘ You must offer a beast to the idol.’ ‘I cannot,’ replied the believer, ‘ for I do not respect idols. Allah has no partners; He is One.’ ‘ Well, then,’ said the attendant, ‘you must offer a fowl.’ The believer still re fused. ‘In any case,’ the attendant went on, ‘you must at least offer a fly.’ This time the believer yielded, and at once came the order from Gabriel, ‘ Away with him to Jehannum.’ After a while another believer came along, and again the attendant demanded : ‘ You must sacrifice a beast to the idol before you enter Paradise.’ ‘Never,’ said the believer, ‘ I believe in Allah ; He has no partners.’ ‘ Then,' tempted the attendant, ‘ if you cannot afford a beast you must offer a fowl.’ ‘No,’ persisted the believer, ‘I offer no fowls to idols.’ ‘I really cannot let you pass unless you offer at least a fly to the idol,’ the attendant maintained. But the believer was unshaken. ‘ Beast, fowl, or fly, it is all the same to me; I make no reverence to stone images. ’ This time came the order from Gabriel, ‘ He is a true believer; admit him to Paradise.’ And,” added Ibn Saoud, “ I will follow my Prophet absolutely. . Not even a fly will I offer to any other religion.” It was on November 19 of last year that Ibn Saoud next visited this part of the country. The circumstances were markedly different. On the former occasion the vague claims of Turkey to Kuweit were a subject of discussion, and the Crescent and Star still flew from Mubarek’s flag staff. At that time the decision of this question was of momentous importance to Ibn Saoud. England and himself regarded one another as unknown quantities, and the Turk was standing by, waiting to see how the sum would work out. Then Ibn Saoud would not trust himself in Kuweit, RSE WHISKY.

In the Name of God the Most Merciful and Compassionate. After offering salams and respects,the cause of writing this letter is to as^f about your welfare,and if you ask about us we are, thanks to God,quite well,and true to the ties of friendship and' love. I submit this letter- of mine with our messenger ’Abbas Al Falaii who went to Syria to settle private matters with some people from Najd at Syria,and also with the Anazah. We are sending this man in order to place before you the details of the condition of the Turkish Government with her subjects in Svria,an- what he saw with his own eyes. As regards what the friend of all,Col.Hamilton, the Consul of the Great Government at Kuwait,has said respecting the trade between the People of Naid and those of Kuwait,and the sending of imported goods to the enemies,! mean to Hail,Medinah and Syria,it cannot logically be admitted that we should give help and assistance in money or goods. It is not hidden from Your Excellency that I have written to you on the matter and that I was aware of what was happening before it took place,and requested you to mark this thing specially,and undoubtedly you still remember. I have taken the necessary precautions that lead to preventing this thing which causes harm to both sides. I also beg to inform you respecting Al Sharif Muhammad Al Hajury who came from ' edinah,apart from the letters we have previously KBEgiinsd sent to you: he went to Taman,and it happened that I was at Al Hasa at the time. We We received aletter from him which you will find enclosed. I sought information from the people who know something about those of Taman,they say he has a tribe and authority in their country. I send the letter to you; perhaps the Great Govt, has views con cerning Al Taman. This man is sure to be under Al Idrisi if he is undnr anyone; He will be of your party.

A/C. le have arrived in your country and we wish to see you and to have a verbal conference with you referring to the interests of Islam and the Muslims. It is not hidden from you that we came to you having heard that you have enHred info an agreement with the British Government with a view to preserve the land of the Moslems, bih Saiyid Muhammad/Ali Idrisi of Tahama,Yamaii has also agreed with them. They are in the sea and he on the land and thus the Turks will be completely beaten and through the Germans Taman and other places have gone out of their hands. Please communicate with me through Saiyid ’ uhannad bin Ali al Idrisi who is at Sabya and Shaikh ’Abas at flajour. Yahya is at Thawab near our town Ilajur; he (i.e. the Idrisi ?) is following him and defending the Italians (or possesses Italians guns). My town is distant six hours journey and the district of Hajur is seen from the mountains of the town of A1 Zayud. Three years ago that we cane out of Ilajur and the ! ali Mahmud Nadim came to us and he did (not ?) succeed in making peace between me and Yahya at Thawab. Everybody knows my influence in all the mountains of al Zayud from Ta’aza to Sa’dah,Hashid and Bakil. If the matters progress favourably,let me know what is necessary and 1 will refer to Imam Yahya. He has the Arab chiefs under him and we shall explain the matters to them. Then the conditions will improve and Imam Yahya will help. No Arab likes to have his land and town ruined and peop 1 e killed. I guarantee this to you,to the satisfaction of God and His Prophet and for the welfare of Islam,according to what you expect from us andwe rely upon God and you.

No.7115,dated October in which the inability or disinclination of 2£—10-1917 Shaikh of Koweit to prevent a largo caravan leaving Koweit was reported. That particular caravan may have been bona fide but since tbon we have continued to receive evidence of large quantities of supplies from Koweit reaching enemy destinations. Shaikh Salim when remonstrated v/ith simply denies statements while averring that nothing can leave the town without his knowledge. At present there is practically no steamer traffic to Koweit and. the port receives its supplies almost entirely by dhow from other ports, so that control from the source (i.e. Bombay and Karachi) is not possible. Neither do we desire in view of the urgency of the food question to deprive ■-esopotamia of a conveniently situated additional clearing station for foodstuffs. But it is becoming urgently necessary a-o to supervise and re gister all export as to ensure its not passing to enemy destinations. In order to do this, no other course seems left to us but to place troops at Koweit to for- blockade cordon round the town and regulate export under the supervision of the Political Officer, with such assistance as may be •iMf necessary.

Was given distinguished reception by Turki bin Saud and by Governor and public of oown. Turki is posted here by Ameer to watch Ibn Rashid, counter his intrigues in Kasim, control confederation of tribes and prevent anyone of them such as the Mtair from raiding tribes which are sending quotas to assist Shereef. He is also directed to try by diplomacy to seduce Shammar from Ibn Rashid. Ibn Rashid is reported in Medina with Fahhfi Pasha and Ibn Lailah at Damascus with Jemal pasha. Both are endeavouring to squeeze money and arms from Turks. Turki Bin Saud says it is notp: possible capture Kail by coup de mam, weak though Ibn Rashid is, because one suburb of Hail has bee$ strongly fortified and garrisoned by Turks Its reduction would take time and require seige material. AS regards provisionment of Hail and Medina, Turki says firiji action is being taken to prevent leakage from Kasim and now most is being taken direct from Iraq and Koweit by Aslam Shammar and tribe of Ibn Hadhdhal. He denies that letter which he gave to Shammar who descended on Koweit with large caravan in latter part September was a pass for Musabileh. He meant it only to be a safe conduct to few Shammar passing through his tribes. I venture to suggest that special Blockade officer with small establishment should withoak the formal assent of Shaikh be at once stationed at Koweio to scrutinize all passes and make certain that the destination of goo ds is not to enemy countries I am leaving for Rig, dh today and will wire through Bahrein after seeing Aneer.

Chief Political Officer, Baghdad. 7TTTTTTT Your telegram No•3484. Firstly Bin 3a f ud considers that his throY/ing in his lot Y;lth us has had great effect throughout Arabia including on the Sharif/of Mecca; he has largely neutralised ibn Rashid whose peace overtures he rejected saying that he must first make his peace with British; he has maintained friendly relations with the Sharif of Mecca. Secondly. He was apparently quite satisfied with what we had done for him and had nothing hut praise for us • He mentioned no wants except that he Yras very anxious for a merchant vessel to call at one of his ports twice monthly as hardship was being caused by scarcity of roods. He thinks Y/e did not make sufficient capital out of capture of Baghdad in one respect: if ytq could have put on even one rotten old steamer for passenger traffic effect on Arab mind Y/ould have been great. ThirdlyThirdly. No uaeful information. Harrison says that Bin Sa’ud is hampered and ore- ocouried by the difficult .job of making bis various tribes pull togetherj Heal feeling in 'iajd is not for us: though there is no sign of talk against us owing to attitude of Bin 3a’ud 7 ^et there is no word spoken in our favour. The prices paid by the Sharif to tribes have rather spoilt the market. From my own observation hero and at Qatif I can bear witness to moral value of opening the Tigris route even to limited extent and pilgrimage to Karbala and f iajaf ,though I see it may not be feasible for military reasons.

The object of writing this cordial letter is to enquire after your health and to say that you will be glad to hear that i am well; and that nothing of importance has occurred which is worthy of mention. I have received your letters and have noted all you wrote in them. I am sending herein a wireless message for the friend of all Colonel Hamilton with the request that you will kindly transmit to him, and it is as follows:- His onour Colonel Hamilton, His iajesty's Political Agent, Kuwait. In your telegraphic message, which I received, you mentioned the coming of ’Abdul 'Aziz Al Hasan to me and requests me to be on good terms with His Exeellency my brother Shaikh Salim Al iiubarak; no doubt it is.not hidden from your honour that we are brothers, and it is of course a binding duty on us that we should be on good terms, and tile re is no difference between me and His Excellency; even if he wore to ask me for a number of my subjects or were to commit a big mistake, I would not hesitate to forgive the latter, and comply with the former accordingly. But as regards the question of the Ajraan^ and their stay in the vicinity of Kuwait, it will not be possible for him to obtain my consent to same. It is therefore a question which is impossible, and I have informed you of the fact. I hope you will unceasingly write to me your cordial letter This is what had to be said and may you be preserved.
