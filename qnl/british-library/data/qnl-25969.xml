In some Instances : already letters and telegrams have been audresseo directly by the Secretary General to the Government of India in the External Affairs Departioent, although, on other occasions, telegrams and correspond- nn, ce + ^ ur &gt; despatching. We are, however, npw telling the Secretariat that in lliture all communica- tions should be addressed direct to the Govern lent of Inula, and not to this Office. Similarly, we suggest that comiunications from the Government of India to the secretariat should be sent direct. No doubt you will agree that this is the correct procedure to adopt. Ji. „ +( i ie ^sult will, of course, be that the Secretary of State wiil not now become automatically aware, as they arise, of points which may concern him. v/e shall con- ^ . receive, tiirough the good offices of the Foreign 01lice, copies of all United Nations papers generally issued, / H. l/eightman, hsq., G.I.E. Secre ^tw y De?hi! ie Govem,nent of Mia (Egtegn^l Affairsissued, but we shall not receive copies of any corx*es- pondence specifically passing between the United nations Secretariat and the Government of India - to take an example, we shall not be awai'e of invitations to individuals or to the Government of India to serve on Commissions or Conferences, nor the date and place of their convening. Nor should we receive, under these arrangements, copies of communications from the Government of India to the Secretariat, or of briefs g iven to Indian delegates to United Nations Assemblies, ouncil Meetings, or Conferences. As this is an entirely new problem, which did not arise during the days of the League of Nations, the Secretary of State would like to have the views of the Government of India as to the best method by which he can be kept infomed of matters with which he is concerned. In such matters, his functien is already somewhat similar to that of the Secretary of State for the Dominions. He will continue to act as the link between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government as members of the Commonwealth, and must be ready to bring to the notice of either Government at a sufficiently early stage tire views or proposals of the one party which may affect or cause difficulty to the other. (For example, if His Majesty’s Government should contemplate proposing certain drastic reforms with regard to narcotics which the Government of India could not in practice apply, it would be the Secretary of State's duty to bring the Govemaent of India's difficulties to the Notice of His lajesty's Government. 4. Among the subjects which may be raised in a United Nations Organisation context there are many, especially in /■ in the fields of defence axiu external affairs, in relation to which the Government of Inaia’s policy and activities are franed in close concert wlh the Secretary of Stiite, and on which therefore it is evidently necessaiy that the Secretary of ' tate should be fully i-nd continuously inforaed. So far as concerns other subjects with respect to which the India Office has in practice a less close concern, it is always possible that something primarily related thereto say impinge in scene way on a topic in which the Secretary of State is more directly interested, and .‘igain there are likely to be many occasions wiien it v/ill be of advantage to India tnat the India Office may be awfire of what is passing between India ana the United Nations Organisation in or.ier to be able to put at the service of the Government of Inaia its knowledge of connected matters arising in other quarters, anu to see that Indium interests are taken into account in any consideration by Kis Majesty's Government of related questions. For these reasons, and since it may be almost prohibitive without undue labour and delay to extract from a mass of papers and correspondence the points which are or may be of interest to the India Office, you may possibly find it most convenient to make some arrangement whih will ■secure that we should receive a copy of all ceumunica tions passing between the 1 inited Nations Organisation ana the Government of India and of any instructions given to the Government of India representatives or delegations. b. It has occurred to us that it night be convenient, once the Organisation is housed in the United States, for the Government of India, if they contemplate an arrangement by which papers from the United Nations Organisation Headquartorssare received by a permanent Government /Government of Inula representative in tlie United States of America, to secure that the latter should transmit one copy to this Office at tlie same tin-'- s he sends the :i to tile Government of Inuia. This, however, would cover only communications from tire Secretariat to India. For comiunications the other way ana for briefs we should presumably have to look to the CuveTOr* nent of India. therefore, if you will &gt;-ive 6. e sirall be rrateful, euux-eiui-e, j.i wxxj. ,JE' consideration to this matter.and perhaps aduress Vie Secretary of state ofllcially as early as possible, since the United Nations Organisation Secretariat is already in the process of moving to tis interim Headquarters in the Uilted States of America. 7. Turning to a more domestic aspect of the question, 'ODE it rill probably be heloful to you to know how it has been decided that incoming papers on tire united kalians Organisation matters should be dealt with internally on receipt in this Office. In the formative stage of the Dumbarton Oaks and San Francisco Conferences, and later durin the Preparatory Commission and the first part of the first General Assembly (which might bo called the constituent stage) tire Jjcternal Department has, as a provisional arrangement, taken charge of tire papers. ing&lt; ^ nd has acted as the,co-ordinating Department. For example, a raamber of tire uxternal Department was attached to tire United Kingdom Delegation during the Conference in London for the purpose of providing liaison between the Indian Delegation and tire United Kingdom and Dominion Delegations in matters affecting India. Again, apart from recording tire mass of papers received from the Secretariat, and from tire United Kingdom Delegation, the External Department have also been responsible for the general co-ordination of United Nations Orgjurisation matters of concern to othercterxiitcjents in tiie India Office, by initiating actiun Oid consult!ni. the appropriate authorities. 8. In t ie li ht of experience it has, however, now been decided that, as the bulk of the work is likely to concern the hcononic and overseas Department more directly tiian aiy other Department of tlie India Office, the v/hole of the papers tiould, in the first Instance, be taken by this Department. It is, therefore, taking then over forthwith, and we shall be glad if - subject to what is said in paragraph 9 below - you will address this Department in future on all United Nations Organisation topics. Actually, trie IS. &amp; Q. Department is in process of reorganisation and it is likely that the branch of it which will handle United Nations Organisation atturs will be renamed within the next few weeks. We sliall l„t you know the title of the reorganised department as sOon as possible. 9. Very diverse .ratters are likely to be raised from time to time under the auspices of the United Nations Organisation and it is not, of course, intended that t us Department in its capacity as the Department handl ing United Nations Organisation work should itself ueal with tiie matters of substance so ad sing. It will receive, record and distribute United Nations Organisa tion papers and any com amications concerned with the functioning of the United Nations Organisation, anu the temuling or natters by,, or .in relation to, the United Nations Organisation. It will have the task of follow ing the relationship of one subject with another, of providing the United Nations Organisation 'slant', and generally of advising other departments here on the United Nations Oi’ganination aspect of subjects that come . v/ithin /wiUiin their purview. It will alno deal vlth aiy iiuestion that iiviy arise Iiei-e in regard to the stiv*!ture find Pricing of the United Nations Organisation itself. I .sofar, however, as rmy question of substance arising out of dealings with or by tlie United Nations Organisa tion relates to, for exaiaple, external affairs or financial policy, it is contemplated that the woiic on the subject natter ana any correspondence thereon with the Government of India would be done by our dxtemal or ^in&amp;ncial Department i , espoctively, and so on in the case of other subjects. This would be uone in consul tar- tion- so far as concerns tho United Nations Organisation aspect - with the ii. . 0. Dejartaent. e imagiie that some similar arrangement may be adopted at your end, as respects the functions in this connexion of the several Departments of the Government of India, but should be gird to havo this confirmed or to know what you propose to uo in this respect. 10. All tiie above arrangements - actual or proposed - are, as is indicated in the first paragraph, conceived in the light of current experience and of existing relationships; but as it cannot be foretold how and when the situation may be basically altered, it will be unuerstood that they must be regarded &amp;s quite pro visional.
