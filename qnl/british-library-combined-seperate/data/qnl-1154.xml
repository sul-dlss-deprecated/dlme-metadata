The majority of the correspondence is between the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agency in Bahrain, the Political Agency in Kuwait, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, the Colonial and Foreign Offices, both in London, the High Commissioner in Jerusalem, the British Agency in Jeddah, the Chief British Representative in Amman, the Government of India, and Ibn Sa'ud.The majority of the papers concern the definition of borders between Ibn Sa'ud's territories (the Najd and later the Hejaz) and Trans-Jordan, most specifically the status of the Jauf [al-Jawf] area and the towns of Kaf [Kāf], Akaba [Aqaba], and Maan [Ma'an], and to a lesser extent, Iraq. Reports on tribal raids and counter-raids are also included, particularly those between the Bani Sakhr and the Ikhwan. The latter's raid just south of Amman in August 1924, and the British military response, is prominent. Details of the Hadda Tribunals, which were set up to settle such disputes, are also given. The question of where ex-King Hussein should settle after his departure from the Hijaz is also discussed.Transcripts from Parliamentary Questions on these subjects are also included (folios 178-185). At the back of the volume is a broadside announcing the Shaw Commission, following the 1929 Palestine Riots.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Ṣakhr (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Transjordania</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trans-Jordan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kāf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Jawf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al 'Aqaba</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000218#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000218#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
