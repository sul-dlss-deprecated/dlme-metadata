India Office, Sir, Ma y&gt; In reply to your letter No. 3710, dated the 5th March last, regarding the claim upon your department for a refund of SI. 15s. 10^. in connection with the suppression of the slave trade, I am directed to explain that the Secretary of State for India in Council is unable to reply fully to your enquiries without communicating with the Govern ment of India, who would probably themselves find it necessary to refer through the Political Resident to their local officers in the neighbom:- liood of the Persian Gulf. The Marquess of Crewe sees no reason,wmm ^ H- however, to doubt the propriety of treating these charges as connected with the suppression of the slave trade and as arising directly ont of the fact that His Majesty's Government have, in pursuance of their declared policy in this matter, caused a large number of treaty engage ments with this object to be entered into in times past with the local \ Chiefs on the coasts of the Persian Gulf. {Vide Aitchison's ' Treaties,' &amp;c., A'ol. XIL, under heading ''Slave Trade ' in Index.) At the same time His Lordship is aware that the total annual amounts of these charges are comparatively small and that their special treatment entails some labour and inconvenience. He would, therefore, be prepared, while reserving his right to revert to the present system in the event of the total charges rising at any time above, say, 2001. a year, to include the amounts in future in the ordinary accounts of the Consulates and Agencies, and to claim each year a moiety only from British revenues, in the annual settlement of diplomatic and consular expenditure I am to enquire whether the Lords Commissioners will agree to this procedure, and to add that a copy of this letter, together with that to which it is a reply, is being communicated to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In the event of the Lords Commissioners' concurrence I am to suggest that the sum of SI. 15.s. lOd already claimed, together with a further sum of 211. 6 .9. lid., in respect of which vouchers and a receivable order are now for the first time forwarded, be transferred to the credit of the Secretary of State in Council of India at the Bank of England.

General authority for expenditure towards suppression of alave Trade* Sir, I have the honour to report that in connection with the suppression of I^aluch slave trade in Trucial Coast, it has, in the majority of oases been found necessary to clothe and ^rartt passages to Baluch slaves in addition to feeding thera as well as to nay spies, cost of teletfrains and boat hire. Strictl3 r speakinr; the annual allotment of as.700/- is intended for dieting the slavee, but in many cases it was also necessary to incur the • other charges in the interests of humanity. The expenditure incurred towards clothing, passages etc., was therefore un avoidable.

T ., olitioal Resident in the ersian Gulf, bushire.Political Agency, 14th October 1912. Kuwait, In reply to your demi-official of the 3rd Oc -tober 1912, regarding the praotloe in Kuwait when refu- -gee-slaves apply for manumission. Your notes give almost exactly what is the actual practice here. Fortunately there are very few application but when one is made, I have the statement of the appli cant taken down by the Mulla, question him or her myself so as to complete the statement for our own records then send the applicant with the Mulla to the Sheikh with or- -ders to represent the case to the Sheikh and to express with my compliments a hope that he will be so good as to bring about a reconciliation or see that the applicant gets justice. I have had no flagrant oases m my time and such as have come to the Agency have been reconciled to Jol, sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.B.I* &gt; Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E .Political Agency, Bahrein, 26th October 1912. y A &gt; Your D.0. dated 3rd October 1912 with en- clocures relating to the Manumission of Negro Slaves,only came to hand on 15th October. 2• I have drawn up a note on the procedure followed in regard to such cases in Bahrain in the past. It agrees in general with the note forwarded with your letter, but shows a slight elasticity to which I think you will probably see no reason to object• Reference to Bushire is always a very lengthy business, and v/hen a case can be adjusted to the satisfaction of all parties, it seems a pity to inconvenience every one by defer ring settlement. 3. The policy and practice pursued in the past in regard to the Manumission of Slaves of Bahrein Masters, are in my opiiv ion satisfactory. As far as I have seen^ Slavery in Bahrein is a very mild affair,and often positively beneficial to the Slave, regard be'had only to the present generation. 4. In the occasional cases in which a house-born,, comes up A and as such is refused manumission, we extract an Undertaking from the Master to treat the Slave well, not to sell him (or her), and to produce him when called on to do so. Such under takings are readily glven^but are probably really worthless because no steps have ever been taken (as far as I know) to see that they are observed, he This could/ remedied by actually calling for the production' of the slaves occasionally, and by adding a further conditicn obliging the Master to report and bring proof of the death of the slave, whenever he died. The main difficulty is that the Agency has already as much work as it can well manage. 5* Of the condition of Foreign Slaves in general, I have no special power to speak, but in Qatar according to all account^, the f r 0 ''- ( J -leal Resident, B B ^ s h i r e. Mlw| II t-hs institution, /hicli ia clossly allisd with the Pearling' ^ Industry, is seriously abused. Divers who are slaves, or are unjustly treated as such, are during the non-pearling season, taken inland and kept in chains. So at least I have heard frequently asserted. I would feel inclined to recommend that in the case of Qatar Slaved the Political Agent should be allowed to notify **''»• ' i WiWw■ i -t- ' 0 ,»« n the master through the Qasim bin Thani family that such and Mk mmn-rt i mwwuiP*'' 11 ' 1 ■ * ■ such a person claiming to be his slave has taken refuge in the Agency, and that failing his (the Master 1 s^ appearance J within a fixed period (say 3 weeks), the slave will be manu- mitted. This would probably lead to the just and easy settle- ment of a certain number of cases. 6* It may be remarked that a number of Slave Cases are in directly settled by the Shara' Court. This arises in the fol- . t M l . 1 i n I III urn mi , , lowing way: a man applies for manumission and promptly his al leged master turns up and lodges a pecuniary (usually pearl ing) claim against him. The case is in the ordinary way sent / to the Qazi or the Salifa,which always refers on in such y ters to the Qazi. If the Qazi allows the claim, then from the point of view of Muslim as well as our own law, the man is ^e facto* a free man. In that case to make assurance doubly sure, and as the man always continues to assert, pro bably truly, that he was a slave, I give him a Manumission Certificate• If on the other hand the Qazi disallows the claim on the ground that he is a slave, the question of his title to Manu mission is gone into by the Agency. Of course in the first case, the slave may object to the Qazi's finding and continue to assert that he is a slave, and not a debtor, and then the Agency has to take the matter up. I have a case of this sort pending at present, but I think it is my first. 7. I have never found anything to complain of the Qazi, Sheikh Qasim bin Mahza f s. conduct where slave cases are con- cerned. He appears to me to be very fair towards them. Of course he could not be trusted in cases where strong local influencesu ft influences might be brought to bear on him. 8. As regards the General Note received with your letter, T have noted paras 1,2,3,4,6,7,9 and 10, and have no remarks to offer. As regards para 5• I think Manumitted Slaves are regard ed in Bahrein as being as much entitled to our protection as other foreigners, and logically, as they would if ever be Bahrein-born, I do not see why they should not count as foreigners. I do not think the claim is likely to be Challeng- ed, and I should recommend that we always assume until it is. As regards para 8# I think very few cases will be found in which the emancipated slave would thank one for shipping him to Zanzibar, but the procedure to be followed is noted. 9. Before closing I would invite your attention to letter No. 1481 dated 20th July 1912 addressed me by Mr. Bill, when 1st Assistant Resident, and ask whether its doctrine is to be regarded as orthodox. In the case referred to I issued a Manumission Certificate as directed. From first to last I have heard nothing of the master^ So a speedy manumission was cer- ainly the best thing in this case.PROCEDURE. !• All Negroes claiming to be Slaves and seeking Manumission are received under the protection of the Agency* Males are lodged in the Agency premises under the charge of the guard. Women are as a rule put up outside in the quarter of the Free Slaves, for which they make their own arrangements. 2. There is only one exception to the Slaves and that is of those hailing from Koweit.iInstructions as to how these are to be dealt with, are contained in letter No. 941 dated 11th April 1911 from ;the Political Resident, Bushire, to the Political $ Agent, Bahrein ■p ''TOf Koweit Slaves are Hist therefore/considered in what follows. 3« Slaves fall under two classes according to whether their Masters reside in Bahrein, or abroad. In the first case, that of 'Bahrein Slaves^ each application is dealt with in accordance with the principle laid down in let ter No. 3351-E.B., dated 4th September 1905 from Secretary to the Government Uy-v al Resident in thg^Skeikh-coimultBtlr or- doeQ hrimit to be consulted• In oeis^s of deadlock or tii-ff icultv. refwance is m^de to the Resi dency i | W-lth regard to-^ara 6 the l^tterKlast cited, it is to be remarked thatjj^r general consent the year 1895 (The year of Zubarah) is taken as the criterion for determining whether im portation is 'new' or 'old'. 4. In the second case, that of 'Foreign Slaves'-chiefly from Trucial Oman, Qatar and Turkish Arabia, the applicants* state- • ments are taken and reference is nade to the Political Resident In a few cases in the past however, the Masters have turned up and have consented to the grant of Manumission Certificates which have accordingly been issued to save time / by this Agency. In such cases the Master is usually seeking to record a claim and to enable him to establish his rights, asserts that the Xman has never been his slave or has long since been manumitted. This may sometimes be true, but it is usually expedient to strengthen the 'slave's 1 * position by giving him a Manumission Certificate. Occasionally a Foreign slave comes to terms with his master and voluntarily returns with him. t &gt; As a general rule, however, all Foreign Slave Cases isa&amp;e vc referred to the Political Resident and disposed of in ac cordance with instructions received from him.71 i© 29th November 1912. &amp;t' ii y doar Trevor Please refer to paragraph 6 of Lorimor's demi-offi cial letter of 26th October regarding the manumission of slaves, in which he recommends that 'In the case of Qatar slaves, the Political Agent should be allowed to notify the master through the Qasim bin Thani family, that such and such person claiming to be his slave has taken refuge in the Agency, and that failing his (the master 1 s) appear ance within a fixed period, (say th3\rce weeks) the slave will be manumitted.

His Highness requests that the slave maybe detained for from 10 to Ip.days pending further investigation or the arrival of his master. In the now rare cases of slaves imported before 1873 claiming freedom the Sultan is not asked to agree to their manumission unless crueltv or inhuman treatment is proved, in which case freedom is given with the consent ^ the Sultan ; otherwise when slaves not entitled to freedom under the treaty appear to be well fed and clothed and in good condition, they are returned to their masters by the Sultan, who causes the masters to sign a bond by which they undertake to treat the slaves thus returned with kindness. . In the event of British Indian subjects or subjects of Native States taking retuge in the Maskat Agency from a state of pseudo slavery, their free dom has been demanded, as of right, from His Highness and admitted bv him as a matter ot course, on the principle that the reduction of such persons to a state of slavery can under no circumstances be legal.

General Notes. (i) Experience shows that there is a disposition to use the word ' slave ' as a synonym for ' negro ' in correspondence. This should be avoided. There is a large tree negro population in the Gulf and it does not at all follow that ^ ' ls . a ne S ro h ® 18 necessarily a slave, nor is the converse the case of o\her denomination? 6883 ' 1 ' Ue8r0 - He may be a ^dividual +i ,f ll' ^ a ' ]aVe ' ia . 3 serTefl his master for a long time, the probability is that the cause of his desire for freedom is ot recent origin, and as it is very more in bis ^ntereTtlnt ^' Can '. reall y 1 be repatriated in practice, it is often vT ti.l Jl! . f at a ^conciliation be effected between master and slave by the execution of an undertaking from the former to meet the slaved wishes id some particular respect and treat him better toasfL^the ;^™:v^^n' o be shouid be taken divers who have ru/away to evad e the i S h ^ mea ^ P earl H of the former cate g oi| they sbouM brdealt wUh as abZ indicatd 7 bu^f fa^ wbc T er ^ bte to have th « ^ diving industry. 7 a LoUrt ' accordl nS to the usages of the pearl In this connection reference is invited to the Trueial Coast Pearl Divers Civi s „ v , 1 ' r ,, Agreement, 1879 (copy attached*).

The impression which appears to exist in some ports that a British manumitted slave becomes a British subject ipso facto, may be in the slaved interests and need not be actively dispelled, but it will not hold water if challenged. There is no objection, however, to giving a deserving individual holding a British manumission certificate, friendly offices as a special case and to the extent to which the local authorities will accept them. (vi) Subsistence allowance at the rate of not more than four annas a day may be granted to slaves whose cases are under consideration, at the discretion of the Political Officers. The cost of food and of repatriation when necessary should be drawn on a separate bill and attached to the monthly cash account sent to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, Calcutta. (vii) In cases of persons born in slavery (known as ' Muwalli d' or domestic slaves) good offices can only be given in circumstances of gross ill-treatment with a view to the extraction of a guarantee from their masters that the ill-treatment shall cease. They are in no case entitled to a Manumission Certificate; on the other hand we are under no obligation to assist their masters to recover them. It should be remembered in this connec tion that domestic slavery is not prohibited in Turkey under the Brussels Act. A domestic slave is one born in slavery, one or both of the parents being at the time bonded slaves. (viii) Emancipated slaves, who can work as field labourers, porters, &amp;c., but not those of the domestic class, may be sent to Zanzibar in direct com munication with His Majesty's Agent and Oonsul-General at that place; in such cases all charges, which should of course be kept as low as possible and should not exceed Es. 50, in each case, will be borne by Government. The funds required may be drawn on separate bills and submitted with the monthly account to the audit officer concerned. Emancipated slaves may, if necessary, be sent by native craft, sailing under the British, flag to Zanzibar, His Majesty's Agent at that place being advised by post • of their despatch; if, however, native sailing Foreign Department letter No. 145 E.-A., dated ^ available, emancipated the leth January 1900. slaves may be sent to Zanzibar via ^ F Qyf 4 . i fn I ! e ? art ? 1 Q e on letter N0,2142 E ■' A ■ , dated Bombay by steamer, the cost, which the 30 th October 1900. J J ' i.t&gt; Foreign Department letter No. 918 E.-A., dated should, not eXCeed abOUt xtS. OU, being the sth May 1903. debited as described above [note (vi)J. The above procedure can be applied to all ports under the Persian Gulf E-esidency. (ix) Whilst a slave from Persia or from the Arabian shore of the Gulf, not otherwise entitled to his freedom, becomes ipso facto free on setting foot in British India, it has been held that if he returns of his own free will to the Foreign Department letter No. 1647 E.-A., dated place where lie Was tomiClly domiciled, the 6th September 1892. he reverts to his original status of slavery. (x) It was held in 1896 by the Advocate-General to the Government of Bombay in the case of the seizure of a slave dhow on the high seas by Captain E. G. Beville, Political Agent, Maskat, that the capture was probably illegal because section 3 of the Slave Trade Act of 1873 only authorises seizure by the Commander or Officer of any of His Majesty's ships. (xi) Refund of expenditure. —When a slave is restored to his owner, either because he is not entitled to manumission or as the result of a reconci liation effected between him and his master, the expenses of returning him (including cost of his feed and keep) should be notified direct to the Consular Officer concerned with a view to its recovery from the owner. In the case of refugees from the Trucial Coast the cost is treated as a first charge on the man's earnings and will be recovered and refunded direct by the Residency Agent in due course. *(xii) Should civil claims or criminal complaints be preferred against a refugee, as sometimes occurs, the following procedure should be observed (a) Civil claims— (i) If the claim is connected with pearling transactions, it should be referred to the Salifa Court at the place where the transaction took place. (ii) If it is an ordinary claim for a loan, &amp;c., it should be referred to a Civil Court of a Kazi, preferably a Kazi acceptable to both parties. In both cases a representative of the Agency or Consulate concerned should be present. (^) Criminal complaints— The refugee should first be freed if he or she is entitled to freedom and then the complaint should be enquired into and settled un officially, if possible. If this cannot be done, the case should be referred to a Shera or Consular Court or the local Adliyeh according to the nationality of the complainant. In the local court a representative of the Agency or Consulate should be present at the enquiry. | It should be borne in mind, however, that no claim for debt can lie against a person undoubtedly in state of bonded slavery. (xiii) In the case of minors released from slavery, both in their own interests and in order to save expense, the Political Agent may at his discretion consign individuals during the years of their minority to the guardianship of approved applicants, almost invariably Christians, to be brought up as domestic servants, the said applicants executing a bond in which they guarantee to produce their charges whenever required and give such other undertakings in respect of them as the particular circumstances of the case may render expedient.

(1) If a slave escapes from area of o^^Agency ad takes refuge In an Agency situated In another area, we cannot In any circumstances force the slave back, and we will readily give the manumission certificate sought. (2) if a slave does not escape, and we hsar from a third party - even a relative - of his on her being in wrongful captivity, we must proceed with great cau^tion. in the instance of this *lrl, named Saluhah, we have no reason to believe that she is not happily settled where she is. To endeavour to get her away may endanger her life or reduce her to worse cir cumstances than she is in at present. I will not therefore ask R.A.Sharn;ah anything about her.

After coTTvpl ^ , It has been brought to notice that a certain individual at Jask styling himself as the Political xepresentative of the British Sovernment at that place issues manumission certificates to Persian slaves and also provided them with British passports (certificates of identity) to enable them to travel to Muscat and other places without taking out Persian Tazkerahs. ihe saitt person, in reply to the represen tations made by the Director of Customs (Mudir) at Jask to the effect that the slaves being - v -rsian subjects should provide themselves *ith Persian Tazkerahs, states that since they (the slaves, were liberated by British manumission certificates they should be considered as British protected -ersons. ihere is no aouot that the freedom of such persons should be granted by the Persian authorities.

On the other hand, paragraph 3 of -Residency letter No.851, dated the 11th .ugust 1900, appears to suggest that we have been exer cising this right by usage and sufferance rather than by any explicit agreement. it H.B.M's Consul &amp; As^trT to the Resident, fandar Abbas.No.118/3 of 1929.

The practice followed hitherto at this Legation differs slightly from that described by you. The Persian Governirent, through the English Section of the Ministry for foreign affairs, have been in the habit of givin 0 us the required certificate of liberation; we have then taken a copy of it for purposes of record, and have handed it in original, marked with the Legation or Consulate se al , to the person liberated. It may be possible in future for you to follow this procedure, which appears less likely to wound Persian susceptibilities. 4. The whole question of the suppression of slave traffic, which forms the subject of the -inglo-Persian Convention of 1862, is likely to be discussed in the near future, and a revised Convention may possibly be agreed upon The situation has ho--ever been changed by the passage through the Majlis on the 7th February last of a law abolishing all slavery and dealings in slaves, throughout Persia .J.Barrett, C.S.I., C.I. a ., s Majesty's acting Consul-General, B U 3 H I xv E.5lf - E - Persia and Persian territorial waters, although it is possible that this law may not jet have been put into effective exeoution. 5. itor these reasons therefore I prefer if yon see no objection to leave matters as they are for the present.

Letters between the Treasury of the Government of India and the Political Residency discuss the annual budget allocated to the suppression of the slave trade, from which dietary expenses, as well as clothing and repatriation expenses, were taken. Amongst the particular issues discussed are the expenses related to increasing numbers of slaves originating from Baluchistan in 1923 as a result of that area’s famine, and the increasing costs of feeding slaves due to rising food costs near the end of the First World War.The second part of the volume comprises correspondence sent between the Residency and Agencies/Consulates between 1910 and 1939 on how to deal with the manumission of slaves. The file includes guidelines for manumission (folios 56-58), created by Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Cox in his capacity as Persian Gulf Political Resident in 1912. Cox’s guidelines were distributed to the Gulf Agencies and Consulates. These guidelines responded to the ambiguities present at the time in determining whether manumission should be given: the date of an individual’s enslavement, where their owner resided, the nature of their servitude (domestic or otherwise). The guidelines outline the authorities (treaties and proclamations) governing the prohibition of the slave trade in the Gulf, and grounds and procedure for manumission. Procedure for manumission varies dependent on whether slaves have come from Persia, the Arab Coast (Kuwait, Bahrain, Trucial Coast, Muscat), and slaves from Persian territory under British protection. Queries over the status of slaves from Persia occupy a significant portion of the remainder of this part of file, due to official Persian policy regarding slaves having changed with Persia’s abolition of slavery in 1928. Also included is a revised set of manumission guidelines drawn up in 1938 (folios 127-29), intended to replace Cox’s earlier rules. These updated guidelines reflect the change in Persia (now Iran’s) policy towards slavery.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Muscat Political Agency and Consulate</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Zachariah Cox</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Najd</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Jufayr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuk-I-Mund</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kūh-e Mand</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras Tannura</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ra's Tannūrah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Az Zallāq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zellaq</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000bc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
