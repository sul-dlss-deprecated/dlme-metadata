Contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, dated 30th March 1905. (Printed on separate sheet.) Enclosure No. 2. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, E.C., Sir? 15th February 1904. I hare the honour to bring to your notice the fact that the Contract dated 6th of August 1896, and which became operative on the 1st of May 1894, between the Government of India and tin's Company, for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Baghdad, will expire on the 30th April of this year; and I am directed' by my Board to apply to you for a renewal for a further decennial period. It will be within your recollection that the subsidy was reduced in 1894 from a sum of Rs. 36,000 to a sum of Rs. 24,000, the rupee having, however, materially depreciated within the 10 years. The sum now given is only sufficient to cover the outlay necessitated by the keeping in Busreh of a third steamer, which we are not permitted by the Turkish Government to use, but which must always be in readiness to convey the mails should a breakdown occur to one of the other two steamers. We trust, therefore, that we shall not be asked to consent to a reduction of a subsidy which has already reached a figure that is barely in proportion to the demands made by the Postal Service upon the Company. During the last decennial period the condition of the River Tigris has sensibly deteriorated. Navigation has become much more difficult owing to the volume of the water in the river having become less as further canals, unscientifically cut, have been dug by the Arabs along its banks for irrigation purposes. To meet the congestion of cargo, for the most part British and Indian, which this state of things has brought about, the Company have been obliged to have recourse to the towing of barges, distributing the cargo between the steamer and the barge. This measure has been a great boon to British and Indian manufacturers and merchants, whose cargo would otherwise have been delayed for a very long period. But it has imposed a great strain upon the Company’s, staff, and it has been most difficult to keep up a regular service, 'in the circumstances, we submit that the service of the mails has been efficiently maintained. Although it was provided in our last contract that, having regard to the reduction of the subsidy, the service should be a weekly one, so far as was compatible with the reasonable requirements of the trade, yet we find, in fact, that the weekly connection between the river steamers and the British India steamers has only failed in about 10 cases on an average out of 100. When it is borne in mind that even this small percentage is due to three factors over which our Com pany have no control, namely, extreme lowness of water, inability of the Baghdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for discharging cargo, or quarantine restrictions, we submit that the record is not a discreditable one. During the last half-year, when the river has been better, the steamers have not missed the connection a single time. While asking for a renewal of the subsidy, we feel it our duty to call your attention to the extremely onerous restrictions which are imposed by the Turkish Government upon the activities of our Company. So long as we are confined to the use of two steamers only, and so longns these steamers are detained in Baghdad for quite uncertain periods, owing to the unsufficiency of the wharf at the Custom House, we could not recommend the Government of India to increase the subsidy in order to obtain an accelerated service. Because all that could he gained under present conditions, of heavily-laden steamers and^ barges, and a low river, would be a possible slight increase of speed during high river when the service is already punctual. Navigation, at high speed with very little water in the river would he impracticable^ In conclusion, I would venture respectfully to remind you that during the last decennial period this Company has been spending very large sums of money upon the development of the Persian trade vid the Karun. More than half of this trade is Indian, and the Indian Government do not at present contribute anything towards the service. The advantages of the service have already been reaped in a practical form by the Government of India, the material for the new overland telegraph line having been conveyed to its destination in Persia by the Company’s steamers on the Karun, and across the Ahwaz-Isfahan Hoad, which has been constructed at the Company’s expense.

With reference to the letter from the Government of India, No. 150, Eoreign, dated the 24th September 1903, as to the conditions of the renewal of the contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Bagdad, which terminates on the 30th April next, I am directed by Mia Secretary Brodrick to request that he may he informed whether Lord Lansdowne has any observations to make upon the enclosed draft* of a letter which it is proposed to See Enclosure o. address to the Company in reply to an application which has been received from them for the renewal of the Contract for a further period of ten years.

I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant relative to the question of the renewal of the Contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Company for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Bagdad. It appears to Lord Lansdowne that the communication which the Secretary of State for India proposes to address to the Company is likely to result in a renewed application from Messrs. Lynch for permission to use a third steamer on the Tigris. Sir N.

I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th Eebruary in which you apply for an extension of the Contract for the conveyance of mails by your Company between Busreh and Bagdad for a further period of ten years. In reply I am to say that the Secretary of State in Council will he prepared to enter into a new Contract with your Company on the basis of paying the same subsidy that has been paid under the existing contract, viz., Bs. 24,000 per annum, for a weekly service. The Secretary of State in Council is not, however, satisfied that the complaints which have been made of the irregularity of the service maintained by the Company are beyond their power to remedy under the existing conditions of the navigation. He, therefore, considers it necessary to insist upon provisions (a statement of which is enclosed) being introduced into any new Contract, in order to secure greater regularity in the future.

With reference to your letter of 2nd March, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to you, to he laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch regarding the possibility of again approaching the Porte for permission for Messrs.

Constantinople, My Lord, 5th April 1904. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s Despatch No. Ill, of the 22nd ultimo, asking my views as to the possibility of again approaching the Porte for permission for Messrs. Lynch to' use a third steamer on the Tigris. I have carefully considered this subject, and I do not think that anything has occurred which would lead me to alter the views I ventured to express in my Despatch No. 440, of 4th August last. The Russians have approached the Sublime Porte with a view to being granted similar privileges to those enjoyed by Messrs. Lynch, and the Civil List has just placed its new steamers on the Tigris, and proposes to place two more in a short time, so that probably the old argument of congestion of traffic will no longer serve. The existing privilege is envied by more than one Power as well as grudged by the Porte, and I do not see any argument likely to prevail, and obtain a further concession to Messrs. Lynch. Their permission to run tugs was extracted from the Ottoman Government with the greatest difficulty, and would have been withdrawn shortly afterwards had it not been for the determined opposition of this Embassy. I have, &amp;c., The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., N. R. O’Conoe. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Enclosure No. 7. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, E.C., gj rj 15th June 1904. We have taken advantage of the presence in England, on leave of absence, of our Manager in Baghdad, which was already in con templation when we received your letter of the 25th March, to conferfully with him upon the conditions of the mail service The resulf ef our interviews has been to amplify in detail and to confirm in mincMe the statement of the position which we had the honour to submit to you m our letter of the 15th February. We find, for instant that during the period which has elapsed since the writing of that letter not a single connection has been missed. Anv irreeularitv in the service is caused by factors over which our CompanV has no control namely, either extreme lowness of water, or inability of the B itrhdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for disci,argir.!&gt; car^o or lastly, quarantine restrictions. &amp; 1 s - &gt; Inasmuch as, however, we are anxious to comply as far as possible with the wishes of the Secretary of State in Council, I am directed bv my Board to confirm what was stated by our Chairman in the interview kindly granted to him on the 13th instant by Mr. Biohmond Ritchie C.B., namely, that we accept the new clause to he inserted between Clauses 11 and 12 of the existing Contract. We are quite prepared to rely upon the reasonable use by the Government official of the fresh powers to be conferred upon him. As regards the proposed omission of the words “ So far as is compatible with the reasonable requirements of their trade,” this we submit, if carried out in principle, would quite as much militate against the interests both of the Home and Indian Governments, as it would prejudice, in a degree quite incommensurate with the subsidv earned the takings of our Company. It is known to you that a few vears ao-o’ after infinite trouble on the part of His Majesty’s Government’ permission was obtained by this Company to tow barges. One of the prime objects of this measure was to relieve the congestion of car^o which takes place at Busreh during several months of the year, which months generally coincide with the season of low water and difficult navigation. It would he easy on such occasions to leave the barge behind in order to get up the mails to Baghdad a day earlier ; but such a course would entail the detention in Busreh for another week of all the cargo m the barge amounting to about 200 tons. The congestion would be increased to that extent each time just at the period wife i the greatest efforts are being made by our representatives to get the cargo up the river. There can be no question that if the alternative were placed before the mercantile community of Baghdad, of either receiving their letters a little later, or of having 200 tons of cargo detained in Busreh, they would unanimously adopt the former alternative. The met should not he overlooked that the hulic of the mails are merchant mails having reference to the cargo which is coming forward. As regards the effect of leaving the barge behind on the takings of the Company, it must he borne in mind that the congestion lasts foi such a considerable period that merchants could not be expected to wait until, in the natural course, the cargo had been taken up. They would he obliged to import less. It is true that these merchants, in spite of the knowledge that their cargo will he delayed for several months, do nevertheless continue to ship it to Busreh ; they are hand to mouth traders for the most part, depending upon a rapid turnover, and they get advances from the bankers in Manchester directly the goods have left their hands. But of course there is a limit to this system, that is to say, an amount of cargo accumulated, and a period of time for carrying it forward, which cannot be exceeded. When this limit has been reached importation ceases. The loss in this way to our Company would he considerable, and quite out of proportion to the amount of subsidy received. Bor these reasons, winch we have endeavoured to state clearly, though we fear at some length, we are unable to accent the omission of the words in Clause 5, and we would venture to hope that this course may be approved by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in Couneii, dictated as it is, not merely by the consideration of the interests of this Company, but also by the interests of that trade withGreat Britain and India, which we have for so many years laboured to bU In the concluding paragraph of your letter it is stated that, “ the “ Secretary of State in Council is not satisfied that the complaints “ which have been made of the irregularity of the service maintained “ bv the Company are beyond their power to re medy, under the existing “ conditions of the navigation.” We submit that toe acceptance by us 0 f the new clause between Clauses II and 12 ought to secure that such irregularity, if caused by the fault of our representatives, should not be repeated m future. I have, &amp;c., Fr ank Bottom lev, The Secretary of Stale for India, Secretary. Enclosure No. 8. India Office to Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. India Office, g- r 9th September 1904. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th June last, on the subject of the renewal of your Company’s contract for the conveyance ot mails between- Baghdad and Busreh, in which you state that y ou J accept the new clause to he inserted between clauses 11 and 12 ot the existing Contract, hut are unable to accept the omission from clause 5 of the words “ so far as is compatible with the reasonable requirements of their trade.” . -inn In reply, I am to say that the Secretary of State in Council fully appreciates the objection of the Company to the complete subordination of their interests as carriers to the absolute punctuality of the mail service. Cn the other hand, it appears to him that the words in dispute have too wide a scope, qualifying, as they do, the obligation on the Company to maintain a weekly service. Mr. Brodrick notes with satisfaction your statement that the Company are fully prepared to rely upon the reasonable use by the Government officer of the fresh powers bestowed upon him by the new clause. He Avonld therefore propose that the object of the Company should be inet bv re-drafting clause 5 as follows :—“ That the Company shall and will ‘dmaintain a regular line of communication from Busreh to Baghdad “ and hack by means of the vessels before-mentioned, and the com- “ munication between the two ports shall be weekly; and in every case “ in which it is desired to delay the departure of the weekly steamer, “ whether on the ground of political disturbances or other circumstances over which the Company have no control, or on the ground of the reasonable requirements of the Company’s trade, the consent of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad' or of His Majesty’s Consul at Busreh shall be first obtained.’ &lt;e The Secretary, Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. I have, &amp;c., H. Walpole.Enclosure No. 9. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to India Office. 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, E.C., Sir, 9th Novemher 1904. I have placed your letter of the 9th September before my Directors, and, in reply, I have the honour to set before you their observations as follows :— If the words “ as far as is compatible with the reasonable require- “ ments of their trade, the communication between the two ports shall “ he weekly ” in Clause 5 were omitted, and the draft proposed in your letter under acknowledgment were substituted, there would then no longer, they submit, be any provision in the Contract to meet the case (which is very frequent during the season of low water) where a steamer starts within her appointed time, hut is unable to reach her destination in time to enable her punctually to perform her share in the weekly service, owing to the insufficiency of water in the river. This case would probably not be met by the contention on the part of the Com pany that this was a circumstance beyond their control (see new clause), because the Consular Officer might object that they could have per formed the voyage more rapidly had the steamer run empty or with very little cargo, thus enabling her to cross the shallows over' which a loaded steamer could not pass. The draft of Clause 5 which you propose does not, it seems to us, provide for such a case. Nor, on the other hand, does it seem practicable to us to leave the decision of the question as to what does and what does not constitute a proper amount of cargo for a vessel to carry during the low season for settlement by the Consular Officer. The captain on each occasion presents a note to the Agent stating the cargo-carrying capacity of his steamer with the existing condition of the river; and he bases his estimate upon some sort of compromise in his own mind between getting up cargo and not unduly delaying his voyage by going aground for long periods upon the shoals. 13ut under your present proposal the Consular Officer might urge that in such circumstances the vessel must run empty, or nearly empty, in order to maintain a weekly service. Owing to the changing conditions of the river, and the limited number of steamers we are allowed to run, we are unable during the low season absolutely to guarantee a weekly service unless we sacrifice considerable quantities of cargo, in which case we should require a very much larger subsidy. As a matter of fact, we rarely omit to maintain such a service even at that season, the omissions numbering perhaps five or six during the year. Still we should obviously not be prepared, in view of the uncertainty as to the future condition of the river, and for the reasons above stated, to impose what would be a serious disability upon our steamers in their carrying capacity. Noting your objection that the words in the old clause have too wide a scope, and being most anxious to meet the views of the Secretary of State as far as possible, my Board would venture to suggest that their scope should bo defined. This might be done by accepting your draft of Clause 5 with the single addition of the words “ and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,” at the end of the clause, and amending the new clause between Clauses 11 and 12 to read as follows :— “ That in case any vessel, employed or to be employed in the performance “ of this Contract, shall not arrive at Busreh or Baghdad before the end “ of nine hours calculated from the time fixed for the arrival of such “ vessel by the said Government officer, then, and in each and every of “ such cases, and as often as such default shall happen, the Company “ shall forfeit and pay into the Treasury of the Government of India “ in Calcutta or Bombay as and by way of liquidated damages, the sum “ of rupees fifteen for every hour aud fraction of an hour after the time 1583G. C“ so fixed for “ heZblelo any penaltie^ under this clause if the default be proved “ to the fatisfaction of the said Government, or of the s^d Government “ officer to have arisen from circumstances over which he Company .. oftheir servants had not and could not have had any control, “ the state of the river in the low season when the Company shall not be “ called upon punctually to perform the weekly such per- “ forntxmce would necessitate their rej cargo or omitting to call at “ tf™onclulion 0r my Board trust that the Secretarv of State will recognise that they have done their utmost to meet his wishes m this matter hut that they are unable to tie down their Agents any further 1 “ return for the small amount of the present subsidy, and in view of the extremely difficult conditions of their trade.

The draft, of clause 5 which you propose cioes not* it seems to us, provide for such a case. practicable to us to leave the decision of the question as to what does and what does not constitute a proper amount of cargo for a vessel to ca,rry during the low season for settlement by the Consular Officer. The Captain on each occasion presents a note to the Agent stating the cargo-carrying capacity of his steamer with the existing condition of the River; and he bases his estimate upon some sort of compromise in his own mind between getting up cargo and not unduly delaying his voyage by going aground for long periods upon the shoals. But under your present proposal the Consular Officer might urge that in such circumstances the vessel must run empty, or nearly empty, in order to because the Consular Officer might object that they could have performed the voyage more rapidly had the Nor, on the other hand, does it seem(3.) maintain a weekly service. Owing to the changing conditions of the river, and the limited number of steamers we are allowed to run, we are unable during the low season absolutely to guarantee a weekly service unless we sacrifice considerable quantities of cargo, in which case we should require a very much larger subsidy. As a matter of fact we rarely omit to maintain such a service even at that season, the omissions numbering perhaps five or six during the year. Still we should obviously not be prepared, in view of the uncertainty as to the future condition of the river, and for the reasons above stated, to impose what would be a serious disability upon our steamers in their carrying capacity. IToting your objection that the words in the old Clause have too wide a scope, and being most anxious to meet the views of the Secretary of State as far as possible, my Board would venture to suggest that their scope should be defined. This might be done by accepting your draft of Clause 5 with the single addition of the words — f ' and such consent “shall not be unreasonably withheld* at the end o^(4.) 'bh.s Oleins© t slid, amending 'tdie new Clsunse 'beijween Clauses 11 and 12 to read as follows 'That in 'case any vessel employed, or to be employed in the 'performance of this Contract, shall not arrive at 'Busrah or Baghdad before the end of nine hours 'calculated from the time fixed for the arrival of 'such vessel by the said Government Officer, then, and 'in each and every of such cases, and as often as 'such default shall happen, the Company shall forfeit 'and pay into the Treasury of the Government of India 'in Calcutta or Bombay as and by way of liquidated 'damages, the sum of rupees fifteen for every hour and 'fraction of an hour after the time so fixed for such 'arrival during which the said vessel shall fail to 'arrive, but nevertheless so that the Company shall 'not in any case be liable to any penalties under 'this Clause if the default be proved to the satisfac- 'tion of the said Government , or of the said Government 'Officer, to have arisen from circumstances over 'which the Company of their servants had not and could 'not have had any control includ ing the state of 'tl 16 'river in the low season when the Company shall notX (5.) '■be called upon punctually to perform the weekly 'service if such performance would necessitate their “rejecting cargo or omitting to call at intermediate 'ports.' Secretary of State will recognise that they have done their utmost to meet his wishes in this matter, but that they are unable to tie down their Agents any further in return for the small amount of the present subsidy and in view of the extremely difiicult 'conditions of their trade.

Sir,, We have taken advantage of the presence in Eng land on leave of absence of out* Manager in Baghdad, which was already in contemplation when we received your letter of the 25th March, to confer fully with him upon the con ditions of the mail service. The result of our inter views has been to amplify in detail and to confirm in principle the statement of the position which we had the honour to submit to you in our letter of the 15th Feb ruary. We find for instance that during the period which has elapsed since the writing of that letter not a single connection has been missed. Any irregularity hi the service is caiised by factors ov&amp;r which our Com pany ha^ no control namely, either extreme lowness of water, or inability of the Baghdad Custom House officials to provide a berth for discharging cargo, or lastly, quarantine restrictions. Inasmuch as, however, we are anxious to com- ply far as possible with the wishes of the Secretary ot State in Council, I am directed by my Board to confirm wnat was stated by our Chairman in the interview kindly granted to him on the 13th insi,, by Mr, Richmond Ritchie C.B. namely^, that we accept the new clause to be inserted between clauses 11 and 12 of the existing Contract. We are quite prepared to rely upon Ihe reasonable useby the Government official of a oi the fresh powers to be conferred upon him. As regards the proposed omission of the words, So far as is compatible with the 1 reasonable require ment of their trade,* this we submit, if carried out in principle, would quite as much militate against the interests both of the Home and Indian Governments, as it would prejudice, in a degree quite incommensurate with the Subsidy earned, the takings of our Company. It ls known to y° u that a few years ago after infinite trouble on the part of His Majesty's Government, per- mission was obtained by this Company to tow barges. One of the prime objects of this measure was to relieve the congestion of cargo which takes place at Busrah during several months of the year, which months gen erally coincide with the season of low water and dif ficult navigation. It would be easy on such occasions to leave the barge behind in order to get up the mails to Baghdad a day earlier; but such a course would en tail the detention in Busrah for another week of all the cargo in the barge amounting to about 200 tons. The congestion would be increased to that extent each time just at the period when the greatest efforts are being made by our representatives to get the cargo up the river. There can be no question that if the alternative were placed before the mercantile communi ty of Baghdad, of either receiving their letters a little later, or of having 200 tons of cargo detained in Busrah, they would unanimously adopt the former alternative. The fact should not be overlooked that the bulk of the mails are merchant mails having re- . ference to the cargo which is coming forward.As regards the effect of leaving the barge behind on the takings of the Company, it must be borne in mind that the congestion lasts for such a considerable period that merchants could not be expected to wait until in the natural course the cargo had been taken up. They would be obliged to import less. It is true that these merchants, in spite of the knowledge that their cargo will be delayed for several months, do nevertheless continue to ship it to Busrah; they are hand to mouth traders for the most part, depending upon a rapid turnover, and they get advances from the bankers in Manchester directly the goods have left their hands. But of course there is a limit to this system, that is to say, an amount of cargo accumulated, and a period of time for carrying it forward, which cannot be exceeded. Idaen this limit has been reached import— atiOn ceases. The loss in this way to our Company would be considerable and quite out of proportion to the amount of subsidy received. For these reasons, which we have endeavoured to state clearly, though we fear at some length, we are unable to accept the omission of the words in clause 5, and we would venture to hope that this course may be approved by His Majesty's Secretary of State for India in Council, dictated, as it is, not merely by the con sideration of the interests of this Company, but also by the interests of that trade with Great Britain and India, which we have for so many years laboured to build up. In the concluding paragraph of your letter it is stated that, ^the Secretary of State in Council is *not satisfied that the complaints which have been made^of the irregularity of the service maintained by the ^Company are beyond their power to remedy, under the existing conditions of the navigation.* We submit that the acceptance by us of the new Clause between Clauses 11 and 12 ought to secure that such irregularity, if caused by the fault of our representatives, should not be repeated in future. I have the honour to be Sir, Secretary. -4- — - .. . —3-.a a J\&lt;d I arn direcijed by the ^larquess of Lansdowne oo acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd insoant relative to the question of the renewal of tne Contract with the Euphrates and Tigris Company for the conveyance of mails between Busreh and Bag dad. appears to Lorcd Lansdowne that the communi cation which the Secretary of State for India pro poses to address to the Company is likely to result i n ^ renewed application from Messrs.

O 1 Conor in his Despatch Mo.440 of the 4th of August last explained the reasons which he then con sidered to prevail against supporting such an appli cation and, in view of the recent establishment of a Turkish steamboat service on the Tigris, it is probable that the Porte would be less disposed than before r Secretary of State, India Office.before -to favourably consider any representations on the subject. Lord Lansdowne will however again refer the question to Sir N.

Poet William, the 14th January 1904. Sir, With reference to your telegram, dated the 8th December 1903 regarding the renewal of the contract under which the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company maintains a mail service between Basrah and Baghdad, we have the honour to forward the accompanying memorandum explaining the modifications which we consider should he made in the terms of the existing agreement. We have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants,R,.u ! j H v4vvv3 W \ji 4 ^ C. memorandum. CZowse o.-The words 1 *o /« y « s i s c 0 mpa«JZ e with the reasonable require, menu of their trade ’ should be omitted. Them the only ground on whhdr the Company will he able to justify any failure in the regularity of the weekly communication will be the ground that such faflure was due to political disturbances or other circumstances over which they had no control. 1 As the clause now stands, it is practically open to the Company to subordinate the regularity of the service to the requirements of their t rad e and to start their steamers trom the terminal ports on any day they please. Clause iA—Between this clause and the present clause 12. the following should be inserted as a new clause :— ° “ That m case any vessel employed or to be employed in the performance of this contract shall not arrive at Basrah or Baghdad ai the time at whieh having Tigard to the stipulated duration of the voyage the samp vessel ought salo arrive then and in each and every of such cases and as often as the same shall happen the Company shall forfeit and pay into the treasury of the Gov ernment of India in Calcutta or Bombay as and by way of liquidated damages the sum of rupees fifteen for every hour and fraction of an hour after the time ^ fixed for such arrival during which the said vessel shall fail to arrive but A nevertheless so that the Company shall not in any case be liable to any penalties under this clause ihthe late arrival does not exceed ninp hou r s o ff if the default be proved to the satisfaction of the said Government, or of the said Government officer, to have arisen from circumstances over which the Company or their servants had not and could not have had any control provided always that if the late arrival exceeds the further time hereby allowed the penalty shall be payable for the whole period of delay counting from th&amp; hour when such vessel should have arrived ”. 2. Clause 6 of the Contract does not appear to need modification. The state of the river varies at different seasons and the navigation is at times difficult and uncertain. The times for the runs cannot be fixed without a full provision for changes and the wording of clause 6 probably best meets the requirements of the case. if /, A- ^ ^ -h '*'*''* / /- frjpLPr'1904.
