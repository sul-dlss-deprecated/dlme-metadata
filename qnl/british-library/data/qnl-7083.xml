Sur is a town of about 12,000 inhabitants situated in the province of Jaalan in Oman, about .17 miles west of Has el lladd and 94 miles south-east of Muscat. 2 . The shore at Sur is low' and sandy, destitute both of trees and other vegetation. The principal features of the place are a creek with the town standing on both sides of the entrance and a stony ridge called Eed, which rises about 50 feet high from shingly flats and runs from north to south at a distance of 2 miles behind the town. The creek is half a mile long, 150 yards wide and only three-quarters of a fathom deep at 1ow t w r ater. 3. The towm on the east of the creek is called Aiqa and is occupied by the 13ani Bu Ali tribe ; that on the w r est is called Muqrimatain and is occupied by four sections of the Jenebeh tribe. The fighting strength of these sections is stated to be as follows :—Alarm, 2,000 ; Makhana, 800 ; Ghialin, 600 ; Fuwaris, 150. 4. Adjoining the north-west end of the story ridge are Sanaisalah, occupied by the Bani Sinan, and Shariah, containing 100 houses of the Jenebeh (Arama). 5. On the plain at the back of the ridge, situate! about 4 miles from the sea, is Balad As Sur, a stone-built village in which the Walks residence is situated, but in disrepair. There is also a fort named Jinah situated inside Balad As Sur and occupied by the Bani Amr, askaris of the Wali. Stated to be the key to the command of Sur. 6 . There are extensive date groves and cultivation of lucerne and about 250 houses of various tribes who supply Sur with vegetables and fodder. 7. Balad As Sur contains about 95 wells and the water supply of Sur is obtained from there daily on donkeys. It w^as in order to keep the town in check by commanding the water supply that this site w T as chosen as the Walks residence. During hostilities water is also obtained at night with some difficulty from sweet wells to the south of the creek. 8 . According to Lorimer’s Gazetteer (Vol. II, p. 1849), there w r ere at one time over 100 Indian traders at Sur, but these numbers gradually dwindled down owing to the insecurity of the place. In 1923 there were 35, at present there are only 20 British subjects in Sur. These British merchants are living on sufferance, having to pay blackmail to the various Sheikhs of the Jenebeh in order to avoid being looted. I understand that since the kidnapping of a Baida in 1926, Mahomed Bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, has not himself levied anything from the Banias, but that he is suspected of instigating others to do so. 9. The climate of the place is stated to be very equable, and wrere it not for the insecurity trade there w r ould be in a very flourishing condition.* 10. Unlike Muscat, there are roads suitable for wheeled traffic in Muqrimataiu. The track between Muqrimatain and Balad As Sur would require some labour on it near Sanaisalah before it could be used for wheeled traffic. 10a. Sur is the port for the shipment of dates from Sharqiyah. Most of these dates are of the Mibsali variety, which is preferred by natives of the country to all other kinds and is much appreciated in India. The trade is a large one, the Badiyah division of Sharqiyah alone containing some 158,000 palms. 10 b. The carrier trade from Sharqiyah to Sur is in the hands of the Hijriyin tribe, whilst the Jenebeh of Sur, who are a seafaring tribe and own some 130 dhows, convey them thence to Bombay and other ports. * The total number of Sur dhows is estimated at 150. Most of these belong to the Jenebeh tribe. The Bani Bu Ali own 8 or 10. and a few are owned by the Bani Sinan.10c. A small number of Jenebeli belonging to the Majaala section live at Izz near Nezvva, and in forner days the Temeemah or Chief Sheikh of the Jenebeh was chosen foni this section. He was regarded with veneration, had despotic power, aid took 25 per cent, on all bags of dates exported by the tribe. Presumably he acted as agent for the Jenebeh in Sharqiyah and helped to build up this trade. By 1900 his power had waned and a Sheikh of the Arama section, who are the largest section in Stir, wis recognised as Temeemah. Unfortunately a blood feud, which started in 1913, between the Arama and Fuwaris sections on the one hand and the Makhana and Ghialin on the other, undermined the influence of the Arama Sheikh and Mansur bin Naser of the Majaala section of Masirah Island was elected Temeemah. The influence of this Sheikh over the Arama and Fuwaris sections waned, and he seems to have enlisted the sympathy of the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali tribe for the purpose of regaining his authority. In 1927 he went to Mecca with the brothers of Amir Mahomed bin Naser to visit Ibn Sand, but died of smallpox on the return journey. The Jenebeh, though they bear an evil reputation in slave dealing and piracy, are not a warlike race, and under normal circumstances could have been kept in control easily enough ; but misrule, internal feuds and French influence have combined 'to let loose lawless elements amongst them. 10d. The Bani Bu Ali. as a tribe, live in the interior of Jaalan. Their principal port is Lashkharah, but they have a small settlement at Aiqa on the opposite side of Sur ^reek to the Jenebeh and own about eight or ten dhows. According to Saiyid Mahomed bin Ahmed, Aiqa formerly belonged to the Hinawi. The Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin Majid, occupied it under their patronage, but Abdullah bin Salim threw off the Hinawi connection and made the place purely a Bani Bu Ali settlement. The Bani Bu Ali are a wild and warlike tribe of ruffians. They put up a fight against a Division of Indian troops, and their name is to be found on the colours of a number of Indian regiments. The Sultans of Muscat have never been able to control them, but have often enlisted their assistance ■during former rebellions, when they have come chiefly for the sake of loot. II.—Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. 11 . The Bani Bu Ali tribe of Jaalan are a branch of the great Adnani tribe Bani Temeem. 12. The name Bani Bu Ali appears to be of recent origin, since in the History of the Imams and Seyyids of Oman,” by Salil ibn Bazik, translated by the Rev. G. P. Badger, they are constantly being referred to as the Beni Temeem, and not as the Bani Bu Ali. 13. The Bani Temeem, one of the most considerable tribes in Arabia, ascribe their origin to Temim—born about A.D. 120—the son of Murr, a descendant of Madhar through Tabikhah, and therefore of the race of Adnan and Maadd. They were dispersed over the north-east of Nejd from the Syrian desert to the borders of the el Yamamah. Their territory comprised the vast desert called Dahna, and extended on the south between the confines of A1 Yamamah and el Bahrain. 14. The Bani Bu Ali are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. They belong to the Wahabi sect known as Azraqah and will not eat meat cooked by others. The founders of the Wahabi, Ibadhi, and lufuyyah sects all belonged to the Beni Temeem, whilst the llarth, the other branch of the Bani Temeem in Oman, have been the i&gt;rincipal supporters of the Muttawa or extreme sect of the Ibadhis. 15. In 1807 the Wahabis sent a Joasmee fleet of 22 dhows to attack the fort at Sur, but met with such a spirited resistance on the part of the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali that they were driven off with heavy loss. Intrigue accomplished what force failed to do.9 During the Wahabi invasion of 18.12-3, Salim bin Ali, Temcemah Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali, became their biij)porter, helping them against the Bani Bu Hassan. In consequence of the part which Salim bin Ali had taken against the Bani Bu llassan, there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a light wherein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed ; some of the Bani Bu llassan also fell, and as neither side would give in, the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 1G. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali as Temeemah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi, throwing oil the authority of the Imam. 17. In 1820 Saiyid Said, having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that his followers among the A1 Ashkarah had plundered many Knglish ships wrecked there, applied to the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. 1 he Bani Bu Ali murdered the messenger ■carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports ol piracy near Has el Hadd. Captain Ihompson, in charge of operations, decided to avenge the act, and with a small force consisting of six companies, sailed to Muscat, where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani Bu Ali, the capital, of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate, and after attempting to take the town, were sharply repulsed. Six out of eight officers and 270 men were killed. In January 1821 Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore British inBuence in the gulf. From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani Bu Ali, which surrendered after most of the defending force had been killed or captured. The Sheikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bombay. (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Yol. VI.)*' 18. As late as 1815 the Bani Bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance of the Wahabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco, but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer (Lorimer Vol. II., p. GG.) 19. In 1851 Sultan Saiyid Said stated that the Bani Bu Ali had long withdrawn from allegiance to him. 20. In the early part of the reign of Saiyid Thoweynee [185G-G6] the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu llassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other, in which Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ali, at the head of the Bani Bu Ali, generally won the day. About the same time a series of raids was committed by the Wahibah against the Bani Bu Ali, these raids culminating in a serious engagement at Theeleyeh, in which Sheikh Abdulla greatly distinguished himself by totally defeating and routing the enemy.f 21. Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality, but Saiyid Salim during his reign [18GG-8J, having had reason to suspect treachery on the part of the Hinawi garrison at Muscat, sent a large present to Sheikh Abdulla and requested his help to defend him in his position. Sheikh Abdulla gladly removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it ■ but, owing to the vr,dilatory policy of Saiyid Salim, was dismissed after a stay of four months and returned to Jaalan. Soon after this, Saiyid Azzan- bin-Khais, on coming to power in 18G8, summoned him and' the other Sheikhs of the Bani Bu Ali to Muscat to render their submission, and on their having refused to visit him, he marched against the Bani Bu Ali, seized three of the Sheikhs of the tribe and threw them into prison at Muscat. * A good description of these opemtions and the subsequent proceedings is contained in the Annual Administration Reports, 1883-4. page 26. t Abdulla bin Salim- was not actually Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali till 1867 in which year the Temeemah Mahomed bin Majid was murdered; but he certainly took a very prominent part in affairs before that date. J ^6 22. Concerning this expedition Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident in the Gulf, wrote at the time (No. 202, dated 3rd November ISOO) : “ If Saiyid Azan bin Khais should succeed in his present expedition in the south, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could.” 23. Sheikh Abdulla, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutawwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani Bu Hassan and the A1 Wahibah to wage war against the Bani Bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh, in which Abdulla defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for this the Bani Bu Hassan rose again, only to be defeated a second time at Sell A1 Masaddee. 24. In 1870, Saiyid Turki having requested the help of the Bani Bu Ali, they joined him at Sur, and 200 of their number marched under Sheikh Abdulla and Yusuf against Matrah, where they both took a leading part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan-bin-Khais, and subsequently restoring order and holding the place till Saiyid Turki s arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Turki granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali exemption from the payment of customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 25. In 1874 the Bani Bu Ali had at length amicably adjusted an internecine feud that had been going on amongst themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other, and as regards wounded (about 70 in number), the blood money was determined by Mahomedan Law. 26. In 1874 Bani Bu Ali of the Ja’afarah section, belonging to Lashkharah, were responsible for the wrongful confinement and subsequent release on ransom of subjects of the Rao of Cutch at Hellanujah Island. Major Miles went to Lashkharah in H.M.S. Philomel, and as the surrender of the actual offenders could not be obtained, a fine of $600 was imposed and readily paid at Sur by Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali, acting on behalf of the Ja’afarah.’ :f 27. In 1881 the Bani Bu Ali attacked and defeated the Bani Bu Hassan in their own quarter of Jawabi al Khwarah. This engagement was described as the most sanguinary ever fought between Omani tribes, and is said to have cost 157 killed on both sides. 28. In 1887 the Awlad Kassib kidnapped one Bania at Sur and had severely beaten another. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of his own accord restored the kidnapped Bania and imprisoned live of the Awlad Kassib.| 28a. In 1888-9 relations between the Bani Bu Ali and Jenebeh were strained. In May 1889 hostilities broke out, which resulted in a tight of some importance. Badr bin Saif, who went there to settle the dispute, reported on return that the Bani bu Ali had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Highness’s officials, and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in all local matters. 29. In 1895 the Bani Bu Ali sent a detachment in support of Saiyid Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Saleh bin Ali, but they made no determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali an allowance of $100 per mensem. 30. In the spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Sharqiyah being then in progress, Abdulla bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris, were supplying his enemies with the sinews ot war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdulla had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatain became so strained that when Major Cox (then # For full details vide “ Narrative of ^Muscat Affairs,” 1874-5 Cric), para. 343. t The Awlad Kassib were originally a Fakhth of the Jenebeh, but came under the protection of the Bani Bu Ali.Political Agent, Muscat) arrived there in August he found the two factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately proceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and before proceedings had commenced in earnest the Sultan was called away by serious news from Rustaq ; nevertheless, his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbour hood. (Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 580.) 31. In 1013 Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim Al Alawi died. He was considered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat, and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him, and as the latter’s sou Mahomed was still a minor, Abdulla’s second son Ali was made Amir jointly with Mahomed bin .Naser. An arrangement which .still continues. 32. During the 1913-9 rebellion the Pani Bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but their behaviour was not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and also left behind the ammunition, with which the Sultan had provided them, at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity, and then on their arrival at Sib were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. They retreated unexpectedly and unaccountably from Bidbid, where they were iirst established, to Watiyah. On being brought back to Muscat much alarm was felt owing to their reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. Their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly amongst themselves and paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Mahomed bin Naser, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be induced to obey orders of any kind. In one quarrel amongst themselves, which arose over pilfering by some of them in the bazaar whom the Sheikh wished to punish, stones and sticks were freely used, with the result that there were several heads broken. Even the Sheikh himself was stoned. 33. Since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani Bu Ali through misdirected economy, but Mr. Wingate 0 restored them. 31. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement, and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. This claim to independence on the part of the Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact entered into by the Wahabi Sheikh on his invasion of Oman, when certain Sheikhs were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right without any dependence on Muscat (Bombay Government Records, XXIV, p. 43). 35. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde° that he was -authorised by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khnrr.is bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied, permitting him to interfere during the Salifah period, but after this period he was not to interfere in anything. 30. Major Hinde then enquired how it was that the Sheikh did not permit the new customs house to be built at Sur. Mahomed bin Naser became •evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and stating that he never would * * Then Political Agent. Muscat.aeree He went on to sav that the right of His Highness to collect customs at Sui- and Aiqa had never been recognised by his forbears, himself or his tribe. 3 - l n ’1925 Colonel 1 ’rideaux (then Political Resident in the Gulf) remarked that the Amirs were not very loyal to the Sultan and that if they had done their duty and given the Wall of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom tor the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a lledoum. 38 In December 1925, in protesting against having to obtain a “No- Obiection” certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay, Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Government of India : “ I submit that this request ot the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent Mate, and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political Agent, Muscat. I hold the Political Agent in hinh regard, but I think you will appreciate that 1 prefer to preserve the dignity of my State not to do an act detrimental to its independent possession. 39 Mahomed bin Naser has as his lieutenants (I) Abdulla bin Saleh, a Habshi who was his agent in Bombay, speaks English and is reputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Nuser's letter to the Government of India. He is stated to be very unreliable; (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about December 1927 to teach his children. Reputed to know a little English and to he much travelled. XU. Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. 40. Little is traceable concerning the early history of this tribe. According to Colonel Miles, they are a branch of the Bam -Tahir and, therefore, Wilad Dhubyan of Kahtanate origin, but now classed as Chaim. They are considered the least religious tribe in Oman, and in this connection it would be interesting to trace whether there is any connection between them and Abu Said al Hassan, el Janaby, the Karmaty, who abolished prayer and fasting and the pilgrimage and attacked the Hajj and invaded Oman about the year A.D. 000. ,:f 41 A violent grudge of old standing between the Jenebeh and the Harth (the tribe of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh—the strong man of the Imams Government), culminating in an affray near Khaburah in which the Jeneben were the victors, is mentioned as taking place in the early part of the reign of Saivid Said (1807-56), whilst they were assisting the latter in Ins opera tions against the Wahabis. Later they appear to have assisted the Wahabis in conjunction with Mahomed bin Nasir al Jabir against Saiyid Said Later still they appear once more to have assisted feaiyid Said against the \\ ahabis. 42. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur, discontented with the Sultan’s rule, sought Wahabi assistance from Baraimi ; and the Wahabi agent, nothing loth, sent a contingent, who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by the Jenebeh and Ban! Bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu traders and shopkeepers; the extent of their losses was estimated at $27,700 and one of their number was killed and another wounded. Before being allowed to leave for Muscat, they were stripped of almost all their clothing-t 43. Colonel Belly considered that a prompt and severe example should be made of the Jenebeh, who were implicated with the W ahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment of this tribe. They had long been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti-slavery proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H.M.S. B asp, who had disappeared from * * They were in league with the Bani Jabir for many years, following their fortunes vis-a-vis the Wahabis. . , ^ »* t For fuller details vide “ Muscat and its Relations with the Wahabi 1 ower.S3 9 their craft a few months before. The Sultan of Muscat was assured of their criminality and had himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Felly had also in the preceding month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the heads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of $27,000 as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subjects and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand. Their reply was that on a former occasion when Lieut. Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast nothing was done, and they were quite sure the Resident would not' come now. 44. On the 11th February 18Gb H.M.S. Highflyer appeared off Sur to- insist on atonement by the Jenebeh for their part in the affairs of August, by payment of $27,700 compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate, a tire was opened which demolished their fort, the whole of their boats were either confiscated or burnt, and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. No personal injury was suffered by non-combatants, who had ample opportunity to move, but a small part of the town was burnt accidentally in consequence of a change in the direction of the wind. 45. In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader of Sur, a Bania named Jethnand Motamull, was broken into during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of Jenebeh, who offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about $ 1 , 000 . 1 he spoil was openly sold in the town and tho robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were~ taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not even, appear that they offered to remonstrate with or suppress their tribesmen. There was no, Wali or other authority on. behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time who could have taken action in the matter. The Bania therefore reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His Highness, who promised redress. 46. Soon after this, H.M.S. Rifleman happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offender, and would have doubtless caused restitution, but Jf.M.S. Rifle man, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed anchor, the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 47. During His Highness Saiyid 1 urki s absence in Gwadur, the case- was presented to Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without beneficial result. About this time the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the Bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This, arrangement they afterwards repudiated. Saiyid Turki was reminded of the mattei after his return, but he w T as not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. • t 8 * P is j ^ 1111688 finall y informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter in the hands of Government, and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported His Highness’s request that the enforcement of reparations might be undertaken bv Government lo have held His Highness personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh s hands would have tended still further to weaken His Highness s authority, and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs ta continue their depredations on British subjects at His Highness’s expense * whilst the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand' be a cautionary warning to all. Colonel W. F. Prideaux, the Political a ^ ^ggepfed that in addition to the original amount a fine of .._,000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as compensation for the delay and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 3393 ^49. At first, however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan’s request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals was the duty of the Sultan, and that in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turki the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy and for other material aid which had been afforded to Saiyid Turki from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would be effectually -carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for. armed intervention. 50. The Sultan’s efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective that finally in July 1877 the Political Agent was authorised by Government to proceed to Sur in H.M.S. Teazer and convey the Sultan’s demands. 51. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Highness’s order and warned them that if they failed to comply within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognised head at the time, the nominal Sheikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. 'They expressed their readiness to comply with His Highness’s order, but explained that the absence of a recognised authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, (heir chance of reimbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland lighting against the Bani Bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time and were allowed until sunset on the 25th. 52. By noon of the 25th, Jethanand’s claim amounting to $1,600 had been satisfied, partly by a money payment and partly by a buggalow (or native dhow), of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Sur and Jethanand came on board. The former delivered to the Political Agent $2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied. Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that the fine of $2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki, after deducting the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 53. In 1885 Saiyids Faisal and Fahd went to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh, but were unsuccessful. 54. In 1898 Suleiman bin Suweylim , who was the Sultan’s Wall of Dhofar, Sur, and Sohar, went to Sur, where the inhabitants were being encouraged by French agency to make light of the Sultan’s authority. He summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that in future he would not respect Kltafir and would seize the persons and property of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly, even if in the house of the “ Khafir ” himself. (When a party or caravan wish to pass through the country of another tribe, they take with them as escort a man belonging to the tribe through whose country they wish to pass. The party or caravan is then safe from attack, and this is known as the “ Khafir” system. It is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe travelling under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe.) 55. This aroused the greatest indignation amongst the Jenebeh. Suleiman then proceeded to Muscat, leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years, in charge of the place. Later he wrote to his son at Sur, ordering him to build a fort at a spot which would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. Such a fort would have enabled the Sultan to overcome the Jenebeh and ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Sur. About this time Suleiman’s son threatened to shoot a gardener, and actually did shoot a bullock and cut11 down a date tree belonging to the gardener, because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. 56. r I he four sections of the Jenebeh then combined and wrote letters to the Sultan asking him to stop the building of the fort and remove Suleiman’s son from Sur. The Sultan did not reply to these letters. Five ot the sheikhs then came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear and they went away disappointed. 57. At length, after representations from several quarters, His Highness sent his writer Hamad to Sur to listen to the complaints of the Jeuebeh and stop the building of the fort. No attention was paid by Suleiman’s son to this order, and on Hamad’s return His Highness did not even take the trouble to liear his report. 58. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali now intervened and induced the Sultan to stop the building of the fort, but the Jenebeh insisted on the recall of Suleiman s son and said they were quite prepared to fight rather than submit to Suleiman’s rule. 59. The Jenebeh then cut off the supplies of the garrison. The Sultan at once wrote to the Jenebeh warning them that their attitude, if persisted in, would only result in speedy and condign punishment. The Sultan’s- messenger was informed by the Sheikhs that unless he left Sur before nightfall, his blood would be bn his own head. 60. It was difficult to understand why the Sultan persisted in trying ta force Suleiman bin Suweylim’s unpopular and high handed rule on ^he Jenebeh against their will. He had neither money nor troops with which ta coerce the tribe. Any man he could raise would come out, not for the purpose of fighting, but merely to live at His Highness’s expense ; whilst the Jenebeh, though not a martial tribe, were well armed and had sufficient money to induce other tribes to join them. 61. At length, towards the end of September, a force consisting of 600 Jenebeh, 200 Bani Bu Ali and 150 Bani Rasib beleaguered the fort occupied by the Sultan’s representative. The rebels opened fire at long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without resulting in any loss for either side, when it suddenly seemed to strike one of the Sheikhs that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, the rebels guaranteeing that the Wall’s son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the coast and placed on board a vessel bound for Muscat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party despatched to Muscat. 62. Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built fort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offerino- to hand over the fort to anyone deputed by him except Suleiman bin Suweylim or his son, and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison under Hamad* bin Saif. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheikhs, informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion, but the Sheikhs not convinced of his bond fides, refused to allow Hamad to take over the fort* and he returned to Muscat. 63. At the end of the year the Jenebeh were persuaded to accept a new Wali, and Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad (the present Wali of Matrah and President of the Council) and a fresh garrison of 60 men took possession of the fort. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled ; all the woodwork had been removed and nothing left but the bare walls. 64. During this period the authority of the Sultan was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at Sur published by the French Government in 1901, showed that their attention had been directed to that place at some earlier date, and in 1893 M. Chapui, a somewhat disreputable French subject, arrived at Sur in a steamer flying the French flag and tried to obtain a site for a coal shed there.The scheme for advancing French interests by a wide distribution of the French flag was boldly pursued. In November 1891 it was stated that as many as 50 Sur boats flying the French flag were bound for Bushire and 18 had put in to Lingah. (This question is further dealt with in the review of the slave trade.) By 1900 the people of Sur, especially those of the Jenebeh tribe, had almost ceased, under French encouragement, to regard the Sultan as their master. 65. In 1900 Hilal bin Amr arrived at Sur from East Africa, joined hands with M. Ottavi, and began to inveigh against the Sultan and the British; and the spirit of the Jenebeh was such that, when summoned by the Sultan to meet him at Muscat, they refused to go and insolently suggested that he should deal with them instead through the French Vice-Consul. It was this state of affairs which obliged Saiyid Faisal in June 1900 to make a visit to Sur, the first since his • accession in 1888. His reception was more favourable than he had expected, for all the elders of the town immediately paid their respects to him, the Cheif Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali came down from the interior with a thousand men to do him honour, and the Sultan was successful, before he left, in obtaining from the French flag holders of the port, including the Jenebeh, a formal profession of -allegiance to himself and a renunciation of French protection. 66 . In 1901 the Sultan sent 80 Askaris to garrison his post at Sur, and the French flag holders, few of whom had observed their promise given in the previous year, understanding the act as a threat to themselves, asked M. Ottavi whether he would protect them in case of an attack by the Sultan’s troops; his reply was unfavourable, and the incident marked another stage in the decline of French influence at Sur. 67. About 1913 a blood feud started between the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh, which has continued ever since. In 1918 His Highness the Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Rs. 14,000 and imprisoned 26 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years. 68 . In 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganised and the people of Sur, ■seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced, refused to allow a customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain MacOollum, the then Wazir, went to Sur in H.M S. Britomart, and the Jenebeh agreed to accept the new arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since. The customs house was not built, difficulties being invariably placed in the way, and the Wali became as powerless and inept as ever. 69. Spasmodic murdering went on, and in 1923 the Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to attempt to put an end to the feuds. He returned, having been openly flouted and having accomplished nothing. In July Zubair, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban, l.A. (in command of the Muscat Levies) and 150 levies and three machine guns, proceeded to Sur and occupied the fort. Zubair reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered $6,400 customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe $4,000. A site was selected for a custom house and the party returned to Muscat in triumph. Unfortunately there was one case in which blood money was not accepted. The Makhana agreed to pardon the murderer, an Arama. He was imprisoned in Muscat and was released in 1924. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered Sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections, in which one Arama boy was killed. The Fuwaris took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama, and a struggle ensued, in which an Arama girl was killed. The Wali was able to use the Ramzan feast for arranging a 45 days’ .armistice. 70. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser, Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhana and A1 Ghialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud among the Jenebeh—to acknowledge his authority.71. In 1925 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser, of Masirah Island, proceeded to Sur and informed the Hindu community that there was no Sultan’s Government in Sur, and that they were to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of justice as the local Wali had been found incapable. The Wali told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. &lt; 2 . In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah, accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salim bin Naser, brothers of Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani Bu Ali, stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Majesty Ibn Saud. Mansur bin Naser died of smallpox on the return journey. IY.—The Slave Trade at Sur. /3. British efforts lor the suppression of the slave trade first took shape in 1822 by a treaty concluded with Saiyid Said of Muscat, the object being the extinction of the slave trade between Africa and India. This treaty was amplified in 1838-9. Another agreement was made in 1845. Again in 1873 a new treaty was made. 74. The Resident in the Gulf, writing in 1844, says, “ Muscat and Sur are the principal primary ports to which slaves from whencesoever shipped, whether from Zanzibar or the Red Sea, are brought.” In the ’sixties the Political Agent in Muscat estimated that about 4,000 out of 15,000 slaves passing up the Gulf were landed either at Ras el Hadd or the adjacent port of Sur. 75. In 1852 the steam vessel Tigris was placed on special duty at the •entrance to the Gulf, but it soon became evident that surveillance would be more effective if instituted on the African coast. 70. In the ’seventies somewhat greater success attended the efforts of H.M.S. Magpie and Vulture, sent to cruise off Ras el Hadd. The latter •captured a large dhow, in which were 169 slaves, mostly women and children. The Nakhoda of the vessel was imprisoned by the Sultan of Muscat, and the vessel destroyed. From a description in the Times of India (October 1872) of a slave vessel captured by the Vulture, the methods of the exporters appear to have been characterised by great barbarity. “The number of slaves it was impossible at the time to estimate ; so crowded on deck and in the hold below was the dhow, that it seemed, but for the aspect of misery, a very nest of ants. The hold, from which an intolerable stench proceeded, was several inches deep in the most foul bilge water and refuse. Down below, there were numbers of children in the most loathsome stages of smallpox and scrofula of every description. A more disgusting and degrading spectacle of hum mity could not be seen, w'hile the foulness of the dhow was such that the sailors could hardly endure it. When the slaves were transferred to the Vulture the poor wretched creatures were so dreadfully emaciated and weak that many had to be carried on board and lifted for every movement. How it was that so many survived such hardships was a wonder to all. . . . But perhaps the most atrocious piece of cruelty of the Arabs was heard afterwards from the slaves themselves, viz., that at the first discovery of smallpox among them by the Arabs all the affected slaves were at once thrown overboard, and this ivas continued day by day until, they said, 40 had perished in this manner.” 77. In 1873 H.M.S. London was stationed at Zanzibar for 10 years and during that period the wholesale traffic was for the time being suppressed. But slaves still arrived in the Persian Gulf in small lots and dealers had begun to conceal their operations by use of the Fiench flag, which secured them against search by British vessels. In the ’eighties there was a recrudescence of the trade owing to the withdrawal of H.M.S. London from Zanzibar. 78. Inquiry showed that slaves were brought to Sur in vessels belongincr to that port, most of which flew French colours. The slaves were ordinarily landed at Sur itself, but the owners of the vessels had accomplices .at Ras el Hadd and other places, and when British cruisers appeared theyreceived warning and landed them at small places near by, whence the slaves were marched in gangs to Sur. The demand in the interior behind Sur is not great, for the system of irrigation in Jaalan and Sharkiyah does not demand slave labour. The majority of the slaves are re-exported in small vessels to the Batineh, where irrigation is mostly from wells, and where some of them are retained. The balance is distributed from the Batineh to the Trucial coast by land. At this time the number imported here annually was estimated at 300. 'The Jenebeh tribe proclaimed openly that their only object in taking the French flag was to protect their slaving operations. 79. Sur quickly attained a disreputable prominence in the traffic, and it became increasingly clear that the only way to put an end to it was to break up the Sur depot; but the chief obstacle to such a step was the attitude of France in regard to her flag. Political difficulties arose owing to the extent to which the protection of the French flag was being abused. 80. From 1892 onwards abundant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of the French flag by importers. In 1890 several vessels carrying slaves were captured. In May the Political Agent captured a vessel carrying 28 slaves. A few days later H.M.S. Lapwing captured a vessel carrying 14 slaves, whilst the Sultan’s officials rescued two recently imported slaves at Bunder Gisseh. H.M.S. Sphinx captured two vessels flying the French flag. The one had 30 slaves on board ; the other 140. A third vessel, whose French papers appeared to be in order, was allowed to proceed. The vessels, though stated in the papers to belong to Madagascar and Comoro, were in reality from Sur. 81. Owing to political difficulties created by these seizures, slave cruising was virtually discontinued and from this time onwards the traffic appears to have been on the increase. The Sultan was assured by the Government of India that his subjects could not be removed from his jurisdiction, but the precariousness of his position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking any action. 82. In 1900 Captain P. Z. Cox, then Political Agent, Muscat, re-examined the question of the importation of slaves. He found that about 1,000 slaves had been imported that year into Sur, of which about half had been carried in vessels under the French flag. In 1901 about 1,000 slaves were again imported, whilst in 1902 the supply was stated to be abundant. In 1902, 114 Arabs were captured by the Portuguese in Mozambique whilst actually engaged in slave trading. About a third of them died in confinement, while of the remainder 54 were sentenced to transportation for 25 years. With a few exceptions these men belonged to the Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali tribes of Sur. The number of the captives who might have claimed French protection was never ascertained, but it was admitted by one of them before the Portuguese authorities that two of the vessels captured flew the French flag. 83. In 1905 the award of the Hague tribunal in regard to the French flag question compelled the French authorities to exercise a closer supervision over native masters entitled to use the French colours. 84. Since the settlement of the French flag question and the stoppage of the principal sources of supply at Zanzibar and on the African coast very little attention appears to have been paid to the traffic of slaves at Sur, but I am assured from several sources that the trade, both in slaves and in arms, is very profitable and nearl}’ every Arab dhow arriving at Sur has a small quantity of these commodities. The slaves are being imported from Socotra, Mokalla and Dhofar, whilst the arms come from Jeddah and the Italian ports in the Red Sea. Y,—Summary of recent Events in Sur. 85. In 1927 the Arama and Makhaua sections of the Jenebeh each built three new forts in their quarters against the orders of the Wali. 8 G. In August 1927 Mr. Thomas, Minister of Finance, went to Sur. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay 2J lakhs of rupees which they owe15 Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Muscat, and to pull down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section, and on leaving 8 ur, in the Al Saeed, he took in tow an Arama sambuk, which was in the harbour, whereupon the Arama fired on the Al Saeed. Beyond hitting the funnel •and one of the ship s boats, no damage was done. The lire was not returned. The Council lined the Araina section Us. 10,000, but have been unable to enforce this. 87. In April 1928 the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali established a new customs post at Aiqa. Their customs officer wrote to the State Customs Official at Sur, demanding refund of customs which the State had levied on the grounds that the boat belonged to the Bani Bu Ali. The Amirs refused to lurnish the Councils representatives with any explanation regarding this customs post. 88 . About the same time the Bani Bu Ali stopped a boat belonging to the Arama section from entering the creek, whereupon the Arama prevented a Bani Bu Ali boat from entering the creek. Ihe Bani Bu Ali then occupied Balad AsSur with a view to commanding the water supply of Sur and obtaining mastery over the town. On the 15th April they were attacked in Balad As Sur by about 70 men of the Arama and Fuwaris under the leadership of Sheikh Vaser al Majaala. The Arama lost six killed, whilst the Bani Bu Ali lost 10 killed and three wounded. Sheikh Uashid, Minister for Beligious Affairs, accompanied by Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness, went to Sur on the 17th April to try and settle the dispute. Their reception by the Amirs was not cordial, and they returned to Muscat on the 2«Trd April, having failed to accomplish anything. However, through the intervention of other Sheikhs, the parties came to terms. The Arama and Makhana sections each destroyed one of their forts. All sections of the Jenebeh were to pay $20 on each of their boats to the Amirs for this year only, and Sheikhs Yaser and Naser bin Mubarak were to call on the Amirs at Aiqa. 89. On the 25th May the Amirs wrote to the Council of Ministers, stating that their action had been taken on behalf of the Muscat State and demanding payment of $10,000 expenses. They attempted to send this letter to the Council through the Holitical Agent, but it was returned to them and they were informed that if they wished to communicate with the Council they should do so direct. 90. In May Abdulla bin Saleh, Secretary to Mahomed bin Naser, proceeded to Bushire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bani Bu Ali did not recognise the Sultan’s authority and attempted to get a certificate of identity at the Agency. He was directed to obtain a passport from the Sultan's Government. 91. In July 1928 His Highness the Sultan and the Council of Ministers furnished their views on the situation at Sur. They resented the letters and actions of the Amirs of Jaalan, realised they were not strong enough to deal with the situation and asked for the assistance of the British Government. 92. In August 1928 the Amirs wrote to the Political Resident claiming that Sur was a part of their territory, that the Sultan’s VV ali was there and customs collected with their permission, that the town and customs were under their protection and everything would be accomplished in its proper time. 93. On the 21st August a party of about 15 Arabs, chiefly of the Fuwaris section of the Jenebeh, boarded a Cutch Mandvi buggalow belonging to a British subject, Khimji Ramdas, which had arrived from Karachi, overawed the crew with rifles and daggers, and made off with 22 bags of rice and Rs. 200 worth of personal property belonging to the Nakhoda. Most of the culprits are known. The Council of Ministers arrested one of them in Muscat and are attempting to obtain the surrender of the others from the Fuwaris Sheikhs. 94. On the night of the 27th August some Arabs climbed over a broken wall and got into the fort where the \Yali lives. They stabbed his two besthorses. The Wall’s Askaris are believed to have had a hand in it in conjunction with the Bani Bn Ali. They have been replaced by others from Muscat. The Wall’s telephone line from his residence to the customs is also being cut constantly. 94a. About this time a party of the Meshaikh tribe (a small tribe of Bedouins and robbers, originally allied to the Beni Bu Hassan, but now stated to be under the protection cf the Bani Bu Ali) stationed themselves on the road outside Muqrimatain and looted all people coining into Sur for some days. They killed a number of donkeys. 95. On the 18th September a shop belonging to . a British subject Motimul Sukkumul—was broken into at noon by two men, an Arab and a slave, whilst the owner was upstairs. The robbers ran awav on seeing the owner coming down, taking with them $138 in cash and ornaments worth $95 ; 'whilst running away they dropped $45 worth of ornaments, which were recovered. 96. Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani Bu Ali removed the flagstaff from his house at Aiqa and erected a new flagstaff on ground level. On the 21st September Abdulla bin Saleh, mentioned above, hoisted Ibn Sand’s flag on the newly erected flagstaff. A salute of three guns was fired when the flag was hoisted and one gun when it was lowered in the evening. This appears to be a parallel to the action of Saiyid Fadhl iTin Alawi Moplah at Dhofar in 1875, when the latter styled himself as Governor of Dhofar under the Ottoman Porte (see Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 591). •)&lt;. On the 21 st September a caravan from Budiyah (Imam’s territory) which had brought dry dates for Khimji Ramdas and obtained advances for a further supply, was returning to Budiyah laden with rice. It was seized by a party of Fuwaris under one Said bin Abdulla, who was the leader of the party who looted Khimji Ramdas’s boat on the 21 st August. Naser bin Ali, Khimji Ramdas’s landlord, succeeded in intercepting them before they had reached Jebel El Fed and recovered the caravan without loss. Said went to the \\ ali and threatened him that if the Council did not release the •man whom they had arrested at Muscat in connection with the looting of the buggalow, he would commit further mischief. 98. On the 26th September Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Wali of Sur not to allow caravans to come to Sur from Budiyah with dales. The M ah refused to comply. He also wrote to the Political Agent stating that his truce with the Hijriyin had been broken and asking him to warn British subjects not to deal with the Hijriyin of Budiyah. He was asked not to interfere with the legitimate trade of British subjects. It would seem from the above that the gahg of Fuwaris were acting in conjunction with Mahomed bin Naser in stopping the Budiyah caravan. 99. It is believed that this action of the Amir is in order to induce caravans to proceed to his new customs at Aiqa instead of Muqrimatain. He has also attempted to induce British merchants to transfer themselves to Aiqa, offering to charge 2£ per cent, instead of 5 per cent, as charged by the Muscat authorities. J 100 . Iheie has been trouble also with regard to a Chinaman who went to bur via Aden and Muscat, lie bought a large quantity of fish and fins and refused to pay the export duty on the grounds that he had already paid it to the Amirs. On the 16th September Abdulla bin Saleh wrote to the customs Mudir, stating that the Chinaman was under the protection of the Amirs, that his goods should be shipped to any place he desires, and that the Government had no right to recover any duty in any places under the rule of the Amirs. . f 10L 0,1 the September the Director of Customs at Muscat received information from Sur that the Amirs had ordered their man in charge of customs at Aiqa to count the sailing vessels entering Jerama and Sur creeks as they intended to charge anchorage fee. They intetded also to register boats at Aiqa in the name of the Amirs. I he levy of such dues at Khor Jerama would appear to be a revival of the dispute in 1877-80, when the people of Ras el Hadd attempted to levy17 such dues and the British authorities were obliged to take cognisance of the matter. British war vessels visited the spot in 1877, 1879 and 1880. All tolls on trading vessels entering the Khor were then finally abolished. (Lorimer, Vol. J, p. 515; also Narrative of Muscat Affairs.) 10^. The latest nows from Sur is that the caravan mentioned above left Sur for Budiyah on the 29th September accompanied as far as Qalab Bay eh by an escort of Fuwaris and Wali’s askaris. Beyond Qalab Rayeh it was seized by a party of Bani Bu Ali, assisted by Ghialin and Makhana, and taken to Aiqa. The Wali sent a letter to the Amirs protesting against this, but they have refused to restore the caravan. YI.—Review of the Situation at Sur. 103. Hitherto the policy pursued with regard to the slave trade, arms traffic and ill-treatment of British subjects at Sur may be summarised in the words of Major (now Sir) P. Z. Cox in Ids Report No. 373, dated 29th August 1902 : — “ It must be conceded that the present Sultan has been in a great measure powerless to do much to stop the ingress of newly captured negroes, and at any rate during the time that the question of the French flag has been in process of negotiation between His Highness and the French Government it would have been ill-advised on our part to put upon him any special pressure in this connection; but I venture to submit that the recent purchase of a steamer for him and the fact that the question of the French flag seems to be shaping to a settlement, affords a convenient and fitting opportunity for the address to His Highness of a strong exhortation on the subject of Sur and its connection with the trade in arms and slaves and as to his own position in regard thereto.” 104. The purchase of a small patrol steamer in 1926 has proved no more effective as regards Sur than it did in 1902, whilst the total armed force of the Muscat Infantry which could be made available for despatch to Sur is about 70 men. Such a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. 105. Both the Sultan and the Council of Ministers realise that they are not strong enough to deal with the situation without the support' and assistance of the British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance the little control which the Muscat authorities exercise over Sur will cease. They have definitely asked for such assistance. The prestige of the Muscat Government rests at present on the support which they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the State is impotent. If assistance were withheld the result would be far- reaching, as every part of the country would be affected. 106. A number of Arabs in Oman are of opinion that the British Government are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they would countenance the formation of another independent authority in Jaalan. This, I have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Jaalan. Considered politically and in its bearings on the welfare of the Muscat State and the general peace of Oman, it seems most undesirable that any such claim should be countenanced. The Amirs could not maintain their independence, and the almost inevitable result of such a claim being allowed would tend to foster the intrigues for extraneous support which the Amirs are now active in fomenting. 107. Whether Mahomed bin Naser has the approval of Ibn Sand for hoisting his flag at Aiqa seems doubtful, but the extension of Ibn Sand’s influence to this part of the coast would seem to be undesirable.^ * In 1865 His Excellency the Governor of Bombay pointed out the evil effect of the revival of Wahabi power on the Indian Ocean with regard to piracy and slave trading and that these aggressions threatened seriously to injure Muscat, a power which for several generations past has been the only representative of civilisation and order in Eastern Arabi He proposed that aid be afforded to the Sultan to re-establish his authority in fSur or anv other place on the seaboard of which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabis may have donr^v JI him. (Minute dated 9th October 1865.) y nave deprived 3393 C108. The value of Sur from the point of view of prestige appears to have been realised by Colonel Felly, who wrote in 1869 that if Saiyid Azzan bin Khais were successful in his expedition in Jaalan, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could. 109. It was also realised by the French, who confined all their efforts to undermine the Sultan’s authority to that place. 110. The extension of the influence of the Amirs of Jaalan lias also •caused some uneasiness to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam’s Government. The Council fear that the Imam’s Government may interfere and obtain mastery over Sur, in which case most of the trade from the interior would be deviated to Sur, and the revenues and trade of Muscat would become negligible . 0 111. In 189f) the British Government extended to Saiyid Faisal the guarantee given to his father that they would not allow attacks to be made upon Muscat and Matrah, whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes. In actual practice this guarantee was extended to ail the ports of the Batineh coast, and to Kuryat, at which British subjects were residing, and in 1890 an offer was made by the British Government and finally accepted by the Sultan, of naval assistance for the recovery of Dhofar. 112. If assistance is now to be afforded, the question arises as to what form such assistance shall take, and I venture to* put forward the following remarks on the question. 113. It seems hardly likely that at the stage which has now been reached, Mahomed bin Naser would be deviated from his purpose by moral pressure alone. His attitude will probably be that of the Jenebeh in 1865 : “ We have been threatened before. Nothing has happened. We are quite sure nothing will happen now.” 114. It was suggested last year that economic pressure could be brought on the inhabitants of Sur by preventing their dhows from trading in British ports. This was the policy attempted by Napoleon against England. It failed then. 1 doubt whether it would succeed in the present instance. 115. Naval action has been taken at Sur before, as has been noted in the Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. The presence, of a man-of-war would appear to have a good moral effect at the time, but its influence seems to depart as soon as it has steamed out of sight and the incident forgotten as rapidly as the promises made to former Sultans on their visits there. Beyond levying a few fines and possibly destroying a certain amount of property, the result obtained is meagre. It tends to make British merchants at Sur more unpopular than ever with their customers and forces them eventually to seek their means of livelihood elsewhere.! H 6 . If the administration of Sur is to be brought to that state of efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium demands, if the slave trade and arms traffic are to be stopped, and if effective protection is to be afforded to British subjects trading in Sur instead of allowing them to be * tn 1891-2 caravan roads from Slmrkiyali to Muscat were closet! by Gliafin tribes, ant! trade was deviated from that part of the province to Sur, thereby causing a gloomy prospect for Muscat trade. (Administration Report, 1891-2.) t In bis letter Xo. 97b 8., dated 28th December 1922, to the address of the Foreign Secretary to tin* Government of India, commenting on the elTect of shell fire on Oman tribes, Colonel Trevor writes :— “ It will be seen that the operations dragged on from the 18th October until the 2nd November. This was most unexpected as ihe Muscat Government confidently hoped that the Yal Saad would submit as soon as one of H.M. Ships appeared upon the scene. The Political Agent and I both consider there were good grounds for such a hope, as the last time when the Yal Saad were rebellious the mere threat of bombardment by the then Wazir made them submit and pay their tine at once. I have noticed, however, recently on the Trucial Coast that bombardments are not regarded with so much dread as formerly, and that whereas formerly the threat of a bombardment, or at most the tiring of one or two rounds, was sufficient to make a Sheikh submit, nowadays it has become necessary to carry out a fairlv heavy bombardment to achieve the same result. I can only regard this as one of the unexpected * results of the war.”19 driven out, it would seem necessary to follow the same course as in the case •of Muscat and Matrah. The towns have been transformed from armed camps living constantly under the threat of raids, inlo peaceful and law abiding places as quiet and safe as any town in India. The result has been reached by gradual development of circumstances. Indian troops were landed in 1913, during the rebellion of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam of Tanuf, for the protection of Muscat and Matrah in accordance with our undertaking to defend these towns. After one attack in 1915, when he sustained a severe defeat, Sheikh Isa bin Saleh left these places severely alone. After the Sultan had come to terms with the Imam, a small levy corps under a British officer was formed and paid for by the Muscat Government, and the Indian troops were able to depart. 117. This corps, though very weak numerically, is a constant reminder to the tribes that they cannot raid the place with impunity and their presence is sufficient to restrain any lawless elements there may be in the population. 118. By stationing a battalion of Indian infantry at Sur for a year or two, the same result could presumably be achieved. The State could undertake to build a proper customs house and establish an effective administration there. Increased customs revenues could be utilised for the increase of the strength of the Muscat infantry by 100 men, -eventually to take the place of the Indian troops as soon as the situation becomes sufficiently stabilised. 119. The cost of such a force has been worked out for me in detail by Captain Walker, Commandant, Muscat Infantry, but I have not thought it necessary to include such details in this report. He estimates initial ■expenditure, exclusive of quarters, at Rs. 24,170 ; annual expenditure for the first two years, Rs. 00,000 per annum ; annual expenditure subsequently, Rs. 01,400 per annum. 120. The customs receipts of Sur amounted to— Rs. Rs. 1921 - 45,531 1925 - 42,751 1922 - 30,370 1920 - 37,813 1923 - 50,728 1927 - 38,802 1924 - 37,457 The above amounts were collected under the conditions described above. If the town were properly under control the customs receipts should exceed one lakh. 121 . With the presence of such troops, it might also be possible to induce the British India Company to send their slow mail steamers to call at Sur. Although rhe volume of trade would justify this, the opposition of dhow owners and the general insecurity of the place prevents their doing so at present. Such visits would be a great civilising influence to the place in addition to furnishing an easy means of access and also furthering British trade. G. P. MURPHY, Major, Political Agent and H.B.M. Consul, Muscat, Muscat. 9th October 1928.APPENDIX I. Early History of Sur. The name Sur is stated by Colonel Miles to be identical with that of Tyre or Sur in the Mediterranean and to have been its prototype. He therefore ascribes a Phoenician origin to the place. The Mart of Maceta (mentioned by Arrian in his account of the voyage of Nearchus), Hereen says, was probably Stir, and he adds that an emporium like this, at the entiance of the Gulf, strengthens our idea ol an ancient Indian trade with the Oman coast. At the time of Albuquerque, Sur is described as a small fishing village he passed whilst approaching Muscat. The Portuguese appear to have occupied the place twice, the first period prior to 1633, when they were driven out by Naser bin Murshid al Yarraby, again prior to 1648, when one of the conditions imposed by the Arabs on the Portuguese was that the fort of Sur should be surrendered and razed. APPENDIX 2 . Wrecks and Piracy. In It}-.) the Dam Bu Ah looted a British ship Oscai', which ran ashore on the coast of Jaalan, and plundered cargo to the value of eight lakhs of rupees. The Resident went to Sur, accompanied by 11.H. the Sultan, two fi igates and a squadron, to lecover the property, but succeeded in recoverin° r $ 12,000 and some shawls only. It was remarked at the time : “ Finding that this Chief and tribe, in consequence of their residing in the interior, were wholly untangible by naval means alone, the British authority conceived it useless to attempt force and therefore endeavoured to create such an impression on the minds of the inhabitants of this dangerous coast as would be likely to prove highly beneficial to ail y British ship that might have the misfortune to suffer a similar accident.” (Vide Bombay Government Selections, XXIV, page 199.) In 1833 a piracy attended with cruel and aggravated circumstances, committed on a Cutch No wry oft the coast of Zanzibar, was traced by the Imam to some of the tribes of Sur. He seized the principal offenders and placed them at the disposal of the Resident to be dealt with as he might direct. In 1852 the S.S. Centaur ran ashore near Ras el Hadd. The Bani Bu Ali plundered the whole of her cargo, valued at 10 or 11 lakhs, and destroyed the vessel. In 1904 Jenebeh, of Masirah Island, were responsible for the murder of 17 of the crew of the Baron Inverclyde, which struck a rock near the Kuna Muna Islands. Eight Greeks remained on the ship and were rescued by the S.S. Prome. One ship’s boat was never heard of again. The other boat contained the 17 men mentioned above, who were massacred on attempting to land at Masirah. The ringleaders were shot after trial by the Sultan’s Askaris, in the presence of Major Grey, Saiyid Taimur and a party from II.M.S.
