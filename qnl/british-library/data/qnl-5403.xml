There has been no change in local conditions in favour of the staff, prices of imported commodities having continued to rise. 2) - In view however of the instructions of Circular despatch (K 11643/11643/250) of October 16th, I have made arrangements to dispense with the services, at the end of the year, of one ghulam, the office farash and one grooiji and to reduce the escort horses to two. I have not been able to dispose of the two horses yet as they are over sixteen years old, whilst buyers fear they may be requisi tioned from them for the campaign in Kurdistan. 3) - On the above reduction of establishment, the annual office allowance at the present rates will amount to Krans Thirty nine thousand three hundred and forty five, as shown in column 4 of the detailed statement transmitted herewith, instead of the sum of Krans Forty seven thousand six hundred and sixty (see column 2 of the above statement).

I am to explain that Mr. Henderson’s attention was recently drawn to the embarrassment caused by the recent fall in the value of the kran to employees paid in Persian currency, and in this connexion the attention of Their Lordships is directed to the letter from this department of the 8th April last (K 3657/291/234). It will be observed that the whole of the staff are affected by the increase in the cost of imported household goods, and in the circumstance I am to request that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction the assignment to this post of an office allowance of Krans 47,660 forty seven thousand six hundred and sixty krans a year as from July 1st 1931. I am, etc., (Signed) D.J. Scott. The Secretary to the Treasury.IP) \ COPY (K 8151/8151/234) Extract from despatch No* 4 from Mr. Consul Hoyland (Kermanshah ) dated 19th June, 1931 « With reference to Sir Robert H. Clive*s Circular Despatch No« 846/1/2 of May 1st, 1931, I have the honour to submit an application for the increase of the salaries of the clerical staff of this Consulate and for a small bonus for the servants, together with a recommendation for the increase of certain items of the office allowance affected by the decline in the value of Persian currency, the increased import duties and by the Government foreign trade monopoly Law. 2* A statement showing the movement of prices during the month of May 1931, to which the figures for the years 1929-1930 and 1930-1931, as furnished in Form A 30 transmitted in my immediately preceding despatch of the 30th ultimo have been added for the purpose of comparison, is forwarded herewith. Though there has been no increase as yet in the prices of most of the local produce which commands its lowest figure at this season, the rise in cost of all imported goods is striking and these increases have not reached their highest level. Many of these imported products, such as tea, sugar, matches, &amp;c., are daily household requirements of all native classes, whilst the clerical staff require many other imported commodities, the cost of which is at present very high. 3. The senior clerk of this Consulate, Mr. G. Nahapetian, Krans 800. was engaged in May 1925 at a salary of Krans eight hundred per mensem and has obtained no increase of salary. He is competent, conscientious and hard working and was given an excellent character by my predecessor. Mr. Nahapetian who is50$ is an Armenian born in Persia is married with two children and is hard hit by the increase in the cost of all imported household goods. The rate of exchange at the time of his engagement was Krans 42.50 to the £, with an average of Krans 45 until 1928, when it depreciated gradually to Krans 60 to the £• It now stands at the official rate of Krans 90 to the £, though this forced rate is fictitious, the bazaar rate, at which most prices are fixed, being the Krans 100 to 110 to the £• It will be seen that the purchasing value of his salary, in sterling, has shrunk by over fifty per cent. In the circumstances I feel confident in making a strong recommendation for the increase of his salary by twenty five per cent, i.e. from Krans eight 25% Krans 800. Krans 1000. hundred to Krans one thousand per mensem. 4. The munshi, Mr. Aziz E. Meer, occupied his position since October 1930 having previously served, in a clerical capacity in this Consulate and lastly as head of the ^raq Pass Office at a higher salary, under ray pre decessor. He was well reported upon by Mr. Consul Cowan and his local knowledge and experience have been of assistance to me since my arrival in this country. Mr. Meer is a Jew of Baghdad origin, and is married with a family of four Krans 600. children. His salary of Krans six hundred per mensem was granted with an exchange of Krans 60 to the £ and I submit 25% that it may be increased by twenty five per cent, i.e. to ? 15 o ~ — - Krans 800. Krans eight hundred per mensem. 5. As regards the ghulams, farrash, grooms and gate- ' keepers, they are affected by the increase of the cost of all imported foodstuffs as stated in paragraph 2 above. They are however provided with clothing and this increase does not fall upon them. I recommend that a bonus assessed upon the figures transmitted in the statement showing movements ofN [ V Krans 3,080. 25% Krans 3,850. Krans 1,160. Krans 1,450. of prices may be granted to them. 6. Ihe items of the office allowance requiring urgent revision are those for the clothing supplied to the servants and for the stable in the upkeep of saddlery and s gear, the provision of sundries and the shoeing of the horses most of which, including horse shoes of good quality, are imported. It is difficult at the moment to arrive at an estimate of the amount required for clothing, as the import of materials is prohibited and has caused prices of native homespuns, &amp;c. the quality of most of which is inferior, to rise out of all proportions. I recommend however that the sum of Krans three thousand and eighty, being the annual provision for this item, may be increased by twenty five per cent, i.e. to Krans three thousand ei$it hundred and fifty per annum and that the same increase may be allowed for the stables, fodder excepted, bringing the allowance for the upkeep of saddlery and gear and for shoeing from Krans one thousand one hundred and sixty to Krans one thousand four hundred and fifty per annum.■ Telepho ICTORIA 3820.
