WITH reference to my despatch No^ 79 of the 25th March, I have the honour to state that since that date I have received no further information of any value regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation. Rumours of fighting and of Saudi reverses have reached me from Mecca, and my Indian vice-consul reports the existence of much apprehension there. He also reports that the King goes in fear of his life, in consequence of a message that a party has set out from Sana to assassinate him. He relates with circumstantial detail the precautions that were taken before and after the pilgrimage to ensure His Majesty’s safety. 2. In my telegram No. 45 of the 24th March I referred to the speech which the King was understood to have made on the 22nd March at his annual dinner to notable pilgrims. This speech was reported in the Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd March, but the number was unobtainable in Jedda for several days. It was perhaps deliberately kept back until the pilgrimage should be safely over. When received, it was found to contain the King’s speech, a leading article on the situation, and a communique. The leading article followed closely the general lines of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s statement to me on the 24th March, but was not so precise. The communique contained little more than an announce ment that the King, having achieved nothing by his patience and his negotiations, had ordered the heir apparent to advance to the frontier, with a view to the recovery of the territory invaded by the Imam. I need not trouble you with translations of these documents. I need only note that they do not reproduce Sheikh Yusuf’s statement to me that the Imam had made the evacuation of the occupied territory conditional on the renunciation of Najrari by Ibn Saud; and they do not explicitly foreshadow a crossing of the frontier, though the note struck in the leading article is a note of war, unless the Imam uses the door to peace which the King has left open, by honouring his previous engagements. 3. The King’s speech is fairly hot stuff, but this also reiterates so much that is familiar that a full translation would be wearisome. It begins with the complaint that the King has been done down by the Imam, a man whom he had regarded as his dearest friend. This is followed by a justification of his proceedings in Asir, where he had spent from 200,000 to 250,000 riyals a year, over and above its revenue, after the Idrisi had asked him to take charge. He goes on to accuse the Imam of breaking the agreement reached in December 1931, inter alia by not extraditing the Idrisi after his flight into the Yemen a year later. This leads up to a relation of more recent events, which is chiefly interesting because of certain incidental passages. In one of these the King gives as his reason for patience (apart from the question of expense) the fact that the Imam was negotiating with His Majesty’s Government regarding the nine cantons, and he was unwilling to do anything that might be misinterpreted. In another, he claims that the people of Najran have paid taxes to the A1 Saud since the time of his ancestors, in virtue of letters and treaties still in existence; and he scoffs at the idea that a Yemeni tribal origin can justify the Imam in claiming them as subjects, any more than he himself could claim his cousin Ibn Shalan, or the Imam could claim the many people of Yemeni origin in Syria. In a third passage the King comments bitterly on the fact that none of the Moslem rulers, representatives or parties have sought to effect a reconciliation and to sift the true from the false, but have merely sent useless expressions of their hopes ■and good wishes.mn ihtii ii . „ p f -L QAtb A/Tarch contains a further communique, 4.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 2535/79/25] ■'April 24, 1934. Section 3. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 24.) (No. 91.) Sir, Jedda, April 4, 1934. WITHIN twenty-four hours of drafting my despatch No. 88 of the 31st March, regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation, 1 received an intimation that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had been appointed Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. I gave you in my telegram No. 49 of the 2nd April the main points of our conversation when he paid me his first visit in his new capacity that morning. 2 . I made very rough notes of the ten telegrams exchanged between the two rulers, following on telegrams from the King to the Imam announcing that he had ordered the heir apparent to advance. Although I am keeping a record of them here, I think it unnecessary to burden you with the details of this wordy correspondence. Its chief characteristic is the unrelenting firmness of the King in stating and restating his demands and refusing to be put off by any suggestion that he should stay his hand without obtaining complete satisfaction. 3 . As for the demands themselves, there is little to add to the summary in my telegram No. 49 of the 2nd April, except that the King made a special point of the release of the hostages taken by the Imam in the Faifa-Beni Malik area. The King bases himself expressly on the agreement, which he says was come to by his delegates at Sana in 1927-28, and on the agreement of the 31st December regarding Arwa. He claims that by the former the Imam agreed to leave to him everything north of Waila, but offers for the sake of peace to agree to a neutralisation or partition of the Wadi Najran proper, as distinct from the area Badr-Hadada-Habuna, which he describes as being occupied by the Ikhwan. He repudiates a suggestion, apparently made by the Imam, that the Yemeni invasion of Najran was justified by correspondence subsequent to the Arwa settlement. 4. The statement that the Badr-Hadada-Habuna area is now held by Ihn Saud was new to me. I do not think I had previously heard of Hadada, which appears to be east of Badr. Sheikh Yusuf could not explain what had happened in this area. I surmise that the Ikhwan have held it since December, when it was admitted that certain of the King’s sympathisers had joined forces with the local tribesmen, but denied that they were organised Saudi troops. 5. The King’s telegrams emphasise and confirm his previous promise of pardon to the rebels in the Faifa-Beni Malik area. 6 . In one of the earlier telegrams the Imam begged the King to beware of opening the door for foreign intrigue. The King, in his reply, said that he was alive to this danger, and took credit for having held his hand when he learned that the Imam was engaged in negotiations with His Majesty s Government. When reading these passages. Sheikh Itusuf said that the King had specially charged him to explain the references to the xYngloAemen negotiations in his speech of the 22nd March and in his correspondence with the Imam. They meant that he had wished at the time to avoid any appearance of putting pressure on the Imam not to conclude an agreement with His Majesty s Government. 7. In my comments at the end of the conversation I expressed gi atification at the King’s explanation, saying that I had noticed the expression foreign intrigue.” I developed in some detail the thesis that, whether people liked oi disliked the policy of His Majesty’s Government, it was open and abo\e boar d. Since the Great War they had sought to cultivate friendship with ad Arab 111 e,s in their respective spheres and to promote friendship among them, ihen policy was entirely free from intrigue. I recalled once more the circumstances in vine r the British mission had been sent to Sana. 8 . When urging that it might be prudent to avoid, if possible, any entry into admittedly Yemeni territory, I made it clear that 1 was not speaking m the interest of the Imam, but in that of Ibn Saud. I had heard, I said, not from a2 Yemeni but from a feaudi somce that the I 1 ^ had suited him not to field. If that were so, oould the King t kl ag his territory as a casus bells treat the Imam’s invasion of 'hat he c an o and declared wa.s which Would it suit him now to become mvo^ d we ' e driven out?

He outlined a probable Saudi plan of campaig , which he has fent to the Times. Broadly speaking, he contemplates two main Saudi advances, east and west of the central ridge '^'fastera north to south between Tihamat Asir and Najran. The object ol the eastern advance would be to cut communications with Najran and th ® , occupy Saada. The western advance would be aimed at Medi an d Haiadn.

I laid emphasis on the point that Signor Suvich would be able to obtain any additional mformatio ha dpaired during; his forthcoming visit to London. 2 Signor luvich stated that he could not regard the present hostilities very seriously. No doubt we should hear for some time to come of important victories on each side. At any rate the Italian Government were continuing to Tct in the spirit of the Rome conversations of 1927 and had yesterday sent a tYiPQQno-P to the Imam urging moderation and a settlement. . , As regards the Asir question, the Italian view was and continued to be that it was defirable that Asir should be a small, and more or less independent buffer State I said to him that the reasons for which His Majesty s Government were unable to accept such a position were set out in the letter I had just handed to him, but I felt that the advice given by the Italian Government to the Imam would be much appreciated by my Government. &amp;c ERIC DRUMMOND.

I have now received their comments. Briefly, these ^ f.^Xlian Majesty’s Government, though anxious as always to meet the w shes ol tne lta Government, are unable to share their views as to the desirability of a conierence between British and Italian experts at the present time. hostilities If we may believe the rather confused reports of the last fortnight hostmue between King 7 Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yel “ n ,t erta inl/be useless on a considerable scale. In the circumstances i wou , wavs an( j means to hold a conference, the major object of which was to of arriving at a peaceful settlement of the aispu e.

'T'nortunTtv arise, urge moderation upon both sovereigns, should ui PP t that the Italian Moreover, your letter under reference appeared to suggest that U e nana Government still considered the question of the sovereignty of ^ , as implied that, in regarding Asir as a rightful P ar l°/^ t^Eome His Majesty’s Government were acting at varia reuresentatives during •» «sgi-4r »pi.« their considered view that, quite apait from ^e^ ruled by the Idrisi has in international law the sovereignty o\ j-hprpforc be considered as an ClSrSSM# t ™d“”kin S .&lt; His Government » refrmn [81 cc—3]from addressing to Kins Ibn Sand a formal communication of their recognition of his sovereignty over Asir. The position in international law appears to His Maiesty’s Government to be as follows Prior to the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca of 1926, the Idrisi was an independent ruler exercising sovereignty over certain territories in South-West Arabia By the Treaty of Mecca, the Idrisi handed o\er to King Ibn hand M entire control over his foreign relations, while retaining the government of the internal affairs of his country, apart from financial matters, which were also handed over to Ibn Saud. The result of the Treaty of Mecca was to establish a protectorate by Ibn Saud over the territories of the Idrisi as they existed at that date, and the Idrisi became unable, owing to the fact that he no longer possessed the control of foreign affairs, to alienate to any other Power any of his territories, As a result of the treaty of 1926 the Idrisi ceased to possess the status of an independent person under international law. 1 In 1930, as the result of negotiations which culminated m letters of the 10th October from the Idrisi and from his Council to King Ibn Saud, and as further defined in an arrangement contained in a report signed on the 16th November by representatives of King Ibn Saud and of the Idrisi, the Idrisi handed over to King Ibn Saud the internal government of his territory; and these arrangements were put into force by an order issued by King Ibn baud on the 20th November, 1930, under which the Idrisi territory was governed by a direct representative, appointed by King Ibn Saud under the title of Emir, assisted by. an elected legislative council, the Idrisi merely retaining the nominal position of head of the Idrisi territory under Ibn Saud, with some powers of veto over the decisions of the Emir and the Legislative Council, subject to the final decision of King Ibn Saud. It appears to be perfectly clear that, as the result of the arrange ments made in 1930, King Ibn Saud acquired full and complete sovereignty over the territories of the Idrisi, and that the form of government set up therein became merely part of the internal constitution of the territories of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies as it was then called. The territories over which King Ibn Saud thus acquired sovereignty were the same territories as those over which he had acquired a protectorate under the Treaty of Mecca of 1926, namely, all the territories which were under the sovereignty of the Idrisi, at the moment of the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca This appeared to His Majesty’s Government at the time—and still appears to them—to have been the position at that date. They considered further that King Ibn Saud’s sovereignty over these territories was effective in international law and did not require any express or implied recognition by any other Power to render it legally complete and effective. It was on these grounds that His Majesty's Government (when the question was under discussion with the Italian Government in 1931 as a result of a request from the Hejaz-Nejd Government, which involved entering into correspondence with them on matters concerning Asir) decided that there could be no question of their declining to recognise the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud over Asir, but that, in deference to the wishes of the Italian Government, they could agree to refrain from sending to the Hejazi Government a formal communication of their recog nition. The purport of this Embassy’s note of the 24th July, 1931, appears, however, to have been misunderstood by the Italian Government, vcho seem to suggest in paragraph 5 of their note of the 23rd December last that the inter- pi etation of the Embassy s note, which has now been given them, involves some c egree of conflict with statements made by the British representatives during the conversations held in Rome in 1927 regarding affairs in the Red Sea and South- ,, es r ^P ia - H was, indeed, precisely because there seemed some danger that tte Italian, Government might misunderstand the attitude which iiis Majesty s Government felt bound to adopt in 1931 in entering into correspondence with King Ibn Sand's Government over Asir, and thus recognising, \ implication, his sovereignty over that territory, that they felt it rn^nni 6 ° P 08 .^ 011 to the Italian Government beforehand. They thl &gt; r ^ ret that . th e Italian Government appear to have failed to understand n U f n P ro P ose d by His Majesty's Government in the F£h ZLf Qsf the 24th Ju ! y ’ 1931 &gt; when the y replied to their note of the idtn August, 1931, concurring therein.reference a is g m ide w'lfk Governm ® nt ’f u ' dat ed note of December 1933, reieience is made to the well-known rights” of the Imam over Asir. His i ajesty s Government know of no good grounds for any claim which the Imam may have put forward before the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca to the ar^ .fecu^on 4 uh thebt^ S 0 T reignty and they ^ereforeUld not agree to any .discussion with the Italian Government on the basis that the Imam had a reasonable claim to that area at the present time. I am. however to add that His Majesty’s Government will naturally continue in pursuance of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, not only to refrain from intervention in the present conflict between King Ibn Saud and the Imam but also to avoid all appearance of taking the part of either of the disputants, while seeking, should further opportunities arise, to use their influence in favour of a peaceful settlement. I am further to assure you of their desire to continue to exchange information with the Italian Government regarding the progress of the dispute.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that Signor Suvich referred, in a conversation which I had with him yesterday, somewhat seriously to the situation In Araoia. Bo confirmed the information contained in my telegram No. 126 of the 4th May that three Italian ships were at or were proceeding to the neighbourhood of Eodeida. He explained that there were considerable Italian interests there including petrol stores. On the other hand, the Italian Government were not sending any aeroolanes to the spot. He enquired whether we intended to disembark any men. I said that I had no definite information but that it appeared to me that it vVaS unlikely that we should disembark sailors unless events absolutely compelled us to do so. Signor Suvich said that the news which he now received v/as that the report of the death of the Imam was false. The latter was now rallying his supporters, who were mountaineers and would be serious adversaries ix attacked in their own fascnesses. 2. I thought it wise to say to Signor Suvich that the reason why we had not felt able to do more for the time being than what we had already explained to him was that if we gave modertaing advice to Ibn Saud at the present moment the latter was not likely to t^ke it, and that therefore oar influence for future good would be lessened. I felt sure that he could rely on His Majesty's Government to give such advice if and when a suitable and effective opportunity offered. Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., iv.

His principal object was to receive commuiication v/hicn Italian representative had been instructed to make. Italian Government explained amicably their recent proceedings at Hodeidaln They assured Saudi Government that their policy was one of strict neutrality and that they had no intention of intervening in present conflict. They had made a similar communication to the Imam. 2. Following are main points in information given to me by Fuad this morning., A. The Heir Apparent : s primary object 10 days ago was to guard against danger of Yemeni descent on littoral from the mountains, It was thought that this might best be achieved by securing Saada but the King had later countermanded this in order not zo create a situation from which it might be difficult to recede. Advance v/as therefore suspended and present position was one of an effective though not an agreed truce. B. Telegram from the Imam dated 11th may promised the surrender of Idrisis within 5 days and evacuation of Beni Malik etc within 5.'-N 2 . G. Italian Charge d'Affaires had made comiiunication as above. He had broached the question of appointment of an Italian agent au Fodeidah. Saudi Government were replying that they could not compromise any pre-existing situation by recognising such an agent but would not object to presence in an unofficial capacity of any person whom Italians had in view, 5, Fuad seemed to think developments at (B) oiier deiinite prospect of early peace. Cn my referring to what he had saia about 'guarantee' he intimated that the King would not be over exacting and desired only basis for future harmonious relations with Imam. I welcomed this statement and said that I hoped settlement would be unequivocal, unlike the past arrangement, lack of precision of which had caused so much subsequent trouble. 4. I expressed view that Italian communication was of great importance and value. I refrained iron comment on proposed beyond observing tho.c we had some one at Eodeidan who wa^ connected with Residency at Aden but had not, I tnought, an^ official standing in Ilodeidah.

Please see record of further conversations with Puad in my telegram Mo* 107 and my immediately preceding telegram. Although latter foreshadows possibility of easier situation I still attach importance to the follow ing points. 2. There is no doubt that by 'intervention' Saudi Government moan political or even military action by Italians in support of the Imam. ±ney have probably even envisaged possibility oi eventual Italian protec torate or colonisation of the Yemen. mney have little faith in Italian assurances but believe that nis majesty’s Government are in a position to restrain Italian Gov eminent from intervention in the acovo se-ise. 3. I consider it very important to obviate sus picion of which Ibn Saud is Quite capable tnat -is Majesty'* s Government and Italian Government have some sort of agreement to compress him by simultaneous asser tion of British Blue Line policy and cy Italian machinations to keep him out of the Yemen. 4 0 It is not clear from Clayton’s reports to Colonial Office in 1927 and 1928 how much precise infor mation he gave to Ibn Baud oi conclusions resulting from Home conversations of 1927. ^2 0 5 0 I mentioned, to Fuad tills morning distinction drawn in your telegram under reference. He did not demur to principle that landings for sole purpose of protecting national interests might be justifiable in certain circumstances but it is clear that Saudi Gov ernment would at any time regard oven these with sus picion in the case of the Italians lest they should be inspired by ulterior motives. 6c Latest developments may make further dis cussion of Italian attitude unnecessary. If, however, the necessity is again to arise I feel it would be desirable to take a rather more positive line than that contemplated in paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference c Could I, for instance 5 refer to actual terms of Home conclusions of 1927 saying that para graphs 3 and 4 still represent policy of His Majesty's Government; that they regard principles stated in them as equally binding on Italian Government; and that v.’nile they have no reason to expect Italian Government to depart from those principles they would use all their influence to secure observance of them if occasion arose.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] From SAUDI-AFABIA , Decvoiier.

In further conversation today I gave Fuad gist of your telegram No.80 and your statement in the House of Commons on May 7th« Pointed out affirmation of neutral attitude implied intention of His Majesty's Government not to intervene and said their influence with any third Power notably Italy would be used to diminish likeli hood of intervention. I said it was already being used to ( 2 groups undec:) Italian post remaining on shore at Hodeidah after H.r.S. 'Penzance' had re-embarked British post. I hope I did not go too far, I wished still to deter Ibn Saud from putting embarrassing questions to His Majesty's Government on the following lines - (a) 'What would His Majesty’s Government do if Italians . dii in fo.cK intervene? !t (d) !: Wiil His Majesty's Government advise him secretly as to his nest present course of action, e*go as to whether he should seel; (? compromise) with Imam?' II observed that His Majesty's Government might consider the question (a) too hypothetical to answero I repeated that if the question (b) were put, His Majesty’s Government would certainly want to know King’s objective. It seemed to me that he was unlikely himself to determine these pending developments of the military situation which appeared to me to be the cardinal factor at present although Italian attitude was also importanto I said position might be different if, on his appreciation of present situation as a whole, the King decided to content himself with compliance with his previous demands plus 11 guarantees 5 ’« Such a decision might stimulate interest in the possibility of early settlement, e.g. by mediation* I avoided anything that could suggest that His Majesty’s Government would themselves offer mediation* Fuad decided again to postpone formal question.* He was returning again to Taif this afternoon* Addressed to Foreign Office No 0 107, repeated to H*M* ’'Enterprise 55 No. 13ikL* Decypher.

In the name of Ood the Moat Merciful, the Compasaionate. Orders have already been issued to the forces of His Majesty the King to advance all along the frontier line. The first victory God has granted His Majesty’s troops was the occupation of the city of Haradh by Hamad ash-Shuweyir, the commander of the Tih&amp;ma area. Two forts in the said city remained and did not surrender, but one of them fell while the other is still besieged and has in it as-Sabdni, the commander of Yahya 1 s troops in the Tihama. reports from His Highness the Heir~Apparent the Amir Sa^hd state that the forces he despatched under the command of the Amir Meysal ibn Sa*ad to go through the mountains to Bfiqim captured Aqabat ash-Shatba, which is one of the most important places. The troops then advanced to Yabad village and captured it. They then advanced to and captured the valley of Bab al~Uadtd, which is the strongest natural fortification in those parts. The troops then advanced towards Haqim end besieged it. Most of its forts have fallen into their hands. The last fort is still being bombarded and one corner has been destroyed. It will shortly fall down, please God, Baqim is the^goal to block the way behind the forces of the ImSm Yehya who were causing aggression in our territory in the mountains of j?aifa and Beni M&amp;lik. The Ira&amp;m Yahya h^s in the meantime sent to the Tihama a force to strengthen the fort of Haradh under the command of /Abdurrahman0 ) Abdurrahman ibn 'Abbas, a relative of his* ash-Shuweyir learnt of the arrival of this force so he despatched a force under the command of Ibn ;\bftd. The two forces met at ♦Yadi HairSn between llidi and Luhayya.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 2354/79/25] ^°- 1 - Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 16.) ( No - 79 -) Jedda, March 25, 1934. bir ’ IN mv telegrams Nos. 45 and 46 of the 24th March, I have reported the main noints in my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that morning regarding t e Saudi-Yemen situation. I now enclose a fairly full record of what passed. The discussion covered the ground so completely that I do not think it necessary to cprid vou any further account of the less interesting conversation I had with Taufiq Bev Hamza on the 22nd March, when he brought me the message reported in my telegram No. 42 of the 23rd March. , , , ^ 9 The denouement, which has been so long expected, has taken a rather imexnected shape. When I received the first intimation that Ibn Saud had ordered his troops to advance, I was in some doubt as to whether his apparent desire to localise any armed conflict was due to unwillingness to commit himself too irretrievably to a war which may be disastrous for him, or to unwillingness to let the full importance of the crisis be publicly realised until after the . 3. The King might well shrink from war, if he could avoid it without crushing humiliation. Only a couple of days ago his Director-General of Mi i ary Organisation told a member of my staff that ^/audt Governmen knew aH about the Yemeni army The Imam, he said, could put 12,000 legulars into tn field at onceand could produce another 13,000 regulars and 50,000 irregulars in due wu?se The Director-General added that, in his opinion, Ibn Saud could smash the Imamic army within two months; but, if there be anything in these figures, one canno? thul that Ibn Saud likes the prospect of tackling 75,000 men ° f 7 ^^^^SlTSSasin, howeyeT S s . « the King has decided to take every risk I trust you wdl not th ^ in what I said to the Sheikh. I felt that, even now, there might be^onm chance of averting a declared state of war, if Ibn Saud con , course of events Imam’s territory. I had, indeed, little hope of ‘f^tfemot C longer us'ng in any way, but it seemed to me worth while to make the attempt “0 longer usij general counsels of moderation, but concentia ing . notice. It was all using any and every argument that I could thin' o Yasin was hurryinf the more' necessary to take a line quickly, as ^ 161 ' Feast of Sacrifice back to Mecca for'the pilgrimage, which, followed as it is by the Feast of bacrince, “% p rS.g i cS.”“'E 3 «SJ« H SiKE Ambassador in Rome, and to the Chief Commissioner a, e . relying on being now here, I am keeping her commander ^ him to send any necessary reports to the Comm &gt; Fleet, and the senior naval officer, Red bea Sloops. ^ ave \ T)VA 1 M Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Saudi-Yemen ^ituatio SHEIKH YUSUF YASIN came to see me this morning. T ^ e f ° 0 1 |,° l g r 1 “f 3 main points in a conversation which lasted °^ ei ^ •* ^K-jects in order vays that of the actual discussion, as we came bacc on „ incidentally elucidate them. I have omitted many points which were touched on incidental } ly or are unimportant. [81 q-2]2 •2 The King, said Sheikh Yusuf, was desirous of peace There had been manv occasions in the past when he might have gone to war with the Imam, but n hlr? tkvavs avoided it. He had no territorial ambitions m respect of the Yemen ' His dominions were quite large enough. The fai ure of the Abha Conference and of Ins direct negotiations with the Imam compelled him to defend his rights It was hardly necessary to go into the reasons for his friendship with Hi Majesty's Government. He wished to keep them informed as a duty ot friendship and in order to seek their advice. He was confident that His Majesty, Government were on^hmside^n ^ that he was not sure how much I had been told by Sheildi Abdullah Suleiman aiid Taufiq Bey Hamza. He would, therefore, recapitulate the developments which had produced the present situation. I would remember that at an earlier stage the King and the Imam ac leached a preliminary agreement regarding the determination of frontiers, the disposal of the Idrisi the discussion of the Najran question and a meeting of delegates to draw up a treaty of friendship. The King had thereupon ordered his troops to keep to their positions and to make no advance. Even before that the Commander- in-chief had been directed to refrain from any aggression. ^ 4 Before the delegates met the Imam had taken forward action. He bad sent Abdul Wahhab-el-Idrisi to occupy A1 Ardha, where a kaudi garrison of fifty men were made prisoners. He had made approaches to the Beni * lahk, some of whom took his part, and to the people of I aifa, who resisted. He had occupied both districts, sent officials there and collected taxes. The Imam had stated m reply to remonstrances, that these acts were done before his orders had reached his commanders, and had promised to evacuate the occupied areas, subject to the Kind's pardoning the local dissidents. The King had done this^ but there had been 0 no withdrawal. On the contrary the Yemeni forces in the Beni Malik area had been reinforced. . . ,• Sheikh Yusuf was quite vague as regards dates, and his intormation as O. to the distribution of tribes differed somewhat from that given me by Fuad Bey Hamza. I gathered, however, that the area affected comprised the two mountains called Beni Malik and Faifa, and the tribes bearing those names as well as others like the Abadil and Bil-Ghazi, A1 Ardha being apparently in the country of the Abadil. (The fact is that neither Fuad Bey nor Sheikh Yusut have really precise information, but it may be taken that the most salient teatures ot the disputed area are the two mountains named.) 6 . The position when the delegates met was that the occupation was main tained despite all the promises given by the Imam. The latter had gone s° far as to ask the King to release all prisoners at Jizan, a demand so astonishing that ttie King preferred to ignore it. The assurance of pardon for the local rebels was sent by the Amir Saud through Sayf-al-Islam Ahmed, as that was the only channel available. Sayf-al-Islam Ahmed, however, refused to evacuate until tne conference should have ended and until the Yemeni claim to Najran should been admitted. The King had exercised patience until the end of the negotiations. In the course of these, however, the Imam's delegates had denied any preliminary agreement about the determination of frontiers, the Idrisi, or anything else. - last the King informed the Imam that the negotiations could not be completed, j* long as the unlawful occupation of his territory was persisted in, contrary to preliminary agreement. He suggested that Najran should be neutralised by withdrawal of the forces of both sides, that the Idrisi should be disposed o » had been agreed, and that the Imam should withdraw from the area of tne Malik, &amp;c. . . i ^ In his latest telegram the Imam had asked the King to recognise Ins c to Najran and to withdraw from that area, failing which he could not vaca area of the Beni Malik, &amp;c. . . j n 7. In the end the Imam’s failure to keep his promises and his ac 1 ^ sending reinforcements and stirring up trouble among the tribes had ^ the King to order the Amir Saud to advance. He had informed the Imam ^ intimated that he would be prepared to resume negotiations, if he, the ’ would evacuate the occupied area, discuss Najran and proceed with the tie friendship. The Amir Saud had set out on the 22nd March, having been pr two days earlier by some of his troops. There had so far been no clash. Q f 8 . After thanking Sheikh Yusuf, I referred to the King’s eX P] es in( j ee d, confidence that His Majesty’s Government were on his side. They were,3 lg had been Imam, but ;pect of the f the Abha m to defend : ndship with J s a duty oi I is Majesty's i I had been d, therefore, 3n. I would 1 reached a s disposal of delegates to iis troops to Commander- on. He had garrison of Malik, some nad occupied id stated, in had reached abject to the at there had i Malik area formation as ;iven me by rised the two ose names as rently in the h Yusuf have t features of on was main- ;one so far as hing that the al rebels was was the only rate until the At completed, so intrary to the ralised by the isposed of a of the Beni iise his claini tiot vacate the mated by the friendliest dispositions toward him, but they had never passed a ^dffment the elements for which were lacking. The quarrel related to three areas. FTstlv there was the littoral of Asir, where the position was pretty clear, i.e., the Kine 1 held it and the Imam had asserted a claim to it without having attempted to enforce his claim. Secondly, there was the mountain area, which fell to be subdivided into two parts, as part of it had belonged to the former Idrisi territory, which the King claimed in virtue of a cession by its previous ruler, while part of it belonged to what was called Asir Surat, where the King’s claims rested on some different basis. Thirdly, there was Najran. 9 I said that the message sent to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 22nd March had suggested to my own mind two questions, one of which I could not put to a subordinate secretary, though I had asked him the other. They were these : (1) If the objective were the recovery of territory which the King considered to be his, why should it be contemplated as necessary to cross into territory which was admittedly the Imam’s? (2) Was it certain that the acts complained of were those of the Imam and not merely those of Abdul Wahhab, the most strenuous member of the family which had ruled Asir ? 10. Sheikh Yusuf took the second question first. He said there was no doubt whatsoever that the Imam had sent his forces, had installed his officials and had collected taxes. 11 . In reply to my first question, Sheikh Y r usuf said that he had no knowledge of military affairs. It might be necessary to enter Yemeni territory to get the best access to the areas to be recovered. &amp; 12. This, I said, did not quite agree with the Amir Feisal’s message. He had spoken of an advance to the frontier and to the possible necessity for crossing it, when it had been reached. I urged that any invasion of the Imam’s territory would mean war. Sheikh Yusuf asked whether the Imam had not been guilty of aggression, when he entered Saudi territory. I said that, if the King were sure of his title he could no doubt have regarded this as casus belli. He had prudently preferred not to do so because it did not suit him. If he entered the Imam s territory he would be putting the Imam in a position to treat his action as hostile and to declare that he had provoked war. This might not suit him either. The position to-day as I saw it was that no formal state of war existed. The position would be very different if, in the immediate future, there were a definite war, the outcome of which no one could foresee. It was generally thought that the King intended to produce this state of affairs immediately after the impending festival, and Sheikh Yusuf himself had just used the phrase, when the war begins. 13. To reinforce my argument that the King should not precipitate a dennite state of war by invading the Imam s territory, I reminded bheikh Yusuf that the King was a party to a pact, the Kellogg Pact, the renunciation clause of which did not apply to the present case, but which condemned war. The King would have a position to defend not only militarily but politically. 14. I made it clear throughout that I was speaking merely tor myseit. Indeed, I observed, I was saying much more than my Government would e\ei say probably. I was not criticising the King. I was thinking of two interests, that of the King and that of peace. , . , 15. The following further points of some importance came out during e conversation :— (a) Sheikh Yusuf said that the King was on perfectly sound ground as regards Jebel Beni Malik and Jebel Faifa, which had been express y mentioned at the time of the Arwa settlement. I said this was new o me. Sheikh Yusuf said that, when the Imam accepted the King s award, the Imam had expressed disappointment at not getting more, but had said that he would abide by the award and had mstruc e is delegates not to pursue the question of the Jebels Malik ana rai a. This had always been taken to mean that he agreed to their being regarded as Saudi. . 1 „ , T . x -a (b) When Sheikh Yusuf referred to a Saudi withdrawal from Najran, I sai we had understood that there were no feaudi forces in that area. Sheikh Yusuf said that there had been forces from Wadi Duwasir at the northern extremity of the valley. W hen the Y^emeni forces go o Habuna and saw Saudi forces in the neighbourhood, the Yemenis retired.Sheikh Yusuf said that it had been decided to publish the “ Green Book' previously mentioned. It would contain all the documents and show clearlv that-the King's action was justified. (d) Sheikh Yusuf thought it unlikely that the King would go to the from. There had been some idea that he might, but he had no present intention of doing so. ANDREW RYAN.

The Italian Sovernment were anxious to know whether His Majesty’s Government contemplated any approach to the two belligerents &amp;s a result of this telegram, and if so, the Italian Government, fearing lest the situation should further deteriorate, wished to make it clear that they would be disposed to take similar action, with a view to furthering a peaceful settlement, in agreement with the British Government. In making this communication the Italian Government were inspired by the spirit of the conclusions of the Rome Conversations of 1927. 2, I now have the honour to inform Your Excellency In reply to this communication that His Majesty’s Government fully share the desire of the Italian Government to do all in their po^er to help bring about a gettlement of the present dispute. They have, indeed, ever since the dispute first/ 8 Excellency Monsieur Mno (Jrt.ndi, etc,, etc,, etc., i &gt; $ 1 mi ir* i ^ r i Mfirst showed signs of becoming acute, loat no opportunity to urge counsels of moderation on King Xbn Saud, and they think that King Xbn Sand ires influenced by this advice in making the repeated efforts which he undoubtedly did to reach a peaceful settlement with the Iraum and In postponing an actual outbreak of hostilities for so long* As the Italian Government are imve, His Hajesty’s Government also took the opportunity of the recent visit to Sanaa by the Hesident at Aden to urge similar counsels of moderation on the Imam. 8. Unfortunately, however, these counsels of moderation did not suffice to avert a rupture; and His Majesty’s Government cannot but feel that, in view of this experience and of the present situation consequent upon the actual outbreak of hostilities, the conditions v- .c might make any effort at mediation useful do not at present exist* In these circumstances, while they will continue to watch for any favourable opportunity to do whatever may lie in their power to further the oause of the re-establishment of peace, they feel that nothing would be gained by any attempt at mediation at the present stage* I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Your Excellency’s obedient servant, (For the Secretary of State).2940/79/25). 1 -• To SAUDI-AMBIA .

According to Fuad Italian Charge? d’Affaires confirms the fact that tho Imam is alive. I understood from the former confidentially this morning that Ihn Baud is not too happy about the possibility of counter attack in the interior and is pressing forward in Saada direction. Fuad knew nothing of march on Sanaa reported in 'London wireless news. The King’s principal pre-occupation seems to bo however the danger of intervention of Italian’s,vanethcr for tneir own purpose or in support of the Imam.

I questioned Fuad as from myself as to King’s intention. Issue emerging from our conversation was whether King would he satisfied with compliance with his previous demands or was Pent on conquest of the whole Yemen or contemplated conquest of (?littoral) e.g. as far as Mocha and Zehid and inland to Bajii which was I find in 1927 Ibn Baud’s idea of what could he claimed as Idrisi territory. Fuad had as I expected no answer. He attaches enormous importance to question whether I.^am is alive or dead and expressed belief that he was alive as a telegram from Imam addressed to Abdullah Hazir and apparently quite recent came through today. I understand Saudi attitude to be that if Imam were dead all Yemen would be at their mercy but Fuad admitted that if he were alive his military reactions might still be formidable and that final result would depend on fresh bout of war. Fuad said there was news from 3ada area, but professed not yet to know what it Fuad pressed me hard as to likelihood of Italian intervention o o «intervention and as to attitude of His Majesty's Government. He even sought my personal advice as to whether Saudis should, go to Moeha 0 I was as cautious as our relations allow. I said my purely personal i td ress lea was that they need not now fear any serious Italian intervention at Hcdeidah hut that the further south the Saudis went the greater the danger of Italian intervention might he. I suggested that every thing must depend on the course of events and especially on military developments. Fuad's line was that if His Majesty's Government showed their teeth Italians could do nothing. I refused to roreshadow attitude of His Majesty's Government. Can you give me line as to conduct of similar conversations in future? I cannot reiuse all dis cussion if I am to maintain present cordial relations and encourage confidence 8 Fuad also asked about attitude of French who he said were also sending a sloop to hodeidah.

Private pro perty was reported still intact. His Majesty’s Ship “ Penzance ” at once pro ceeded to Hodeida in order to safeguard the interests of the British community there, consisting mainly of some 300 British Indians.

His Majesty’s Ship “ Penzance ” is still at Hodeida. Apart from the cap ture by Saudi forces of the Yemeni ports of Medi, Loheia and Hodeida, His Majesty’s Government have no trust worthy information regarding the posi tion in the Yemen. I would add, as to the general position, that His Majesty’s Government have observed an attitude of strict neutrality towards the conflict be tween Ibn Saud and the Imam, with both2922/34. „ + KuW ait Intelligence Summary No.l for period extract -vuv-a i&amp;34 to 15th April 1934&gt; riath nsv/s aitd war ih thicsk; . 14 . (i) As mentioned elsewhere little news is allowed to reach Riath apparently from the Yemen front, and what reaches is carefully censored. (ii) On 12th April 1934, a wireless message from Mecca, addressed to the Shaixh of Kuwait through the Saudi Minister at Baghdad was received in Kuwait. The contents were as follows: 'The orders issued to the army of His Majesty the King to push forward across the frontier have already been given you. The first victory that God conferred upon His troops was the occupation of Haradh by Hamad ash-Shuway'ir, Commander of the Tihama area. Two forts however kept on resisting till finally one surrendered. The otner wmch is occupied by A1 Sabbani. Commarxier of Imam Yahya&gt; s forces in the Tihama, is still holding out. News has been received from His Highness the Wali »Ahd Amir Saud to the effect that the forces he pushed forward, under the leadership of Ameer Faisal bin9a’ad, through the mountains to Baqum, have captured *Aqabat Shatba - a most important post. They afterwards proceeded to and captured the village of 'Yabad” and the passage of 'Bab-ul-Hadid w , which is the best naturally fortified p.ss through the mountains. Later the army advanced and besieged Baqum, most of the forts of which fell in hands, and they the troops are now bombarding the which will shortly surrender, Inshalmah. Baqum has al y been the aim of our forces who transgressed oui country the mountains of Faifa and Bani kalik. Ameer Faisal captured the barracks there on the 22nd Dhil Hujjah (7.4.34.)/2. ^ ^ 34 ^ It is 11 hours distant from Sa» dah for a foot man. In the meantime a force which had been sent by Imam Yrfiya under the leadership of a relative of his, one Saiyid . A bdur Rahman bin Saiyid Abbas by name to Tihama for the relief of the fort of Haradh, was met by Hamad-ash-Shuway'ir who sent a detachment to meet it under the leadership of Ib n Abbud. Both forces met at 'Wadi Hiran' between Midi and Luhaiya. Our army routed and dispersed Imam Yahya’a force. The latter then returned to Medi and laid siege on it. ?0R3IGN.' (iii) On 11th April the Shaixh received a telegram from the 'Moqattam' newspaper of Egypt, quoting a telegram from al Sanaa dated the 9th April. The contents were as follows: 'San'a, the 9th April. The stay of the 'Adarisa' (Xdrisis) in their homes in Asir, while a conference was being held there, was taMen by King Ibn Saud as a sufficient cause for declaring war against Imam Yahya. He attacked Hejran and Haradh, where the Imam's forces returned his attack with a conflagration of fire. A battle which took place in Nejran resulted in the heavy defeat of the Wahhabis and in their retreat to a point beyond the frontier. The Idrisis contingents in the Tihama are alsomoving forward. Opinion here is much perturbed as to the fate of Saiyid Abdulla al Wazir (of the Wafd) oecause he is cut off at Abha and no news has been received from him since some days. The violent abuse which has appeared in the Hejaz communiques against the Imam YaHya has made the worst impression upon the minds of the Yamanites. tribes are proceeding to the battle front, and the Yaman nation is eager to rescue the Hejaz f*om bon g(iv) A message from Aden to the Shaikh dated 9th April stated that the Yaman forces were moving to meet Bin Saud's offensive.

He understands that some 10 or so men have been disembarked at Hodeidah from Azio but his information is that we have also disembarked a few men for the purpose of keeping order. He added that instructions had been given to local authorities to keep in contact with air officers. Imam had told Italian Government that he could not be responsible for lives and property of Europeans at Hodeidah and it was witn a view to being prepared for any emergency that ships and some troops were despatched. Italian Government will not however disembark more men than are strictly necessary for this purpose. They felt that as they could not send aeroplanes the measures taken were required. Signor Suvich stated categorically that we should have no cause for alarm. He believed that Saudi forces had not yet reached the town tut he observed that exact information, owing to difficulties of communications, was very difficult to obtain.

They may no longer attach importance to it now even if one Invia is aliv'e. 2. I am convinced that Ton Gaud wants no mediation but felt special need for support in rejecting that of the Kins of Sgypt owing to the danger of incurring odium ty rcfusin, the intervention of a koslem monarch outside Arabia, He has refused all appeals to suspend hostili ties since 1-Larch 2Gnd. Sven if he did not misconstrue the suggestion at (B) as a pro-imam move by His Majesty's Government he. would certainly reject it, 3. Paragraph 3 -and first sentence of paragraph 4 of your telegram, under reference are unanswerable unuil more is known of the real military situation, Hoaeidah has afforded no test of this hut has created a sense of victory and if Saada falls I shall expect Ibn Gaud to try for Sanaa, Only then shall we know the will and capacity for resistance on the side of the Imam who if ali-ze might still use his almost Intact army with sufficient offset to produce stalemate and possible basis lor eventual mediation. At present there is no oasis for it aid little reason to suppose King would now be sauiofied with compliance with his previous demands.(I*? ^ 2 . 4. I suggest that I should be authorised to ask Fuad whether he still regards the question as important, and if he says yes, use first sentence of your suggestion to answer adding that, if the Saudi Government should reject the King of Egypt, His Majesty's Government would appreciate the reasons for this, but I hope that Ibn Saud will consider whom he would prefer if the course of events should produce basis for mediation. I think this would suffice but if I could add the hint that His Majesty's Government would in case of need dissuade King Fuad from accepting the rfile of mediator, at any rate until other possibilities had been explored, the effect would be greater. 5. The Netherlands Charge d'affaires tells me that the Imam recently asked the Netherlands Government to intervene. He thought similar applications had been made to other Governments with whom the Imam is in relations including His Majesty's Government.

The Egyptian Govein- ment were not in relations with the Hcjaz and any Egyptian over tures towards Ihn Saud might well only bring a snub to Egypt. His personal relations with Ibn Send were difficult; and it was ridiculous for the Wahibis to pose as the Puritans of Mohammedanism. It was common knowledge that Ibn Send took a new wife each week end that his heir habitually drank too much. I mention this to show that any approach by King Fuad to Ion Saud is unlikely.

Rorriv conversations to preventing defeat of Imam ’ey Ibn Saud or to Italian doctrine of balance of power in Arabia. Both Governments are indeed bound by paragraph 3 of those con clusions not to intervene in any conflict between rulers in question 'which, despite the efforts oi the two Governments \ towards pacification, may break out'. 2. You should remind the Italian Government of the foregoing. If 'spirit of Rome conversations is invoked, you must point out that Fis Fajesty’s Government have dou^ their best consistently to prevent hostiliuies and to a.c 0 Q rrioderation on both sides, Italian suspicion of Brioxsh policy in Arabia - if I rightly interpret your telegram - appears to be based on some unjustified notion that His Majesty’s Government’s inability to exercise greater influence on Ibn Baud is excuse for not intervening to check victorious career of this ruler. 5 0 i do not wish to exacerbate Italian Government or lo impair present system of co'-operation cased on non intervention, but your telegrams necessitate the above observations; and, in view of the embarkation of Italian troops .o.IS4J - vn +vip Ost/i a to land at Kodeidah, I do not like the r troops on ai.e i n vour telegram ho» 123 'if present events are quo v allowed to talce their course • • • -' Such words are in conflict with paragraph 3 of the Home conclusions already quoted.

If Ibn Baud is tent on conquest of Yemen no action short of forcible intervention would stop him. Appeals to suspend hostili ties would be useless. If on the other hand he is prepared to be moderate, line proposed in that telegram seems most promising. 4. You should therefore also inform Italian Govern- rent that His Majesty's Government are urgently examining the best method of furthering a peaceful settlemenu, Mi an they have made their views on this point clear no the Saudi Government and that, while they consider an at any aucempu • at direct intervention would be both unjustified and i.n- eflective, they will continue to use their influence ao Jedda to advise moderation.

His Majesty^ Government believe there to be practically no European residents at Hcdeida, though there are a considerable number of British Indians and other foreign Orientals, who are already being taken care of. To land anything like the number of troops now intended could hardly be regarded as otnerwise than intervention from //hicn our two Governments undertook to abstain in paragrapg 3 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927 and would tend to make the position of any Europeans still in Hodeida yet more, instead of less, dangerous and thus defeat the very object tehthe expedition professes to have in view.

He would not admit that this was the King’s own impression hut that is of course the probability we have to reckon with. The King had told him to repeat asseverations of his Own friend and to refer to following reasons for apprehension:- (1) Penzance visit to Medi (2) British mission to Sanaa (3) Failure of His Majesty’s Government to give him the lead which he hoped for when taking them into his confidence at all stages of his quarrel with Imam. (4) Press reports that His Majesty’s Govern ment did not wish him to conquer Yemen lest he should refuse to abide by Anglo-Yemeni, treatyo (5) Appearance of suspicion in regard to protection of British subjects e.go at Medi, (6) Blue line note. I dealt with (1) and (5) on lines Indicated in telegram under reference. Fuad himself admitted that (2) had been complei&gt;ely explained. (3) was merely preamble to (4) and I ignored it* As regards (^) Fuad conveyed King’s assurance as from now that if he became ««&gt;«v. ec£ca e ruler of Yemen he would observe agreement with Iriim in regard to Aden protectorate. I said I knew nothing of press reports referred to and was sure that His Majesty's Government had not entertained any suspicions for the simple reason that they had not envisaged Saudi conquest of Yemen as a practical possibility. As regard (6) see my telegram No.83. I attach little Importance at present to these references to possibility of overrunning Yemen. ?uad spoke in the sarnie conversation of prospect of early settlement of constitutional basis of King's derm-.nds being effectively satisfied. Eulers appear to be still in correspondence and Abdullan vfezlr reac-.ec y.ecca yesterday. Situation might be complicates, if Ibn Saud now pressed for an indemnity but I have heard no hint of this here. Fuad sounded me as from himself as to whether His Majesty's Government might not proclaim their neutrality and issue Order in Council. I fenced ti.ls.

Meanwhile, a difficult situation is developing vis-a-vis the Italians. Prom 3ir Eric Druniiiond's telegrams 123 ana 124 of 4th May below, it will be seen that the Italians, as already anticipated, are extremely anxious to be closely associated with future developments in this area ana would like us to bring such pressure as we can i on/ j-lon Ibn 3aua to compromise with the Imam. That, as the Ambassador realises, woula be very dilficult to ao. But apart from their activities through the diplomatic channel, the Italians, who haa originally sent a minelayer and trawler from Eritrea, with wnich the PENZANCE established cordial relations, to Hodeiaa, are now reported in a telegram not yet received by us to be despatching 400 troops in the C3TIA to be landed at Hodeida in response to a request from the Imam to the Governor of Eritrea to take steps to protect European subjects at Koaeida. The very difficult possibilities to which the despatch ana landing of such a force may give rise are obvious. It is, however, to be hoped that before it reaches Hodeiaa the Saudis may have occupied the town. The PENZANCE meantime reports that all is quiet ana sees no need for special landing.of troops. 3. a further difficult situation is caused by the fact that E00 Yemenis with 2 officers have arrived on the Island of Kamaran. Strictly speaking, they ought to be interned. But it will he remembered that the title to Kamaran is between the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne, and while we in fact administer it, it is probably arguable that we are not entitled to intern refugees or the like. 4. The Colonial Office telephone that Colonel tfeilly has telegraphed that while ne cannot say that no risk is involved to the safety of Aden in tne despatch of 40 police under Captain Bopner to Hodeida, to which reference is made in the submission on P.z. below, he thinks the risk is snail and that it was worth taking. The risk, such as it is, would, ne admits, oe substantially increased if the further party of 109 referred In para. L of the minute on P.Z. were despatcned.

Drummond in Rome in connexion with the situation which has developed at Hodeida, I discussed the drafts which we had prepared with Oliphant and Vansittart. 2. As I explained at the meeting, Oliphant had at first been inclined to accept the suggestion of the Commander of 'Penzance” that it would be desirable to invite the Italians to send their ships to Hodeida if this step seemed likely to make any real difference in assuring the safety of the British colony at Hodeida. On further consideration, however, and in view of the fact that the | Italian sloops are now known to be too small to be able | to afford any material assistance, Oliphant and /ansittart both came to the conclusion that it would be a mistake to invite Italian co-operation. Phey u 1 c not that moral/ J.G. Laithwaite Esq.moral effect of the presence of these two small vessels would be at all likely to prove a decisive factor, while the risks of our taking the initiative in asking the Italians to send sloops might easily prove serious. If, for example, the Italians should decide to attempt any kind of intervention in the present conflict, and eventually become embroiled with Saudi forces, the fact tnat His Majesty’s Government had taken the initiative in asking them to send their sloops to Hodeida might enable them to represent that subsequent events were the consequence of a step which they had only taken at our request and in order to meet our wishes. The despatch of Italian sloops to Hodeida m‘ ght in fact prove to be the thin end of a dangerous wedge, and there were strong objections to our doing anything which might put us in the position of 3 having a.ctively supported such a step. 3. I explained the view which we had taxen at the meeting, that, as the despatch of the Italian ships was almost certainly inevitable in any case, we might 0.0 better to make a virtue of necessity and meet the Italians half-way over it, rather tnan to tn^m chance of representing us as having been opposed to idea/idea of co-operation. It was eventually decided, however, that the balance of argument lay definitely against inviting Italian co-operation, and the telegram - as you will see from the copies which are now being sent to you officially, vias amended accordingly. 4. You will now see from Jedda telegram No. 87 of May 2, of which copies are also being sent over to you officially, that the Saudis seem likely to occupy Hodeida and instal a regular administration there in the immediate future, and that Ryan himself deprecates any concerted local action with the Italians. This of course much strengthens the case for not inviting Italian co-operation, so that it is just as well that our telegram did not go in its original form.

If true this report may account for critical situation which seems to have developed at Hodeidao 2* Immediate objective of His Majesty’s Government must clearly be to secure safety of colony of approximately 300 British Indians in nodeida. They are therefore prepared to agree to any measures which British naval authorities and Chief Commissioner at Aden consider essential for this end, proposed air demonstration is being authorised, and instructions are being sent to H.i . Ships 'Interprise' and 'Hastings', which are only other British warships available, to join 'Penzance' at Hodeida. as soon as possible, 'enterprise should arrive about May 6th and 'Hastings' about may 3th. As regards proposed despatch of troops from Aden, for your confidential information, there are no suitable troops2 . troops a.va. 1 .l 0 t)le s a.nd m any caso landing of any foreign ground forces might lead to even greater difficulties, particularly if Saudi troops should arrive on the scene. 3. As regards proposal of Commander of 'Penzance” that Italian authorities should immediately he asked to send ship, His Majesty’s Government understand that Italians preha,hly have two small ships available in Eritrean ports, which could reach Hodeida within one or two days. On general political grounds however His Majesty’s Government are not anxious to encourage Italian intervention. In any case Italian ships appear to he too small to he able to give much material assistance. 4. It is, however, important that the Italian . government should be informed without delay of situation which has arisen, of presence of 'Penzance' at Hodeida., and of measures, such as despatch of warships and air demonstration from Aden, which are being taken. You should inform them accordingly. 5. Please telegraph whether Italian government have any similar or further information regarding situation and, if so, what, if any, action they contemplate.

Sir A, Ay an, (Jedda), ^ 1 hay 2nd. 1934. Fuad described to me this morning latest correspon dence between Ibn Saud and the Imam. The latter tele graphed some days ago claiming to have evacuated Fa j ran and requesting suspension of hostilities in consideration of promising to fulfil the King's other conditions within ten days. The King sent reasoned refusal. The Imam telegraphed again yesterday disclaiming ulterior motives and saying, to show his good faith, he had explained the position to the King of Egypt and asked him to mediate. The Saudi Government suspect one or both of following explanations of this move. It may be result oi intrigue between King Ghazi and other shereefs and King of Egypt. The Imam may also have acted at the instigation oi Italians who would, rely on their great influence with the King of Egypt to swing the situation in the imam's xa^our. Ibn Saud seeks the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to what attitude he should observe if mediation should in fact be offered by King Fuad with whom he is not in relations. Fuad pressed for early reply. The neutral course may seem to be to refuse advice This,however,would probably be construed by Ibn bundas proof of inclinerence of His Majesty's Government to liis interests and readiness on their part to leave Mm at the mercy of political intrigues of King of jipypu, Italians and Shereefs after he has won the first round in a straight fight with Imam. I have difficulty in making any positive suggestion except that King of Egypt snould be dissuaded from attempting mediation which would probaoly be of little use and his rSle in which would be extremely suspect In Ibn Baud's eyes. Ine whole position may be affected by the Imam's deatn if report which reached Fuad later to-day is confirmed.

(1) Assurance reported in my 73 related only to measure ty Saudi authorities themselves to safeguard British interests in places they night occupy. I do not regard them as covering naval visit to Medi which was arranged before it was certain which side was in possession^ (2) Intimation could not te sent to Saudi Government until 1 was assured late on April 28th of approval of His Majesty’s Government. It was delivered at Jedda branch of Ministry of Foreign Affairs about noon yesterday. x anticipated any representations by ?uad by saying as from &lt;/oeli in conversation this morning that I viewed with pained surprise the attitude of Amir Faisal who had treated the visit as if it had been made to a Saudi port and had refused facilities '-■0 commander whereas visit had been made in conditions of extreme agency to a place outside Saudi territory where the position was ,J uknown to me on April 27th although it was subsequently found to ^ ave ^ ee n occupied on the previous day.

Fuad suggested secret notice might be given us of intended bombardment to enable us to warn British subjects. I considered this undesirable as it would be of little practical use and acceptance of suggestion would tend to compromise our freedom of action. I therefore headed him off but asked for earliest possible intimation of actual occupation of and establishment of Saudi authority in any important place.

Two hundred Arab refugees have arrived on the Island of Kameran, including the military commander of Hodeidah. It is understood that the civil administra tion at Hodeidah has broken down. A number of British subjects and other Europeans are still there. Prince Seif-ul-Islam, eldest son of the Imam, who was in command of the country to the north of Sana, has fled (adds a Reuter message). ***The war in the south-west of Arabia, between the Imam of Yemen and King Ibn Saud, the most important Sovereigns of Arabia, concerns the possession of the dis puted. provinces of Asir and Nejran. 3 yf ’712b 5000 3.33 The Wahabi Advance The procrastinations of the Imam of Yemen may yet rob him of his Throne. In March he provoked the hostility of his redoubtable neigh bour the King of the Hejaz and Nejd by delaying to withdraw the troops who had occupied disputed territory in the course of the long negotiations between the two Arab States. An agreement had been reached when the news of this trespass reached the Wahabi King. His protests were unheeded; the Imam’s soldiers did not budge and the Wahabi army marched southwards. The first encounters went against the Yemeni troops; the important coast town of Midi was lost and the Imam asked for an armistice. It was granted on condition that he withdrew his forces from the disputed oasis of Nejran, returned the hostages taken from Wahabi territory, and handed over certain chiefs of the family of the former rulers of Asir, who had rebelled against the King. It was in all proba bility the last demand that decided the Imam to resist; there is a strong feeling among Arabs against the surrender of political refugees and such a humiliation would have injured his prestige with his none too contented subjects. But as his recent proclamation to his people shows, he had risked a war without making the necessary military preparations. Optimism—or parcimony—had induced him to delay calling out and equipping his tribal levies to support his small regular army until his trained men had been badly beaten and were either retiring in disorder or deserting to an enemy who pays his soldiers regularly and, as Mr. Philby explains on another page, has a plan of campaign and a fairly modern equipment. According to the latest news from Aden, Hodeida, the Imam’s chief port, is being evacuated by his orders; refugees are arriving at Kameran island and a British warship is now lying off the town, where a number of British Indians and Arabs of Aden are engaged in trade. Her presence will no doubt serve to maintain order until the arrival of Ibn Saud’s disciplined troops. The effect of these reverses on the Imam’s prestige is likely to be disastrous. He has taxed his people heavily for the upkeep of an army which now proves to have been ill-equipped and irregularly paid. He has kept them in submission by seizing thousands of hostages. It would be difficult to put too highly the predicament in which he now finds himself. © ^ Departmen lvulc r \F&lt; a WAHABI ADVANCE YEMENIS EVACUATING HODEIDA FROM OUR CORRESPONDENTS ADEN, May 2 The Wahabi troops are reported to be advancing on Hodeida, the port of Sana, and to have already captured three small towns in the Tehama between Midi and Hodeida, which is 110 miles to the south of it. The Zeidi Imam of the Yemen has ordered the evacuation of Hodeida, and MoraLBirk \ Nejran W &gt; '&lt; \&amp;a Sa£la ^ 3&gt;,\ Jauf .Sana ^ rFarsanlS- JL !IliT&lt;cTn55 Pjjj/ijiManakha SaitalFakih bW ¥ ,4- foWta.^ ahej. /SO “ADEPT ■(9674) Tc H.M. sloop Penzance and the British steamer Ayamonte (845 tons) are convey ing refugees to Kamaran Island. Bin Haig, a prominent Yemeni leader, is reported to have been killed, and Yemeni troops are said to be going over to the Wahabis owing to lack of pay and supplies. The Wahabi troops are equipped with armoured cars and wireless. CAIRO, May 2 It is reported from Jedda that the Wahabis are advancing on Hodeida, which is expected to fall at any moment. On the other hand fierce fighting is reported from Sada, to which large Yemeni reinforcements were sent early this week. One of the few Yemeni aero planes was brought down during the fighting there. There are unconfirmed rumours here of a revolt at Sana and of the death of the Zeidi Imam. ** Hodeida, after its evacuation by the British m February, 1921, was occupied by the then independent Idnsi Emir of Asir. The Emir Mustafa, an insurgent member of the Idrisi family made himself independent Emir ot Hodeida in April, 1924, and was not turned out by the Emir of Asir until October of that year. In March, 1925, the Zeidi Imam of the Yemen captured the town in his successful war with the Idrisi. ____ MR. PHILBY’S PREDICTION Writing from Mecca on March 24 Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby, in explaining the Wahabi plan of campaign, predicted the course of subsequent events: — On the other side of the mountains the Wahabi forces are strongly concentrated at Jizan and Abu Arish to hold any attempt on the part of the enemy to break through along the plain Contingents from these centres are gathered at Samta, on the frontier, to advance on Midi, the most northerly coastal outpost of the Yemen This force will have the advantage of mechanical transport as well as the important sympathy of the Shafai tribes of the Tehama. If, therefore it can occupy Midi and Haradh (a few miles inland) rapidly, there will be nothing to check Sis further advance to Loheia on the coast, and thence to Hodeida itself.&amp; flotes.

It is understood that Eeuter reports the death of the Imam. There is no official confirmation of this but Messrs. Gellatly Hankey have received a similar rumour which is said to emanate from Sana.. £+ The Admiralty telegrams now attached make it clear, however that Ibn Saud f s forces are, for practical purposes, in control of the sea- coast as far south as Hodeidah and the reverse which this involves cannot but be a very serious blow to the Imam. From the telegram of to-day (flagged B), it will be seen that the situation in Hodeidah itself is very serious, that the local inhabitants are likely to be reluctant to allow the 300 British subjects in the town to leave in the hope that their retention/ /JHinute . retention will provoke early intervention from outside. While some of these British subjects are probably no doubt Somalis or inhabitants of the Aden Settlement, it is not unlikely that they may include a certain number of British Indians, directly ibis Office is/concerned only in so far as British Indians may be affected, but Colonel Reilly is being asked to keep the Government of India in touch by telegram so long as the situation remains serious. The question of the action to be taken at Hodeidah by H.M. ships and the desirability of inviting the Italians to send a ship to cooperate will be discussed later this evening. Desirable as it might have been to keep the Italians out if possible, it is likely to be very difficult to do so, particularly as there are not improbably some Italian subjects in Hodeidah. 'f. The Foreign Office state that Ibn Saud has intimated through his Foreign Minister that should he conquer and absorb the Yemen, he would be prepared to take over the Treaty recently concluded with the Imam by Colonel Reilly. This for what it is worth is all to the good. 6** On P.Z. 2831 there will be found correspondence between the Bmbassy at Rome and the Foreign Office on the subject of the Italian desire for conversations regarding Asir and the Baudi v emeni situation. 4LA.&lt;.4 A^v, , Mf /tH ftf. air demonstpatlon from Adei», which h-ri nr xij- taken Please therefore approach Italian &lt;JV^ (J-'Cmy* Go/ernment Immediately^Inr^mln Q,th^m r&gt;f o. and s gpeet to them deslratmit;/ of their sendinp ..arghlyw adTjTyfrum irlXre&gt;i.

I THANK your Excellency for your courteous letter of the 24th January last, in which you were so good as to send me the latest information regarding the relations between Ibn Baud and the Imam, and the step which the British Minister at Jedda, on instructions from the British Government, had taken vis-a-vis the Saudi Government with a view to stopping the advance of the Saudi troops and preventing the outbreak of hostilities. The Italian Government appreciates the action taken by the British Govern ment in this respect; and I may, in my turn, assure your Excellency that we have continued, for our part, to exert all possible influence on the Imam with the same objects of pacification which inspired the action of the Government in London. I hold that parallel action by the two Governments has indeed already contributed to diminish the tension in the relations between the two Arab kingdoms, and to induce the two Sovereigns to resume negotiations in order to arrive at an agreement. Your Excellency will in fact be aware that Ibn Saud and Ine Imam have decided to send their own delegations to a meeting which has keen called at Abha. The head of the Saudi delegation is the Under-Secretary ior Foreign Affairs, Fuad Hamza. The Imam has nominated as head of the Yemeni delegation Say id Abdalla-el-Wazir, who left Sanaa on the 29th January iast. and travelled first to Saada, where he conferred for some days with the Yemeni Crown Prince, Seif-el-Islam Ahmed, and afterwards went to Abha. The conference at Abha was preceded by an exchange of wireless telegrams between ihn Saud and the Imam as a result of which it appeared that acceptable bases had been found to enable the conference to examine and solve the following questions:— («) To decide the destiny of Asir and the form of its future administration, with the consequent delimitation of the frontiers between the two Arab States. (b) To settle the disputes regarding Nejran and the respective allegiance of its tribes. (c) To decide on the place where the Idrisi Emirs of Asir shall reside. («?) To conclude a treaty of friendship between the two countries. [56 u— 2 ]2 The favourable news reported above should, however, in my opinio ha judged in the light of the rapid changes in the situation in the^ \rab' peninsula. A telegram dated the 11 th February, 1934, from Sanaa stated tfrt new difficulties had apparently arisen in regard to the outcome of the negotiati ^ between Saudia and the Yemen. In fact, on the 10 th February a report is sa^ to have reached Sanaa that Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud had moved off at the head of his army (“si era spostato con i suoi armatiand was heading for Neiran whereas, according to the agreements which had been arrived at, military move ^ merits should have been suspended, the Seif-el-Islam Ahmed remaining at SaflHa and Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud at Abha. In these circumstances, while for our part we continue to follow with all attention the development of events and to influence the Imam in a sense favour able to a solution of the existing differences, we maintain an attitude of reserve in regard to the merits of such differences in conformity with the conclusions and - the spirit of the conversations of Rome 1927. In the last paragraph of your letter of the 24th January, your Excellency set forth the motives which led the British Government to think that the moment was undesirable to proceed with the conversations proposed by the Italian Government. Your Excellency stated, inter alia, that one of the principal reasons which induced the Foreign Office to assume this attitude was that the points of vie^v of the Italian and British Governments in regard to Asir and in regard to the rights of the Imam over that region were completely divergent. I think it useful to observe in this connexion that in accordance with the statements contained in paragraph 2 of the note verbale of the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 23rd December last, the Italian Government, conforming to the spirit of the conclusions of the conversations of Rome, holds that no particular attitude should be adopted (“ di non dovere comunque assumere posizione ') in regard to the differences which separate the two Arab States, and hence in regard to the question of Asir which is the principal bone of contention between them. It does not seem, therefore, possible to assert that the points of view of the Italian and British Governments in this connexion are divergent since the Italian Government, I repeat, holds that no particular attitude should be adopted. With regard to the attitude adopted by His Britannic Majesty's Government, the Italian Government has already had occasion in the above-mentioned note verbale, to draw attention to the fact that the representatives of the British Government, during the conversations of Rome, declared that all territorial questions in regard to Asir and in general concerning the frontiers between the Hejaz and the Yemen were regarded as an internal Arabian question, which did not interest the British Government. In the same note verbale was expressed the confidence that His Britannic Majesty's Government would maintain their determination to avoid all formal and direct recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, and would also abstain from adopting any particular position in regard to the differences between the two Arabian States. Further, the Anglo-Italian conversations proposed by the Italian Government w r ere designed to have the same confidential character, as the conversations ot Rome of 1927. and since they would not become known in Arabia they could not influence the course of the negotiations at present being conducted between the two Arabian States. They would thus serve a useful purpose in defining the points of view of the Italian and British Governments, who have always co-operated in a friendly spirit for the maintenance of peace in the Arabian peninsula.

E 1803/2/25] No. 1. / Sir John Simon to Sir E. Drummond (Rome) (No. 318.) '' sir ’t tt a tzt? v. ^ J . Foreign Office, April 5, 1934. I HAY K had under consideration your Excellency’s despatch No. 241 of the 17th March, but I remain of the opinion that it would be inexpedient to' accede to the proposal of the Italian Government, that a conference of British and Italian experts should be held to discuss the situation in South-Western Arabia. 2. It is tine that the developments which have taken place there since my despatch No_39_pf the 15th January was written make it appear less likely that King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen will reach a solution of their differences without lecourse to hostilities; but there appear to be no new joint steps to promote a peaceful settlement of the dispute, which His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government could agree, as a result of such a conference, to take. They can only continue, as in the past, to urge moderation upon both Sovereigns, should further opportunity arise. Meanwhile, so long as the Italian Government maintain their present attitude upon the questions of King Ibn Saud’s rights over Asir and of the Imam’s alleged claims in respect of that territory, no conference can lead to agreement upon these points. Moreover, discussion of them, if hostilities do in fact break out, would be academic. It might even lead to the disappearance of the existing measure of agreement in regard to the attitude to be adopted by the two Governments in case of a Saudi- Yemeni conflict, as recorded in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927. 3. Since, however, the Italian Government continue to reiterate their thesis that the question of the sovereignty of Asir remains open, and to imply, as is done in the seventh and eighth paragraphs of Signor Suvich’s letter to you, a translation of which was enclosed in your despatch, that in regarding Asir as now rightfully a part of King Ibn Saud’s dominions, His Majesty’s Government are acting at variance with the spirit of the Rome conversations of 1927 and the declarations of the British representatives during those meetings, His Majesty’s Government cannot, merely in order to avoid controversy, refrain any longer from making the grounds of their attitude clear without a risk that the Italian Government may doubt their good faith. 4. I request, therefore, that, in replying to Signor Suvich’s letter, you will, using the material in paragraphs 3-7 of my despatch No , 39, explain to him the reasons for the considered view of His Majesty’s Government that in inter national law the sovereignty over the territory ruled by the Idrisi has undoubtedly passed to King Ibn Saud (and that it therefore cannot be considered an open question), and endeavour to clear up the misunderstanding regarding the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government to refrain from addressing to the Government of King Ibn Saud a formal communication of their recognition of his sovereignty over Asir. It may be well to add in your reply that His Majesty’s Government will naturally continue, in pursuance of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, not only to refrain from intervention in the present conflict between King Ibn Saud and the Imam, but also to avoid all appearance of taking the part of either of the disputants, while seeking, should further opportunities urise, to use their influence in favour of a peaceful settlement. Y r ou may also assure Signor Suvich of my desire to continue to exchange information with the Italian Government regarding the progress of the dispute. Y r ou should give him po encouragement to hope that His Majesty’s Government will accept the invitation to hold a conference of experts, so long at any rate as the Italian Government maintain their view regarding the status of Asir; but you may inform him that, should he desire further explanation in regard to any special point concerning the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabian affairs, I shall of course be happy to give it to him when he visits London at the end of the nionth. 5.

The attack had been successful and 700 of Yahya's men had been slain. 5. The occurrence took place, it was said, during the truce when full peace negotiations were proceeding, and f after Bin Sand had issued stringent orders to his generals V that no offensive move whatsoever was to be made anywhere. 6. As a result of the incident Yahya at once broke off peace conversations and ordered his armies to prepare immediately to take the offensive* 7. Bin Saud In vain dismissed Saaiyid al Faisal and telographically expressed his profound regrets, but for some days the Imam Yahya refused to be appeased. a* Bin Saud. believing war was inevitable, sent his son Saud on 11th January post haste to Ebha with all avaiia le troops still in Hiath (800 men) in light Ford lorries with orders to take supreme command. With the ^mir a id , Khalid bin Mohamed as Saud and Fahad bin Sa f ad al Saud. 9. The above story though promptly denied in Bahrain and elsewhere nevertheless obtained full evil noo in Kuwait, seeing that it had been brought in by one oi t e king*a most trusty messengers. Sven the Shaikh of Kuweit&gt;hi uuerto cautious, was inclined to believe the story and attached special significance to the departure of the Heir Apparent for the front. 10* On 5th February further news from diath.Riath (thia time tribal) arrived to the effect that Bin Saud had at laat been auoceeaful in pereuading Tanya that Sa’aiyid al Pai»al , s action had beei^ntirely againat hia orders, and after expreauing deep regret, had been abla to reatora the aituation. The report further had it that Tahya*a troops had puraued and surrounded Sa’aiyid al Faisal* force after their victory and in turn had captured the vhole party, and it was tnis auooeas on top of the King's apologies that had turned the scales in favour of peace once More* Thia freah report also had it that the original figure at 700 waa incorrect and the true figure was JOO killed by Sa* aiyid* a men* !!• Peace negotiations were thereupon once again started and had continued till the end of February with varying success* 12* On IJfth February the Shaikh of Kuwait reported that fresh news from Riath had it that Bin Saud had ordered all the camala of his Aair expeditionary force to return to the highlands of Nejd, as there was an insufficiency of grasing in Aair* Such an order, if true, said Hia Excellency would also serve thepurpose of preventing maas desertions from the front of which many had bean reported especially from the Ataiba tribe* 13* On l c &lt;th February the Shaikh reported that according to a Bedouin messenger from Artawiyeh a sharp fight had taken place near Ebha between the Mutair and the Harb tribal contingents of the King* The Harb had been victorious at first and had killed 22 Mutairia, but subsequently the Ataiba came to the help of the Kutair, and turned the tables on the Harb* Thia interfaction fighting in the King* a army had only been stopped after the Aiiiir ^ ud had eraonally intervened* 14* On ?7th February K.B* Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, x—Director of Cuatoma, Kuwait, arrived from ninth , he .i&amp;d one there on 9th February). He brought (a) A personal and ver j^r^en^j^^t^e;from th« King to the writerj (b) A similar letter to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait* Both letters were dated ?2nd February 1934# With the Shaikhs letter cene a 'Mulhaq' or enclosure marked ' very secret * which was of sufficient interest to cause His Sxcellency to pay me a special visit* The contents of the 'Mulhaq' were to the effect that though Tahya out wardly showed an accommodating spirit and was full of friendly ideas* inwardly the man was full of treachery and guile* That he was obviously playing a waiting game anti in spite of his (Bin S&amp;ud(s) every offer of a f iendly settlement would not come to the point* That the latest 'Wafd' (Peace Embassy) had arrived* and by its arrogant and Impossible demands* had made peace ' further away than it ever was'* That he* the King* was still working for pe&amp;oe and would do so to the end* but that the result was now in God^ hand* 16* The Shaikh pointed out that reading oetween the lines* he saw that matters were fast approaching a crisis and for the following reasonsi- (a) The Imam Taya was olearly out to waste time and give Bin Saud smooth words outwardly but all the time he was continuing his under ground activities against the King (such as enc/oursging the Asir tribes to rise and cut communications* etc** etc*&gt;j (b) Tahya* s obvious intention was to pin the Saudi forces to the Asir lowlands until the hot weather set in* when Bin Saud would be forced to give way to all (Taliya* s) demands or fight at a disadvantage} (o) Tahya knew that Bin Saud was only keeping his Asir army supplied with food and munitions by superhuman efforts* and that money and supplies must fail if he oould procrastinate long enough; (d) Bin Baud’s army leaders were daily Impressing on the King that he must fight now or abandon Asir altogether* for they recognised that continued inaction was weakening the troops morals* and was playing into the enemy’s hands; (e) Bin Saud saw ail this clearly also* but dare not risk e pitched battle* 'The wolf dared not bite the hedgehog'* *ai&amp; the Shaikh*■ 13 16* His excellency was still of the opinion (expressed repeatedly since the commencement of the strained relations) that there would be no war and that some sort of a settlement would be arrived at somehow in the end, but that it would be disadvantageous to Bin 3aud. 17. Phe crux of the situation lay, said the Shaikh, round the Idrisi: Yahya wanted Bin Baud to give the Idrisi a small slice of Asir to reside in under his (Yahya’s) guarantee of good behaviour, while Bin Baud wanted (a) Either the surrender (unconditionally) of the Idrisi, or that Yahya should keep him (Idrisi) under surveillance in some town in the interior of Yemen, he (Bin Baud) paying him a salary. (b) That Yahya should pay him (Bin Baud) the total field, a day 18. The above conditions (17) were brought by K.B. Abdul Latif, who according to his own statement, had got them from the King himself. They are of course quoted for what they are worth. No doubt H.M. f s Minister at Jedda has the true facts at his disposal. 19. According to the same source (K.B. Abdul Latif the King was at his wits end for money, and hoped against hope that His Majesty’s Oovemment would still loan him a lump sum down to see him through his difficulties.

The King re stated demands on April 15th and while expressing readiness to receive Abdullah Nazir intimated his visit would not alter the situation unless demands were effectively complied with.

The Saudi Government themselves seem to have been anxious to foster this idea, witness the announcement on p 13 of the limes of the 8th February, a variant of which was given about the same time to the Egyptian press. 2 . I he announcement just mentioned suggests either of two things. Ibn Sand may be so averse from war that he is determined to make the Abha Conference a success at all costs, or he may be expecting war but anxious to be able to represent it in due course as due to the Imam’s intractability in a general negotiation which promised to be successful. At the moment it is' impossible to know what has been passing at Abha. The Amir Feisal returned from the camel parks about the 15th February and came to Jedda on the 18th for four days. When I saw him on the 20th he professed to have had no news from Abha, since that of the arrival of the Yemeni delegation; although three clear days had elapsed, and there is no reason to believe that wireless communication has been interrupted. The Prince replied rather vaguely to a question about the position in the mountain area peopled by the Beni Malik, &amp;c., but I understood him to say that he thought that the Yemeni forces had withdrawn. 3. Mr. Philby, who returned from Mecca three days after my conversation with the Amir, had heard nothing further about the negotiations, and he told me last evening that according to the Minister of Finance there was still no news. It seems hardly credible that the two Ministers most concerned should remain completely in the dark for over a week, but it is possible that the King is keeping the matter in his own hands at Riyadh, and it is conceivable, though less probable, that he has given full discretion to the heir apparent. 4. Meanwhile, the Saudi military preparations have continued. There appears to have been activity up Medina way about the time of and just after the Amir Feisal’s excursion in that direction. One thousand one hundred men from the north are reported to have gone south by motor lorry at that time. Ford lorries bought through Mr. Philby's firm were being hurried off to Mecca as soon as they could be assembled, without undergoing any road test. Two of the motor barges sent to Jizan some time ago returned to Jedda on the 19th February and put to sea again two days later. The third was delayed on the return voyage, but reached Jedda later and left for Jizan on the 24th February with another party of some 200 troops. 5.

By H. St. J. B. Philby (Copyright) MECCA For one whose long career of leadership in Arabia has witnessed the creation, expansion, and organization of an empire Ibn Sand, the Wahabi King, is a surprisingly unwarlike person. Yet, conscious of his duty as a monarch both to Islam and to the Arab race, he claims the right to think of and treat Arabia as a single unit, the whole of Arabia—nothing more but nothing And within the vast though limited sphere icaa. z-vnci wnum vaav. luimgii apiicic of independent Arabia, he wants and seeks nothing but peace and prosperity. He has ever found them difficult to secure without fighting. And so, as often before, he takes up again the Sword to write in blood where the ink has failed. The Amir Saud, heir-apparent to the Wahabi Throne and Commander-in-Chief of the expeditionary force on the frontier, left his headquarters at Khamis Mushait (about 25 miles N.E. of Abha, the capital of Asir) on March 20 for Dhahran (about 40 miles north of Sada, the most northerly of the principal towns of the Yemen), near the border. There he will presumably be in a strong position to cover the Neiran district against any attempt ot the Yemeni forces to advance in that direction. In due course he will doubtless throw troops into that area and advance on Sada itself, while the long line of Wahabi contingents scattered along the frontier through the mountains to the coast of the Red Sea southward of Jizan will presumably conform so far as possible to his movements. ,, , i Developments may well be more rapid than is thought in some quarters, where a perhaps exaggerated respect for the fighting qualities of the Yemenis and an erroneous idea of the advantages they will derive from the mountainous character of their country are coupled with complete ignorance of the temper and equipment (moral as well as material) ot the Wahabi troops which will be pitted against Nothing can forestall war but the unlikely recantation by the Imam of his claims to the district of Nejran. Those claims, pressed with astonishing perversity in face of an unexpectedly generous compromise suggested by Ibn baud m the interests of peace, constitute the actual causa belli ; but no serious student of Arabia can affect to be surprised by a denouement which became inevitable from the moment when the Wahabi leader began, soon after the Oreat War, to stand out among his peers as a man or destiny. , , During the Great War he made no use ot an opportunity to establish himself as the unques tioned ruler of all inner Arabia by the elimina tion of Ibn Rashid. The end of the War thus found him “ stymied ” by the presence of a rival, who had gained rather than lost prestige by his advocacy of the Turkish cause. His position was further embittered by the chorus of British admiration which went out to the Sherman dynasty which had played a prominent part in the military operations leading to the final Allied victory. He was then in a position of serious and humiliating isolation, from which he would have found it difficult to escape had not King Husain compelled him to show his paces before the world.
