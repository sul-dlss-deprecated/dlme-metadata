The correspondence is mostly between the British Agency at Sharjah, the Political Agency at Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain, the Shaikh of Ra's al-Khaymah (Sulṭān bin Sālim Āl Qasimī, later Saqr bin Muḥammad Āl Qasimī) and his brother (Muḥammad bin Sālim Āl Qasimī), and the Foreign Office.The papers cover numerous matters, including:the limits of the Shaikh's territory;the restoration of the British government's support to Ra's al-Khaymah (it had been withdrawn following Shaikh Sultan's lack of cooperation over a concession agreement with Petroleum Concessions Limited in 1938);Shaikh Sultan's claim over Tamb Island and the British government's desire for his flag to be permanently flown there;the 1946 conflict and subsequent stand-off between Shaikh Sultan and his brother, Muḥammad bin Sālim, which eventually resulted in the coup carried out by Muḥammad's son, Saqr, in early 1948;the recognition by the British of Saqr bin Muḥammad Āl Qasimī as the Shaikh of Ra's al-Khaymah;a complaint by Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Sulaiman, Shaikh of Bakha, of aggression by the people of Sha'am.Folio 121 is a genealogical chart of the Jowasim [Qawāsim] lineage.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al-Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial rights</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00039b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00039b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00039b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
