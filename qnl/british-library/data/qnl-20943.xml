British Rasidenoy and Consulata-Ganaralj $ Bushira, /• „ February 1911. To The Political Agent, BAHREIN. Sir, The Postal authorities have drawn ray attention to a latter posted at Bushira to the address of Abdalla bin Hassan al-Qaiaaibi ( ) with 1 anna.sorvica labels. The person who addressed the letter is one Ahmad bin Tahir, an Arab of Hassa and praaumably a Turkish subject. It is not thought desirable to proceed against the latter through the TurKish Consul hare, we sire therefore reduced to taking any steps that we can at Bahrein. I sand you the letters in question and suggest your sanding for the addressee and telling him that this latter having got service labels on which must have bean fraudulently obtained, has been stopped by the Postal authorities and sent to us for enquiry,Th®m 1 see what you cam get out of him. If, as is conceivable, there is^ny suspicion that A1 Qasaibi himself provided the stamps, you nay think it better to endeavour to get some clue to the source of his supply, before going fur ther.

G-ray,12/9 Chief Political Office, Basrah,27th December 16, Sir Percy has received your letter of 14th December asking for information regarding the treatment of British claims against the Turks for goods seized prior to the British occupation and I am desired to send you the following explanation,which you may show to Kirkpatrick:- His claim was received on January 8th 1915 and forwarded to Government on April 14th,1915.It has been \\ registered afe the 'Foreign Claims Office ,, in London for such action as it may be possible to take at the end of the \V war (despatch from secretary of State for India to Viceroy July 30th). The claims registered against the Turks in this category come to about a quarter of a million pounds in all, I suppose,but it is quite understood by every one here that they are claims against the Turks,not against the British Government and I have newer received a single enquiry or reminder verbal or otherwise on the subject since they were made. As regards the claims of natives being settled,no - claims against the Turks by natives have been registered here much less paid. Claims against the British Governmen t by whoever presented are investigated by this office and paid in the usual way and as far as I know there are no complaints on this score, Persia being a friendly Government we can sometimes obtain compensation for British Subjects from that Government,Turkey is an enemy Government,hence our inability to exact payment at present. fy ( a h )A ' ■- H ^' V cotiFinomAL* Pl«a3« s.3© bit letter Uo«333 of Harch 90th # 1917, forwarding an application for employment from Mr Taur.
