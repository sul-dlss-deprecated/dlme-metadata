January 1906. Grant of French Flags to Muscat Dhows. IN 1844 a Treaty was concluded between France and Muscat, whereby French subjects en joyed, as regards their person and property, rights of exterritoriality in Muscat. These rights were extended to their servants, even if subjects of tha Sultan. By a Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat concluded in 1891, similar rights and the most favoured-nation treatment were secured for British subjects in Muscat. On the 10th March, 1862, Great Britain and France signed a Declaration engaging reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. France has always refused to permit the exer cise by the warships of any other Power of the^ droit de visite on the high seas as regards ships carrying the French flag, and, by only partially ratifying the Brussels General Act in 1892, she preserved this claim to resist the right of search. Arabs concerned in the oversea Slave Trade are fully aware of this policy, and have sought to ob tain the benefit of the French flag, and thus avoid detention and search on the high seas, either by hoisting it without authority, or by obtaining permission to hoist it from French Consuls in the Eastern Seas, or from the authorities in French Colonies and Protectorates. The French officials in Obokh, Madagascar,, and the Comoros have granted, from time to [201] btime, French ships' papers and flags to subjects of tlie Sultan of Muscat, and the same course has been taken by the French Consuls at Aden, Muscat, and Zanzibar. Most of the Omanis who thus received French papers belonged to the dis trict of Jalani and the town of Sur, within Muscat territories. These men were neither of French nationality nor naturalization; they had no authority from their Sultan no change their alle giance, and they had no permanent residence or settlement in French territory, but merely paid fleeting visits thereto for the purpose of renewing their licences. Many of these flagholders engaged in the Slave Trade. Moreover, on returning to the waters and territory of Muscat, they claimed that the Sultan was not entitled to board or search their vessels, or to exercise any jurisdiction over them, and that they were entitled to be treated as French proteges, and to be exempt from his laws as regards cus toms, quarantine, and other matters. The Sultan of Muscat never admitted that the grant of French flags or papers was warranted by Treaty or usage, and made repeated protests on the subject. He appealed to His Majesty's Government, who on several occasions made representations to the French Government. In 1899 His Highness visited Sur, and persuaded the French flagholders to sign, an undertaking to give up their papers. Four sets of papers were actually surrendered and were sent to the French Consul, but he declined to receive them. The question formed the subject of further discussion between the British and French Governments, and, in June 1900, the French Ambassador in London gave an assurance that from that date no fresh papers would be issued to Muscat subjects. There matters rested until they were brought to a head by two incidents which occurred in 1903. A French flagholder named Mubarak, a subject of the Sultan, in order to avoid a fine levied on the town of Sur, persisted in taking his dhow out of the harbour in spite of orders to the contrary. The vessel was fired upon, and a shot went through its flag. The French Consul made this incident the ground for a claim on the Sultan for an indemnity of 1,500 dollars. The claim was challenged by the British Consul, and was with drawn or postponed,3 On the 8th April, 1903, five Arabs, natives of Sur, arrived at Muscat on the British mail- steamer from Bombay: Bombay being an infected port the men were placed in quarantine. The following day, however, they broke quarantine^ and escaped from Muscat in a sailing boat. The ' Sultan at once communicated with his Health Officer and His Majesty's Consul. The steam- launch of His Majesty's ship 'Perseus' was dispatched after the fugitives, overtook them and brought them back to Muscat, where they were taken back to the quarantine station. On the 11th April the French Consul claimed the release of the five Arabs as being Suris under French protection. The Sultan replied that he intended to punish them for breaking quarantine, and repeated his protest against the contention that the French flag covered any of his subjects while in his territory or territorial waters. On the 15th April the men were tried and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. An acute crisis supervened. The Sultan's action was supported by His Majesty's Govern ment, but was challenged by the French Consul and the Commander of the French war-ship ' Infernet.' The latter, after a violent scene with the Sultan, threw his sword on the table and told His Highness to choose between that and the release of the five prisoners. Finally, it was decided that this incident and the whole question of the grant of French flags to subjects of the Sultan should be submitted to the arbitration of the International Court at The Hague. The following two points were submitted to the decision of the Tribunal, which met at The Hague on the 24th July, 1905 :— (a.) The scope of the reciprocal Declaration made by Great Britain and France in 1862 in relation to the issue by France to subjects of the Sultan of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag ; and (&amp;.) The nature of the privileges and immu nities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who were owners or masters of dhows and possessed French papers, or were members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affected the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects.4 His Majesty's Government submitted that—- 1. No subject of the Sultan acquired the status ol a French protege by the iact of being the owner, captain, or member of the crew of a dhow which had obtained French papers or flag. 2. By her adhesion to Article 32 of the Brussels Act, France was bound not to give French flags or papers to any native vessel unless its owner was a hond fide French citizen or protege. 3. France was equally debarred by the Decla ration of 1862 from withdrawing any subject of the Sultan from His Highness'jurisdiction by the grant of French flags and papers, and such a practice trenched on His Highness' independence. 4. No subject of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags, acquired for himself, or his crew or family, immunity from the Sultan's juris diction in Muscat territories or waters. 5 and 6. The French titres de navigation were not transferable from one owner to another, or from one dhow to another. 7. France should erase from her registers all vessels owned by subjects of the Sultan, and obtain the surrender of their flags and papers. 8. In cases where France claimed any Omani owner, or captain, or sailor as a French protdge, she should furnish proofs to the Sultan in support of her claim. The French Government contended— 1. That France had in no way infringed the Declaration of 1862 by the grant of French flags or papers, or by forcing the-Sultan to respect the Treaty of 1844, and that the status quo should be maintained. The Award of the Tribunal was delivered on the 8th August, 1905, and ran as follows :— As regards («)— ' 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and adminis trative Rules.' The date in question is that of the ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France was, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions pre scribed by Article 32 of that Act.6 ' 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 had been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retained this authorization as long as France renewed it to the grantee. '3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by /France as her proteges before the year 1863.' The year 1863 was taken as the date at which, in virtue ot legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new proteges was regulated and limited. As regards (b)— ' 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French- Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. '2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even [if belonging to the same owner. ' 3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy, in conse quence of that fact, any right of exterritoriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.' The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— France may renew the licences to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 1863. This decision will, it is believed, reduce the number of French flagholders to ten or twelve at the utmost. Moreover, under Article 2 of {b), the licences in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus, it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, must prove that he comes under the category of those who were bond fide French proteges before 1863. Such proteges must now [201] C6 . 1 . ' .'TV f? C- rv ) [^ }■ v} : be scarce, and the number of French flagholdersr should, in the course of a few years, be reduced to vanishing point. Under Article 1 of (b) dhows flying the French flag are declared to be inviolable in Muscat waters, and thus they are, exempt from search. This decision is regrettable in view of the active participation of such dhows in the Slave Trade. But under Article 3 of (b) the owners, masters, and crews of the dhows, or their families, are expressly declared not to enjoy any such inviolability, and the moment they set foot in Muscat territory they come under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sultan. The Tribunal has definitely laid down that the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan's sovereignty and juris diction would be in contradiction with the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862. This important decision afforded much satisfaction to the Sultan, and determined, entirelyl in His Highness' favour, the controversy regarding the French-protected Suris who broke quarantine in April 1903, the incident which in reality gave rise to the arbitration. On the 22nd August the French Government stated that M. Laronce, the French Consul at Muscat, was returning to his post armed with the necessary instructions to carry out the terms of the Award. Pending his arrival, the status quo would be maintained, and temporary renewals of their licences had been granted to the French flagholders. We concurred, but pointed out that the maintenance of the status quo could not affect the immediate coming into operation of the final clause of the Award, and that the flagholders had now come, as a matter of course, under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sultan. To this the French Government agreed, making, however, an exception in favour of those flagholders who should eventually establish a claim to be bond fide French citizens. In October last we proposed to the French Government that the British and French Consuls, who had already been instructed to cultivate most friendly relations and co-operate loyally to obtain a settlement, should be autho rized to confer together as to (1) the best method of making known the results of the arbitration to the subjects r of the Sultan, and (2) the compilation of a list of such subjects who are still entitled to fly the French flag. The© 7 result of this conference to be referred by the two Consuls to their respective Governments for approval. The French Government agreed, and instruc tions have been sent to Major Grey and M. Laronce accordingly. R G. Foreign Office, January 1, 1906.I CONFIDENTIAL. MEM011A.NDUM. G rant of French E lag's to Muscat Dhows.

Men from Sur involved in the oversea slave trade used this policy to obtain the benefit of the French flag, and avoid detention and search on the high seas.The memorandum details two incidents in 1903 which brought the matter to a head. A French flagholder named Mubarak took his dhow out of the harbour in order to avoid a fine. His vessel was fired upon and a shot went through its flag leading to a protest from the French.On 8th April 1903 five Arabs from Sur, arrived at Muscat from Bombay. As Bombay was an infected port, the men were placed in quarantine. The next day they broke quarantine and the Sultan had them arrested and imprisoned.
