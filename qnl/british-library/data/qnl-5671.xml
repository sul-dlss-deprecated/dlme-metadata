Message from Suric at Tashkend to Karakhan, Chief of the Eastern Department, ^Moscow, stating that he has been in touch with Eliava and Frunze at Samara, and is leaving at once for Kabul. 14994. M., 2nd November. Merv Agent reports, 25th October, that Suric, with full plenipotentiary powers, was expected at Merv hourly, en route to Kabul, where he was to conclude offensive and defensive alliance between Bolsheviks, Afghans, and Turkomans. Suric’s aim is the freeing of Islam and extinction of British power in Asia and invasion of Persia as preliminary. # # # Message, 5th November, from Karakhan, at Moscow, to President of the Central Executive Committee at Tashkend :— “ The Turkestan Central Executive Committee was commissioned to appoint representatives to the neighbouring States only in agreement with the Centre (the authorities in Moscow). The Centre appointed Bravin to Afghanistan. A few days ago Suric left for Afghanistan. We have received no information from you with regard to Mamin. Please inform us immediately who appointed him, in what capacity, and what his instructions are. Does Suric know of his appointment ? (Note .—From the context it would appear that the unaccredited “ Mamin is identical with “ Wintermin ” (see Issue I., § L, p. 3, C.G.S., X, 417).) 10 505 50 12.19 [1694] A1^048. M. 3rd November. Common talk at Merv that one of Suric’s immediate aims, the details of which are to be arranged in Kabul, is to bribe the Afghans with a large slice of East Persia, to join in an effort to drive the British out of Persia. #** K.—1\ Suric’s Mission left Kushk for System of couriers between the Mission and C.C.kX X. 443.

Message from Suric to Karakhan, indicates that Mahendra ratap, who left Moscow with Suric, was with him in Tashkend, and is going on ahead to the lurkestan frontier. Suggestion is made by Suric that it was a mistake to send Bravin to Kabul before himself. ***9th November Suric “ is taking the Hindus ” with him (i.e., Mahendra Pratap and th ® &lt; fi T r T st Mian Mission' see Issue I, § I, D.M.L, 0164/4530 of 21st August, and § III.

Mahendra Pratap reported to have told Colonel Bailey in Tashkend that if he did not succeed in his aims in Kabul he would go to China to “ study religions ” (r start propaganda in China). 15710. V., 21st November.

Issue I. § II. 14794.) HI.—Intrigues at and with Tashkend: Organisation of Bolshevik Executive. W .N. 3rd November. Propaganda Message from Moscow strongly deprecating the criticisms of the Mussulman section of the Turkestan Communist Party by the former Turkestan Government; denying that the section was composedvof bourgeois adventurers, and upholding the New Turkestan’s policy for the improve ment of Soviet construction (among Mohammedan communities) based on trust of the Mussulman proletariat. Message from Suric at Tashkend to Karakhan, Chief of Eastern Department, Moscow, 4th November. Suric reports that prior to his arrival in October no considered Eastern policy had been conducted in the Turkestan Republic, whose relations with Bokhara and Khiva had been of a casual (?’.e., not fully considered) nature, strained by a series of tactless and thoughtless acts tending to strengthen Bokhara and Khiva’s long-standing and deep rooted mistrust of Russia. The harm done, can only be repaired by a new policy conducted in the name and spirit of the (Central Government at Moscow. As a result of Suric’s presence a firm military (see below 15567) and diplomatic base of the Central Government has been formed. As a result of the Soviet and party meetings held while Suric was in Tashkend, the Separatist party has been defeated, and replaced in power, by the supporters of union with the Central Government. The President of the Turkestan Central Executive Committee has, with Suric’s help, arranged that the Turkestan Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Eliava shall be subordinate to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (i.e., in Moscow). Ditto, ditto, 9th November. Suric further comments on the unsatisfactory way in which foreign affairs have hitherto been handled from Tashkend, the agents of the Turkestan Republic having been given the mandate of plenipotentiary representatives [? of Bolshevik Russia]. It has now been decreed by the Central Executive Committee (of Tashkend) that foreign policy be directed by instructions from the Central Government; as a consequence the representatives of the Turkestan Republic, members of Bravin’s Mission, should be subordinate to Suric, and should not complete any treaty with Afghanistan pending his arrival. 15567. M., 16th November. Agent from Bokhara reports that staff of Bolshevik Fifth Army reached Tashkend from Orenburg. Chief of the Staff, Fifth Army, formerly Colonel of General Staff in Imperial Army. W.N., 326. *** Message 15th November from Eliava, President of the Tashkend Commission to the People’s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Moscow :— The Turkestan Commission considers the presence of Professor Barkatulla in Tashkend desirable, and requests steps to be taken for his immediate journey to Turkestan. W.N., 329, 21st November. Message from Karakhan, Eastern Department of People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Moscow, to Eliava, plenipotentiary of the Soviet of People’s Commissaries, at Tashkend, 19th November :— Kindly forward copies of all our instructions to Suric. We intend to place at your disposal several persons possessing knowledge of English ; state whether you are in need of them. Inform Suric that he is to send information more frequently, also send us as detailed information as possible yourself.4 W.N., 333, 26tk November. Message, 20th November, from Rabiaovitch, Secretary of the Tashkend Propaganda Bureau, to Comrade Vedemikoff, of the lurkestan Bureau, at Moscow, demanding 1,000 poods of paper from Turkestan for spreading propaganda literature in Mussulman countries. C.G.S. X, 489, 29th November. Tashkend Bureau of Mussulman Organisations reports the names of representatives of Turkestan Mussulman bodies to the All- Russian Assembly of Mussulman Organisations of the Russian Communist Party. IV.—Afghan Mission to Kushk. 15500. M., 14th November. It is reported that Mirza Mahomet Khan, 2 colonels, and 2 Herat shrine custodians returned to Herat with Suric’s Mission. V.— Movements in Afghan Turkestan. 14922. M., 1st November. Agent who left Merv 22nd October reports that Afghan Consul is busily engaging stray Afghans in Bolshevik forces. Herat shrine custodians in Panjdeh area conducting anti-British propaganda campaign. 15048. M., 3rd November. Merv report 27th October. Four Afghan officers and 40 cavalry actually in Merv. Locally rumoured that 1,600 Afghan troops are in Russian territory ; probably not more than 300 in fact. 15184. M., 5th November. Merv report. Afghans and Turkomans now number about 400 in Yulatan. Turkomans look on the Afghans as deliverers from Bolshevik oppression, and Afghans do utmost to strengthen this impression, and are spending money lavishly among leading Turkomans. 15338. M., 9th November. Agent was at Kushk on 31st October and 1st November. The existing Bolshevik garrison there is slightly over 400, but it is to be increased to 1,000 shortly, owing to the fear of Afghan aggression. For the same reason 500 men are also to be sent to Panjdeh. Herat shrine custodians who are still in Panjdeh are being made much of by Turkomans. There are rumours in Kushk of more Afghan troops coming to the frontier from Herat. When Agent returned to Herat, however, on 3rd November, he found that there had been no actual movement, although there were strong rumours that the 3rd Herat Regiment and the Kandahar Regiment were under orders for Kushk, but that the move would be deferred pending the arrival of Suric in Herat. Two battalions from Kabul side are expected in relief should the move take place. 15500. M., 14$h November It is said that Mirza Mahomet Khan, 2 other colonels, and 2 Herat shrine custodians returned to Herat with Suric and his party. 15521. M., 10th November. Agent, who left Kushk by rail on 3rd November, reports as follows:—There is an Afghan and Turkoman camp of 60 tents at Chaman-i-Bid. Afghan cavalry were seen south of Yulatan, patrolling railway. At Yulatan it was said that there were 250 Afghan cavalry who had come via Bala Murghab and Takhta Bazaar. A special train of three carriages passed towards Kushk at 16 hours, 4th November. This was said to contain Bolshevik Minister Suric, Afghan Sirdar, and others from Moscow. At Merv there was a train with 300 Bolshevik troops shortly to leave for Kushk. It was said there were [? 700] Afghan troops in Merv, and that Afghan commander had assumed command of town. Unnumbered. V., 17th November. M., 15th November. Merv, 6th November. On 5th November 400 Bolshevik troops from Tashkend arrived at Merv, bringing Merv garrison up to about 1,400 men. There are now about 300 Afghan troops in Merv but it is said more are coming. 15817. M., 22nd November. Report by Agent who left Panjdeh 10th November:— Bolshevik garrison of Panjdeh 300 men with 4 machine guns.VI.—Afghan Mission to Moscow. t .(t.S., X. 428. Message from Doulyanski, bank director, Tashkend, to Mahommed W ali Ivhan remitting 700,000 roubles (1,800?.), to be debited to Afghan Consul- General, Tashkend. 15241. M., 8th November. A Sart, formerly closely identified with Bolsheviks, still working with them, but actually now in employ of Amir of Bokhara, informed one oi my confidential agents in Merv on 31st October:— 1. Object of Mission of Afghans and Kasim Beg to Moscow is to bring about Bolshevik-Mahometan solidarity throughout Asia and ruin the British Empire by destroying its power in the Near and Middle East. 2. Programme to be discussed at Moscow consisted in first place of plans to win over Persia to Bolshevik and pan-Islam side by means of peaceful propaganda. Emissaries are to be sent to Persian Democrats and all others disaffected towards present regime. It was hoped by these means to coerce the Shah’s Government into annulling recent Anglo-Persian Treaty, establishing really democratic regime, and so bringing Persia definitely into Bolshevik orbit without recourse to arms. VV.N. 329. 8th November. A demonstration took place in honour of the Afghan Ambassador at Moscow on the occasion of the celebration of the second anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet Republic. Lenin and Trotsky were present. The Afghan Ambassador Extraordinary was present in a box surrounded by his suite and accompanied by the Supreme Judge [s7c] of the Afghan army. Kameneff, who presided, said in the course of his speech: — “ We are happy to welcome the representative of the Afghan people, our friends, and we confidently hope that this friendship will be transformed into a solid alliance destined to counterbalance Imperialism in the West.” The Afghan Ambassador, Mahomed Wali Khan, expressed his satisfaction at the sentiments expressed with regard to his country, and stated that he was confident that now, after the new regime had lasted two years, the Russian working people would continue to advance on the path of progress. The Ambassador was accorded an enthusiastic ovation by the whole assembly. W.N. 325. # # # 12th November. Repeated request to Esthonian Government to allow Afghan Ambassador passage to Western Europe to attend the Peace Conference (sec Issue I, § VI). W.N. 319. 13th November. Message from Faiz Mahomet, of the Embassy, to Consul-General, Tashkend, asking for news from Kabul, and stating that their business in Moscow is not yet completed. W.N. 336 28th November. Message from Faiz Mahomet, Secretary of the Afghan Legation, Moscow, to Consul-General Aslam Khan at Tashkend :— “ The Afghan Extraordinary Mission left Moscow for Tashkend at 3 o’clock on 27th November.” W.N. 337. 29th November. Yesterday the Extraordinary Afghanistan Mission left Moscow. Before the departure a great reception was held, which was attended by the People’s Commissaries. In their speeches the People’s Commis saries expressed their willingness to establish exchange of goods between Soviet Russia and Afghanistan. In reply, the Afghanistan Envoy declared that England would never succeed in depriving Afghanistan of her independence by force of arms. If England decides to commence military operations against Afghanistan, India and Persia will immediately rise against her.6 VII.—Movements in Ferghana. C.G.S., X. 4797. M., 21st November. T.—M. States special efforts being made* restore order in Ferghana (? whither) Special Sub-Committee of Turkestan Commission has gone. In Kokand district Irqash is living like a Prince. Some of the rebels are deserting to Bolsheviks. VIII.—Bolshevik relations with Bokhara, Khiva, and Samarkand. 14994. M., 2nd November. Evidence available points to Bolshevik instructions being (a) capture of Krasnovodsk as soon as possible ; (b) to smash Bokhara, apparently with Afghan aid, as preliminary to invasion of Khorasan. As regards (b) it is difficult to obtain first hand information, no intelligence having been received from my various correspondence on and beyond the Oxus for last two or three weeks. Merv, however, is full of rumours of combined Bolshevik and Afghan operations against Bokhara. Camels from Merv are reported to have (? crossed) Oxus with a view to invasion of Bokhara. Amir is said to have torn up the railway on both sides of Bokhara. All Bolshevik and Afghan agitators are preaching the urgency of smashing Bokhara as the chief obstacle in the way of Central Asian Mahometan unity. Last night leading members of Bokhara community in Merv said that they had heard that Bolsheviks, reinforced by large force of Afghans from Mazar-i-Sharif side, were marching on Bokhara. 15184. M., 5th November. There is much talk in Merv of impending operations against Bokhara, in which Afghan detachment would take part. Great majority of Turkomans would take no action against Bokhara and they seem to think (probably on Afghan instigation) that Afghans will really join with Bokhara for the purpose of overthrowing Bolsheviks and establishing complete Mahomedan independence throughout Central Asia. This would not take place until Afghans had got arms and ammunition, aeroplanes, &amp;c., they require from the Bolsheviks. 15240. M., 8th November. Bokhara. I am still without any of my usual letters from Bokhara, Samarkand and Kerki. The Bokharam community in (? Merv) are all completely without any news and are very anxious. There are continued rumours that Amir has pulled up considerable length of Central Asian railway on each side of Bokhara, fearing Bolshevik attack. Message from Suric at Tashkend, 4th November, to Karakhan, Moscow. Prior to his arrival the Tashkend organisation’s relations with Khiva and Bokhara were of a casual nature, strained by a series of tactless and thoughtless acts which strengthened the deeprooted and longstanding mistrust [of Bokhara and Khiva] towards the Russians. Only a new policy conducted in the spirit and in the name of the Central Government can help matters. C.G.S. X. 454 # # # T.—M. There is great unrest against tyranny of Junaid Khan in Khiva. Rising has occurred and encounters have taken place. “ Young Khiva ” Bolshevik party are very active. Unnumbered. V., 17th November. M., 15th November. From further information received from various sources it appears that the collection of camels by Bolsheviks was not intended for military operations off the railway but (a) to collect and bring in fuel for locomotives and (b) to supply elaborate cordon of posts west of Oxus and north and south of railway, designed to cut us off from all communication with Bokhara. The latter object has evidently already been secured (c/. 14994 above and Issue I § XIV, 14828). 15538. M., 15th November. HaA^e received letter from Amir of Bokhara dated 23rd October. In it he states “ I am observing neutrality. All is satisfactory here.” He expresses doubt as to whether Orenburg railway is working right through;' also mentions passage of large Bolshevik reinforcements to Askabad7 front. He says nothing regarding projected Bolshevik attack on him, but such an attack is considered inevitable by Russian agent who brought this and other letters. 15567. M., 16tb November. Russian agent from Bokhara states that Bolsheviks resolved on removing their garrisons from Bokharan territory. Agent considers this prelude to Bolshevik attack on Bokhara. From several sources reports received that Bolsheviks have asked whether Afghans would co-operate in attack on Bokhara. Afghans said to have replied that they would in such event remain neutral, but believed that if Bolsheviks were not in strength Afghans might utilise the opportunity of raising all Mahometans against Bolsheviks. 15708. M., 20th November. Report 31st October from Bokhara :— “ 1. Bolsheviks recently demanded of Amir— (a) 400 wagons of wheat; (b) acceptance of Bolshevik paper money; (c) resumption of traffic on Kagan-Bokhara branch line ; (d) abolition of necessity for permits to enter Bokhara city. Amir supplied 60 wagons of wheat and refused other demands. “ 2. Bolshevik Kagan garrison now 2,000 strong, with 10 machine guns and 2 guns. “ 3. Frequent communication between Bokhara and Kiva between whom close relations continue. “ 4. Amir of Bokhara has purchased 1,200 rifles during last few months and continues buying at high prices. “ 5. Bokharan Envoy invited Moscow by Lenin, but no reply yet sent.” IX.—Afghan-Bolshevik Trade Relations. 15048. M., 3rd November. On 27th October large quantity of sugar arrived Merv from Herat. Afghans demanded extravagant price, and would only take Nikolai notes. Bolsheviks had none of these, and prices were much in excess of Bolshevik controlled rates. Hence nothing doing except considerable increase in Bolshevik- Afghan friction. 15240. M., 8th November. Afghans are said to have assumed complete administrative control of Yulatan, and to have cancelled existing Bolshevik orders regarding fixed prices and requisitioning of food supplies. 15338. M., 9th November. All Afghan travellers and traders are now carefully searched on the frontier by Bolsheviks. Message from Suric 9th November to Karakhan. The trade representative Kalikor reports from Kabul that a commercial treaty is being prepared, (c/. Issue L, § IX. C.G.S., X. 332.) Suric is afraid of running short of funds, and asks for about 5,000,000 roubles in Nikolai money, in 100 and 500 rouble notes. 15820. V., 24th November. Suric’s mission tendering 100 rouble notes in payment for purchases at Herat. Bidding rate of exchange for these is down to 8 krans (i.e. } 1 rouble = about penny). X.—Barkatulla. W. N., 326. *** Tashkend Soviet requests Moscow to send Barkatulla to Tashkend.8 XI.—Afghan Aggression into Russian Territory. Afghan-Bolshevik Relations, Politically and Militarily (c/. § V). 14994. Afghan influence in Merv and to south is consolidating. Afghan Consul in Merv is recognised as a more important man than local Bolshevik Commissary. 15048. M., 3rd November. Merv report 27th October. Four Afghan officers, with 40 Afghan cavalry, actually in Merv. Local rumour says about 1,600 Afghan troops have entered Russian territory. (Numbers probably much exaggerated, perhaps 300 in all.; Afghans have brought no guns. Bolsheviks are outwardly - friendly, and supply them with food and money allowances, but Bolshevik officials really, resent Afghan arrival. Afghans say they have come to ensure fulfilment of Bolshevik promises, some (corrupt and missing groups). Bolsheviks cede much territory south of Merv on condition that Afghans made war on British. Bolsheviks apparently think Afghans did not fulfil properly their bargain, and are hanging back in matter of cession of territory. Afghans are claiming “ up to Merv,” and say they are determined to have it. Pending recognition of this claim they will give no armed assistance to Bolsheviks. 15184. M., 5th November. According to Merv report Bolshevik-Afghan current negotiations are as follows : Bolsheviks cede whole area of Yulatan-Kushk (both inclusive) to Afghans. Bolsheviks also give Afghans 30,000 rifles, 1,500 machine guns, 500 guns with ammunition. In return Afghans lend Bolsheviks force 600 troops to serve with Bolsheviks under Mahomedan commander. This is said to be only part of large projects to be unfolded by Suric in Kabul. Merv report. Afghans with Turkomans now number about 400 in Yulatan. Turkomans look on the Afghans as deliverers from Bolshevik oppression, and Afghans do utmost to strengthen this impression and are spending money lavishly among leading Turcomans. To the Bolsheviks Afghans pose as allies, but general opinion seems to be that they are playing double game. There is much talk in Merv of impending operations against Bokhara, in which Afghan detachment would take part. Great majority of Turkomans would take no action against Bokhara, and they seem to think (probably on Afghan instigation) that Afghans will really join with Bokhara for the purpose of over throwing Bolsheviks and establishing complete Mahomedan independence throughout Central Asia. This would not take place until Afghans had got arms and ammunition, aeroplanes, &amp;c., they require from the Bolsheviks. Tejend report 26th October. Turkomans greatly delighted at arrival of Afghans in Merv district, and will readily join them against Bolsheviks. 15240. M., 8th November. I am receiving news pointing to Afghans playing double game in Turkestan. They are said to be giving Turkomans secretly, assurances of ultimate active support against Bolsheviks. Afghans are said to have assumed complete administrative control of Yulatan, and to have cancelled existing Bolshevik orders regarding fixed prices and requisitioning of food supphes. Over-bearing attitude of Afghans towards Bolshevik officials causes resentment, but Turkomans appreciate them as protectors against Bolshevik oppressors. 15337. M., 9th November. On the 8th November my agent at Sarakhs wires that telegram from Merv states that Bolshevik plenipotentiary (evidently Suric) with twelve delegates has arrived at Merv from Tashkend. Owing to presence of Afghan troops in Merv area there is much anxiety Bolshevik circles. (Note .—It is not clear whether the Bolshevik anxiety is for Suric’s safety or in regard to the situation generally.) 15338. M., 9th November. My Agent was at Kushk on 31st October and 1st November. The existing Bolshevik garrison there is slightly over 400, but it is to be increased to 1,000 shortly, owing to the fear of Afghan aggression. For the same reason 500 men are also to be sent to Panjdeh. Bolsheviks in Kushk say they wdll not tolerate any further movement of Afghan troops into Russian territory. All Afghan travellers and traders are now carefully searched on the frontier by the Bolsheviks. There are rumours in Kushk of more Afghan troops coming to the frontier from Herat. When Agent returned to Herat, however, on 3rd November, hefound that there had been no actual movement although there were strong rumours that the 3rd Herat Regiment and the Kandahar Regiment were under orders for Kushk, but that the move would be deferred pending the arrival of Suric in Herat. Two battalions from Kabul side are expected in relief should the move take place. 15521. M., 10th November. Agent, who left Kushk by rail on 3rd November, reports as follows :—There is an Afghan and Turkomam camp of 60 tents at Ohaman-i-Bid. Afghan cavalry were seen south of Yulatan patrolling railway. At Yulatan it was said that there were 250 Afghan cavalry who had come via Bala Murghab and Takhta Bazaar. A special train of three carriages passed towards Kushk at 16 hours, 4th November. This was said to contain Bolshevik Minister, Suric, Afghan Sirdar, and others from Moscow. At Merv there was a train with 300 Bolshevik troops, shortly to leave for Kushk. It was said that there were (? 700) Afghan troops in Merv, and that Afghan Commander had assumed command of town. He has issued orders that any disrespect shown to Afghan troops will be severely punished according to Afghan law, and has ordered that mosques will be regarded as sanctuaries for all Mahometans. This order has hit Bolshevik conscripts hard, and has had effect of completely stopping pro- Bolshevik activities of Persian Consular Agent, Mehr Ali, who has been specially warned by Afghan Commander. Unnumbered. V., 18th November. M., 15th November. Merv, 6th November. On 5th November 400 Bolshevik troops from Tashkend arrived at Merv, bringing Merv garrison up to about 1,400 men. There are now about 300 Afghan troops in Merv, but it is said more are coming. 15567. M., 16th November. From several sources reports received that Bolsheviks have asked whether Afghans would co-operate in attack on Bokhara. Afghans said to have replied that they would in such event remain neutral, but believed that if Bolsheviks were not in strength Afghans might utilise the opportunity of raising all Mahomedans against Bolsheviks. Russians are faw in Bolshevik forces in Turkestan, which consist largely of conscripted Mahomedans who would join Afghans, plus some thousands of prisoners of war desirous of returning home. F.S. 1562. S., 18th November. Merv report, via Meshed Afghans are interfering with most-favoured principles of Bolsheviks, such as enforced conscription, commandeering of supplies, Ac. 4hey are also insisting on release ol local Mahomedan political prisoners and are generally supporting local people against Bolshevik enforcement of communist principles. The result is that Afghans are acquiring much popularity in the whole area between Merv and Kushk. Many Turcomans seem to think that Afghans have come to stay, and attribute their arrival to British instigation. They would much prefer Afghan rule to Bolshevik. 15568. M., 19th November. Bolsheviks held large meeting at Merv attended by leading Turkomans from whole area of Merv, Panjdeh, Kushk. Six Afghan officials listened to Bolshevik doctrine of land ownership, and, after refusal, declared they would proceed to Tashkend to lay the matter before Mahomedan Soviet there. Bolshevik demands for recruits, food, and camels (? to be) considered. Afghans publicly agreed that Turkomans should aid common cause, but privately told latter not to help Bolsheviks with men or material of any kind. Afghans would safeguard them from Bolsheviks’ ill-treatment. When Bolsheviks demanded troops, Afghans evaded definite reply, but agreed to send detachment of 40 men to Askabad front as evidence of Boshevik-Afghan Malleson comments that Bolsheviks on this occasion probably represented by Suric and companions. Report strengthens suspicion of Afghan double dealing in Turkestan. 15735. M., 20th November. Bolsheviks increasingly distrustful of Afghan designs. 15817 M., 22nd November. Following from Agent, who left Panjdeh 10th Novem ber ; _1’“ Bolshevik garrison of Panjdeh, 300 men with 4 machine guns. ^ Afghans’ attitude towards Bolsheviks is insolent, and they constantly protect Turkomans against exactions. In contrast to friendliness shown by Afghans to Persians in Merv, Afghans in Panjdeh ill-treat and abuse Persians, saying that latter havesold their country to British. In Yulatan are 40 Bolshevik and 40 Afghan troops.” 15903. M., 34th November. Tashkend Government have sent to Merv a Bolshevik Commissary, Ivanov, formerly of Samarkand, with orders to counteract growing Afghan influence in Merv district, though ostensibly to reorganise administration on lines of People’s Government, and to stop oppression of previous Bolshevik officials. 15988. M., 25th November. Report received from Turkoman sources in Merv that Afghans are assuring iurkomans that, though temporarily compelled to dissemble intentions, all will come right for Central Asian Moslems, and ultimately only law will be Shariat. It is said that all 1 urkomans, also low r er class of Russians, are (onvinced that British tacitly approve Afghans’ proceedings in Turkestan. XII.—Kasim Beg. 15241. M., 8th November. Kasim Beg is reported to have returned to Askabad ; if so, intensive propaganda in Persia may be expected. 15/10. \ ., 21st November. Kasim Beg said to have written, 29th October, to Governor of Herat urging usual pan-Islamic propaganda, and saying that the time is at hand when Enver Pasha will lead all the Mahommedans of Central Asia on Persia to expel the British. XIII.—Pan-Islamism. 14922. M., 1st November. Herat shrine custodians in Panjdeh district preaching anti-British campaign, denouncing British seizure of Persia and oppression of Mahommedans everywhere. Rumour circulated from Tashkend that at appropriate time Enver Pasha will lead all Mahommedans of Central Asia to expel the British from Persia. 14994. M., 2nd November. Suric’s Mission said to have as ultimate aim the freeing of Islam and extinction of British power in Asia, by means of offensive and defensive alliance between Bolsheviks, Afghans, and Turks. 1524L M., 8th November. The object of the Mission of Mohamet Wali Khan and Kasim Beg to Moscow is (on the authority of a Sart formerly closely identified with the Bolsheviks and still working with them, but actually employed by Amir of Bokhara) to bring about Bolshevik-Mahommedan solidarity throughout Asia, and ruin the British Empire by destroying its power in Near and Middle East. Failing winning over Russia by propaganda and thus working up to the expulsion of the British from Asia, Bolshevik rule would be forced on Persia by a^ large army of Bolshevik Russians, Afghans, Central Asia Mahommedans, and Chinese mercenaries. Afghans with frontier tribes would invade India, while Turkey would foment a rising already planned in Kurdistan and Persian Azerbaijan. 15338. M., 9th November. Herat shrine custodians still in Panjdeh being made much of by Turkomans. 15568. M., 16th November. All available evidence points to (a) Lenin and others at centre prepared to give complete autonomy to Moslems of Central Asia, probably with proviso of assistance in attack on Persia and India ; (b) Russian Bolsheviks in Turkestan opposed to such policy. 15/10. V., 21st November. Governor of Herat reported to have received a letter from Kasim Beg, dated 29th October, containing the usual Pan-Islamic propaganda and saying the time is at hand when Enver Pasha will lead all Central Asia Mahommedans. with the Afghans in the van, on Persia.11 15988. M., 23rd November. Agent present at Merv when Suric arrived and addressed public meeting denouncing British as sanguinary oppressors of Moslems in India, Mesopotamia, Egypt and elsewhere. All must join in destruction of British, beginning in the East. XIV.—Bolshevik Designs on Persia. 14922. M., 1st November. Herat shrine custodians in Panjdeh area conducting active anti-British campaign and denouncing British seizure of Persia and oppres sion of Mahommedans everywhere. Impending combined Bolshevik and Afghan interference in Persia is commonly talked in Merv. Reports received there from Tashkend state that Enver Pasha, who is now in Russia, will at appropriate time lead all Mahom medans of Central Asia into Persia, drive out the British, and establish Mahommedan communist rule in Teheran. All Persian news sheets and pamphlets published in Turkestan are rabidly anti-British. Persian Consular Agent in Merv (one Mehr Ali) is very active on Bolshevik side, and denounces anyone suspected of British sympathies. 14994. M., 2nd November. Opinion in Turkestan prevalent that, after capturing Krasnovodsk and smashing Bokhara, Bolsheviks will invade Khorassan with Afghan assistance. Invasion of Persia a preliminary part of Suric’s programme, immediate aim being offensive and defensive alliance between Bolsheviks, Afghans, and Turks, and ultimate object freeing of Islam. 15048. M., 3rd November. Merv Agent’s report. There was much talk in Merv on journey there and back of attacking Khorassan, driving British out of Persia, and giving Afghan large slice of Eastern Persia. Agent says Bolsheviks are confident this is fixed policy of Moscow. Bolshevik envoy (Suric) is generally supposed to be going to Kabul to fix up details. 15184. M., 5th November. Officer Commanding Bajgiran reports rumoured orders from Moscow that Azerbaijan Republic is to be converted to Bolshevik persuasion and egged on to attack Persia. 15241. M., 8th November. Bolshevik designs in regard to Persia. A Sart formerly closely identified with Bolsheviks, still working with them, but actually now in employ of Amir of Bokhara, informed one of my confidential Agents in Merv on the 31st October :— 1. Object of mission of Afghans and Kasim Beg to Moscow is to bring about Bolshevik-Mahommedan solidity throughout Asia and ruin the British Empire by destroying its power in the Near and Middle East. 2. Programme to be discussed at Moscow consisted in the first place of plans t(3 win over Persia to Bolshevik and pan-Islam side by means of peaceful propa ganda. Emissaries are to be sent to Persian democrats and all others disaffected towards present regime. It was hoped by these means to coerce the Shah’s Government into annulling recent Anglo-Persian treaty, establishing really democratic regime and so bringing Persia definitely into Bolshevik orbit without recourse to arms. When this had become fait accompli the necessary further steps for ejectment of British from Asia would be taken. 3. Should above method fail in gaining over Persia, a large army, not less- than 150,000 strong, composed of Bolsheviks, Afghans, Central Asia Mahom- medans, and Chinese mercenaries, would invade Persia and establish Bolshevik rule. Simultaneously and co-ordinated with the above, Afghans and frontier tribes to invade India, whilst Turkey would foment rising in Kurdistan and Persian Azerbaijan, for which plans, matured by Turkish regular officers, are now in preparation. 4. Above is quite possibly accurate description of enemy designs. It tallies with Kasim Beg’s constant announcements. To what extent programme was. endorsed at Moscow remains to be seen. B 2 5055. According to telegram from Bajgiran to-day, Kasim Beg had returned to Askabad. If this is correct we may expect intense propaganda in Persia in near future. 15499. M., 13th November. Report from reliable Agent in Merv, 4th November- Plans are being discussed for attacking the British in Khorassan. If such is decided upon, Bolsheviks consider that Afghan assistance may be relied on. 15522. M., 11th November. Intelligence report from Bajgiran 10th November: All barracks in Askabad full of Bolshevik troops ; all tracks crossing Persian frontier are closely watched by Bolsheviks. 15523. M., 10th November. In connection with report of Turkish anti-British propaganda, especially in regard to betrayal of Persia by British, private letter from Governor of Asterabad just received states that (a) Russian Cossack officers do nothing to stop the entry of Bolsheviks or Turkish agents or restrain Zamuts who assist them. The attitude of Cossack officers has become worse since Anglo- Persian agreement ; (6) active steps to assist and encourage our enemies are taken by the Russian Consul at Asterabad who has lately gone on leave. 15568. M., 16th November. Lenin’s policy and that of Central Government is indicated to be readiness to give autonomy to Moslems of Central Asia, probably on condition they join in attack on Persia and India. 15710. V., 21st November. Kasim Beg says the time is at hand when Enver will lead Moslem Central Asia against Persia. 15734. M., 10th (? 20th) November. Reported from Tashkend that Lenin has recently sent 23 German orientalists from Moscow to spread Bolshevik propaganda through Asia, including 3 to Persia. 15735. M., 20th November. Information from Bolshevik deserters arriving at Bajgiran, that Bolshevik plan is to capture Krasnovodsk as soon as possible and then raise trouble in Persia. XV.—Bolshevik Assistance to Afghans in Material, &amp;c. 15184 M., 5th November. According to Merv report Bolshevik-Afghan current negotiations are as follows: Bolsheviks cede whole area of 4ulatan-Kushk (both inclusive) to Afghans. Bolsheviks also give Afghans 30,000 rifles, 1,500 machine guns, 500 guns with ammunition. In return Afghans lend Bolsheviks force 600 troops to serve with Bolsheviks under Mahommedan commander. This is said to be only part of large projects to be unfolded by Suric in Kabul. Suric, 4th November. The Afghans’ connection with us is based simply on obtaining military help from our side. The extent and the expediency of this help can only be established (? on receipt of information) of Bravin at Kabul. 15338 M., 9th November. Suric’s aims in Kabul reported to be discussion of situation, conclusion of a treaty, and arrange for provision of numbers of aeroplarfes with material and extensive plant and materials for manufacture of munitions in Afghanistan. *• XVI.—Miscellaneous: Movements of Bolshevik Troops in Trans- Caspia, Food Situation in Bolshevik Area, Intrigues in Trans-Caucasia, &amp;c. 14994 M., 2nd November. In support of presumption that Bolsheviks aim to get Krasnovodsk as soon as possible, Officer Commanding Bajgiran wires 1st November that refugees from Askabad report Bolsheviks have issued orders for immediate conscription of everyone, irrespective of nationality, for advance on Krasnovodsk.Bolsheviks now said to have captured Kizil Arvat and to have proceeded on to Uzun and Kasaujik. Large reinforcements have reached Bolsheviks from lashkend direction, and their strength on Askabad front is said to be 10,000. Bolsheviks are requisitioning all live-stock and transport animals. 15184 M„ 5th November. Officer CommandiDg Bajgi ran wires 4th November. -Arrivals from Askabad confirm that universal (? conscription omitted) being vigorously enforced. Both Kizil Arvat and Askabad full of troops for advance on Krasnovodsk. ^ n i r -i Russian Jews who escaped from Trans-Caspia state that Bolsheviks are determined to capture Krasnovodsk as soon as possible. It is commonly stated that orders received from Moscow to this effect from Baku (two corrupt groups) obtain, and the Azerbaijan Republic to be converted to Bolshevik persuasion and egged on to attack Persia. .. *.. t Suric, 4th November. Considers that the peace concluded with the Afghans (by the British) will not be permanent. 15339 M., 9th November. Following telegram received from Bajgiran to-day^ Kizil Arvat front remains unchanged. Bolsheviks have now 15,000 troops between Kizil Arvat and Askabad, and it is said that force is to be increased up to 40 000 bv reinforcements from Orenburg side as the early capture of Krasnovodsk is considered imperative. Elaborate arrangements are being made at Askabad loi the accommodation of the expected reinforcements. 15499 M. 13th November. A reliable Agent at Merv reports 4th November : Putting together information from all sources, including check on railway movements, estimated Bolshevik strength in Trans-Caspia (corrupt group) from Charjm to Kizil Arvat front is: 60 guns, of which 15 are large calibre, more than M machine guns, (? 4,000) cavalry, 15,000 infantry, 8 armoured trains, 6 armoured cars. (This agrees generally with reports Irom Askabad.) Bolsheviks state that large numbers of the volunteer force are deserting, some to the Bolsheviks, and more are making off south through the Yamut country to south-east of Caspian coast. The Bolsheviks are confident of very early capture of Krasnovodsk. Ihey do not contemplate a movement across the Caspian during the ^jnter 1 e situation requires urgent support of Turkish and Kurd forces which are to collec, in the Urumieh area. Suric 9th November, to Karakhan. The Afghan Consul-General at Pashkend has private information to the effect that the tribes on the North-Eastern frontier have risen against England, and in a series of successful encounters have taken several t housand prisoners. The Indian .Government has approached Afghanistan on the subject The Consul-General, even at meetings, talks of a speedy rupture with KWland Everything points to the necessity for a speedy departure. ” Suric adds that he has learned that the British left Baku a month and a half ao-o i.e. mid-September; that they left a large quantity of arms, &amp;c m Baku ; tKit’the Government in Baku consists of various parties, including Mensheviks, muler the Presidency of Nasim-bei-Josuff; that the Government attempted to enter into economic relations with Denikin, but were prevented by the working masses ; and that the Communists’ party is enormous m Baku. 15521 M ' 10th November.

Intelligence officer Bajgiran wires as follows :—10th November New arrivals confirm that 15,000 Bolsheviks are now on Kizil Arvat front and all barracks in Askabad are full. All tracks crossing Persian Frontier art closely watched by Bolsheviks. Some recent reinforcements in Askabad come from Orenburg or beyond. Many Armenians are said to be joining Bolsheviks, having deserted from volunteers. M 10th November. Turkish Agent who left here for volunteer front, but rJti’Mlv returned owing to volunteers’ retirement to Kazanjik, reports as follows • “ At Chat-i-Atrak (due north of Gumbad-i-Kabuz) he met a Turk calling himself Essen (probably Hassan Effendi). Latter had arrived from Constantinople mu Batoum, Baku, Gumbad-i-Kabuz He was going along \ alley of Sumbar River to Nukhur, thence by rail to Askabad. This Turk told inhabi tants British had seized all property and destroyed Constantinople. Time was at *14 hand, however, when British would be expelled from Turkey and all the East- No faith was to be placed in British assertions as to pledges. They would abandon Persia and leave her at the mercy of Bolsheviks just as they had betrayed Russia and lurkomans. He added two Turkish Generals, one of whom was Djemal Pasha, were already in Baku.” In this conjunction private letter from Governor of Asterabad just received states that (a) Russian Cossack officers do nothing to stop the entry of Bolsheviks or Turkish Agents, or restrain Zamuts who assist them. The attitude of Cossack officers has become worse since Anglo-Persian agreement ; (b) active steps to assist and encourage our enemies are taken by the Russian Consul at Asterabad, who has lately gone on leave. 15523. M., 10th November. Serbian and Austrian lately arrived here from Tashkend state that in September Bolsheviks captured in Orenburg and elsewhere thousands of new rifles ol American make which had never been unpacked from their original factory cases, and also hundreds of machine guns of British make.

Information from Bolshevik deserters arriving at Bajgiran that Bolsheviks are very short of flour. 13990. C.C., Baghdad, 20th November. There is no indication that troubles in Mosul area are spreading and it is increasingly clear that Turkish intrigue directed from Erzeroum and Van, rather than Kurdish nationalism, is the cause of the present effervescence. 15871. M., 23rd November. Report received from Askabad that Kizil Arvat has been recaptured by Volunteers. Fourteen trains of reinforcements despatched westward from Askabad on 18th November. 15903. M., 24th November. Agent reports on 17th November train passed Merv for Askabad front, containing mostly Cossacks and Caucasians from Orenburg side, plus two heavy guns and much ammunition.

Several reports now indicate that Volunteers have recaptured Kizil Arvat. Volunteer advanced troops reported from Bajgiran on 23rd November to have reached Archman. 14134. C.C., Baghdad, 24th November. Letter from Sayyid Taha dated 4th Novem ber, but sent previous to news of Akra rising, states great efforts being made byTurkish propagandists in Van vilayet and Shamsdinan and southwards to spread rumours in favour of the Turks and unfavourable to British, e.g., arrival of large numbers of Turks at Van and Sart [? and that] large sums in gold have been despatched to Shamsdinan for distribution. Taha reports that propaganda is having considerable effect and^ claims that withdrawal of Assistant Political Officer from Urumiyeh has given new life to this propaganda, (c/. 15499 above.) 15989. M., 25th November. Agents report four more trains passed west through Merv, period of 18th to 20th November. Two were armoured trains. Total contents of above estimated at 1,850 men, 4 heavy guns, ammunition, rails, fuel, live-stock, and rations. Most troops were Kirghiz and Sarts with some Russians, Armenians, and Persians. Fighting value of the whole small. All civil traffic on railway stopped. Arrivals from Askabad report Volunteers captured Kalateh aided by aeroplanes, -and main body now west of Geok Tappeh. Bolsheviks lost considerable rolling-stock, including armoured train. 16152. M., 28th November:— A Belgian refugee named M. Halalwa, ex Tashkend, has arrived at our outpost. Following information has been obtained as the result of a preliminary examination. The organisation of Tashkend railway is working, though but badly, as the track is much damaged, all rolling stock in a deplorable condition and fuel bad and scanty. Troops have come through from Moscow and 40,000 for whom barrack accommodation is being prepared at various points are expected in the future. The Bolsheviks attach immense importance to the Turkestan Front, and it is rumoured that Trotsky himself is expected in order to speed up things. 2. Generally speaking, the Bolshevik troops are in much better condition than they were last year ; better armed and equipped and better trained and disciplined. They have better clothing but their boots are of indifferent quality. All rifles are 3 line Russian. Troops’ rations fairly good, evidently at the expense of the inhabitants. 3. Bad condition of the railways and rolling stock and scarcity of fuel* in all their territory are the great weaknesses of the Bolsheviks. In Ferghana they have taken up the Namangan branch line in order to obtain materials for the repair of the Kizil Arvat track. It is reported that they intend to extend the Vyerni line to tap a wheat area and have also built a short line to a coal-mine in Semirechia. Coal of poor quality is being produced but it is unsuitable for use in the fireboxes of oil-fired engines. 4. There is a great scarcity of petrol throughout all Bolshevik territory ; hence their anxiety to push through to Krasnovodsk and tap Baku petrol and engine oil. 5. Large reinforcements have gone to Kizil Arvat front and the Bolsheviks are confident that they will secure Krasnovodsk at an early date. C.G.S. X. 4828. T.—S., 27th November. Frunze at Samara is instructed by Tashkend to send forward the whole political section for the front in Turkestan, and reports necessary measures taken for establishment of an “ agitation point ” in Aktiubinsk area, and in Aralske More area, which is the most important focus for all units arriving in Turkestan. Arrangements also made to send on to Tashkend a supply of “ agitation literature ” and propagandist personnel. 16151. M., 28th and 29th November. Bolsheviks strongly reinforced and again advancing on Kizil Arvat. Volunteers also reported having received reinforcements. Merv Agent, 22nd November, reports Merv garrison reduced to forty rifles, all other troops and transport animals sent to Kizil Arvat front. Two troop trains with 4 guns and many machine guns passed Merv westward, 21st November. W.N. 337. *** 29th November :— The Congress of Communist Mussulmans at Moscow has voted the following resolutions in regard to the Eastern question :— (1) The problem of the international social revolution cannot be solved without the participation of the East. (2) The Russian Communist party, being the leader of the Communist world movement, must take concrete measures to spread revolution in the East. * cf. § viii, V., 17th November, unnumbered, paragraph (a). t16 (3) Sectious of the Third Communist International (V are to be established) in Oriental countries, and the national movements in those countries are also to be supported, as the latter tend to upset the existing authority while not opposing revolutionary aspirations. (4) Revolutionary energy must be encouraged, asnt will start a new era in the East. The best way to do this is to make use of the various Soviet Republics as bases for revolutionary work in the East. (5) As concrete measures for training Communist workmen as Oriental specialists, a corps of Soviet Orientalists will be created in the East in order to give effect to the decision of the Russian Communist party as to the right of the peoples to settle their own conditions of life in all places where the situations allow of this being done. These decisions are bound to make the most tremendous alteration in the whole Oriental and Mussulman world. XVII.—Appreciations of the Situation. 14994. M., 2nd November. There seems to be no doubt that important movements are taking place in Turkestan. Exactly what they are still remains indefinite, as evidence is [ ? J obscure. Everything points to (a) Bolshevik intentions to push through to Krasnovodsk as soon as possible ; (b) to smash Bokhara apparently with Afghan aid. When these objects are attained, opinion in Turkestan seems to be very prevalent that invasion of Khorassan, again with aid of Afghans, will take place. Cox, Tehran. 719. 6th November :— Governor-General of Khorassan reports to Persian Government that General Malleson has visited him, and given him following appreciation of situation :— Bolshevik Afghans, Caucasus Government and Enver party of Young Turks have entered into an offensive and defensive agreement, and contemplate early invasion of Khorassan. Weakness of Admiral Kolchak has enabled them to obtain reinforcements via Orenburg, and they count upon seizing Krasnovodsk and obtaining control over the Caspian. They then contemplate invading Khorassan and effecting junction by landing between Persian Turkestan southern shore of the Caspian and Persian Azerbaijan. Khorassan is consequently in imminent danger. English are being reinforced but in any case our hold of particular point is most seriously threatened. Persian troops also need reinforcing in order to maintain internal order and garrison [? open] places. Governor-General can do nothing more than he is doing on his present budget, and asks for the necessary increase of funds. Suric, 4th November, to Karakhan.—The Afghans’ connection with the Bolsheviks is based simply on their desire to obtain assistance from Russia with a view to renewed war with the Indian Government. F.S. Unnumbered. G. of]., 10th November:— Secret. Please refer to Cox’s telegram 719, 6th November, to Foreign Office, giving Malleson’s anticipations of early concerted attack on Khorassan by Afghans, Bolsheviks, and Young Turk party. Afghan politics are in very fluid condition, and it is impossible to prophesy, but our information goes to show that Amir is absorbed in scheme for confederation of Mahommedans of Central Asia under leadership of Afghanistan and is keeping Bolsheviks, and possibly \oung Turks also, in play with this object. It is as likely as not that he will turn against Bolsheviks if they oppose absorption by him of the former Russian territory such as Panjdeh, a scheme which does not seem necessarily inimical to British interests and might, in fact, be in the end favourable to them by increasing thickness of buffer between Russia and India. It does not seem to us probable, while Amir is playing for such big stakes, he will risk another embroilment with us, which he must know an attack on Khorassan might involve. Meanwhile we think it all to the good that, while Amir is apparently pursuing policy which may eventually breed trouble between him and future form of Russian Government in Central Asia, we are keeping him absolutely at (? arms) length, so that we cannot possibly be suspected of complicity in the Amir’s schemes.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000788.0x00035d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/A185</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x00035d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/A185</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Central Asia, Persia, and Afghanistan.
