It will be seen from the orders of the Govt.of India that they have not given a general sanction to draw daily allowance @ Rs.6/- per day for the staff returning from leave for the period of their waiting at Bombay or Karachi. Mr.Carrau states that he waited in Bombay for a boat from 2-4-45 to 22-4-45 i.e. 21 days. It is evident that one has to incur considerable expenditure when staying temporarily in expensive cities like Bombay or Karachi for such a long time. If approved, we as done may forward a formal application which Mr.Carrau will submit, and in case forward it to Bushire with a request to approach the Govt.of India to of Mr. reconsider their decision.
