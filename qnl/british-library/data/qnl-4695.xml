Robinson recounts his recent meeting with Sultan ben Suggur and states that the latter does not believe that he is liable for the payment of 190 dollars. Robinson reports that Sultan ben Suggur has requested that he be allowed to make another reference to Kemball before paying the money.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x000019#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
