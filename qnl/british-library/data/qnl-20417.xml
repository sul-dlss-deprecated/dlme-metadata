I concur as this was expressly stipulated by Ibn Saud and moreover postponement until after by pilgrimage season,^which time tribes will have moved north, will involve further delay of at least 6 months. ^hey suggest Political Agent at Kuwait as President, if Resident in the Persian Gulf concurs, and Kuwait as venue, if the Shaikh sees no objection: I concur.

' iViVt ^7-)- h46 (84) Letter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulp, to the Colonial Office, No. 11, dated the 25th March 1930./ ^ I have the honour to invite a reference to telegram No. 2300, elated the 24th February 1930, from His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, regarding the conference of the two Kings. 2. In paragraph 2 of that telegram His Excellency the High Com missioner reported that both the Kings had agreed that a tribunal for the adjudication of claims in accordance with the provisions of the Bahra agreement should assemble at Kuwait in June under the presidency of either Colonel Dickson or Major Fowle as might be decided by His Majesty's Government. 3. For the reasons given in my telegram No. 40 of the 22nd February [Serial No. (40)], I consider that it would be preferable that Colonel Dickson should not preside : on the other hand Major Fowle has a good knowledge of the language and some judical training, has served in Iraq, Aden and other Arabian ports, and could of course avail himself of Colonel Dickson's local knowledge of tribal customs, etc., if necessary. Further, I could make his services available for the purpose any time during the summer, as Captain 'Russell could act temporarily as Secretary as he did last summer. I trust therefore that His Majesty's Government will agree to his appointment as president of the tribunal. 4. It would seem desirable however that certain points of procedure and tribal custom should be clarified before the tribunal is convened, irrespective of the question of who is to be president, and Major Fowle has prepared a note on such points as have occurred to him which I for ward herewith for the consideration of His Majesty's Government. 5. It would certainly seem desirable in order to avoid subsequent delay that an agreement regarding these matters should be arrived at be fore the tribunal assembles, and I would therefore venture to suggest that, if His Majesty's Government see no objection, the two Governments should be invited to exchange lists of their claims as soon as possible and to sav whether they agree to the procedure outlined in the draft note at page 36 of Colonial Office Print Middle East No. 28 being followed mutatis mutandis by the proposed tribunal under the Bahra agreement. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, and His Maiestv's Charge d'Affaires at Jeddah. ^ ' y/ , , / j /.

E. the High Commissioner for Iraq, to the Presiuent of the Council of Ministers, Iraq, No. P. O.-102, dated the 126th April 1930. I have received an enquiry from the Secretary of State, regarding the procedure that it is intended to adopt at the Tribunal which, as at pre sent arranged, is to meet at Kuwait in June to settle XaJd-'Iraq claims. As I told Your Excellency a few days ago I am inclined to doubt whe ther the Tribunal will succeed in obtaining any real satisfaction of the claims of the 'Iraq tribes. It will be exceeding difficult for the Tribunal to prove or disapprove the validity of claims dating back over two years, and the Tribunal is also likely to find itself entangled in side issues, such as the claim that the Dahamshah tribe belongs to Xajd. When I discussed the question with Fuad Hamza in Baghdad on March 10th, he also said spontaneously that the Tribunal was unlikely to achieve anything as the Najd delegates would put in claims to balance the 'Iraq claims. He suggested that the only satisfactory solution was for His Majesty King Feisal to accept a lump sum in settlement of all claims ; King Ibn Sa'ud has already offered £10,000 [cf., Serial No. (42)] to be shared between the tribes of Kuwait and 'Iraq, and Fuad Hamza said he thought it likely that King Ibn Sa'ud would agree to increase this figure so that 'Iraq might receive the round sum of £10,000. As Your Excellency is aware however King Ibn Sa'ud has not yet paid the £10,000 which he promised to pay early in March. I am sure in my own mind that his failure to do so in due to his uncertainty whether His Majesty King Feisal intends to carry out the undertaking in regard to Ibn Basiihur which King Ibn Sa'ud understands His Majesty to have given during the Lupin conference. I understood from Your Excellency that His Majesty was corresponding direct with King Ibn Sa'ud on this sub ject and I hope that a satisfactory settlement will shortly be reached. I fear that it will be useless to propose to King Ibn Sa'ud the matter of 'Iraq's claims against Najd until the Ibn Mashhur question is definitely disposed of. In order that I may be able to reply to the Secretary of State I should be glad to know as soon as possible :— (i) Whether the 'Iraq Government would agree to accept a lump sum payment of £10,000 in settlement of their claims, and to Lc239FD■ .

Secret letter from the Councillor to His Excellency the High Commis sioner for Iraq, to the Prime Minister, Iraq Administration, No. P.

His Excellency understood Your Excellency to sav in the course of a recent conversation with him that the Iraq Government had decided to present the claims of their tribes before the Tribunal to be convened under Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement in preference to accepting a lump sum payment from King Ibn Saud. In that case it will be necessary to proceed immediately with the arrangements for the meeting of the Tribunal at Kuwait. As Your Excellency is aware it is probable that the President of the Tribunal w 11 be Major T. C. Fowle though I still await the Secretary of State's final decision on this point. In the meantime Major Fowle has made certain suggestions as to the procedure to be followed on which I should be glad to receive the views of Your Excellency as soon as possible. Major Fowle's suggestions may be summarised as follows :— (1) Lists of claims should be exchanged forthwith betweenthe Nejd and Iraq Governments, copies being sent to the President of the Iribunal for information. (2) Certain conditions should be agreed to in advance by both Governments, viz. :— (а) 1st November 1927, will be taken as the starting point for the liquida tion of losses. No account will be taken of raids committed prior to that date ; all raids which may have occurred between that date and the date of the meeting of the Tribunal will be covered by the Tribunal. (б) It will be open to the Tribunal to call any witnesses they may think necessary provided such witnesses are summoned through the Government to whom they may be subject. (c) Should the Nejd and Iraq members of the Tribunal disagree, the deci sion of the President shall be accepted as final and binding on both parties. {d) The remuneration of the arbitrator and the expenses incurred in connection with the Tribunal shall be borne by the Government of the Hejaz and Nejd and by the Government of Iraq equally. Major Fowle presumes that as regards the procedure of the Tribunal tribal custom will be followed as far as possible, but enquires what procedure will be followed when the tribal customs of the Iraqi and Nejdi tribes differ. His Excel lency suggests that it is impossible to legislate for such cases in advance and that it should be left to the discretion of the President to adopt such procedure as h^ thinks fit. His Excellency wishes Your Excellency to understand that the suggestions contained in this letter are merely tentative and that he is as yet unaware of the views of the Secretary of State on them. As the time is pressing, however, he would be glad to know as soon as possible, for the information of His Britannic Majesty's Government, the views of the Iraq Government, on the various points raised. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Rais of the Royal Diwan. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (101). Letter from the Prime Minister of the Iraq Administration, to His Excel- I LENCY THE hlgh commissioner for iraq, No. 1423, dated the 7th M a Y 1930. &gt; '• I have seen Your Excellency's letter No. P. O .-102, dated 20th April 1930, [Serial No. (87)], on the subject of the amount of compensation to be paid to Iraq tribes by the Government of Nejd. It is understood in this connection that His Majesty Ibn Saud had deposited at the Bank in Jeddah a sum of £10,000 to compensate Iraq tribes for the loss and damage sustained by them. When this question came under discussion at the Lupin Conference the representatives of the Iraq Government could not help showing their astonishment at the insignificance of this sum, since the actual lo ses sustained by Iraq tribes, according to officially compiled lists, exceed £60,000. Ai last His Majesty Ibn Saud left the question of compensation and the determina ' tion of the amount necessary therefor to the discretion of His Majesty King Faisal,70 (102) promising to accept such result as His Majesty the King of Iraq may satisfy himself as being conformable to fact. The position of an umpire in a case like this is, as is not hid from Your Ex- collency, a difficult [delicate (?)] one, and courtesy calls for the exercise of consider able moderation even though it should imply unfairness. Actincr on this principle and having assured himself of the correctness of the figures representing the claims of liaq tribes, His Majesty agreed to assess these claims at a minimum of £C0 000 and undertook, in view of the fine feeling shown by His Majesty King Saud in leaving the matter to the discretion of 1 lis Majesty, to induce the Iraq Government to accept halt of this amount, i.e., £30,000 only. I do not wish to hide from Your Excellency the fact that having examined 1 he question with the Ministry of Interior from all its aspects I consider that to reduce the total figure by one-half is considerd to constitute a great sacrifice and a consider able loss for the Iraqi side. As, however, a promise to that effect has already been made by His Majesty the King, I have no alternative but to agree, with the realisation that this repvesents an act of moderation implying such excessive gene rosity as cannot be made the subject of bargaining (or discussion). Should, however, the Government of Nejd hesitate to accept this solution notwithstanding the concession made, we can only express our regret at that and resort, as a matter of necessity, to the settlement of the question in accordance with Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Rais of the Royal Diwan. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (101).

O.-108, dated the 8th of May 1930 (Enclosure No. 1), was written. Before taking further action His Excellency the High Commissioner would be glad if Your Excellency could confirm that the Iraq Government desire that King Ibn Saud should now be informed of the Iraq Government's readiness to accept a lump sum payment in settlement of their claims. His Excellency had understood from his conversation with Your Excellency that the Iraq Government had definitely abandoned the proposal to obtain a settlement by lump sum payment, and he is anxious that there should be no mistake.

I am directed to inform H. E. the High Commissioner that His Majesty sees no objection to the convening of the tribunal being postponed to the beginning of October next, in the event of His Majesty King Ibn Saud declining to agree to 'the sum of 30,000 Guineas which it is proposed to suggest to him. In the personal opinion of His Majesty, resort to arbitration, in the event of the above sum not being agreed to, would be preferable ; otherwise to forego com pensation altogether prior to arbitration would be more in keeping with the dignity of Iraq than to accept the sum of 10,000 guineas offered by King Ibn Saud, which is indeed hardly sufficient to meet the claims of two or three Iraqis. In this connection I enclose, for the information of H. E. the High Commis sioner, copy of a draft letter which His Majesty proposes to address to His Majesty King Ibn Saud. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (114). Draft of a letter from Faisal, son of Husain, King of Iraq, to His Majesty King Abdulaziz, son of Abdulrahman al-Faisal, al-Saud, of Nejd, Hejaz and Dependencies, may God preserve him. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings. I trust that my dear brother is enjoying perfect health and comfort. His Majesty my brother must remember the conversation which took place between us, during our meeting on the ' steamer ' {sic.) ' Lupin concerning the question of compensation and the necessity of reaching a settlement thereof at the earliest possible date and how he was so good as to entrust its settlement to his brother. To say the truth, I felt at the time the heavy nature of the burden involved by the confidence shown by Your Majesty in connection with so delicate a question and one which I would rather not have entered into but for my strong77 anxiety for the strengthening of the bonds of amity and friendship between our two countries and for the necessity of removing the undesirable impressions left on cer- tainminds by recent raids on the borders of the country. On my return to Iraq I proceeded with the examination of the question from all its aspects, and I found out that the sum claimed by Iraqis under the title of compensation was not less than 70,000 guineas. But anxious to settle this ques tion and in view of the delicate position in which I found myself, 1 lound that it was inevitable for me to reduce this sum to the lowest possible limit, and accordingly I decided that it should be (reduced to) 30,000 guineas, believing that this (latter) amount may afford some compensation to Iraqis and may a so meet Your Majesty's approval. So I suggest this (figure) to you in the hope that you will consent to it. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (114).

He said t 'day that King hfid given orders for payment. He hoped it would be made within a week or at the furthest a fortnight.

'• Firstly I want you to express my regret to the Hon*hie the Political Resident for having taken so long over my reply but the delay has not been entirely my fault, for I could not get down to business until I had received the copy of the Bahra Agreement from you which I asked for, and which only reached me on 10th March. Then there were delays getting it properly translated ior the Shaikh, and last but not least the latter's dis inclination to tackle the question during Mohamed ibn sultan's presence (Bin Baud's commander) in Kuwait territory. 3. When I did finally get the Shaikh dovm to business and persuaded him to read through the terms of the Bahra Agreement, he seemed to find things not as much to his liking as he thought he would, and he expressed the opinion that as apparently he had everything to lose, and Bin Baud everything to gain, by the Agreement as it stood, he thought it would be much better if things were left alone. 4. I had,previous to this, and by the Hon»ble the Political Resident's verbal permission, given the Shaikh an unofficial copy of the document which Bin Saud signed and gave us at the Khabari Watha Conference and he Shaikh 'tein A. A. Russell, M,C., Under Secretary to the Hon»ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.f Shaikh Ahmad appeared to think that the guarantees con tained therein about Nejd tribes in future not raiding ; and Bin Saud T s willingness to pay compensation if they did, was all that was necessary to safeguard Kuwait in future. 5. When however I pressed the Hon'ble the Political Residents point of view on the Shaikh, namely that a proper agreement would emphasize in marked manner the independence of Kuwait, and would provide a definite machinery for the settlement of past claims in place of the present hopeless and antiquated method of trying to, and for ever failing to get satisfaction out of Bin Saud, the Shaikh pointed out and with some reason , that the existing wording of the Bahra agreement would enable Bin oaud to force him the Shaikh of Kuwait to keep out all adjacent liejd tribes from his territory who desired to enter either for grazing purposes, or in order to purchase provisions they were in need of. As the former was closely mixed up with the latter, and his Shaikh Ahmad 1 s whole policy was, and always had been, to try and get Bin Saud to allow his North Eastern tribes to visit Kuwait territory where water and grazing wees of the best and purchase their requirements from the town, it was like asking him to cut his throat by giving Bin Saud a definite handle whereby he could force him (the Shaikh of Kuwait) to keep these self same persons out. It was quite clear added the Shaikh that under Article 3 of the Bahra Agree ment for instance. Bin 3aud had only say that as there was quite good grazing in Nejd his tribes could not cross the border, and the thing was done. 6. It took me some time to convince the Shaikh that if he did not quite like the wording of the existinr 3ahra Agreement, he could make any nug^estions he chose in the shape of additionn and alto rail onn, and that thof?o would all be very carefulJy oomjidered by Colonnl Dlscoe, especially as the latter^ Who w n oortnlnly out to holp&gt;( u 3&gt;-3'7 A i'7 nelp him safeguard Kuwait's interests, would probably on his side offer other suggestions also. r7# To C}X ^ a long story short and after seven long meetings, I managed to get the Shaikh to write me his letter of today (dated 17th April 1950) translation of wk : which I attach with this. The Shaikh's letter speaks for L it sell and v ;e have no?/ got something to commence operations on. I might iiere mention that I am responsible for the suggested additions to Article 3, and also for the in- troduction of new Articles 11 and 12, both of which pleased the Shaikh Immensely. Article,was the Shaikh's idea en oil ely, and tnough I told him this would probably wreck the Agreement he insisted that it should go into any treaty with Ivu.;ait, if only to show K.M. Government &amp; Bin Saud that he had never agreed to the Mutair (ilwa) Ajman and Awazim being taken away from him, and not only looked upon the old boundaries of Kuwait as they stood in Mubarak's time, as Kuwait's 'terra irredenta', but indeed had every hope of someday recovering these lost territories. In this connection, I should like you to draw the .-lon'ble the political Eesidont f s attention to ray rather lengthy despatches No. 451 of 1st August 1929 and my No. 457 of 3rd August 1929, which bear on this subject, and the second of which contains Shaikh Ahmad's letter of 27th Safar 1348 referred to by him in his present letter. 8. Shaikh Ahmad of course has repeatedly told me that if Bin Saud were to die and he should be alive at the time, he would certainly attempt to regain his lost territory and tribes, in the resulting confusion and disorder that 7/ould ensue in Nejd, and that he has it on the authority of Sir Percy Cox's that he will have every right to do so. I do not suppose Shaikh Ahmad would have much difficulty in carrying out his object either, should that day ever came, seeing that the Awazim, Mutair,£- Ajman whose whole economic existence lies in the direction of and depends on Kuwait, would always be ready to assist.assist. In any case the Shaikh believes they will be Ss I on his side should fortune change and smile upon him C once again, 9* As regards the alterations and additions now submitted by the Shaikh, the following are my comments:- xlRTIGLE 5 . (old). The underlined portions are new, and I think they are necessary, for under the existing wording of the treaty there is nothing to prevent Bin Saud saying to any of his tribesmen who v/ished to enter Kuwait, that grazing was equally good further south in Nejd, and that therefore they could not enter Kuwait, or again if he grudgingly gave them permission to enter Kuwait, he could undo all the advantages such permission gave, by forbidding them (as he id doing now), to 'musabal' or visit Kuwait for the purchase of food. Shaikh Ahmad quite sees this point. e ^xHTIGLE 11 (new) • This I think is a necessary e safeguard, though Bin Saud may not like it. ARTICLE 12 (new). This if we can get Bin Saud to accept it, Y/ill give us a starting point from which to commence negotiations on behalf of Kuwait for the resumption of the trade relations which have for so long been denied her. ARTICLE 15 (newJ. Though I agree with Shaikh Ahmad T s point of view, the wording might be altered to make it more palatable for Bin Saud, without actual ly changing the sense. .That Shaikh Ahmad means to convey is that he reserves to himself, his heirs and successors the right, even though he should sign the new agreement. L a to recover any lost territory or tribes that may have been deprived of, either in war or by 'force majeure'. This is after all a legitimate aspiration. As regards the remaining articles of the Bahra Agreemait, Shaikh Ahmad agrees to let them stand, only inserting the name 'Kuwait' where now the word ^Iraq' is found'.

Dated 18th Dhil Qa^da 1348 (17th April 1930). After compliments Sec. &lt;Yith reference to the various conversations which have taken place between Your Excellency and ourselves regarding the question of an agreement bet ween Kuwait and Nejd after the manner of the 'Bahra' agreement between 'Iraq and Nejd, we have taken note that the -on'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf considers that it v/ould be to the interest of ourselves as Ruler of Kuwait to conclude such an agree- nent wi oh i.ejd, as in the first place it would emphasize i 1 the independence of Kuwait,and secondly it would provide a definite machinery for the settlement of claims in the place of the present procedure, in accordance with v/hich such claims are to be settled by direct corres pondence between 11.i^.King Bin Saud and ourselves, and which method has proved quite ineffective in the past. V/e have the honour now to inform Your Excellency that we agree that H.M.Government should conclude a treaty on the lines of the aforesaid 'Bahra' Agreement between ourselves and the Government of Nejd, and we consider the treaty for the most part might suitably follow the wording of the aforesaid Bahra agreement. We consider it necessary however to say that as we do not possess any tribes now-and as the advantage would appear to lie with H.M.Bin Saud, in that he will suc cessfully be able to prevent under the terms of the agreemeno as taey stands any of his tribesmen who live near our border from entering Kuwait whether for obtain- | i-E-S grazing or food, certain alterations and addit as given in the attached statement should ' added to^ c i 4 to the existing wording of Bahra agreement, rle therefore submit these for the consideration of the Eon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In particular Article 13 has been considered necessary, as we wish it to be particularly understood by H.M,Crovernment that we never agreed to our tribes being handed over to H.M.King Bin Saud in the first inctance nor that the Kuwait boundaries as they stood in my grand-father Mubarak's time should be altered as they have been.

I anticipated that the reply of the Shaikh of Kuwait regarding the conclu sion of this agreement would be received in a very short period and that I should be in a position to submit my views without undue delay. Unfortunately this has not proved to be the case ; the matter has been discussed at considerable length between the Political Agent and the Shaikh and I have only just received the Shaikh's views*on the subject. The Shaikh hais suggested a number of alterations and additions to the terms of the Bahra Agreement [Enclo. of Serial No. (147) in file No. 149 (iv) N.|24- 25] and I shall therefore have to make a further reference to him on the subject. I hope the matter will not be unduly delayed, but in the meantime it may be desirable that I should put before His Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India my views regarding the general question of maintaining the in dependence of Kuwait. * ♦ 2. Before the War the vital importance of maintaining the independence of KuVait was clearly recognised and numerous measures were taken to prevent Turkish encroachment and to retain under our control a port, which it was thought might become the terminus of the Baghdad Railway. 3. These factors no longer exist but others have arisen and I would submit that the strategic importance of Kuwait is no less now than then. Firstly, it is on the flank of the main route for the supply of oil from Persia to British territory and hostile forces at Kuwait could easily, I imagine, blockade the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. Secondly, it is a most important point on the projected Arab air route. Thirdly, it would probably be a useful subsidiary or emergency Naval base in case of necessity, should it at any time be found undesirable to utilise Basrah. 4. Kuwait, however, is surrounded by two powerful neighbours—Nejd and Iraq—each of whom casts covetous eyes upon it. The desire of Ibn Sand to 'possess himself of Kuwait has been many times demonstrated. He blockaded it, and threatened it, and his officials^ have openly announced that their master would not rest until he had planted his flag on the walls of Kuwait. His blockade of Kuwait is primarily dictated by a desire to compel the Shaikh of Kuwait to give him some hold or control over the Kuwait customs, which are practically the only source of revenue of his small principality. He virtually admitted this to me at my interview with him last January and said quite frankly that the Shaikh of Kuwait had a comfortable income and that he intended to get some of it if he could. 5. The designs of Iraq are less obvious and doubtless entirely un-official, but they are more insidious. While the populace and Ruler of Kuwait can, I think, be counted upon to resist Ibn Sand economic and other factors incline them to listen much more readily to the blandishments of Iraq. Only a few days ago I received a letter on the subject Irom the Political Agent. Colonel Dickson writes : This brings me to a quite new feature of Kuwait politics namely the rather startling efforts which I am convinced are now being made to get the Shaikh to look favourably on Iraq, with what idea in view is not difficult to guess. ' Though it would be most difficult to prove anything, there is little doubt in my mind that important Basrawis 'who come down on \istts, oi who own property in Kuwait, are by order, acti\el\ engaging tin m selves in anti-British propaganda as well as preaching the doctrine of the amalgamation of Kuwait with Iraq. Similar preaching goes on in Basrah, I am told, among the big Kuwait business men and date garden owners. ^ The movement is I believe new, and the propagandists' methods take the following line :— 44 England is made out to be { finished ' as a result of the great war, ^aridf to be slowly 4 going down '. Events in Egypt, Iraq, Persia, the Persian Gulf and India are held up as ' proof ' positive that everyone who tries can successfully throw off England's ' yoke LC280FD14 The Shaikh and the people of Kuwait are told that they must join in the general movement. In England's place Kuwait must accept the overlordship of Nejd or Iraq. Of the two, Nejd will obviously swallow her up, while Iraq will take her to her bosom as a Ipng lost prodigal. That Iraq will treat Kuwait well and allow her to retain her qua si-independence is of course rubbed in, but it is equally well rubbed in that as her interests (mer cantile and land) are so closely bound u'p with Basrah she can no longer continue as she has done in the past and must act. The main thing these gentry promi.se, I am told, is that Iraq will guarantee Kuwait against all Nejd aggression in future, and will allow the Shaikh to retain his gardens at Fao free of taxation as at present.' ' Such is the form of propaganda that, as far as I can make out, is being actively disseminated from Basrah to-day.' It will be clear therefore from the above that my apprehensions on the subject are not devoid of basis. 6. Finally I may mention that last January, when the surrerider of the rebel Mutair and Ajman was being arranged, several articles regarding Kuwait ap peared in the Iraq press and in other newspapers from their Jeddah corres pondent. In them appeals were made to the Shaikh of Kuwait to realise that his ' spiritual home ' was Iraq or Nejd as the case may be. It seems not improbable therefore that attempts will be made in the future to attract Kuwait into the orbit of either Iraq or Nejd, and it would certainly be simpler to check the movement at its initiation than to allow matters to drift and be compelled to intervene in a more drastic form later on. 7. There is a certain school of thought which contends that the simplest course in such circumstances is to proceed immediately with further measures to establish our position at Kuwait, such as the construction of an air base there and the placing, if necessary, of some oil or coal for His Majesty's Ships there : in short, the establishment of a virtual protectorate and to ignore the protests of the Ruler and disregard his wishes. 8. There seem to be two objections to these methods. Firstly, I believe them to be opposed to the general policy of His Majesty's Government ; secondly, they undoubtedly arouse resentment. 9. It may be argued, that this resentment can be ignored, but after all we still hold the British Empire with the traditional corporal's guard, and at a time of crisis it would certainly be preferable, having regard to the limited forces at our disposal that we should retain the regard of the Ruler and 'people of this small principality rather than that the troops, probably limited in numbers, should' be surrounded by a hostile population. The friendship of even small Arab rulers proved of value to us in the last war and may do so in the next. Finally, I believe that by supporting the Shaikh and by taking measures to maintain the independence of Kuwait, we can with a little patience obtain his co-operation and concurrence in all measures that we may deem necessary in our interests. 10. If these views are correct and it is considered desirable that the inde pendence of Kuwait should be maintained then I would suggest that the follow ing measures might be adopted. Each measure in itself does not amount to verv much, but their combined effect would, I think, be noticeable and opportuni ties' will doubtless arise later to adopt further measures to the same end. 11. As regards Nejd I would' suggest firstly that endeavours should be made to bring about an agreement between Nejd and Kuwait on the lines ot the Bahra Agreement. Certain modifications will be necessary regarding, which I will address the Government of India separately. But if an agreement can be negotiated, Ibn Saud will then have formallv recognised the independence of Kuwait and it an article on the line's of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement is inserted he will have given a formal undertaking that his forces will not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders except with the consent of both Governments. This I think will be of value.15 12. The really important question however at issue between Neid and Kuwait is that ot the blockade of Kuwait territory by Ibn Saud. Through this blockade Kuwait has lost 75 per cent, of its trade and of its customs revenue. \\ ere it not for the pearling industry Kuwait would have been practically abandoned by its inhabitants, most of whom would have been compelled to seek their livelihood elsewhere. Ibn Saud shows no signs of relaxing this blockade and I feel sure that it will need the strongest pressure on the part of His Majesty's Government to compel him to do so. Recently I have heard that men have been posted on the Kuwait border to inform caravans that they should not go to Kuwait, but were at libertv to pro ceed to Zubair though Ibn Saud informed me personally, when I pointed out to him that while he laid much stress on the question of customs posts on the Kuwait border he had none on the Iraq frontier, that his caravans did not ^o to Zubair. If however means could' be found of inducing Tbn Saud to permit free com mercial intercourse between Kuwait and Nejd it would do more than anything else to attach the Ruler and his people to our side. It would revive the commerce of the State and the welfare of the com mercial community : it would provide the Ruler with funds with which he could arm his forces and defend his territories and relieve His Majesty's Gov ernment and the Royal Air Force of much responsibility in this respect. The Air Officer Commanding has frequently asked me to urge the Shaikh of Kuwait to improve and increase the limited forces that he maintains, and has himself co-operated in this matter by training Kuwaitis in the handling of machine guns, etc., at Basrah. Unfortunately, in his present impoverished condition, tho Shaikh can do little in this respect and I believe that this year the budget of the State has not balanced. 13. As regards Iraq, there are two measures that I think might be adopted to weaken the link between the two countries. Iraq at present maintains a post office at Kuwait and although the stamps used are Indian stamps surcharged 'Kuwait' letters are delivered by postman in Iraq uniform and the post office is administered by Iraq officials. I write subject to correction but I was told recently that the post office made a comfortable profit. Secondly Kuwait is linked' to Basrah by an Iraq telegraph line. The objec tions to this have been emphasised on many occasions and the sanction of the Government of India was actually received to this line being taken over by the Indian Telegraphs. Unfortunately at the last moment the Director-General of Tele graphs stated that he could not be responsible for the maintenance of a line at such a distance from India. There are also other difficulties in the way of the transfer of the line to India. It would no longer be possible to send telegrams in Arabic and an addi tional terminal rate would be charged on telegrams to Iraq since they would then be treated as foreign telegrams and not as internal telegrams. In view however of the importance of the principle involved I do not think these difficulties should prove insuperable. For instance it might be possible to obtain Arab operators for Kuwait ; it might be possible to arrange for a special rate to be charged for telegrams between Kuwait and Basrah, with which place Kuwait merchants transact most of their business, or it might be possible to connect up Kuwait with the Indo-European Telegraph Department system at Fao. I am examining the matter and will address Government further on the subject. 14i Finally I would urge that Iraq officials,^ British and Arab alike, should scrupulously observe the integrity of Kuwait and in\aiiabl\ tiodt it as foicigu territory. . g|16 (39) The Shaikh is only too pleased to accede to any requests for facilities made to him but he does appreciate his prior permission being sought and I consider it desirable that it should be sought wherever possible so as to remove the effect in the minds of the general public that Kuwait is an appanage of Basrah. 15. A copy of this des'patch is being sent to the Government of India and to His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah.03 w •2^ I siioula be ejiad 11 jsou wo^ia put belore the The suggestion ib t^ls; that aa agreemeht should be negotiated between Kuwait and tteja on the lines of the Bahra A^ruemeat, but articles 5,4,7,8,9 ana 10* ** llrstly to emphasise the ladependence of Kuwait and secondly to provide soxne maunlnery lor seltlemcnt of claims* ana 12 wf the iianra Agreement bot^i these objects will haye been accomplished and if we can also ^et a clause Inserted on the lines of the shaikh's new article !&lt;£, providing for frlexidly discussions with a view to the conclusion of a further agreement for the resumption of trade and coiaraerclal Intercourse then I thlnK we shall nave accomplished a jreat deal.

I have the honour to invite a reference to my despatch No ,20, dated SOth April 1930, regarding the conclusion 'between Kuwait and Nejd of an agreement similar to the Bahra Agreement. 2. 1 stated therein that the Shaikh had suggested a number of alterations and additions to the terms of the Bahra Agreement and that I had made a further reference to him on the subject. 3. In the first communication which I received from Shaikh Sir Ahmad, His Excellency stated that he thought there were great objections to certain articles of the Bahra Agreement when applied to the particular conditions prevailing between Nejd and Kuwait. As His MaJesty^s Government are aware, while the Shaikh of Kuwait has been compelled to recognise the AJman and Mutair and even the Awazim as Kejd tribes, he has never relinquished the hope that a swing of the pendulum and a change of conditions in Central THS Hr.H0H t BLK LOBD PASSyiSLE^P.G., Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, LOKJjOK . * i 1-2- Central AraMa might one day taring atout a reversal ot this position and a rectification of the Kuwait 'borders. Meanwhile the Shaikh has always contended that in accordance with Arah custom these tribes should he at liberty to go into i^uwait territory for grazing and should 'be allowea to purchase their supplies from Kuwait town, and it is primarily to prevent this that Ion Saud has imposed his hloclcade on the Kuwait oorder. In the circumstances, it is natural that the shaikh of Kuwait should be unwilling to agree to conclude any agreement with Nejd analagous to those of articles 3 and 4 of the Bahra Agree ment. I therefore suggested to the Shaikh through Oolonel Dickson, that it might he worthwhile to try and negotiate a treaty between Kuwait and ejd on the lines of the Eahra Agreement, hut omitting clauses which relate to the migration ■■Hi o.t tuibes# Such a treaty would emphasise the independence oi - uwaitj it would provide machinery j| lor ohe settlement of claims, though whether it would he ever possible to put this machinery into action seems somewhat doubtful in view of the ract that it does not seem possible tp put it into action between Kejd and 'Iraq., and finally it would contain a definite acknowledgment by Ibn Baud that the Nejd forces could not cross the common frontier except with the consent of both gowernments* The Jhaikh has approved of ilio -3- of this suggestion iDut desires that an additional clause should he inserted reading as follows: ' The govermaents of Kuwait and Nejd undertake within a period of six months from the ratifi cation of this agreement to initiate friendly disoussions with a view to the conclusion of a further agreement for the resumption of orade relations and commercial intercourse and the removal of existing carriers and misunder standings % I therefore^ have tne honour to submit ior the consideration of xiis Majesty^ Government a draft of the agreement which the Shaikh desires should be negotiated on his oehalf with Kis Majesty iing Ihn uaud* It will he seen fhat articles 1 and 2 correspond with those of the iiahra Agreement* Articles 3, 4^ 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Bahra Agree ment are omitted.

ScT'of the 30th of June, enclosing for consideration a draft Agreement on the lines of the Lahra Arreement which the Shaikh of ICov/eit desires to 'be negotiated on his 'behalf with King I on Saud. 2. I note that the draft Agreement includes an additional Article whereby the parties would undertake to attempt to arrive at a settlement of the principal issue between them, namely the Customs blockade of Koweit by Hej d, within six months of the ratification of the Agreement. In my opinion it would be most injudicious to include this additional article in any draft agreement presented to Ibn Saud as representing the desiderata of the Shaikh of Koweit, since it would give the former an opportunity, which he would doubtless welcome, for avoiding all detailed discussion of the o blockade o x uestion during any negotiations that it may be possible to arrange with him on ITejd-Koweit questions generally. Those negotiations should, in my view, ha\ e •1 -POLITICAL EilGIIMTT IK THE PER SI AH GULF. / +have a settlement of that question as their principal objective, and tne effect of putt in,'; forward the proposed additional article would, therefore, 'be most un fortunate. On the contrary, it would seem far wiser to make it clear at the outset of any negotiations that the blockade question is regarded by His Uajesty's Government as a distinct issue and a ..lost important one, and to press lor a settlement of that question in some separate agreement or other instrument, and not as part of the agreement dealing with tribal matters. Should Ion Saud then prove obdurate over the ■lockade question, the threat to reconsider the cornmercial facilities at present ^iven to ITejd at _ ahrein might well be used as a lever to induce him to adopt a more favourable attitude. 3, I note also that the six articles in the P.ahra Agreement dealing with tribal migration have been omitted from the draft Agreement submitted by the Shaikh of Koweit. Ibn Saud cannot fail either to notice this omission or to appreciate the principal reason for it, namely that the Shaikh of Kov/eit, hoping that some day the Awazim and other tribes may return to his allegiance, is not prepared to agree in a formal instrument to provisions of which the effect would be to stabilise and thereby to give the appearance of permanence to the existing tribal position. 4. While the version of the Bahra Agreement submitted with your despatch under reference might perhaps serve,when amended as suggested in paragraph 2 above, as a first draft to be presented to Ibn Saud, it ^ I■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■I&lt;7 it seeing idle to hope that he will accept it in its present rorm. it appears to me that this aspect of the matter should be made clear to the Shaikh and that pressure mirht 'be exercised upon him in an endeavour to octain his consent to the ^rant of pov/ers of discretion to yourself (or whoever represents the Shaikh in any negotiation) to accept on his behalf an agreement which deals on the lines of the I^ahra Agreement with tribal migration and other kindred subjects as well as with the :..ere machinery for the settlement o: raiding; claims. In this connection it should be made clear to the Shaikh that rigid adherence to his present views would be likely to result in the breakdown of any negotiations that it might be possible to arrange. In view of the considerations advanced above I should be glad if the observation® on the draft Agreement contained in the ^receding paragraphs ;:-ay be communicated to the Shaikh of Iloreit, and aa attempt made to induce him to agree to the omission of Article ^ of the present draft Agreement, and to the grant of powers o: discretion as suggested in para graph 4 above to the person entrusted with xhe negotiations on ..is behalf.

In this despatch » view is expressed that it would be most injudicious to include in the flraft agreement an additional clause whereby the parties would undertake to attempt to arrive at a settlement of the principal issue between them, namely, the customs blockade of Kuwait by NeJ d / within six months of the ratification of t e agreement, 1 would explain that the Shaikh, and I myself, were under the impression t at the present draft agreement would be limited to the setting up of some machinery for the settle ment of claims and would be of a simple nature and could therefore be negotiated with the Sejd authorities by nis majesty's Minister at Jeddah y and would not form part of the i negotiations regarding the Kuwait blockade and Persian Julf questions* It was for this reason that the Shaikh desired the inclusion of the clause stipulating that negotiations Ki^ht Hon'ble Lord Passfield,P«C« 9 His Majesty^ Secretary of State for the Colonies, COLONIAL OFFICE, LOBDOlU■ -2- negotiations regarding the 'blockade, eto. should be initiated later. If however this agreement is to be dis* cussed not at Jeddah but by myself, o - whoever may represent the Shaikh, and the Nejd representatives then obviously there is no necessity for this clause and I am sure that when this is explained to the shaikh he will readily agree to strike it out. 3# As regards the elimination of the clauses in the Bahra agreement regarding the tribal migrations, it is perhaps unfortunate that the agreement under consideration has always been referred to as being on the analogy of the Bahra agreement* /hen Ibn Saud raised the question with me last January the only matter we were considering was that of the settlement of claims between Kuwait and itejd and Ibn Uaud stated that he was willing to agree to the setting up of some machinery similar to that provided in the Bahra agreement# So reference was of course at that time made to any question dealing with tribes, and 1 do not think that Ibn Saud had any idea of the tribal clauses in his mind, since he presumably regards the present position as immutable. I did not till later realise the full implications of the iaatter and i fear that in reporting that Ibn Saud was ready to negotiate a trerty on the lines of the Bahra agreement I expressed myself somewhat loosely. I should rather have said that he was willing to negotiate a treaty setting up some machinery for the settlement of claims similar to that provided in the iahra agreement# 4. I hare now reconsidered the matter in the light of Your Lordship's remarks. Hxe Shaikh is not unnaturally excee Ungly-3- exceedingly sensitiTe on the subject of these tribes and I think he woulu rather not si^n an agreement at all than ei^ n one which .n any way tied hie hands or those of his succeso- ors should a swing of the pendulum cffer an opportunity to Kuwait of getting baclc its old tribes* On the other hand X fully realise the force of the arguments advanced in para graph of Your Lordship's despatch, if the issue is raised In this form and the agreement referred to as an agreement on the analogy of the Bahra agreement* It seezas to me however that at an^ meeting that may take place between the representatives of the Shaikh and the I^ejd representatives, it should he possible to evade the issue of the tribes altogether, and simply to suggest t&gt; t e aejd representatives the desirability of establishing some simple machinery for the settlement of any claims that may arise in connection with raids between llejd and uwait. J&amp;e relations between Kuwait and liejd are in tany ways somewhat less formal than those between Uejd and 'Iraq and it would probably be preferable that the machinery set up for the settlement of elaims should be less forual and based more on tribal custom and practice. If this course were followed then no rsference to the Sahra agreement need be made; the question of the tribes would be evaded while t-e object pf the present draft agreement would be attained# 5, I am visiting Kuwait in the near future and will discuss the matter with the Shaikh and address Xour Lordship further. I trust that if His oateel^ency agrees that the matter should be raised in the form indicated above • • •i, -4- above, it will be approved# 6 » I a-ra sending copies of this despatch to the Goyerniaent of India and to His Majesty's Minister at J eddah* I haTe the honour to be f Your Lordship^ Tour most obedient, humble servantt p- Lt .Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

In his despatch Major Young suggested that His Majesty^s Government, while making no overt act to encourage the absorption of Koweit by Iraq, should in fact assist any tendency there may be in that direction by assimilating tVieir treaty relations with Koweit to the relations with Iraq under the new Treaty as soon as it has been ratified. The adoption of ^ajor Young*s suggestion wduld clearly c involve a revarsal of the policy as regards Koweit followed by his Majesty's Governments in this country for many years. As recently as the 18th March 1929 the Cabinet Sub~Committee /of Imperial Defence appointed to consider the policy of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf came to the following 'As regards Koweit it is better on the whole that matters should remain as they are and that, while endeavour^ ing to secure so far as possible that Koweit shall not be identified with Iraq, we should defer consideration of the establishment of a formal Protectorate until circumstances appear to make this more clearly desirable'. Lord Passfield is not aware of any new circumstances which make it desirable that there should now be a change of policy as regards Koweit in particular or Persian Gulf matters in general. 3. In Lord Passfield's view, the closer union of Koweit conclusion :- with—Mi r-- • ~1 MBu I' 1 r jiM* 1^6 Mrith Iraq, can scarcely strengthen the position of His Majesty^ Government in the latter country, and would undoubtedly weaken their position with Koweit. At present His Majesty's Government can, with the minimum of effort, secure that all matters of importance the Sheikh of Koweit shall follow their advice and, so long as they support the Sheikh and guarantee his independence, this fortunate situation may be expected to continue• But with the merging of Iraq and Koweit into one State,it might be much less i e«sy to secure the desiderata of His Majesty's Government in Koweit, the authorities of which would then look to Baghdad rather than to His Majesty's Government for guidance. Moreover, any union of Koweit with Iraq would inevitably produce some sort of reaction in the other Arab protected States, the rulers of which, receiving the impression that the interests of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf were on the decline, might think it well to seek for themselves the overlordship of, if not absorption by, Ibn Saud or any other Arab who might then be powerful in the interior of Arabia, 4. For these reasons. Lord ir'assfield is of the opinion that His Majesty's Government should continue the policy hitherto followed, namely, to maintain Koweit as a Protected State entirely independent of either Iraq or Kejd, but he would be glad to be furnished with an expression of Mr. Henderson's views on the matter.

This I think Is most satisfactory, and shows that the King appreciates the Justice of the Shaikh of Kawalt 9 8 point of view, and also I think that shows your representations have ^ 'A had some effect. 3. The King's letter was sent through -bdullah bin Jaloul Ibn Turkl al-3aud the Governor of Hassa, and was for warded to the Shaikh of Kuwait under eover of the latter^ letter dated 20th Jamad Awal 1349 (13th October 1930), together with an open letter fror- the King to Ibn ArfaJ, which contained practically a verbatim copy of his (the King's) letter to the Shaikh, and Instructed him to take further action In direct cormunlcatlon with His excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. jHil* letter the Shaikh has sent on to Ibn Arfaj after perusal. 4 ' Tho satisfactory feature of the King's letter Is Its Tery cordial tone, and from l^ulhaq No.3, one gaihers 1 that the King Is grateful, as I knew he would be, for the tratment meted out to his officials (Abdullah al-Mansur and - r ^7 when 'Jaoy arrlred on Kuwait's Southern frontier and asked If thqr could take 'Zlkat' from the Harb Tribe camped at Subalhlyeh. • The Shaikh Is naturally pleased and gratified at % the turn of events and proposes in antlwlpatlon of your approval,to proceed on the lines proposed by himself and agreed . to by the Kins, and will shortly write ibn ^faj to send all ^ejdi •laiiiaants to Kuarait.

The Nejdi will then be allowed to go away with his camel. 6 * ^ practice the Shaikh will go through all claims together and whon it is known what money is to be paid to Kuwaitis, he will send a responsible official to ibn Apfaj who will submit a full statement of the result of the enquiry, and will bring back all monies due in a lump sum.

It will be recalled that in paragraphs 3 and 4 of his despatch of the 2nd of October Confidential 'A' to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, a copy of which accompanied the Colonial Oii'ice letter under reference, the Secretary of State commented unfavourably on the omission from the proposed agreement of Tribal Migration Clauses on the lines of Articles 3 and 4 of the .Bahra Agreement. In paragraph 3 of the accompanying despatch, Colonel Biscoe explains in this connection that when the question of an agreement with the Ruler of Koweit was first raised by Ibn Saud, only matters connected with raiding claims were under discussion, and that vhat His Majesty had in mind was a treaty setting up machinery for the settlement of raiding claims similar to those provided in Articles 1 and 2 of the Bahra Agreement.

From To The bccretary to the Hor^ble Uie Political neaiaent in the Persian Gulf, Yhe Poll ti col A^en t # Kuwa it. h ux f^h Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to the ?*v correspondence ending with my predecesaor 1 b letter Ho. b82-S, dated the 20th October 1950, regarding tlie draft treaty to be negotiated between Kuwait and Hejd for the aettlement of claims. 2. His Majesty's aovernment have now a^roved of the proposals contained in the Hon'ble the Political nesiuent's despatch Ho. 44, dated the 20th October 1950 (copy of which was forwarded to you with the letter referred to above), and have agreed to the elimination of -he tribal clauses. Colonel iJiscoe in that despn&gt;c^ expressed the view that, since relations between Kuwait and Wejd were in many ways somev/hat leso forwalthan those between liejd and Iraq, it would probably be preferable that the nachinery set up for the settleraent of claims should be somewhat less formal than that provided in the Bahra Agreement and based more on tribal cue to# and practice. 3. If a satisfactory settle;tent ia arrived at over the question of the 55 Mejd camels discovered in Kuv/ait territory, and if Ibn tsaud accepts Cht bhaiJch's valuation and sends the money to Kuwait, this case should form a most valuabj precedent for the settlement of future cases by the tribal sys ten^/WMSr \j. -2- aystem of -Arafa*. 4 * It does not however help ua, as far au the non'ble the Political weeioeut can see, ae regarao paat claixafi of Kuwait tribeemen f^r raidu cocanitted by iie 0 d tribeswen. It seeznu doubtful whether, in practice, a tribunal on the a linen oC the Hahra tribunal would really prove ^aatisfactory method for the aettlement of these claims though it is difficult to suggest an alternative. Colonel aiscoe would therefore be glad if you coiici discuss the matter again with the Mhaikh and a»k him whether he can suggest any alternative method baaed, if possible, more on tribal cusum for the settlenent of these claims. if so, the draft treaty might be motfified accordingly. IT not, then the present draft will stand. Since King Ibn baud has now returned to the jteajaz it is Improbable that any meeting with him will take place winter. ii the meeting is likely to be postponed for a long time. Colonel i5i8coe considers that it would be better to recommend that the draft treaty should be negotiated at Jeddah; but if there is a possibility of a meeting between the 1 ing and him taking place In the autumn, the discussion regarding it could be deferred for timt occasion. J 1 6. I am to state for your information that it is hoped that the sura of ^ 3,000 allocated to Kuwait by nis Majesty^ Government, out of the 10,000 paid by King ibn aaud as compensation for Iraq and Kuwait claima, will be received very shortly. 1 have the honour to be.

Wil1 y ou kindly refer to my oonfiAentHf - viO*:i6 dated 5th Larch to your Secretary^ regarding the Kuwait-Nejd Draft Treaty. It is difficult to make ones points clear in a letter, but the Shaikh and I think that for dealing with petty cases between Nejd and Kuv/ait a afa' clause can be inserted with advantage. There -caYer the qu^s'lion o' major acts of aggr ess ion, Kuwait has had bitter experience of thes^ during the last decade, and she has neither seen the cudgels taken up on her behalf properly, nor has tnere been any sort of machinery under which she could demand an enquiry and fix responsibility on I»Gjd ^na -in ol ^ ug .. xhe resuxt was that His Majesty's G-overn— ment me_ely used to pass on Kuwait's complaints made regu— 1'drly af te^. Ocxcn raia or attack, and Bin Saud as regularly denied all knowledge^or if he did admit them in anyway, he used to very greatly minimize them, and say they were done oy out of hand tribesmen, whom he was most assuredly going to punish with dreadful scourging. Beyond that nothing ever happened. I ' t is for this reason that both the Shaikh and 1 y /hile we are in entire agreement with you about a Tr too formal ? 'Treaty where Kuv/ait is concerned, think that Article 2 of the Draft Treaty about the Special Tribunal should be retained. 5. The other alternative is to have only an The w 'Arafa' treaty with Bin Saud^exactly like what we are trying '.-o a . d.nge vrith 'Iraq, and trust to strong diplomatic pres— sure uoing brought oo bear by Iiis Majesty's G-overnment where Hon'ble Lieutenant-Coloiiel H. V. Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- v /liere acts of major aggression take place. Candidly I would lix.e this best Oi. a.^1, if only we can get His Majesty's Government to act firmly with Bin Saud. The scheme is SQing oo work all right with f IraQ. 1 helieve, but then we nave a Resident High Commissioner in Baghdad. P.3.

Sir, I have the honour to refer Jou to your r .o.62-L dated 9th February 1951, and to remark that I have noted its contents carefully. w 2. As regards paragraph 3 of your letter. For the information of the Eon^le the Political Hesident, « the Shaikh tells me that he has not yet had a reply to his last letters addressed to li.M. the King and his son the Amir Saud at Riath, about the question of the 55 camels, but he is hopeful that the matter will terminate in satis factory manner. In the meantime his representative is still at Riath awaiting the final decision of the ^mir uaud who no doubt took his father's instructions before the latter left for Mecca, and will shortly pass orders. As you are aware the Amir Saud is the Administrative head in Uejd and it will fall to him, if the Shaikh's valuation is accepted (as I think it will be) to send the money to Kuwait and settle the whole business. As regards paragraph 4 of yDur letter - I have had a long talk with the Shaikh on the subject and his views generally are as follows (a) FUTURE GLAIIxIS. He favours the idea of an 'Arafa' clause being inserted in the draft Treaty to enable ooth sides to deal with ordinary questionsV strayed ,, tribal aniioals, also for the final settlement of claims that may arise as a 1 result of a raid and after the special tri bunal (Article II of Draft Treaty) has assessed responsibility. The clause to be on something of the following lines, and should preferably be numbered Article I, 'The G-overnments of Kuwait and Nejd severally recognize that all Kuwait and Nejd tribes will in future be considered as Bani *^111, and disputes arising between them con nected with lost, stolen or strayed animals will normally be settled by the well known tribal system of n Arafa n . The responsibility of seeing that cases are so settled being vested in the Rulers of both states, or in such frontier officials as may have the necessary powers delegated to them. Details of the 'Arafa' system as ge nerally accepted by the tribei of both states -are attached to this Treaty as an Appendix.' lies. This appendix to be exactly similar in wording to the draft 'Arafa' Treaty pro posed for Kuwait and ^Iraq by Mr. Sdmonds, j.iuh uiie additions and alterations proposed by the Shaikh of Kuwait as intimated to H.S. the High Commissioner^in Bushire5confidential yv* c 'TZyjf despatch No.20-S dated 9th January 1921. The Shaikh does not think, and I agree with him that such 'Arafa' clause can in any way take the place of Article II of the Draft Treaty forwarded by the Hobble the Political Resident to Kis Majesty 1 s Secretary of State ^ 3^ :ror Colonies in Bushire despatch No.30 dated oOth June 1930, and which clearly furnishes us with the necessary machinery for dealing with an important raid, fixing res- l** * ^' f n'n J ^I5&gt;Z5 responsibility, and assessing damage done, whether this includes loss of life, destruc^fe tion of property or seizure of camels, sheep or other property. At the same time the Shaikh and I both think that Article II of the Draft Treaty (now to become Article III if the Arafa clause is inserted as Article 14 might be slightly modified as follows The word ' serious' to be inserted in the fourth line after the word ' any' . The words ' and the system of Arafa ' to be inserted, in the twenty first line, after the word ' Customs '. The Figure 'I' after the word Article in the 22nd line to become 'II'. ( b ) x j-lp'-l lltio • The Shaikh presumes that the Hon r ble the Political Resident has in mind those Kuwait claims which were submitted under this office confidential despatch No.186 dated 18th March 1930, and which were for the most part due to organized raids committed by Bin Saud's 'Akhwan' during the last nine years, when these fanatics were attacking both Kuwait and ^raq indiscriminately. As regards these, the Shaikh's views are that no sort of clause in the draft treaty how ever carefully worded, will be of aBBistance in helping Kuwait recover claims due to her, whatever be the future relations between Nejd and Kuwait. The only way .he thinks is for Kuwai1te'Eill' to be presented to Bin Saud by His Majesty's G-overrynent, as Kuwait's protecting power, in the same way that 'Iraq, sent in her Bill. Bin »-&gt;aud will then have the alternative of either denying the claims, submitting a 'Bill' in return (as he did in 'Iraq's case) 'or agreeing to compound the matter for a round figure, as lie eventually did with 'Iraq, (the £ 20,000/- settlement). The first and second alternatives, Bin Saud cannot in decency adopt I think, and the last will probably be the way the matter will end. The £ 3,000 already allocated to Kuwait as a sort of advance (under the Khabari Watha agreement) would of course be deducted from any sum agreed upon f inalty. 4. In point of actual fact Kuwait's claim might be used as another and powerful bargaining weapon in the coming negociations for getting Bin Saud to raise the 'Blockade**. There is little doubt that the Shaikh and his people would readily waive all claims to compensation for injuries inflicted by Nejd subjects in the past, if only Kuwait could be given back her trade with Nejd. This suggestion is Y /orth the serious consideration of His Ma jesty* s Government I think. 5. As regards Past Claims , and at the risk of repeating myself I should like to again say that the Shaikh was insistent that nothing would ever be recovered, unless His Majesty's Government themselves took up the cudgels on behalf of Kuwait. 'Iraq.,he said, has successfully got her claims attended to simply because Bin Saud knew that His Majesty's Government was behind her. He trusted Kuwait would be similarly supported. His Excellency of course opinied that as Bin Saud had climbed down over the £ 30,000, a still greater effort would be required to get anything for Kuwait, a natural enough supposition seeing that the King will not relish having to 'foot' another bill. 6. At the back of the Shaikh's mind and in all his talks with me on the subject of the proposed Treaty, there exists the feeling that any agreement come to by Kuwait with Nejd will be quite useless Bin Saud is clearly made to realize that His Majesty's Government will insist on his carrying out his obligations, if Nejd is proved inin the wrongo In other words, should Bin Saud^ tribes for instance raid Kuwait at some future date, and the Tribunal provided by the Treaty, give judgement against Nejd, His Majesty*s G-overnment must be prepared to coerce Bin Saud into seeing justice done and bringing the culprits to book, just as they would certainly do if the /d&lt;. S &lt;4A fault lay with L-uwait. othor , His Majesty's Government must hold the scales evenly between Nejd and 1(3 '( ( Kuwait even though no clause exists-in the Treaty to be drawn up« It was this point which the Shaikh had in mind, when in the original draft Treaty as proposed by himself he inserted a clause ( Nojll) giving His Majesty's Govern ment the role of Umpire, (see my confidential D.O. No.211 dated 7th April 1930 to Captain Russell). ^• Before taking my leave from the Shaikh, I mentioned the contents of paragraph 6 of your letter under reference. His Excellency appeared genuinely pleased that there was a likelihood of Kuwait getting her £ 3000 ^ soon &gt; an(3 - a sked that his grateful thanks be communicated ^ il0 ii0ntble 't 116 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The ohaikii was fully aware of 'Iraq feaving tried to get |he whole £ 10000 but said that from the first he felt i His Majesty's Government would see fair play done, xhe £ 30Ou lie said though only a small amount compared to the original heavy loss suffered by Kuwait, would prove to his subjects, who were sometimes very impatient, that it was worth while waiting for the justice and fair dealing of His Majesty's Government.

MR. WARNER said that King Ibn Saud, at his meeting with Lt.Colonel Biscoe in January 1930, at which arrangements were made for the disposal of the Nejdi rebels who had surrendered in 1 Iraq and Kuwait, had expressed readiness to conclude a treaty with Kuwait on the lines of the Bahra Agreement. The matter had been under consideration since that time, and had been discussed between the Resident and the Shaikh of Kuwait. It had been found that various clauses of the Bahra Agreement were unsuit ble for reproduction in a treaty between the Hejaz-Nejd and Kuwait, and Lt.Colonel Biscoe 1 s latest proposal which had been approved, was to the effect that the contem plated treaty should merely arrange for the settlement of future claims between Kuwait and Nejd on the lines of the local tribal system known as H arafa M . MR.BAXTER suggested that Lt.Col,DicKson should give the meeting further details of this proposal. LT.COL.DICKSON explained that the Arafa system was well-known and traditionally accepted by every Arab. It was complicated, and it would be impossible for him to give the meeting an expose of its exact working. Suffice it that there was no doubt in the minds of Arabs as to the procedure, and tha t ....-2- thctt in the case of several recent claims agreement had been reached between King Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait for their settlement on the basis of this system, and the claims had thus been satisfactorily disposed o£* j- 4 • ?c'L.B^SCOE pointed out that the somewhat elaborate treaty provisions in the Bahra Agreement for the settlement of ^ j.1^. claims had never been satisfactorily worked, and expressed the opinion that it would be far better in the case of Nejd and Kuwait that their claims should continue to be dealt with as they arose along the lines of the traditional tribal system. He thought that it was perhaps unnecessary to endeavour to conclude c ' l '^ --- j ' j Psc*j. that future raid claims should be settled in i accordance with the Arafa system.

Major Young had suggested that the policy of His Majesty^ Government towards Kuwait should be to encourage, or at any rate to acquiesce in, its absorption by 'Iraq. The Committee of Imperial Defence had as recently as 1929 expressed the con trary opinion, stating that ' as regards Kuwait, it is better on the whole that matters should remain as they are and that, while endeavouring to secure as far as possible that Kuwait shall not be identified with 'Iraq, we should defer the establishment of formal protectorate until circumstances appear to make this more clearly desirable w . The policy of His Majesty's Government ...Government in respect of Kuwait was based on this opinion of e , ominit t ee cf' Imperial L/efence, and Major ^oung had been informed in reply to his despatch that His Majesty's Government were of the opinion that the policy hitherto followed should be continued, namely, that Kuwait should be maintained as a protected State entirely independent of either 1 Iraq or Ne-'d*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/600</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/600</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 61/22 I (D 116) Bahra Agreement: meeting of tribunal under the ---, 1930.
