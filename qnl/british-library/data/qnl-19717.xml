Bit- reply is that IThaid 'bin T .7alaid was taken to his house 'b^ a man i rom JaalaB whose name he does not know and remained there as a guest as it is the custom of the Arabs. There the said ITbaid approached him requesting to release him from ^'i # ( the Possession of) the Jaalanijthat the said Mohammaa addressed the man of Jaala« and after troubles got him released for the payment of Bs.500/- ind that the said Ubald remained serving in Muhammad's house as a waterman and that he did not employ him in diving; that he was 'being treated honourably and with respect# until he was found missing from the house of Muhammad 'bin Bilal. The Ruler's reply -to me it is that his subject ^. a namely Muhammad bin Biat had not done to Ubaid anything but good. If he can now pay the amount paid to the Jaala®iwell \ i p. and good other-he should return and serve the said Muhammad until the amount is paid for him / is paid up. I have the honour to state that according to enquiries instituted Ubaid bin Talaid had actually approached the said Muhammad ffor his release from the man of Jaalaa. Now if you deem it advisable a British Manumission I Certificate may be granted to Ubaid and the man may l)hen be sent to work as a servant with anyone he desires to work and to pay, gradually, the sum back to Muhjjnmad bin Biat .

They sent for those who reported this matter and who had seen Nasib selling the pearl to the Persian. The case was proved against him and he then admitted to have taken that pearl while at the diving banks. The Shaikh of Qmm ul Qaiwain and Abdullah bin Said recovered! from Nasib a sum of 'Rs.400/- on account of the pearl; Nasib told them that the balance is with the Persian who is at If Debai. The Shaikh arranged for 2 men to accompany Nasib to Debai to fetch the Persian. Nasib run away from the two men at Debai and they did not know where he went to. This is Nasib bin Salih's case. 1 beg to forward herewith a letter in original from* * v-| trie Shaikh of Umm ul Qaiwain and a copy of the sanad wherehy his deht v /as established. It is true that Nasih stole the pearl and if you see no objection you may issue a 1T anumissior Certificate and send it along with Masih to the Residency Agency to enable me to find out the Persian who has to pay the balance of the price of the pearl and also about Nasib's debt on account of diving. ihe Manumission Certificate will be delivered to Wasib bin Salih after these two points are settled and 1 shall submit to you a report in this connection in due course; decision rests with you.

Jith regard to your enquiry about Nasib bin Salih, diver of Abdullah bin Said, who has taken refuge at Muscat; please note that this diver has got a wonderful case. After the termination of the diving season it was found that Nasib was spending money. The Nakhuda enquired from some of his friends as from where Nasib had obtained the money and they said t*iat he sold a pearl to a -Persian for Rs.1600/-. Thereupon the Nakhuda reported the fact to Abdullah bin Said and the latter informed me. 1 sent for Nasib and enquired from him and he admitted to have ta^en the pearl while at diving banks and sold it to a Persian at Debai. He was asked as to what price he has sold the oearl for and he replied Rs.lOOO/-. 7e sent for those who knew about this and they said that he sold it for 'Rs.ieoo/- that he recovered Hs.609/- and that the balance is still with the Persian. 1 sent Nasib with two men on my behalf to Debai to search for the Persian in question. On theirarrival at ^'bai Nasi^b quietly run away and they did not know where he has gone to until now that you say he is at Muscat. You will find herewith attached a copy of the sanad and the evidence given 'by witnesses in the presence of the C^azi of our town regarding the pearl stolen 'by iNasih. 1 request you therefore to ask the Hon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian O-ulf to send Nasib 'bin 3alih to show us the Persian so that the amount should 'be recovered from him. it is not possible that a Persian should eat up the money. 5e have good hopes in the Political Resident.

A copy of my letter to him as well as his reply, in original, to are forwarded herewith for your information. Sheikh Said 'bin Maktoom, CJhief of De'bai, has until now not returned from Braimi to ehai and is still fighting with the Sheikh of Braimi as no peace was concluded 'between them. i I have made enquiries into tne case of Salim 'bin Firos^ and found out that he nad committed thefts in several houses at pehai and at last he 'broke into the house of Ihrahim 'bin All al Saye^h, one of the notables of ^e'bai, and stole gold ornaments. 5 days after the rohhery Salim took some of the ornaments to a goldsmith named Ahmad 'bin Semeen of Hasa with the intention of selling them, 'but the nephew of Ibrahim whose ornaments were stolen saw the ornaments with the goldsmith and enquired from him as to how he ^ot them. The goldsmith told him that a slave has given them to him and that he could recognise him. The man went and informed his uncle Ibrahim bin Ali who reported the matter to the i Sheikh and took the Sheikh # s Fidawis with him and went to the goldsmith•s shop. They then took the goldsmith with tnem and went round the town in search of the slave Salim bin Firoa. As soon as they saw him he ran away and entered the aouse of one of the Fidawis but they pursued him and arrested and took him to the Sheikh. The slave confessed the theft in question and several other thefts as well whenhe was questioned by the aheikh. The Oadhi was also called and oalim oonfessed 'before him the theTts v/hic5h were commit ted 'by him* The Sheikh then cut the slave's hand aoGording to the order of the ohara*. As to the slave's allegations that he had a v/ife they are unfounded• He had no wrtx. legal wife 'but he had kept a prostitute in whose house he was also making liquor* This is the information I have obtained after instituting enquiries a'bout the slave Salim 'bin Firoz. On return of Sheikh Said to Dehai I will make further enquiries from him and submit a report 'in due course. T J • Hi # Idvj of a letter No*337 dated 4th Habi al awwal 1350 (2nth July 1931) from the x ^esidency ^gent, Shar^ah, to the deputy Huler of -t)el)ai» A.a. I have to inform you that the Hon t 'ble the Political Hesident has written to me intimating that a certain slave named Salim 'bin Firoz claims that Sheikh Said 'bin Maktum, ♦ Ruler of Dehai, arrested him for a mere charge of theft and cut his hand without having the case established against him.

Oh my fried if the son of Firooz and other people like him come to our town ^elDai and commit roh'beries we cannot leave them alone when we catch them and we have to act according to the Muhammadan Shara Law.

At the front of the book (ff.2-4) is a handwritten index listing all manumission subjects contained within. The subjects are numbered 1 through to 40. Subject 23 is not present in the volume, having been removed by Residency staff for the Resident to take on tour at the time the correspondence was being compiled.</extent><extent>Foliation: The volume has been foliated with a circled number in the top-right corner of each recto, from the title sheet to the last folio of the volume.

                           ypages, written in pencil in the top-right corner of each recto. A very small number of these internal numbering systems do not run in the correct numerical sequence, suggesting that items were bound in the incorrect order.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains thirty-nine manumission subjects, each one involving the manumission request of one or more slaves, who had sought refuge at the Political Agency in Muscat (then under the charge of Major G. Murphy). Each manumission case follows a very similar pattern. Murphy sent a copy of the slave‘s manumission certificate (with covering letter) for the attention of the Secretary to the Political Resident, making his own recommendation as to whether manumission should be given. In most cases, the Secretary to the Political Residency responded by agreeing to the manumission request. In the case of slaves who had been kept in the Trucial Coast towns (Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi), a copy of the manumission statement was forwarded by the Secretary to the Political Resident to the Residency Agent in Sharjah (‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif), who was asked to make enquiries as to the validity of the slave’s statement.A small number of the manumission cases are more complex. In July 1931, the Political Residency heard of a slave who had had his right hand cut off and been imprisoned at the decree of the shaikh of Dubai, after having been accused of theft (folio 195). Enquiries made by ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif suggested that the slave was caught in the act of robbery. A medical certificate from the Agency Hospital in Muscat verified the extent and recent nature of the punishment meted out on the slave (folio 199). The Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Biscoe) wrote to the Residency Agent (folio 215) to protest in the strongest terms to the shaikh of Dubai about the severity of the punishment handed out to the slave, insisting that imprisonment was the usual punishment in this day.Another case was brought to the attention of the Secretary to the Political Resident by the Political Agent Muscat in June 1932, in which a pearl diver from Umm-al-Qaiwain, who claimed to be a slave, requested manumission. ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif agreed with the manumission request, commenting that, because the demand for and price of pearls had decreased considerably in recent years, many divers had become heavily indebted. He advised that, once the slave had been given his manumission certificate, he should return to Sharjah to enable the Residency Agent to carry out the necessary enquiries relating to the slave’s debt (said to be 520 rupees) in the Diving Court. Another manumission request was made by a slave who was kept at Kalba, near Muscat. The Political Resident requested that, in future, the Political Agent at Muscat treats affairs (including slaves) in Kalba, as the Political Agent Bahrain treats affairs in Qatar.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Muscat Political Agency and Consulate</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Hasa</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000be#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
