I do not consider that it would he advisable for you as Political Agent to he the official representative of the Shaikh at the coming Smuggling Conference at Baghdad. Such an arrangement would demonstrate too clearly that in reality the Shaikh is in our hands, especially in matters of such importance for Kuwait as the result of this confer ence must he. The effect in the eyes of ’Iraq, would he to give the lie to our policy of insisting on the independence of the Arab Shaikhs, and their freedom, at least outwardly, to order their own policy. 2. In actual practice, of course, the Shaikh’s policy, particularly in regal'd to foreign affairs, is, as far as we can arrange it, dictated by us, hut nowadays this fact must be kept as much in the background as possible. 3. I think you might suggest to the Shaikh that if he considers that the Director of Customs would be an unsuitable representative on account of his lack of experience ana the subordinate position he holds, he could appoint another man better qualified. Whoever is finally appointed as the Kuwait Official representative, you ana I will both be/- 2 - 'be present at the Conference ana will see that the Shaikh is not let down. You could explain to the Shaikh that it would look letter for him to nominate one of his own subjects as his official representative, hut that he can rest assured that we shall do most of the discussion and the actual bargaining. 4. It is hardly necessary to point out to you that in this matter of smuggling into ’Iraq. Kuwait has a decidedly weak case. In a nutshell the situation is that ’Iraq want some effective co-operation from the Shaikh to stop the smuggling, while if the Shaikh does give this effective co-operation he will be ruining his State which lives on the smuggling. heads very close together and concoct some plausible policy for us to pursue at the Conference.

No doubt at the conference a man representing ’Iraq’s point of view would be produced a to act as opposite number to myself, 6. He was quite content, continued the Shaikh, to leave the fighting of his case to you, his Resident, without x doubt ’Iraq could have no better champion than the Ambassador, Why therefore drag in an ignorant 'Katib' to represent hi#, 7* If you and the Ambassador after hearing the pros and cons from the advocates of both sides could not ccme to an agreement, why, then his idea was for you to call in a neutral e body of men (French, American or German), He felt so confident that he had right and justice on his side and that under no ’’international' law could he be forced to make concessions to ’Iraq in this matter of smuggling, that he was perfectly wil ling to leave the judgement of his case to body of 3 foreigners or a single foreign judge, 8, The shaikh spoke much more in the above strain and was more excited than I have seen him for some time, 9, After a good deal of persuasion and quiet argument, I managed to make him see that the point both a you and I wanted was to emphasize his ’’independent status', and that you and I would defend his interests to the last degree, and would give nothing away. The conference, I said was really only to be an exchange of views to see if there was any reason able way out of the impasse, nothing more. &gt; v • ■ • ; ' ' 10, lam glad to say I won in the end, and got the Shaikh to agree to his Director going with us. I must admit, how ever, that he did not seem over happy about it. He gave way because he felt that this course would please you. To use his words, 'If Colonel Fcwle really wishes me to send my own i ; \ man, then I will certainly not oppose his wishes, but please warn him not t© expect any assistance of value frcm a person W \ )' ; who is my clerk and not to let the man give away'. 11, In another despatch I am replying to your telegram No.82, dated the 25th January 1934.3 - 12. I regret the length of this note, hut I am anxious that you should get a complete and full picture of how the Shaikh feels and vtfiat he is thinking about. He more and more these days appears to be brooding on the dilatory methods of His Majesty’s Government in the matter of his ’Iraq revenue troubles, the attacks on his property and Bin Baud’s blockade, which have hit him very hardly financially. He has harped several times lately on the way His Majesty’s Government has set all her old friends against her, and made the Arabs of the Gulf lose all confidence in the justice of His Majesty’s Government, when it comes to a dispute between small states on the sea board and big neighbours like Bin Baud and ’Iraq. Both the latter, according to him, seem to be able to pull heavy strings in London, more so he has hinted than their protector, the Government of India. my policy always is to encourage the Shaikh to open his mind to me in private. It has the effect of a ’’safety valve”, and also enables me to get right down to what he is thinking about. This and similar talk is not pleasant to hear, but fin If surrender in made to f Iraq on the grounds, of expediency, 5* I am also enclosing with this a precis of His excellency f s talk with, me yesterday (oO, 1,54) * It is long and reads somewhat disconnectedly t I fear, but that is due to the fact that as ha talked I took down notes of what he said. He particularly asked me t6 sehd them tb you, 4. Shortly tfc© Shaikh f s attitude, which has somewhat hardened in the last few months, my be summed up in the following words:- I am an independent state, just as ’Iraq is, I have just as much right to try and improve the trade of my country and people as ’Iraq has: ?h© very existence of Kuwait as a state depends on r„y keeping avenues of trad© open with the tribes of the interior. Bin Baud has, by -the his blockade destroyed S/3 of these avenues, and now ’Iraq is trying to divert the remaining 1/3 of Kuwait’s trade with the Bedouin to her port of Basra, by means of diplomatic pressure, and the demand that Kuwait should cooperate and stop what to ’Iraq Is smuggling, but which to Kuwait is legitimate trading. To stop all so called 'smuggling^ by land, would be to kill little Kuwait’s remaining source of life, her Import trade^ and would bring about my Bt&amp;te’s certain destruction. On the other hand ’Iraq, an Immense ly rich country, 1# not appreciably affooted by the so called oauggllxig throu/?h the Bedouin tribes of the interior. I can therefor® only come to the conclusion that the pressure now being brought to bear on me is only part and p&amp;rce. of the “ general unfriendly attack? which has been going/- 3 - going on against me during the last four and a hal ‘ years, and which has cost me close on Rs*50,000/- to counter, (Date Gardens Revenue, Bashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh oases, as# Fao case and water-hoat- persecution), I am quite aware that there is no international obligation upon me to take active steps to prevent persons smuggling goods from Kuwait territory into that of my neighbours, provided I and my officials do not assist, for M I have taken legal advice on this point, (In this connection see Mr,Warner of the Foreign Office D.O. No.P.Z.4555, dated the 28th July Y'j 1933 to Mr.Laithwaite of the India Office)'*, 5, The above being the Shaikh’s attitude and view point generally, he thinks that the policy you and I should adopt in Baghdad at the coming conference should be one of 'Wait and see'. As ’Iraq’s attack develops her arguments may be countered. But in the main our attitude should be defensive. 6# My views are those of the Shaikhs, especially as I know positively with my 4-g- years experience of Kuwait’s hinterland trade and my 7 years experience as an Administra -tor in the Eupherates, that nothing short of killing the whole of Kuwait’s trade with the interior will really stop smuggling. This would of course unthinkable, and fortunately for us would be an impossible undertaking. 7. At the same time I realize that it will be good policy for the Shaikh, who after all is in friendly re lations with ’Iraq, to do what h© can to appear to want to cooperate. In this light therefore let us examine what Kuwait can and cannot give away, also in what way ’Iraq can do likewise* (i) Kuwait can tighten up the issue of manifests to all ships that put to sea frcm her port. * This she already does, but it can be made moremore strict She canno t (a) issue manifests for goods that go into the interior, for nothing goes out of the town in bulk, or by means of organized caravans. All that happens is that individual Bedouins come into the Town buy their needs, and disappea: again. Kuwait in other words is like a big English market town, and just as in England thousands of persons may be seen daily coming into the town from the country in order to buy their small wants from the shops, and go home again; so does the same process go on day by day in Kuwait. It would be imposs ible t to control this daily shopping business, short of closing all gates for good on the land side, for the simple reason that no one knows what is eventually intended for the ’Iraq, markets and what not. You cannot punish the innocent Bedouin^ legitimately buying his wants, or ask the shop-keeper to try and spot the prospective smuggler by preventing suspicious individuals buying from him. The thing is impossible. (It should be realized that Kuwait always has a nomad and village population in- out side her walls of anything upto 10,000 souls, who have to be fed). (b) Post a guard ship outside the Shatt al Arab, because she cannot afford to do so. Nor would such be of much use. (c) Patrol her border s , and hold up smugglers, for the simple reason th^ t as mentioned in (a) above, these do not work in caravans but as individuals, and the country to b© guarded is5 is vast desert with a 180 mile frontier line. Such patrols would be faced with the difficulty of saying what a man was carrying for his family use or what was intended to be taken into f Iraq. (d) She cannot accept the appointment of an ’Iraq official in Kuwait to watch the Blockade question, and issue permits for goods that go by sea to ’Iraq, as it would neither be practicable nor serve any purpose with the land tradegoing on unchecked. Nor could Kuwait accept this interference with her sovereign rights. (ii) ’Iraq can on the other hand:- (a) place a string of customs posts along her frontier between Safwan and Rigai. She has none on this 120 mile stretch at present, (b) She can get her Bedouin tribes, especially the Dhafir to cooperate on her side of the frontier by a system of subsidies, and giving them a share of the ’catch’, as Bin Saud does. She prefers not to do this, and so the Dhafir have become one of the chief snuggling tribes. (c) She can base car patrols on Busaiya and Zubair, the former operating from Rigai to Jarishan, and the latter from Jarishan to Um- Q,asr, to look for and seize ’dumps’ of contra- band goods collected on the ’Iraq side prior to being sent on to the riverain area. (d) She can make it an offence and bring pressure to bear on her own powerful merchants in Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere. (I could give names of certain of these if necessary), and forbid them to import sugar cargo ®s to Basra■v i j &lt; - 6 - tM. marked ft Basra option Kuwait ”on the threat of confiscation. Any cargoes so marked in the , • Bills of Lading which go to Basra,in 70 cases out of 100 are intended to be landed in Kuwait. (e) She can stop the enormous export of f Iraq cigarettes that now come to Kuwait free of ’Iraq excise duty, which are merely dumped in Kuwait by interested ’Iraqi firms with the deliberate intention of getting them sent back into ’Iraq as contraband through ’Iraqi bedouin in their pay, (f) She must know or should be able to find out the names of ’Iraq traders engaged in con signing cargoes to Kuwait for contraband pur poses (I am told these are some of the highest in the land), and can take steps to punish them, (g) Lastly but most important of all, she can reduce smuggling to a negligible quantity if she will only reduce her duties on sugar, tea, matches and tobacco to a reasonable figure* There is nothing under the head ’’ Cannot ”that I can think of, so I do not mention any. 8. Our policy at Baghdad therefore, in my opinion, should be to listen to what ’Iraq has to say, poit out Kuwait’s difficulties, and counter by pointing out the things she can herself do to stop smuggling. That the remedy lies in ’Iraq’s hand there is no shadow of doubt at all. At the same time we can ”rub it in” that the Shaikh of Kuwait is sympathetic, where he can be, without actually hurting himself, and we can quote as an example that he arbitrarily takes full duty on ’Iraq merchantsmerchants cargoes consigned 'Basra option Kuwait' even though such cargoes are not landed at Kuwait at all but go on to Basra. This he does in his efforts to stop this form of smuggling. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ■ Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait,NOTE qiVXNq Ttm tiejs of his excellency shai'kh. on the' smuggling questions^ with nm: Dioated to Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C*I*E*, Political Agent, Kuwait, by His Excellency the Shaikh on 30th January 1934 for submission to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1 # Kuwait was an independent State long before Sa’udi Arabia and modern f Iraq had come into existence. In the past she had developed, prospered and become a great ceantre of trade for middle Arabia and the Bedouin tribes of the interior, including those of ’Iraq* 2 0 Bin Saud then appeared on the scene, rose to be a great King (incidentally by the help of the ohaikh of Kuwait) , and feeling himself strong enough to defy both His Majesty’s Government and Kuwait, decided to stop all trad© moving from Kuwait to his dominions* His openly avowed object was to divert Kuwait trade to his ports, and so make the latter Important at the expense of Kuwait* His real reason was the hope that he might compel Kuwait to come into the Nejd fold (as Asir did) to escape destruc tion* He declared a strict military blockade, but in the process he kept his personal relations on a more or less friendly footing* This was 10 years ago* 3. He, the Shaikh complained to His Majesty’s Government under whose protection he was, but got no re dress- Por ten years he raised his voice, but without result. His Majesty’s Government’s policy was apparently one of n expediency”. She did not want to offend Bin Saud, so the Blockade went on* 4* As a result the total receipts from the Kuwait Customs fell from approximately 10 lacs of rupees per annum in 1922 to Rs.60,000 in 1932. Kuwait today was a weak and crippled State and great poverty ruled within her borders. 5. During the post war British occupation ofof ’Iraq there had never been Biuoh trade between Kuwait and the ’Iraq tribes or the towns on the ISupherates, for the simple reason that ’Iraq’s reasonable customs duties then attracted the bulk of overseas trade to the port of Basra. Kuwait was comensated by her steady trade with Nejd and Qasim. 6# When however new ’Iraq was given her independence, she slowly hut surely began to raise her tariffs on all imports from overseas, till they approximated roughly to the very high and vicious figures ruling in Persia. This especially applied to sugar and tea, vital necessities of life; it meant that the same bag of sugar which in Kuwait cost Rs. 10/- was sold in ’Iraq for Rs.40/-# This policy simply invited trouble. 7. The immediate result was that smuggling which for the past 10 years had only been going from Kuwait into Nejd (Because of Bin Bauds Blockade) began slowly to flow also into ’Iraq. 'Surely', said the Shaikh, 'the fault was entirely ’Iraqs, not his, for this state of affairs'* 8. The chief 'profit earners' in this smuggling business were well known business houses in ’Iraq, who commanded capital in abundance - while those who tookaway goods intended to he run as contraband were ’Iraq tribesmen .A ^ i f invariably. One of the methods employed was as follows: Merchants in ’Iraq arranged for cargoes (sugar mostly) to be consigned ' Basra option Kuwait ? and then landed such cargoes when the steamer called at Kuwait, and had them stored by selected Agents to await favourable opportunity. Next when their spies^and they had many of these within the ’Iraq customs department itself, reported that proper vigilance was not what it should be, or had reldxed, the merchants arranged with certain Shaikhs up-country to sendto send small parties of men down to Kuwait to take delivery of the goods (always in small quantities) and convey them to selected dumping places in the ♦Iraq southern desert, such as Bedouin camps etc. where the contraband was general ly made up into bigger parcels or bags for removal up to ♦Iraq. ilo, the Shaikh, wanted it to be clearly under stood that he disapproved of such methods, and had as far as h© was concerned, forbidden caravans carrying whole bags or cases to leave his Town. He could not stop small quantities being bought of articles of food and clothing. He had also made it a practice to charge full duty on 'option” cargoes owned by ’Iraqis, even if such were not landed and went on to Basra. This was his contribution towards stopping ♦Iraq merchants using Kuwait as a port for their back-door trade. #hy, however, did not the ’Iraq Government do something to help themselves by forbidding her nationals to import sugar under this 'option ' cargo system? Why should the onus of being 'hasty' be thrown on him, the Shaikh. The commonest form of smuggling, if smuggling it could be called, was by means of the Bedouin and river tribes of ’Iraq. This was quite unconnected with merchants in ♦Iraq. These gentry were n^t quick to learn of the profits to be made, due to the ’Iraq Government’s high tariffs. They came down to Kuwait to sell ghi, skins, wool etc., and under the guise of innocent shopping, took away goods, much of which no doubt eventually got to ’Iraq. It was the same method employed by the tribes of Kejd during the lastlO years. The ’Iraq tribes had themselves learnt the game. 9. To him, the Shaikh, and to the shopkeepers of Kuwait it was all good trade, and the latter merely sold their goods to the Bedouin and did not naturally carecare wlare articles so sold eventually got to. This was not their business. They merely sat in their shops and sold their goods* 10, This increase of ’Iraq’s tariffs, has to some extent, no doubt, bettered Kuwait’s trade | in the way described, during the last years, for Kuwait’ s customs receipts have risen from the Rs.60,000 level, mentioned in Rs. para 4 above, to close on/70,000 in 1955, a poor comparison, however, compared with the figures of 10 lacs e# and over of 12 and 15 years ago. 11, The next step was the discovery by ’Iraq that her high customs duties, was diverting trade to Kuwait. This must be stopped at all costs, she says. She, therefore begins to raise the cry of ff smuggling from Kuwait ”. She goes further, she decides to follow Bin Baud’s method and if possible destroy the only outlet left to Kuwait trade in the interior. Not only was it all good business, but like Bin Saud, ’Iraq also, no doubt, hoped, by a policy of strangulation to persuade Kuwait to come within her fold. 12, The position of Kuwait, placed as she was today, between her two powerful neighbours, was an unenviable one. Bin Saud on the one hand was trying steadily to divert what few imports she had left to his own ports, by a com plete prohibtion of trade with Saudi Arabia. Whilst ’Iraq had now joined in the game, and seemed equally determined to divert to Basra what little trade Bin Saud had left to Kuwait. 15, To use the Shaikhs words 'Two big saluqi dogs were worrying a small Jerboa, each intent on devouring it, the latter by wriggling and turning was trying to save itself, but where was Great Britain, who was supposed to be the protector of the Jerboa”, ’’Clearly”, said the Shaikh, ”if both Bin Saud and ’Iraq were allowed to get their way in this matter, the t^e end of Kuwait was near, for it would mean that she would have to close her gates5 V \ gates by lam to the Bedouins who came up to market, and her merchants would languish and die. las this fair?” 14* Hypocritical ’Iraq, with her tongue in her cheek obviously anxious not to spend money on a strong anti- smuggling service in the desert was trying to get His Majesty’s Government to play her game for her. She was clever at this. She was asking that he, the Shaikh, should n poke out his eye with his own finger*. 15. It would seem that ’Iraq developed her plan early in 1935 and through His Majesty’s Ambassador, requested that he, the Shaikh, should coopera be to put down smuggling which to Kuwait was no smuggling, but merely selling goods legitimately to the Bedouin of Hie interior. She asked (a) that he should place an armed dhow near the Shatt al Arab; p (b) that he should accept a customs official in his capital to issue trade permits etc.; (c) that he should patrol his own side of the frontier, with a view to seizing contraband runners. He, the Shaikh, had rejected (a) because he could not afford it, (b) because it was not compatible with his honour and dignity as a sovereign State and (c) because such course would be useless. He did promise and would again promise to use his good offices towards the prevention of overt snuggling in his capacity of a friendly and neighbouring ruler. Beyond this he could not go• 16. In his opinion it was clearly up to ’Iraq to act jo herself and^ do her dirty work for her. She had the following courses open to her and could act any time she chose, but apparently did not so choose (a) To reduce her terrific high import duties on sugar, tea, matches, etc. (b) To place a chain of customs posts on her frontier along tMe Batin Valley. (c) To improve and strengthen her sea patrols, round the mouth of the Shatt al Arab.(d) To stop the Muntafik tribes from coning down to Kuwait (especially the riverain ones) and buying cont ra band. (e) To stop 'option” cargo gambling by Baghdad and Basra merchants. (f) To employ her own tribes to catch the smuggling as Bin Baud did. 17. 'Iraq had no right whatsoever to ask him, the Shaikh to try and interfere in his own States trade. He was just as free to encourage his people's trade and attract trade to Kuwait, as 'Iraq herself was. Just as 'Iraq had a right to liwe her own way, heighten or lower her customs duties without reference to him so he had tie same right. Though his was a small State he was just as independent and had just as many rights as Turkey, Persia and Syria, her neighbours. 18 + Were Kuwait under 'Iraq’s sovereign control, the matter would have been different entirely, but Kuwait was independent 8 and neither had 'Iraq the right to bully her * i or try and fcrce her to restrict her trade with the outer world. Nor (and he said this with every respect) did he think that His Majesty's Ambassador had acted rightly when he had forwarded 'Iraq's proposals of 1953 (See para 10). He could not have clearly appreciated Kuwait's independent position. 19. He, the Shaikh, earnestly desired to live on gooc* terms with 'Iraq, hut in trade matters every state had the right to do the best it could for its own nationals, i nowhere in the world was this right disputed. were 20. There wae/of course other matters, for instance the smuggling of arms, which were on an entirely &amp; if feyent^ footing. He, the Shaikh, would he wrong and acting -co^- murkily were he not to assist a sister state in every way possible where the smuggling of munitions of war was con cerned, but this point did not come into the picture. 21. He, the Shaikh, unfortunately believed that- 7 - tliat 'Iraq waa working to find a pretext for imposing a military blockade, te just as Bin Baud bad done. Being weak he could not make war on ’Iraq, at tbe same time if she acted in this manner (instituted a blockade) it would not be his business to try to teach ’Iraq what was best for her. He could only protest to His Majesty's Government. 22. It was possible that 'Iraq might attempt to 'bring him to so called reason' by making Kuwait water-boats pay a prohibitive port duty at Fao or liisy might even declare the Shatt al Arab closed to Kuwait to water-boats. If they did this he, the Shaikh, would on the grounds of humanity alone and for the sake of thousands of his poorer inhabi tants have to do his utmost to get His Majesty’s Government to interfere. He might be forced to appeal direct to His Majesty King George Mmself. 23. It was clear, finally added the Shaikh, that this smuggling question was pa^rt and parcel of the political pressure which his neighbour thought fit to bring to hear on him. (e.g. the Date Gardens, Revenue and ?ao questions). •Iraq would never cease her attacks, until Kuwait admitted her suzerainty over her and till this happened was not going to lose a single opportunity of hurting him if she could. It was with the deepest and most sincere regret that he said this, hut facts were facts. Dictated by:- His Excellency the Shaikh.P .A.through H.C .

Therefore, the authox'ities in question pursued the vessel and asked the owners to stop. The owners did not fall in with this request, with the result that the customs officers were compelled to fire in the air by way of intimidation and as means to induce the owners to stop.

Moreover, the competent *Iraai authorities had issued orders to the customs officials at fao directing them not to interfere with vessels on any account whatever save when the latter are within the three- mile fcone from 'Iraqi shores. As regards the holding of a conference at Bagdad of representatives on hehall of the 'Iraai Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait, respectively, to discuss what practical measures should he adopted to insure order in the aforesaidl Hhree- mile)zone, I have pleasure in submitting to four Excellency that the 'Iraai Government agree in principle to the holding of such conference. There is, however, a point to which I would like to invite attention, namely, that since the smuggling of foreign goods into *Iraa from Kuwait is the sole cause for these incidents, and as this smuggling has assumed such serious proportions as compel the 'Iraai Government to stiffen control, andw will result in an increased number of regrettable incidents of this nature, the 'Iraai Government consider it necessary that the conference should discuss, before everything else, the remedying of this state of affairs and measures necessary for putting an end to this smuggling, ol the extent of the harmful effects of which on the interests of 'Iraa, both material and moral, you are aware, I believe that lour Excellency will agree/f agree with us that any solution that fails to Drovide such measures will not secure the object sought. In this connection, I have pleasure in inviting a reference to the correspondence ending with this ministry's note ho.7242 dated 3th August 1933, in which certain proposals were put forward for dealing with the situation. The 'Iraqi Govern ment suggest that the said proposals, or some other proposals calculated to put an end to smuggling and to prevent the recurrence of incidents such as those under discussion, should form the bases for the discussions of the proposed conference. In awaiting Tour Excellency's reply, I seize the opportunity to renew the expression of my highest consideration ana most sincere esteem. (sd.) Nuri A1 Ea^d .

Beply is, in my opinion, entirely un satisfactory. ’Iraqi Government make little attempt to controvert detailed case put up by Political Agent, Kuwait, as to launch being in Kuwait waters, ana that statement that crew of ooat opened fire first seems to me absurd since the boat was empty of cargo the crew had no cause for resisting inspection. 3. My own attitude in the matter of Kuwait •Iraq relations is described in paragraph 8 of my despatch No.569-3 of 29th fay last but Shaikh (whose reactions to ’incident* are touched on in paragraph 1 of that despatch) will not bo inclined towards co-operation oy tenour or ’Iraal reply which there fore will not make tor success of smuggling conference at Baghdad on 15th February. LesldentTelegram I.F.O. Ex.1927 ,Vt/ From To Resident, Bushire Political, Kuwait No 132 Dated the 6th received the 7th February 1934 I gather from your letter G~36 that Shaikh will authorize his representative to take up following general line at conference. 2. That in matter of sea contraband Shaikh is willing to cooperate by tightening manifests. 3. Larxl contraband however must be concern of f Iraq Government. Manifests for goods bound for interior are impracticable and guards on desert frontier, especially as aamgglers work as individuals and not in caravans, are far beyond his resources. Moreover since smugglers are invariably f Iraqis 3^ institution of Kuwait patrols would mean latter shooting up f Iraq i subjects which is out of the question. 4. This line seems not unreasonable. Please confirm it from Shaikh, and telegraph reply when I will communicate on above lines to Ambassador Baghdad. -RESIDENT-To Political, Kuwait. No. 134. Dated the 6th February 12b4. PRIVATE! 8c PERSONAL. Your personal letter dated January 31st. First sentence paragraph No.5 and Shaikh’s general attitude show that he has completely failed to understand his position. Owing to his town being a smuggling depot and his subjects engaged (on sea at any rate) as smugglers he has got wiil- into serious difficulties a foreign Power, ’Iraq, which is in a position to Bring serious pressure to bear on him in various ways - water supply for one. Whatever may be case in Date Gardens and Blockade question His Majesty’s Government are in no way responsible for smuggling situation which is entire responsibility of Shaikh himself, but in order to assist him we are willing to give him our good offices. Only hope to stave off ’Iraqi pressure is for Shaikh to show goodwill by sending representative to conference object of which is to see if there is any reasonable way out of the impasse. Please for his own sake get above facts firmly into ^ Shaikh’s head. 2. If Shaikh thinks his Director of Customs is unsuitable he can depute someone else. I have already suggested this in my personal letter of January 20th. 3. You will have received by now my Printed Letter No. 87-S and 88-S January 31st with enclosure.

As regards procedure I propose (a) formation of Customs house experts both sides to discuss (i) above^and (ii) produce recommendations by end of 1st day. (b) Formation of political committee with re presentatives of ’Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs and of Shaikh, to discuss and produce recommendations by end of first day on the remaining items of agenda. (c) Second day to be devoted to terms of written agreement by heads of delegation. I suggest that a gentleman’s agreement will suffice, but if any useful purpose is to be served by conference it is essential that representatives of Shaikh should be empowered / to speak and act for him. We will do our best here to persuade ’Iraqis to be (reasonable?) but if Shaikh is truculent it will I■2 it will do him no good. He is perhaps even more at the mercy of ’Iraq than of Ibn Saud .

Since this is a too complicated subject to be dealt with by Shaikh’s representative and is moreover one in which His Majesty’s Government are interested, I am of opinion it cannot be considered at conference. Item 3. Shaikh’s representative will put forward complaints especially the one dealt with in my Printed Letter 87-S and 88-S II. PROCEDURE . Shaikh has only one representative in whose ability to take on the whole of the ’Iraqi team he has quite frank&amp;y little confidence. He wishes all questions to be discussed on his behalf by his representative witja you and I present to give our good offices. III. Shaikh regrets that he cannot give his representative full powers. Decisions taken at conference must be tentative and referred to Shaikh for confirmation. IV. From conversations I have had with Shaikh I think that above are his views.

Even though we are to do the talking Shaikh desires it to be explicitly understood that he will give us no authority to settle anything without previous reference to him. SIXTHLY. If His Majesty’s Government insists on his producing official representative then Shaikh requests that conference be held in Kuwait forthwith where he himself will defend Kuwaiti interests.

Kes ident.CQNFIP^mAL POLITICAL AGMCY, KUWAIT« D.O.No.C-62. Dated the 21et February 1934. t\ V' V Contraband Q.ueBtlona with ' Irt.n. May I be permitted, with very ^eat diffidence and respect, to register a protest against the wording of two / telegrams which His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, recently addressed to you on the subject of smuggling from Kuwait. 2. I refer to (a) Baghdad telegram No.6, dated the 6th February 1954 (b) Baghdad telegram No.8, dated the 12th February 19 5. In the first of these (a) H.M*s Ambassador uses the words 'but if the Shaikh is truculent it will do him no good, he is perhaps even more at the mercy of ’Iraq than of Bin Baud'. In the second (b) H.M’s Ambassador uses the words 'I trust that you will make it clear to the Shaikh that it is in the interests of himself and his subjects, to place his relations with ’Iraq on a satisfactory footing, without the least possible delay'. 4* With the deepest respect I would point out that the words used appear to me to have an unnecessary minatory meaning behind them and seem to suggest that H.M’s Ambassador has definitely made up his mind that the Shaikh of Kuwait is the sinner in this unfortunate business, while ’Iraq is the innocent and injured party. 5* Surely there are two sides to every question, and surely in the present impasse, it vrould have been more just to have maintained an open mind until the difficulties of both copies of which were sent me by you. States/ The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U s H I R E, .2 - States had been fairly presented and thrashed out at the Conference• 6. I have on several occasions during the past year, attempted to explain, and as recently as the 251st January long 1934 in ny/eonfidential Despatch Mo#0-36, I have pointed out that what ’Iraq condemns and calls 'smuggling', Kuwait considers to be fair and legitimate attempt to keep her old and hard won avenues of trad© open'. This is the crux of the whole argument, and this is where the whole difficulty lies. Two entirely opposite points of view exist and it surely is up to H,M f s Ambassador to try and understand Kuwait’s point of view as well as ’Iraq’s, before prejudging her, 7, ?hat makes things more difficult is the fact that for sometime past a heavy press campaign has been allowed to go on unchecked in the ’Iraq papers against everything to do with Kuwait. The latter even talk now of the advisability of annex ing the principality, I mentioned this matter to you when you were here recently, and have sent you several extracts from Baghdad, Basra and other papers to illustrate my meaning. This campaign unfortunately has had the worst possible effect on the Shaikh, and has done more than anything else lately to 'harden his heart' against his northern neighbour, 8, Although it is almost too late now, I suggest for your very careful consideration that H*M’s iuabassador might be asked to take definite steps to stop this press campaign, else the consequences may be deplorable indeed, 9, In the meantime and for your information, I am enclosin a table showing imports and exports (sea) into and from Kuwait of sugar, tea, coffee, matches and tobacco, principal articles f &amp; complained of as being snuggled for the last 12 years, I have 1 obtained these from my annual Trade Reports, which are of course taken from the Customs House figures, 10, If the figures are studied it will be seen that the rather wild accusations of ’Iraq that Kuwait’s imparts (for the purpose of running contraband) have enormously risen in recentrooent years, are not borne out by facts* The remarks in the margin of the table are my own. 11* I have not included figures for 1935-54, as the financial year is not ever yet. I shall however get them later and send them to you. vss.3 Imports. Exports. £. t. 1 1930-31.

Ifo a 96» (90/33/34) * Bri ti sh Blnbassyj BAGDAD w 15th February 1934* Si r, You are aware from correspondence beginning with my despatch H 0 .7 74 of l^ecember 11th and ending with ray despatch Ho *84 of February 8th last that the Iraqi Government had responded favourably to ray suggestions for a conference which was +0 have taken place in Bagdad on February 15th with representatives of the Shaikh of Kuwait, to devise practical means of nreserving law and order in the territorial waters and on the land frontier between Iraq and Kuwait. From a further despatch (Ho*89 of February 12th) which will reach you by this bag you will observe that it has been found necessary to postpone this conference owing to the refusal of the Shaikh of Kuwait to give his representatives the necessary authori ty to speak and act for him* In these circumstances I consider it desirable briefly to describe the present no sit ion, if only to demonstaate that the task of protecting the Shaikh's interests in Iraq, difficult at any time, is made no easier by his present di sinclination to come out into the open and raeet the Iraqi Government in frank di scu ssi on . ' T ’here can be no doubt that the Kuv;aiti s are inveterate and daring Bmhgglers, buth by sea ard lard, and have themselve largely to blame for the blockade which. Ibn Saud maintains against them and for the energetic preventive mearures taken by the Persian and Iraqi Governments. So far as this country is concerned, the Director-General of Sue tc ms estimates that the / Hie Right Honlble Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.,K«C.V.0 o , et c. , etc *, etc *the annual loss to the Iraqi Treasury resulting from illegal Kuwaiti activities amounts to no less then £60,000/ ^his figure is disputed hy the Political Agent in Kuwait, and I am not in a position to guarantee its accuracy. The control of the Iraqi Oust cm s is, however, in the hands of zealous, efficient and conscientious Englishmen who, I am convinced, would not have taken the extreme measures against Kuwait smuggle s that have resulted from time to time in loss of life had they not been satisfied as to their necessity. 3 e In September 19 32 the Iraqi Government put forward proposals designed to secure the co-operation of the Shaj kh of Kuwait in the nreventi on of smuggling. They suggested that before goods were shipped from Kuwait to Iraq a peimit for each shipment should, be obtained. Tins pemit, together with the shipping documents 'manifests) should be authenticated by an Iraqi customs official in Kuwait, who would be responsible for sending* copies of the permit and the shipping documents to the Collector of Customs at Basra and would inform him of the quantities of goods shipped so + ha + some control could be exercised over the importers. If necessary, the Political Agent at Kuwait couId supe rvi s e and poss i bly under take the du ties of t he Iraqi official mentioned above* As on alternative the Iraqi Government suggested the establishment of a combined Iraqi —Kuwait i Cus 1; oms Tepartm ent to 1 evy customs duty on the basis of the Iraqi tariff on the understanding + hat any excess d’ot y over the Kuwaiti tariff rotes in respect of goods consumed in Kuwait would be refunded to the Shaikh. They else proposed that, in order to watch the mo veraents/movements of boats and dhows, a small steamboat should be stationed at the mouth of the ^hatt al Arab, ^hese propolis were placed before the Shai ]&amp;. in March last, bu+ his reply in May was non-committal, and Colonel ^owle was of the opinion that a round table discussion seemed indi cated % The Iraqi Government , who were approached, considered, however, that no good purpose would be served by such dis cussion until either the Shaikh accepted their proposals in principle or pu. forward satisfactory ones of his own. rr *he ir vi ew w as fha t usefill d i scuss i ons cou Id only be co ndu c* ed on the basis of proposals, the principles of which had been already agreed upon between the two parti es. Mo alternative suggestion had been fc rthcoming firm the Ghaildi, when matters were brou^nt to a head by the incident which formed the ^ subject of your telegram Mo,354 of Becembe r 9th last. ^ 4. Prior to the receipt of that telegram I had repeatedly advised the Iraqi Government to be as amenable as possible in this matter, and as you are aware from the notes enclosed in my despatch Bo 0 774 r I urged the Minister for foreign Affairs take a broad view and to regard any discussions that might eventually take place as falling within his province rather than that of the Ministry of Pinarce. 1 took this line because, owing t o the ever ts of the recent past, I fe± + thot it was improbable that the customs experts on either side would regard the questions at issue in any but a parochial light, and that the discussions, far frompr oduci ng any agree- men'’ , would develop into a fruitless wrangle over recent incidents, the blame for which cannot properly be- allocated. I suspect, of course, that there are faults on both sides and that, owing to uncertainty as to the limits of territoria] f waters, /xvpters.it 1? than prohahle that the zeal of the Iraqi customs authorities has, at +imes, led them to take action outside the limits within v;hi di they can m'onerlv oper at e 0 . 5. ''’he agenda for the proposed conference to which Fur i I^asha finally agreed as follows (a) Consideration of the proposals put forward hy the Iraqi Government for co-operation between ivuwai t and Iraq tor the prevention of smuggling* (by Bcu nd an es of t en'i tor ial wat er s o f Kuv; a it a no Iraq. (cj Const c eraf-ion of + he nracticalmear's of dealing with frontier incidents affecting .Kuwaitis and Iraqis. (d) Consideration of complaints by either party. '’'his agenda differs slightly from that which I telegraphed to Bushire cr&gt; February 6th and I ,am explaining the dis crepancy in a private letter to Colonel ^owle. 6. Nuri Pasha readily fell in wit h t hefsuggestio ns (contained in my despatch Ho .84 of February 8th) which I put forward for the actual procedure to be followed at the conference* and which was devised to produce some sor*- of written agreement or underatandin g with in the short space of time available. I was anxious that the conference should eschew as far as possible jejune discussion of the regrettable events that load taken place during the past year and should devote itself to considerati or of the means of placing the relations between the two parties or a more sati si acto ry footing or the future.7. Tt was for this reason that I felt it necessary to enlarge the agenda, ao as to include items other than that relating nurely to the dispute over snuggling, £t is eminen + ly desirable, for example, that not only should the boundaries of the territorial waters he finally agreed upon, but that each side should undertake to give the necessary instructions for its nationals and officials to be warned of the dangers attending illegal operations outside the recognised limits. As regards items (c) and (d), 11 is unfortunately/ only too a apparent that, inthe absence of some means of sifting the evidence in regard, to incidents as and when they occur, it is inboss ibl e t o arrive at +hie truth. My object in suggesting these items was, therefore, to Secure that some machinery should be set up to enable an impartial finding to be giver to both sides. I understand that + he Iraqi Government had i + in mind to sugges 4 - 1 -^a 4 - the services of Colonel Ward should be utilised in this connection'and that any reports which he submitted after examination of the actual participants in or witnesses of incidents should, be scrutinised by the British Judge at Basra before being communicated to 1 he two Governments, I would regard such an arrangement as being nos 4 equitable in the ci re’instances and the Shaikh would, in my opinion, be foolish to refuse it if, in fact, it i s ever proposed to him. Had the conference taken place on t he basis of this agenda, the opportuni ty thus afforded for the Shaikh to regularise his relations with the Iraqi Government would have been moe t favourable, since the intransigent elements- 6 - cm both sides wuld have been subordinated to what, I hope, won Id have been + he larger view adopted by the Iraqi Mi ni s t e r fo r l ? o rei gn Aff ai rs 0 9. ^he action of the Shaikh in declining to give the necessary authority to his represent atives to enter into frank di b cuss ion wit h the Iraqi Goverment on the lines suggested now places him, and will, I fear, continue to place him i n an unfavourable li$it. Persistence in his attitude may endanger not only his own personal interests in Iraq but also the general interests of his subjects. It should not be forgotten that the Iraqi Government are a'^le, if t he^ wish, to cut off the water supply of Kuwait (see my despatch No.41 of January 22nd last). I*hus, sh ou Id they re cei v e co nt i nue d pro vo ca ti or an d ( an no }^an c e f r ora Kuv; ait an d s h o u Id the y decide to t ak e extreme measures, the Shaikh v&lt;c u Id he entirely at their me rcy. 10I I may mention in this connection the* recent articles in tie vernacular press have drawn attention to smuggling from Kuwait and have urged the Iraqi Government to come to grips with the Shaikh. Should this be the ffrst move in a political campaign against him, I cannot help feeling that by his recent action he is playing directly intd he hands of those uho opnose him here. It seems to me, her? fere, that i + waild be well if a serious warning could be given to the Shaikh on the dangers o^ temuorising in a matter which may prove of vital importance to him. I gather from a telegram from the Political Resident at/ 11at Bushire of 25th last (see ny des-ntch iTo 0 84 of ^ehruazy 8 th last) the. t it is present the poll cy of His Majesty's Government in the Hnited Kingdom to emphasise the independence of + he 8hai hh so far as concerns his relations with foreign rowers, and + hat, for this reason, Colonel ^'owle, considers i+ undesirable that he and +he ^ollaical Agen+ at Kuwait should act as the official representatives of the Shaildh* I was under the impression that the foreign r elati on s of the Shai kh were still condu c + ed th re ugh rerresentativ.es of His Majesty’s Government g.rd t rat a con f ere n ce ^ such as that which forms the subject cf Hi s d.espa tcn was eminently of the tyre where his rerresentati on should he imidertaken by Briti sh officers. If this is not so, and if it is a fact that henceforth the Shaikh is + o conduct his own foreign relations, I think it advisable 4 'o point out that it has always been the desire of the Iraqi Government to treat directly with tie Shaikh personally, and that it has oi?ly been the mediating influence of His Majesty's Represents + iw es in Iraq that has prevented them from dealing harshly with him during the rast few years. lf 0 I trust, therefore,, that the Polii ical Resident at Bush ire will be successful in persuading the Ghaikh that it is in Ms best interests to 'be authoritatively represented by responsible British officers in early conference with the Government of Iraq and that Colonel Howie will be fully supported by His Majesty's Government in his efforts.

Basra, to Kuwait Sir, I have the honour to inform you that Monday, 26th March was observed as the T ID al Haj (or sacrifice) in Kuwait, and the 26th, 27th and 28th were observed as public Holidays here and in Basra. 2. On 26th March His Excellency the Mutasarrif of Basra, Tahsin Beg All, accompanied by the following members of his staff, visited Kuwait in an entirely unofficial and private capacity: (a) Doctor Ibrahim Akif Allusi, Director of Healih, Basra: (b) Sami Beg, Accountant General, Basra: (c) Abdul Wahab al N&amp;ama, Deputy Controller of Customs (d) Abdul Jabbar Khudairi, prominent merchant* (©) Nuri Thabit, Editor and Proprietor of the Comic Paper n Habz-Booz'* 3* The Mutasarrif and (b) and (o) were accommodated at Dasxnan, the Shaikh’s private residence, while (d) and (e) stayed with a leading merchant known as Ibn Bahar. 4* The party were conducted to Kuwait by Mr .Gabriel, His Excellency the Shaikh’s lawyer in Basra, who apparently is on very friendly terms with the x^resent Putasarrif. 5. The Shaikh himself, who is now in camp at Hawaii (7 miles away) came in doily to see how his guests were fairing.6. The Mutasarrif and party left for Basra again on 28 th Mar oh at mid-day. 7» Th© ohaiKh to id m© that h© did not invit© th@ Mutasarrif or any of his party down to Kuwait, nor did he know th© Mutasarrif previously. All that happened was that the Mutasarrif taking advantage of the 1 ID Holidays, got Mr.Gabriel to enquire privately from the Shaikh, if he could run down and see Kuwait for two ni^its in ' a strictly private capacity” . The Shaikh by verbal message through Mr .Gabriel conveyed his readiness to give an Arab welcome to such a distinguished visitor, but requested that he should eou^ in a private capacity. The matter was accordingly arranged on Monday and the guests arrived on Tuesday. 8. During th© Mutasarrif 1 s two days stay in Kuwait, friendly calls were exchanged between him and myself. 9. The Mutasarrif apparently, took very great pains to make himself agreeable, and the Shaikh from being on his guard and very suspicious at first, told me with enthusiasm last night (28.3.34), (when I had him to dinner to meet the American Minister) that his guest had been so delighted with his visit and with the Arab hospitality accorded to him by the people of Kuwait, that in a parting speech he had expressed profound astonishment that his own countrymen and in particular the ’Iraq papers had been carrying on such a pernicious and libellous campaign against fellow Arabs like the people of Kuwait and e their Shaikh, as they had been during recent months. 10. According to the Shaikh, the Mutasarrif in the presence of all his Staff, gravely told him (the Shaikh) that in his opinion the Tf smuggling^ accusations that had been levelled against Kuwait by all and sundry in ’Iraq were ’’wild” and grossly unfair.to the Amir o£ Kuwait and his people, and that the refcl fault lay with his own Government in ’Iraq, for not reducing the Customs tariffs toto a reasonable and decent figure. The Mutasarrif’s above remarks were cordially endorsed, added tiie Shaikh, by the members of his Staff, who also condemned their counxry’s methods towards Kuwait, 'whose Ruler was one of the noblest of Arab Amirs and had done much for the cause of Arabs in the past' (their words). 11. I myself was impressed by the Mutasarrif ’s treat ment of the Shaikh, and by the keen interest he showed in Desert and other matters, when he called on me. (He spent a full hour in my house). 12. Though I think the Shaikh takes rather a too optimistic view of the impression he and his people made on the Governor of Basra, there can be no doubt that the visitors enjoyed their stay here and carried back with them greatly changed views on their host and his difficulties. This is indeed all to the good, and is after all ifoat the ^— Shaikh has all along been trying to make ’Iraqis see. \ 13. The fact that in discussing ’Iraq’s smuggling ac cusations against Kuwait, the Mutasarrif and Staff expressed the opinions they did, shows that many right thinking men in ’Iraq believe their country to be in the wrong in this matter and Kuwait to be the injured party. This is significant and proves what the Shaikh has always maintained, namely that if only one can get prominent ’Iraqis to cane and see his side of the picture, they would have a different tale to tell in Baghdad. These, of course, are my views also. 14. Before their return home, the Mutasarrif and his entourage bought several automatic revolvers, with ammunition also quantities of Eau de Cologne, which only a few days previously I had warned the Bbaikh to be most careful about and see that they did not go into ’Iraq as contraband. Even Mutasarrifs can smuggle, it seems, on occasion. 15*, I am sending 4 copies of this despatch to bus hire.

From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dick son, C.I.S., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at BA HRAIN . Visit of Mr.Edmonds and Colonel Ward to Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to report that on Thursday, 22nd March, Mr .Edmonds, Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baghdad accompanied by Colonel Ward, C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., etc., Pert Director, Basra, flew down to Kuwait by Eastbound air mail, and returned again to ’Iraq on Friday 23rd March also by air. 2. Mr .'Edmonds stayed with me whilst in Kuwait and Colonel Ward with Mr.Chisholm of the A.P.O.C. 3. Beyond receiving a telegram from Mr.Edmonds on the 21st asking me to put him up, I had no idea that the above ’Iraq officials had any intention cf coming here, nor did I know what their business was. 4. Although both mj Mr.Edmonds and Colonel Ward assured me that their visit was purely 'private”, from subsequent talks, and putting two and two together, it is clear, I think, that they came to make personal and private investigations into the smuggling activities of ’Iraqi merchants and their confederates, the tribes on the Euphrates 5. As Kuwait has nothing at all to hide, I took pains to explain to Mr.Edmonds in several lengthy talks, the Shaikh’s view point in the matter of the so called snuggling, as well as the great ha rm that ’Iraq’s continued political pressure is having on the amicable relations existing betweenbetween the two States, which the Shaikh above all persons is so anxious to inaintain. 6. I think I was able to tell Mr.Edmonds, several things about the smuggling trade generally and in particular about the guilty activities of the ’Iraq tribes themselves, which he did not know before. I hope also that I was able to convince him that the people of Kuwait did no smuggling themselves at all on the land side, and that by sea only a ver;y small percentage of the fishing community went in far the game. 7. Mr.Edmonds appeared surprised, I think, at my statement that the smuggling fraternity whether engaged in the contraband running to Persia, Saudi Arabia, or ’Iraq were in 98 cases out of 100, nationals of those countries. 8. I gathered from Mr. Edmonds that before visiting Kuwait, he h&amp;dajxeady been up the Khor Abdulla (to its head) with Colonel Ward, and had also visited the Southern ’Iraq desert, west of the 'Batin” valley, so the presumption is that both were engaged on some scheme $ whereby ’Iraq could bring effective measures to bear on their own nationals engaged in the smuggling business. This is all to the good of course. 9. 'Whilst I am, and shall always be, only too delight ed to furnish information on such things as ! smuggling etc 'tj o /distinguished persons like Mr.Edmonds and. Colonel Ward, I should prefer, if possible, that they let me know sometime beforehand when they wished to visit Kuwait. It will be easier for me to prepare them a proper welcome etc. 10.

Sir In continuation of my telegram No. 174, dated the 15th May 1934, I have the honour to forward translation of an official communication from H.E. the Shaikh, No. R4/1506, dated the 14th May 1934 to my address, which speaks for itself. 2. You will recollect that when you were in Kuwait recently I mentioned on the 10th cf May that I had received a disturbing report frcm Bedouin of the visits of certain ’Iraqi armed cars the previous day, and in your presence the same evening I told the Shaikh, who said that he had also heard the news and was sending out a special party by oar to investigate the truth of the report. This party apparently went out at dawn on 11th May and returned to Kuwait on the night of the 13th May and was under the com mand of an excellent and trustworthy Shammar tribal officer called MIRSHID. 3. The Shaikh, who as usual is rather bad at writing a clear report, obtained the material for his letter to me from his officer MIRSHID, and in order that I might get hold of the full facts, he sent 1fc e man round personally with the latter with instructions to give me a verbal account of what the party had seen and heard. 4. I may mention In passing that Mirshid is a reliable10/- - 2 - reliable Bedouin of good family, who has held responsible posts (a) under Captain Glubb, R.E., late officer in charge of the southern ♦Iraq desert Police, (b) with an R«A#P.armoured car column during the Akhwan rebellion of 1929-30; (c) with Captain Papworth during the R.A.F. survey operations of 1932-33. 5. Mirshid* s statement to myself is forwarded with this letter together with a sketch map which I have made to enable you to recognize place names at a glance. 6. As you will see from Mirshid ♦ s report the portion of Kuwait territoiy which has received the attention of the ♦Iraqi armed cars is the lonely area lyings the north west of the State, and bounded by the Jahara-Safwan Road, the Jalal Liyah-cum-IDAIRAT ridges aid the BATIN Valley. 7. I trust that as a result of my telegram referred to at the beginning of this report, you were able to lodge the necessary protest to the ♦Iraq Gcvemment on behalf of His Excellency the Shaikh at this rather uncalled for series of incursions into Kuwait territoiy, and that as a result orders will be issued to the Commandant of the 4 cars which have recently been posted at Safwan forbidding him to cross the Kuwait border again. 8. The armed cars in question number four, and were brought to Safwan, I believe, early in May. One of them is equipped with a wireless set and the others doubtless have receiving sets, but I cannot be sire of this. All are under the command of an officer named Saleh al Safwa• 9. Doubtless their transference to the northern bor der of Kuwait forms part of the ’Iraq Governments laudable anti-smuggling programme, btit it should not be too much to expect their commandant to confine his attentions to the territory lying west of the Batin Depression and outsido Kuwait territory generally.10. While it is gratifying to see the ’Iraq Government at last taking energetic anti-smuggling measures by land (vshich have long been advocated by me) the least that one can expect is that these measures are taken in ’Iraq territozy. 11. For the rest, the personnel of the armed oars apparently consist of ’Iraq Desert Police and are not ” 'Customs Preventive Officers'. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel, ^ Political Agent,KuwaitTranslation of letter No,H4/1506, dated the 30th - Muharram 1353 (14th May 1934} from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, W# heard reports that some armed cars of the ’Iraq. Government had crossed the Kuwait frentiers and were inter fering with tribes that are subject to Kuwait, and further more were camping in Kuwait territory. Hence it became necessary that we should send out a car to verify the same« servants in charge of one Mirshid ash-Sharamari, They were ordered to proceed and carry out a careful patrol to the North keeping within the territory of Kuwait, They ^ —» j reached Raudhatain and turned to Um-al-Madafi* , wheie V \ they found a party of Kuwaiti tribesmen, whom they asked about the abovementioned armceored cars, and from whom they got the information that these cars had visited than daily. One Walad (the son of) Radiii as-Sumairi, a Kuwait tribesman camped there, informed the party that the said cars last came to them on Friday on 27th Muharram (11th May 1934) and had searched their tents, and that Then they (the Kuwaiti tribesmen) protested against the search by those ’Iraqis of their tents, the latter struck one of than with a stick. camped north of the Liyah ridge and the Idair’at ridge, the ’Iraqi armed cars pass them regularly and proceed southward (and westward).

Please, therefore, be so good as to refer Ihe matter to the authorities concerned, so that such occur rences may be stopped, and any misunderstanding with regard to the rights of neighbours may be avoided. Usual EndingSTATMWF Of MIRSHID AL SEAMARI, MADS TO H.M’S POLITICAL ASSIST, KUWAIT ON 15TH MAY 1954. His Excellency the Shaikh ordered me to proceed to the north of Kwait State by car accompanied by 2 rt Fidawis ft (members of Shaikh’s bodyguard) on 11th May. His instructions to me were that I should visit the various camps of Kuwait Bedouin situate in the north west corner of Kuwait State, and find out by process of enquiry etc if any ’Iraqi armed cars had been seen moving about by night or day in Kuwait territory. The following was the result of my tour of in vestigation: (a) I proceeded from Jahara to Rauthatain on the Basra road on 11th May, and from there moved west to Um al Madafa. The Bedouin camped there all confirmed that 2 and at other times 3 cars, armed wi 2 Lewis guns apiece and manned by ’Iraq0i Desert Police constables had on at least 7 occa sions since 1st May passed their camps and had gone in a southerly direction. (b) At one tent at which I made enquiry, the owner, a person named Mohamed the son of Rathi al Sumairi (sana) complained that as he and his women folk were changing camp^l they had been stopped aid searched near the Abata, anfl because had protested he had been abused and A n** struck with a cane. This was on the ,0th May. (o) On the 12th May I learned from a Kuwait Araibdawl by name Samil al Sirbil that his tents had been visited 4 days previously by 4 armed cars and that he , his women, and his tents had all been searched. They had not been maltreated in anyway. (d) On the same date (12th May) I visited the- £ ~ visited the camp of the Amir of the Shaikh of Kuwait's Fldawiyeh, Half bin Hajraf, who with some 40 tents was camped between Um al Madafa and RAIMA. The Amir reported that the armed cars had been seen moving about on at least 7 occasions during the previous 10 days, and that on one occasion they had visited his camp and he (the Amir) had given them coffee and entertained them generally, /urther that the commandant had been very friendly, and had implied to him that his presence in Kuwait was by the Shaikh's sanc tion and approval, and that 'Iraq and Kuwait were working in friendly cooperation in their joint efforts to stop smuggling. (e) On the same day I visited Farh&amp;n ibn Khadaiyir’s (Kuwait Mutairi) camp, 10 miles north of Um Buaisat, and was told that 2 'Iraq cars had visited him two days previously and that the crew had drunk coffee with him. (f) On the 13th May I visited the Al Diyahin section of the Mutair (Kuwait subjects) near Hauma and learned that they had also seen 2 armed cars manned by 'Iraq Desert Police going south west on 10th May and later in the day had seen them going north again. (g) I returned to the A Rauthatain again on the 13th prior to proceeding back to Kuwait, and met two 'Iraq Desert Police constables grazing their camps there. I knew than personally, and in a friendly talk they told me that the name of the officer commanding the 4 'Iraqi cars, was Saleh al Safwa. They also told me the names of the crews but I can only remember five of these. They were: Raddad al Laaibi (Azayad tribe)- 3 - Ibrahim al Math (Anaze tribe) Ghachan ibn Gubeh(Juar©en tribe) (Brother of the Shaikh of the Juareen) Mansur al Ajmi (known as ibn al Marriyeh)• The same man reported that one car was equipned with wireless and 3 with Lewis guns.

'POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. Dated the 18th May 1934. From To Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.S., Political Agent, Kuwait; The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire: Violation of Kuwait Territorial Waters by ’Iraqi armed customs launch from Fao. . I'V'i Sir, I have the honour to forward English translations of the following letter and enclosures which I received on 15th May last from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait; (a) Letter No*R4/1507, dated the 30th Muharram 1353(14.5.34) from the Shaikh of Kuwait to H.M’s Political Agent; fJ k ! (b) Statement 'A' made by Nakhuda Ghanim bin / Mohamed, a Kuwait subject to H.E.the Shaikh; (c) Statement 'B' made by Nakhuda Hussain bin Mohammed, a Kuwait subject, to H.E.the Shaikh. E. The letter and enclosurejspeak for themselves, and I think afford sufficient proof that the ’Iraq Custerns armed launch from Fao has once again violated Kuwait territorial waters, though in still more serious manner than on the previous occasion, when it operated on and off for a period of some seven days between iviaschan island and y r - ' I Subiyeh village at the entrance of the Khor Subiyeh. (In i j \ this connection see my telegram No*233, dated the October 1933 and my despatch No.245, dated the 11th October 1933). 3. You will doubtless observe from the sketch maps 'A” and W B” which I append for convenience of reference, that 'A1 Eaghasil' and f ’Al Tha’alib”, the localities op posite which the Kuwait woodcutters craft were held up and fired on, lie at the northern end, and centre respective -ly of the Khor Suhiyeh, a purely Kuwait estuary approxi mately/- 2 - approximately 45 miles long and % miles wide. I have personally visited both places, mar© than one occasion, and can testify as to correctness of position etc., Neither is a village or hamlet as one might suppose, but both are well known areas, lying along the shore of the mainland, where the w Turfa” bush, an excellent firewood and much valued in Kuwait, grows in profusion. 4. If you will refer to Section No.6 of the Government publication 'Treaties and Agreements between the British Government end certain Arab Rulers' for year 1926 and the map which faces page 22, it will clearly be seen that the boundary between ^raq and Kuwait places the Islands of WARBA and Bubiyan, as well as the whole of the Khor Subiyeh within Kuwait territory. 5. There is another small island lying south-west of Warba and shown on my sketch ”B W which also lies within Kuwait territory, mention of which I venture to make here as it has recently been rumoured that the T Iraq Government intended to establish a Police post on it. 6. For the rest, I might mention that both the 'Ballam' and the 'Jolly Boat' referred to by the Shaikh as having been fired on are very sms. 11 craft, scarcely 20 ft. in length, with a total crew of 3 men each including the Nakhudas Some 15 of these craft are permanently engaged in bringing firewood (especially the Turfa budi mentioned above) frcm the region of the Khor Subiyeh to Kuwait. The boats are owned by the very poorest of the townsfolk and the profits made are small indeed, seeing that a weeks round trip usually ends in the boats cargo of firewood being sold for a total of Rs.6/- to Rs.8/-. 7. I have myself personally examined the ,.akhu&amp;a of one of the boats fired on (B) , and I find it hard to believe/«• 3 believe iiin- to have been guilty of trying to ssoiuggle goods into 1 1raq, for a more miserable specimen of humanity I have rarely seen* His boat as you will see, from his statement, was the one seized and tafeen off to Fao as a prize. The other boat (B) was given back to the owner because from the Nakhuda's own statement, certain small leaves and twigs were found in the bottom of the boat which fact was considered to have proved his innocence. The Commander of the motor boat, however, was apparently not above robbing the unfortunate crew of their bread. Probably we shall be told that the seized empty boat, contained grains of sugar strewn ever the floor. 8. The point I wish to emphasize in reporting this matter, is of course not so much the question as to whether the two boats were or were not engaged in smuggling as the fact that an armed ’Iraqi launch was operating and firing on sailing craft, in the Khor Subiyeh entirely outside its legitimate sphere of operations. The launch would appear to have come up the Khor Abdulla, rounded Bubiyan Island from the northern end and moved south ag&amp;in down -die Khor Subiyeh. 9. I confess to being not a little puzzled as to why the ’Iraq authorities, after several months of quiescence and 'playing fair' should once again permit their Fao armed launch to 'break the rules of the game'. I can only suppose that some new official has been sent to Fao who wishes to q acquire merit and favour by show ing extra vigorous activity, or that the Central Government does not properly inform its provincial officials of how the Kuwait-’Iraq frontier line runs. This latter appears to be the most likely answer in view also of the curiously and almost simultaneous incursions into Kuwait territory of 4 armed cars from the Korth, reported in my Confidential No^C-180, dated the 16th May 1934. I 10. I trust that you will see your way to make early and vigorous representations on behalf of His Txcellenc.y- 4 - His Sxcellency the Shail^h of Kuwait to the ’Iraq Government, at the above fresh violation of her territorial waters, and will ask that the Fao customs launch be forbidden in future to enter the Ehor Subiyeh either from its northern or southern end* 11. A point which might strike you, is the late re porting of the above two incidents (A) and (B) by the Shaikh, which as you will doubtless have noticed, happened on the 18th and 20th April 1934, respectively. The Shaikh tells me that h© himself only heard the story on 8th May, and then as a rumour only. It took him fron 8th to the 14th to get hold of ihe Nakhudas concerned and get their evidence. According to the Shaikh, both men pleaded the usual stoiy as to why they kept their 'mouths shut'. They said they were poor men aigaged in earning a few rupees each voyage, and they were afraid to come and tell their story, they feared they would be locked up, or at least kept in Kuwait pending the rulers pleasure. This, as breadwinners, they could not aff&lt;x&amp;. They thought it wisest to keep silence. The above attitude of mind is all too c cram on, I fear, among the local Arab, which makes the obtaining of evidence almost impossible. I I have the honour to be.

After Compliments, #ith reference to the verbal conversation X had with you this morning, regarding nakhuda Ghanim bin Muhamad’ 'balam' and nakhuda Husain bin Muhammd’s 'Jolly Boat', the two Kuwaiti boats, which were held up and fired on by the /ao Customs motor boat, close to the mainland in the Khor as Subiyeh (known locally as the KHUWAIB) at the Maghasil* and the Tha’alib* respectively, where they had gone to cut firewood and bring it to Kuwait for sale, this being their usual occupation, I beg now to enclose herewith, the statement fe imid© by the abov©mentioned two nakhudas* I should further request that you will kindly represent both of the abov©mentioned cases to the authorities concerned, with the request that they take serious steps to prevent the occurrence of such oft-repeated aggressions and infringements, which are wholly inconsis tent with the rights and privileges of good neighbours* *Note by H*M f s Political Agent* For position of Maghasil and Tha’alib, see sketch map 'A' marked in r ed ink.'A' Translation of a statement made by nakhuda Ghanim bin Muhammad., a Kuwait subject on 29th Mubarram 1353 (13.5*34}. 1353 (17.4.34) arrived at the ' Ma&amp;dasil' (in IChor-as- Subiyeh) very early next morning. After sunrise the Fao customs motor boat came upon us and started firing at us at long range. Xt fired eiglit shots and then ceased* We fearing lest fire would be opened again and that seme of us might be killed,set sail and proceeded towards the motor boat. When we drew near, shouts, with much abuse and ugly names greeted us. 'The launch then drew up to us, cast anchor and stopped. We aide did the same. We noticed seven men carrying rifles in the motor boat. On asking the reason why they had fired on us, and uhy they abused us, their attitude became worse. They shouted that we had sugar on board, and we asked them to come and search our boat. They came alongside and two of them, one Saiyid Ibrahim by name, who, I believe, was their leader, and another one, Abdur Rasul, boarded our boat. They searched her thorou^ily and saw nothing but small chips and leaves of firewood (the remains of our last voyage) and also that our boat was old and leaky. Satisfying themselves they gave us permission to go wherever we liked, but asked us if we could tell them of boats carrying sugar on board. To this I replied that I was a poor woodcutter and knew nothing about any such boats* Lastly, they opened a small box which we had, and took our bread which we had kept inside. We returned to Kuwait, 9 days later, having stopped to fill our boat with wood. Leaving Kuwait in our ,f Balaja w on the 3rd Muharram Sd.

I and two other men as crew left Kuwait in my 'Jolly Boat' making for Khuwair (Khor-as-Sublyeh) for wood-cutting # our usual occupation. We reached Khwair on the night of the 5th Muharram 1353 (18.4.34). On the 5 th Muharram we reached War ha island, where we spent the night. Next morning at dawn (20.4.34) we sailed for the Tha’alib, but before sunrise we were fired on from long range. A few moments later we heard the sound of an approaching motor boats. \fa understood that it was the Fao customs motor boat. Fire increased, and we, fearing that some of us might be killed, let oursehres down in-to the sea, taking shelter under the lee of our jolly boat. This, however, did not avail us, as fire still continued. We, therefor©, to save our lives were o bliged to leave our boat and swim to one side. Next the launch reached our boat and towed her off with sails still set abandoning as in the water. We remained swimming until we were able to reach land at the Tha'alib. One of my crew was do distressed with fatigue, that he could not walk and we had to wait some hours for him to recover. We then thankful to escape the peril, set out on foot, with a view to reach the settlement of Subiyeh, and take refuge there.

Incursion of Iraqi armed cars into Kuwait territory. r Sir With reference to my telegram No,191 of today’s date, I have the honour to report that Mr.Chisholm, of the A,P,0,C• Ltd,, who proceeded to Basra on 20th May and returned yesterday, 23rd May, reported to me on arrival that on his journey to Basra, he had met 3 Iraq lorries, f armed with 2 Lewis Guns apiece and. manned by Iraq Desert ^ Police in uniform, some miles inside Kuwait territory. The cars were moving fast in a southerly direction. 2. Mr. Chi shorn on reaching Safwan frontier post, asked a Desert Policeman on gaard, hew it was that Iraq armed cars were working in Kuwait territory, when there was a sin^- Jo board as big as lifeolose the post, marking the Kuwait boundary. The man according to Mr. Chisholm, answered with a laugb that Kuwait had no territory, outside Kuwait Town, a rather significant reply from a plain policeman. 3, Mr. Chisholm further stated that on his return jour ney to Kuwait on 23rd May, he again stopped at Safwan post and this time found 5 Iraq Government lorries there, three of which had Lewis Guns mounted on them. He also met the Commandant of the Detachment, Saleh bin Safwa, (See paraO of my Despatch C—ISO of 16th May 1934) who he desci ited as a pleasant speaking man. Mr .Chisholm casually asked thi individual if he knew where the Kuwait boundary began and he replied, w Yes, at that large signboard over there”. Note/NOTE The signboard indicated was erected some years ago by the Shaikh of Kijwait and had the writing on it renewed 2 years ago at my suggestion* It bears the following inscription In Arabic and H&amp;glish: 'KUWAIT FRCimSH' 'Keep to the left', Mr,Chisholm then asked the officer if his cars ever crossed the frontier in search of smugglers and the reply came, 'No, never' • 4, On 23rd May Shaikh Han tush at Suwait of the Dhafir visited me fran his camp on the west side of the Batin, beyond Athaiba and Ruhail, and although at first he was averse to giving ms information, after persuasion, admitted that five days previously when he came up to Kuwait, he had seen four Iraqi armed cars north-west of the IDAIRAT, He added that the cars had been regularly searching Kuwait territory west of the Basra road and everyone knew about I ^, i/*” their activities. y, V: / 1 5, In conclusion I enclose a translation of a second letter from H.B.the Shaikh, No,B/4/l512, dated I9th May 1954 with enclosure, protesting against these continued incursions of the Iraq armed cars, and requesting that the authorities concerned be asked urgently to forbid such acts lest a regrettable incident occur. 6, Regarding the statement of Abdulla al Sumairi, forwarded as enclosure to the Shaikh’s letter, 1 will confine myself to making the following observations only: (i) The man Abdulla al Sumairi is the brother of Mohamed the son of Hath! al Sumairi (See Statement of Mirshid al Shammari in sub-para, (b) forwarded with my report C.180 of 16th May 1954) whose camels were stopped on 11th May as he was changing camp with his women folk. (ii) The search now complained of was made on 14th May, so his and his brothers tents which3 which were together were visited twice by the Iraqi oars, with an interval of 2 days bet ween visits. (iii) Tents were surrounded and guns trained on an unfortunate lot of women and children. (iv) No so called contraband^ was found after search on either occasion^ as far as I am aware. (v) The man Abdullah al Sumairi and his brother are Kuwait subjects of poor but very respect able family and with their father are well- , known to m . (/i^- (vl) The enquiry of the cars crew for 'Mirshid', the Shaikh* s officer who on 11th May visited Al Summairl's tents, on his tour of enquiry, is significant. 7. I would suggest for your consideration that with your request that the Iraq Government should immediately forbid their Police cars crossing the frontier, they (the Iraq Government) be invited to furnish an explanation of the circumstances under which such incursions have been made. 8. In this connection, I recollect that 2-^ years ago when some Kuwait cars accidentally crossed the western boundary of Kuwait for a distance of In miles, in pursuit of a murderer, the Shaikh was the first to admit his men f s mistake, and offered a most handsome apology to the Iraq Government. I have the honour to be Sir.

The Shaikh tells me that he/contemplated sending out his armed Ford lorries,to try and keep out the ^raq cars, but, acting on advice, refrained from doing this, lest an incident occur which would result in a far more serious situation arising than at present existed.

After Compliments, I beg to enclose herewith the statement of Mutlaq bin Abdullah, who is a Kuwait tribesman, and request once again, that you will kindly take up the question of the ’Iraqi cars which are still wandering about our territory of Kuwait without the least thought of consequences, and with apparently no attempt on the part of the ’Iraq Government to stop them* I am in truth anxious and afraid lest their unchecked rounding up and meddling with the tribes will create a dangerous situation. Please, therefore do your very best whilst submitting the facts and truth .of the existing state of affairs to those eoncerned, to bring about a definite end to the said cars crossing the frontiers Usual EndingTranslation of a statement made on the 12th Safar 1353, equivalent to the 26th May 1934, by one Mutlaq bin Abdulla al Dalmani, ^io is a Kuwait tribesumn. I was camped with my family at Hauma, north west r of the Liah* On Tuesday the 8th Safar 1353 (22.5.34) , I proceeded to the 'khabra* (a pool of rain water) to fetch our supply of water. As I arrived there, I noticed two large lorries coming towards me, one of which was equipped with machine guns and the other carried armed soldiers. They stopped where I was and asked me whether I had seen any smugglers* I replied in the negative. Two days earlier (20.5.34) they met my friend, ’Id bin Salih, who was grazing his flocks near the Liyah at a place west of the Idairi* al-Khillah, and asked him the same question. ‘ then he told them that he knew nothing about smugglers, they beat him very severely. He told me the whole story hirflself, when I saw him shortly afterwards, and begged me with pressure to report his story to Government, as he knew X was coming upto Town.waters by sn ’Ireqi launch. ^ 18108 ^ unfcrtunate that so booh after the very friendly vie it of the Mutasr- rr if of Basra, to huw&amp;it, as reported in jay letter ho,C/182 of 7th April 1934, the * Irao am not sure * l ther the Cue tome i&gt;epartmen^/«hould have once more commenced their i « P r 1 cs ice are their xrr©eponeible and high-handed »ctiviti« f which are all the r\ r* er ers or ; the nch certain- is) more regrettable since the department is unuer the control i- of British officials in the employ of the ’Iraq Government.

In this connection I would once more emphasise that such e cti n, as already pointed out in paragraph 7 of my letter Ho.258-G of 1st March 1934, would in no way commit the ’Iraq Government to anything.

His Majesty s Embassy present their compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have the honour to transmit to them a translation oi a letter from His Excellency tile Shaiki of Kuwait to the Political Agent at Kuwait regarding two incidents which occurred on April 18th and April 20th last respectively. Translations of statements made by members of the crews ol thetwo Kuwaiti boats involved in the incidents are also enclosed. 2. The Ministry will observe that according to the statement of G-hanim bin Muhammad, the Iraqi Customs officials found no evidence that the balam which was attached on April 18th was engaged in smuggling, and the Political Agent, who himself examined the nakhuda oi the jolly-boat attacked on April 20th, is satisfied that her crew are equally innocent. In these circumstances, it would appear that the Iraqi Customs officials were in any case unjustified in opening fire on the two boats. 3. Moreover, according to the two statements, it would appear that both boats were in the Khor Subiyeh, which is in Kuwaiti territorial waters, when they were attacked. If this is so, t&amp;e Iraqi Customs launch must have been stationed in Kuwaiti territorial waters at the time. 4. His Majesty’s Embassy have the honour to request that enquiries may be made with a view to ascertaining the facts of these two incidents and that they may be informed at an early date of the result of these enquiries. Should it be established that the statements of thetwo Kuwaiti boatmen are substantially correct, His Majesty’s Embassy will be glad if steps can be taken to prevent in future such violation of Kuwait i/Kuwaiti territorial waters.

The latter informed me when I was recently at Kuwait that he had not made the suggestion to Eis Excellency the Shaikh owing to the inadvisability of worrying the Shaikh with other matters while the Oil re gotia- tions were in active and critical progress. In the meantime also, a further attempt has been made to resume informal negotiations between Kuwait and ’Iraq, which have now definitely failed, vide Mr. Ogilvie Forbes' letter quoted above. 3. In these circumstances and as the Oil negotiations have /i - 2 - foave been suspended I think that now is a suitable opportunity for you to approach the Shaikh and suggest to him that he should submit invriting the details of his proposal for the tightening up of his manifest system, vide my telegram No, T/40, dated Kuwait the 14th February 1934, to His Excellency The Ambassador, Baghdad,(copy given to Colonel Dickson). 4.

No.14 of the 11th June that we have made representations to the Iraq Govern ment regarding the incident described in your letter. You may also like to know that I passed on privately to Sievwright your suggestion that an Iraqi Customs official should visit Kuwait and have an informal talk with the Shaikh. I am afraid that Sievwright's answer was a flat refusal. He explained that the Iraqis had taken the trouble to prepare for a conference here to settle the whole business and that at the last moment the Shaikh had 'ratted”: in the circumstances the Iraqis do not feel like waiting upon him when it suits his convenience. Whilst I consider it regrettable thfct nothing can be done on these lines to improve relations between Kuwait and Iraq, I cannot help sympathising to a certain extent with the attitude of the Iraqis.

In view of the seriousness of the position and the desirability of putting an immediate stop to these violations of the Koweit frontier, I am to suggest that His Majesty's Representative, Bagdad should be asked to report at once by telegraph what further action has been taken by him since the British Embassy's note of 19th May \ to the Iraq Ministry for Foreign Affairs and whether a reply has yet been received from the Iraq Government to his representations * 2. Sir Samuel Hoare would also suggest for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Ambassador should be instructed to invite the Iraq Government to furnish an explanation of the/ he Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S. W. 1.the circumstances in which these incursions into Koweit territory have taken place, as suggested hy Colonel Dickson in paragraph 7 of his letter of 24th May to the Political Resident (copy enclosed with Political Resident’s printed despatch No.484-3 of 29th May). It appears from the correspondence that an Iraq_i officer named Saleh—'bin—Safwa has 'been in command of the Irapi armed cars concerned in the incidents which have taken place. 3. In conclusion I am to invite attention to the two further cases of violation of Koweit territorial waters by an Iraqi armed customs launch, reported in the Political Agent’s letter of 18th May, a copy of which was enclosed in the Political Resident’s Express Letter, No.478-S, of 28th May. As pointed out by Colonel Dickson in paragraph 2 of his letter of 18th May, this is not the first occasion on which cases of the kind have been r eported. Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful to be informed whether representations have also been made by Sir Francis Humphrys in regard to these incidents and, if so, with what result.

Coming to the vicinity of Sanam (mountain) on the 4th inst (August?) they were met by two (Iraqi) police cars whose occupants without any warning opened fire at them. Ha sir fell wounded and they both were arrested, Th]#e wounded man was taken to hospital at Basra, while the other was handed over to the prison authorities; and their six camels were sold at Subair, This action of the Iraqi policemen is very wild indeed; without any reason they fired at shepherds travelling on camels unloaded. Moreover, when Naslr was wounded and his com panion Murshid was arrested, the policemen started beating the latter mercilessly in order that he should say that it was he end his companion who first opened fire, and thus they would get themselves rid of this painful cririe. Murshid, however, after fierce beating promised to say what they wanted, but when he was brought before the questioning authorities, he told the truth and what had befallen them at the hands of the said policemen and the torture they inflicted upon him to make him say that it was he and his companion who first fired. It is much distress ing and unfair, indeed, that innocent shepherds proceeding from their tribe be treated so badly by men belonging to a neighbouring brother State. Further/Further, we have now received a news that the wounded man has died In hospital* His brother and relatives have approached us with a complaint for their dead man and his camels sold at Zubair, Please, therefore, b® so good as to refer the matter to the authorities concerned, so as to make them aware of the real facts, and in order that they should take the necessary action against the culptits and restore the camels looted* Usual Fnding*Telegram G-.T.C.

( Jt.jffsf 1 India Office. n fv SmkEE U P E * opened the discussion by pointinlfout that the Iraqi grievance regarding tii@ muggiing which takes place oetween Iraq and Koweit was at least lu years old, but it had become acute since 1932. He went on to observe that the smuggling seemed to be carried on mainly by sea, (the goods being bought in Koweit}, and. mainly by Iraqis. So far as it took place by land it was again carried on by Iraqis and by migratory tribesmen. i^Xi.Eei 3 M r l. f intervening, observed that Colonel Dickson and His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad did not altogether agree on the latter point. Colonel Dickson had admitted a year or two ago that the tightening up of Persian regulations had in fact turned the attention of Koweiti smugglers from Persia to Iraq. Mr.^lAitlMu.ite suggested that for the purpose of the present discussion '3it WEB V.-' perhaps unnecessary to go into this difference of opinion between the local authorities. He alluded to the varying estimates of the financial importance of the stpiggling* Mi Xrapi estimate put it at .£ 6 u f O 00 in 1932 but tills must cert ala ly be excessive since Colonel Dickson had pointed out that the total Imports into K owe it from all sources in that year did not exceed £180,000. Turning to the problem of the act ion to be taken, he recalled the opinion of the Foreign office that K owe it was not internationally obliged to prevent the smuggling into Iraq, though it would hardly be in conformity with the attitude of a friendly state for Kuweit flatly to refuse all co operation. In these circumstances it would be fair to expect Iraq to pay any expenses Involved in measures of suppression. He observed that certain Iraqi 'suggestions for the suppression of the smuggling would in fact have involved expense to Kuweit* Nevertheless a satisfactory settlement of the question was desirable on general grounds and in the interests of Kowe it herself since K owe it was vulnerable in many ways* Both parties had made suggest ions for liquidating the matter. As long ago as May 1933 Colonel Fowl# had suggested a friendly 'Round fable* discussion at Kowelt between a Customs Representative of the Iraqi Government, the Sheikh of Kowe it, Colonel Dickson and hiffi.se If, but the Iraqi Government had refused to is solution. ihis year Sir Francis Humphry® had persuaded the Iraqi Government to agree to a conference at Bagdad, but • * *but in view of the Sheikh 1 ® insistence that he should be represented at the conference by a British official - a course to which Colonel Fowl® hud seen various objections in that, in his view, it would conflict with His Majesty 1 s Government's * facade^ policy in conducting relations with the 4 rah States of the Gulf * tiiis proposal had also broken down. The Sheikh had recently agreed in principle to tighten up the Roweit Manifest System for goods exported from Kowe it and suggested that an Iraqi Customs official should visit Koweit to work out the details of the scheme, but he wished to take up with the Iraqi Government his complaints in regard to the dhow incidents before finally approving the scheme. Meanwhile it had been agreed at the meeting at the Foreign Office on arch 21st tnat the thehte representation by a British official would not in fact conflict with the H facade* policy, and was indeed desirable in view of the attitude of Hie Majesty's Government on the question of direct correspondence between the iheikh of Koweit and Ibn Baud, but the telegmri which the India Office had drafted to Colonel Fowle as a result of that meeting had since been held up for further consideration of Colonel Fowls's views, Mr. Re ride 1 pointed out that no material developments had taken place in the meauwhlle and since the India Office and the Foreign Office still took the same view about the * facade* policy in spite of the risks of direct representation pointed out by Colonel Fowl® he suggested that the draft telegram to Bushire should now go off with as little delay as possible.

NOTE Lieutenant Go lone1 T.C.W* Fowle, QBE . on Iraqi-Kuwaiti Smuggling o On tLe 19tL July, as arranged,v^Len I flew through BagMad, I was present at an informal conference at the Embassy, with Mr. Ogilvie Forbes in the Chair. There were also present Mr. Bateman of the Embassy, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, Mr. Hogg, and Mr. Sievwright. I put the Sheikh's proposals before the meeting; a copy of these I have given to the India Office. /Copy sent to Foreign Office under p.Z.4891/34 on 25th July/ The representative of the Iraqi Customs Department, Mr. Sievwright, however, practically declined to consider these proposals. Itiat the Iraqi 9 Government wanted, so he saia, was a unified Iraqi- Kuwaiti customs administration, the Iraqi Government VW being willing to guarantee the sheikh a certain sum as customs revenue. After a good deal of discussion it was finally decided, rather against Mr. sievwright’s opinion, since the last thing that he apparently wants is any friendly and informal arrangement between Iraq and Kuwait, that the Iraqi Government should send some trustworthy Iraqi official, not necessarily connected with the Customs Department, to Kuwait to have an informal and heart-to-heart talk with the Sheikh. If vtfas hoped that something concrete might result from this conversation. qdie Iraqi proposal for a unified customs administration is more or less new, though some of their previous suggestions have rather tended in this direction./direction. I dcire ssiy it would solve tde problem £rom the Iraqi point of view, but from the point of view of H.M.G. and the Sheikh it should be looked upon with considerable suspicion, as from our point of view it would be extremely undesirable for the Iraqi Government to get any real administrative control in Kuwait. 3. Ihe Sheikh’s proposals undoubtedly represent a genuine offer to assist in stopping the smuggling by sea 9 and if these proposals ao not go far enough it is up to the Iraqi customs autnorities to make further suggestions. However, as nas been stated above, the Iraqi Government have practically refused to discuss measures on the sea, but wish to put into force some scheme which will include both sea ana lana. I pointed out to Mr. Sievwright at the meeting that it would be easier to move a step at a time and first fix up anti smuggling measures by sea. However, my arguments were of little avail. He pointed out, which is true, that the amount of smuggling by sea was very small in comparison to that carried out on the land. 4. On the other hand, from H.M.G.’s point of view, the sea is really the important sphere, as until the recent incursions of the Iraqi police, all the smuggling incidents which have occurred, the shooting up of Kuwaitis by Iraqi customs officials, have happened on the sea, and if sea smuggling was stopped these incidents would, of course, cease also. 5. I think the only thing to do now is to mark time for the present and wait for the result of the informal conversation between the Iraqi official mentioned above and the sheikh.

On July 19th Colonel Fowle spent a few hours in Bagdad en route for the United Kingdom, he brought with him tentative proposals which the Shaikh had at last been induced to make with the object ot restricting smuggling by sea , and these were discussed at an informal conference at the Embassy, at which were present Colonel Fowle, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, Mr. Hogg and Mr. Sievwri©&amp;t, besides myself and First Secretary. The Shaikh's proposals are: (1) A warning to be issued in Kuwait that no goods may be exported by sea without being manifested? persons found violating this order to be punished. (2) The nakhuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait to be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods carried by him. On return to Kuwait this manifest to be produced showing an endorsement to be made by the Customs at the port or ports of destination certi •Tying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at the port or ports specified. The general upshot of discussion in which Colonel Fowle concurred, we.e that these proposals were inadequate and unacceptable for the following reasons:-2 ( 2 ) •'• s smuggling by sea is but a small proportion oi the total smuggling that goes on* the pro- -posals only touch the fringe of the problem, flo proposals can be regarded as satisfactory unless they make provision for dealing with smuggling by land as well as by sea f In the absence of adequate supervision, the proposals are quite unworkable. i?'or instance, there is nothing to prevent goods other than those manifested, being placed on board, or two sets of manifests being obtained by the nakhuda to be used as convenient to him. Ko real progress will be made so long as the Shaikh refuses to deal seriously with the ’Iraqi proposals of 1932. These proposals were, and still are for some form of joint customs control (with adequate safeguards to ensure the Shaikh against pecuniasy loss) similar to certain agreements at present in force amongst the -Baltic States. The ’Iraqi Government regard this as the ideal solution but they recognise that it is a matter for formal conference between properly accredited representative! and not one for informal talks between officials wi' itb/*Iraqi Government unless he can be assured*- no executive power. The Shaikh is naturally suspicious of anything etren remotely resembling a customs union with ’Iraq ana will probably not consent to nominate nepresentatxves to the confer with/ 1 ^Taqi Government unless he can be assured*- (a)•*•(a) of the correctness of the Iraqi motives and (b&gt; that his sovereignty would An no way be impaired. It ms finally agreed that, as regardsU) it would be well to endeavour to induce the Iraqi Government to send to Kuwait two highly placed and well-disppeed Iraqis (not Customs or Police officials) to confer with the shaikh and try and persuade him that, in spite of recent events, he has nothing to fear, and nothing to lose, by entering into a friendly conference with the Iraqi Government. The names of the present &amp;utasarrif at -^asra and the -Director-Ueneral of Foreign Affairs were proposed, and I will approach the Minister of Foreign Affairs on these lines. As regards (b) it would be of great assistance to me if you could furnish me with information as to the working of the agreements between certain Baltic states mentioned above and possibly Belguim and Luxemburg. Discussion was conducted in a frank and friendly spirit, and the serious view taken by H.M.G. of the present position was made clear so as to ensure that regrettable frontier incidents should cease. I had invited the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be present but as he was already Aegomme and the hour was very late, I saw no useful purpose in pressing him to attend, he had no objection to this discussion which lost nothing by his absence. 0GILV1E FORBES.Telegram .

Kuwait were found, upon investi gation, to be substantially correct, appropriate steps should be taken to prevent a recurrence of the incidents against #iich the Shaikh com- -plained.

Tour Sxo«Xl«ncy will of oourst roaliso that, in view of the $rave nature of the reporte received, the ^ailasay^ note© to the Ministry of foreign Affaire were despatched iaainedlately on receipt of the telegrams from Kuwait, These telegrams naturally containd little beyond a mention of the place© vhere the incidents were alleged to have taken place, arid the names of those responsible, /; In a further note of **une 2 D th (I'lcSAS), the y Mini stry were fUrnisehd with the actual text of a letter addressed by the Shaikh of huwai t to the Political Agent, containing some of the evidence on which His Excellency’s complaint s were based. Further information has now been received vhich I consider it necessary to bring to Your Excellency’s notice. On May 20th, Mr,Chisholm of the ^nglo-l'er si an Oil Company, -a British subject- proceeded from Kuwait to Basrah and returned on May 23rd# .During his outward jounney he met three ’Iraqi lorries armed with Lewi© guns apiece and manned by Iraqi desert police i*- u-ai.....!*.;• -•-* the time when Mr, Chisholm saw this detacfmient, they were well within Kuwaiti territory and were moving fast to the south, Mr, Chisholm enquired at the Iraqi police post near Cafwan why Iraqi armed police were operating in Kuwaiti territory, eepeoially as tbe frontier was clearly marked at that particular point. Me met with the response from the policeman on duty that 'mere was no such thing as Kuwaiti territory outside the town of Kuwait'. I On • ,3* On returning to Kuwait, Mr* Chisholm actually spoke with Saleh al 3&amp;fwa on May 23rd, and learned inter alia, that the latter was in no doubt whatever as to the situation of the frontier* I would point out that this direct evidence from a British subject only goes to confirm numerous reports furnished by Bedouin both to the Political Agent and to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, who sent a personal representative to the spot to investi the -gate and report* a copy of a letter froc/Shaikh con- -taining this report is enclosed for Your Excellency*s information# In the li#t of the above, I venture to suggest to Your Excellency that the Ministry’s note of July 15th leaves much to be desired* In view of the evidence now available, I find it difficult to believe that incursions into Kuwaiti territory by ’Iraqi policemen did not in fact take place* In the circumstances, therefore, I shall be grateful if *our Excellency will insist, with the authorities concerned, on an exhaustive re-iavesti- - gat ion* In this connection, I desired to advert to the note from the Embassy, ^o*32C of ^une 11th, reporting the violation of Kuwaiti territorial waters by and 1 Iraqi Customs vessel, to which no reply has yet been received* I have received urgent telegrams from London showing that the Secretary of State takes a most serious view of this matter. In view of similar reports which formed the subject***4 . aubject csf representations to the Ministry last year, I am instructed to request that the inresti^tions, especially in this case, shall be thorou^i and eoraplete and that adequate assurance for the future will be given as regards both Kuwaiti territory and territorial waters* I trust that the reply of the Iraqi Government will be prompt and satisfactory.

(2) In the absence of adquate supervision, the proposals are quite unworkable. iJ’or iiiStance there is nothing to prevent goods other than tiiose manifested, being placed on &amp;oard, or two sets of manifests being obtained by the nakhuda to be used as convenience to him* (3) Real progress can only be made on the basis of the Iraqi proposals of 1932* These proposals were, and still are for some form of joint euetoma control (with adequate safeguards to ensure the Shaikh against pecuniary loss} similar to certain agreements at present in force amongst the Baltic States* The Iraqi Government regard this as the ideal solution but they recognise that it is a matter for formal conference between properly accredited representatives, and not one for in- - formal talks between officials with no executive power* 4, it was suggested that, in view of the Shaikh*s hesitancy and in order to prepare the way for such a formal conference, it might be advisable for the Iraqi Government to send to Kuwait two highly-placed Iraqis with a broad outlook to make ft clear to the Shaikh that, in spite of certain unfortunate incidents which are reported to have taken place during the course of the last few months, he has nothing to lose...lose by entering into a friendly conference with the Iraqi Government* Ihe present Mutasarrif at -Basrah who is well known to the ohaikh f and perhaps the director • General of Foreign Affairs would be suitable persona to be charged with this mission* 5* 1 hope that the Iraqi Government will be able to give favourable conaider&amp;tion to this proposal.

It should be observed in this connection that it f would require a launch heading from the South for such purpose to cross a long stretch of sea, which is impossinle of accom plishment (? in this case) having regard to the small size of the launch and the inability of its crew to venture out in such manner. From the Horth where the three khors of Abdullah, Zubair and Subiyeh meet together, it is practically impossible to distinguish the place where ’Iraqi waters begins and those of Kuwait end. In any case the ’Iraqi Customs launch, which does not proceed beyond Um ^asr, did not enter the Khor Bubiyan and .*arba. Similarly no bailam was seized and the encorachment (? act of viloation of territorial waters) in question has not been established. As rrgards the personnel of the ’iraqi Customs launch, these noramlly do not exceed six in number, inclusive of crew, while those of them armed do not exceed four innumber The statements made by/it he (Kuwaiti) seamen are incompatible with actual facts. 22. The esteemed Embassy will no doubt appreciate the position of the ’Iraqi Customs Department and t he difficulties they have to confront as a result of the increase of smuggling - difficulties which are on the increase as is proved by the considerable quantities of goods seized in course of smuggling. As regards action occasionally taken by ’Iraqi Customs officials by virtue of the power, granted to some of tjiem, to use arms in certain special circumstances, set forth in Section 149 of the ’Iraqi Customs Law, these officials have not exerciaed this power beyond the frontiers of ’Iraq. The object of that (? using arms) is no doubt only that of compelling smugglers to stop to be searched. being nevertheless smugglers fcaxg/- themselves heavily armed often lire back at customs officials, ^hen a craft is seized empty, it cannot be definitely taken that such craft was not carrying arms or other smuggled goods, as it has been found out in certain cases that the owners of such craft would compulsorily throw their arms and smuggled goods over boared into the water upon realising that their capture was a matter of certainty. 3. One point which the Ministry wish to make plain is that orders issued declare entry into Kuwaiti waters inadmissinle, and contravention of these orders is severely punishable. It is therefore unlikely that ♦Iraqi Customs officials would contravene these orders and violate the frontier of Kuwait. *he Minsitry suggesi that information reaching the Political Resident, Kuwait, is likely to have originally emanated from the ’’advocaf- contml es” of smuggling, who are axixious that no MKkxiusi/ of any sort should obstruct their activities.Accordingly, the Minsitry believe that die esteemed Bmbassy will agree with t j em that no attention should be lent to their (smugglers) complaints,which their interests require that they should fabricate with the object of obstructing^ v - 3- innocent endeavours made by the ’Iraqi authorities within the frontiers of ’Iraq* in accordance with the laws and regulations in force, for the combating of smuggling which has become a normal profession of a section of the inhabitants of Kuwait. The Ministry /avail themselves of this opportunity to renew the expression of their high consideration and esteem.

Informal Customs Conference Kuwait.^ / III Note of an interview with His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, with Major Watts (Political Agent, Kuwait) present, on the 22nd September 1934. ||| The occasion of this conversation was the Shaikh's informal call on me on my arrival at Kuwait. As the discussions with the 'Iraqi representatives were to be quite informal, I had thought it best to make my own arrival private• 2. After the usual courtesies I said to the Shaikh that this call was an informal call of courtesy, but that I should like to take the opportunity of telling him that I had just received a telegram from the ChargA d'Affaires at Baghdad saying that the 'Iraqi Government sincerely wished to do everything possible to reach an agreement with him, and that the Director General of Foreign Affairs was bringing some proposals to make to him. I explained that the two | 'Iraqi officials who were coming were Dr.Naji Beg al Asil, the Director General of ioreign Affairs, and Tahsin Beg 'Ali, the Mutasarrif of Basrah, whom he already knew. I emphasised that the idea was to have an infoimal talk. The Shaikh at once said that he had not been consulted about their coming and that he did not want to talk business with any •Iraqi official, though he was prepared to discuss matters with a British 'Iraqi Customs official if one came. 3. The Shaikh clearly thought that he was being •rushed', and asked by whom the arrangements had been made ^ whether it ... Hie WV* Mv*™”' “■ ' I ™ 11 Government who Md dene thle. I etpl.ihed «■*&lt;• *«' Fowl. l«d teen through Wit i» &gt;“ . meeting in B«hd.d of the Onu-g. d«f.ire. - o.rtein of the British 'Irani .mclsl., end th.t u,. y hod decided that the h..t thing to do ... to ... th. 'ir., Gov.r„.ntto send representatives to talk over things quite informally , with the ohaikh t with the idea of getting to understand each other’s point ot viewj and to see if some friendly settlement coulc^not be reached* The Shaikh said that he had never agreed to this talk and again urged that he did | not want to talk matters over with any ’Iraqi in Kuwait* I said that various attempts had been made to arrange dis cussions and they had unfortunately failed; and that I - thought that it would look bad if he were to refuse to discuss matters with these two gentlemen (at the same time t I cannot help sympathising with him, as the matter is new to him and very sudden)* 6. I said to the Shaikh that I was naturally not very familiar with all that had passed, as I had only read the » case on files, but the impression made in my mind, as a new comer, was that it was desirable to do all that was possible to reach a friendly settlement* I said that the position seemed to me to be that Kuwait was an independent State and that there was of course no legal reason why he should help in the matter of smuggling, because it wus the duty of any country which chose to impose heavy duties to prevent smu g gling into their territory. On the other hand that •Iraq had various means which were quite legal ol brih&amp;int. pressure to bear on Kuwait, such as water, vegetables, etc . The Shaikh said that he was under the protection of His Majesty's Government and that he looked to them to help him and that if they did not help, he knew of another arrangement which he could make (I took no notice of this: but I felt that some anti- 'Iraq pact with Bin Sa'ud was indicated). said that we had to get down to practical matters and that , ere W0 re constant troubles between Kuwait and -Iraq and that „ery effort should he made to reach a settlement agreeabley f &gt;\y' to both sides. The Shaikh reiterated that he did not want to discuss matters with the 1 Iraqi representatives. I impressed on him the very informal nature of the proposed discussion f and (seeing that he was likely to oe adamant in his refusal) suggested that I should see the delegates and find out what their proposals were and that, if I thought that there was any ting in them which might help towards a settlement, I should let him know about it. He more or less accepted this, but again said th^t he did not want any discussions while the delegates were here. I thought, however, that this was an answer, given in haste and without full thought, and that,if I see the delegates and then tell him Sf proposals which might form a real basis for discussion, the Shaikh might well think better of it. The Shaikh again asked me exactly how the thing had been arranged, and I explained again. In the course of the conversation I explained to him that he would have been consulted before final arrangements had been made, but th^t I h^d not long received Colonel Fowled note i i about his meeting in Baghdad and I would have written to him (the Shaikh), but had no idea that things were going to be arranged so suddenly. I said that 1 had received a telegram suggesting that the representatives should come and bad pressed him to receive them as I felt that it was impolitic for him to put himseli in the position uf refu ing to hear what they had to say. I think that he took my point but still feels that he should have been consulted before. 1 admitted to him quite frankly th-t X too was somewhat emoarrassed at the haste in which the matter wd bee n put before him but that I felt that the circum stances were such that it would be impossible to refuse to see the representatives without his placing himself in a somewhat awkward position. I said that 1 had known Kuwait for a long time though I had not been here for nanv years and that he could rely on me to do my best to try/try to help towards effecting a settlement which would be agreeable to both sides and to look after Kuwaiti interests Once or twice in the interview the Shaikh s^id that he was quite prepared to let the lolitical Resident and the ambassador discuss the matter and make the settlement, to which he was willing to submit, but in any case, he did not want to talk with ' Iraqis. 6* The Shaikh summed up by saying that he would welcome the * Iraqi representatives socially and would do them well, but did not wish to talk business with them* 7* At the return call the Shaikh said that he would like to ask me to dine with him and whether I would like him to ask the ’Iraqi representatives. I rather thought that he would prefer that they should not come but I thought that it was most undesirable that they should be left out so replied that I would be delighted if he would ask them at the same time. Kuwait. 22nd September 1934.Note of an informal conversation between Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch, Acting Political Resident in the and Dr* Naji Beg al Asil (Director General of Foreign Affairs, * Iraq Government), with Major R.F.Watts(Political i Cm the 24 th September 1934 at 09.15 hours Tabs in Beg 'All and Dr« N&amp;ji Beg al Asil came to the agency by appointment for a discussion of the Kuwait smuggling question* After coffee and a few courtesies I opened the subject by saying that I had received a telegram from the Charge d*Affaires at Baghdad saying that the 'Iraq Government sincerely wished to do all that was possible His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad of Kuwait, and that I appreciated this friendly attitude* I assured them th^t 1 would gladly do all that I could to assist in arriving had caused me some small embarrassment and that was the haste in which this informal conversation h^d been brought about* I much appreciated the 'Iraq Government's having acceded to the proposal made at the discussion in Baghdad \ in July when Colonel Fowle was present, but the telegram informing me of their coming to Kuwait had only reached .i me about a week before -*nd I had had no time in which to place the matter before His Excellency Ghaikh Sir Ahmad, and that I had only been able to communeate with him briefly by telegram* I said jokingly thaw in Baghdad they were used to moving quickly, but that in thh part of the world we still had rather a dislike oi doing things/IShaikh of Kuwait to feed greater numbers of tribesmen than he did at present j and that any arrangement for the limitation oi imports would have to be made on an elastic basis* Dr. Naji appreciated both these points and said that in regard to the former (rather vaguely) that no doubt means could be found to afford other employment on the sea or in other ways for persons affected, and in regard to the latter that this point could be met in the admini stative arrangements. In particular, in this connection, he said that if there was an 'Iraqi official employed in Kuwait he would be able to see that the Shaikh was able to feed any tribesmen which he wished to feed, and that at the same time satisfy the 'Iraq Government that the goods thus used were not finding their way to 'Iraq. 4. Dr. Naji produced as his constructive proposals the following, and said that the idea was that they should ♦ be discussed in a formal conference (i) the Shaikh of Kuwait should give an under- taking to prevent smuggling, (ii) practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being carried out. The suggestions of the 'Iraq Government were:- (a) the possibility of applying 'Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the •Iraq Customs authorities, or (b) the retention of the Kuwait tariff in Kuwait and the management of the Kuwait Customs by 'Iraqi Customs Officials in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and that there should be a limitation of imports. In both cases, (a) or (b), compensation would be paid to the Shaikh. 5. If neither ©f these suggestions was acceptable to the Shaikh, the 'Iraq Government would be prepared to discuss any suggestions which he might wish to make xor a/ He admitted, however, that if a settlement could be reached bv informal mean.* there would be no need *.or a ifarfflal conference and any agreement reached could be affirmed through the ordinary diplomatic channels.-4 a settlement agreeable to both parties. 6* The question of* compensation was mentioned at various times in the course of the discussion and I particularly asked what they meant by compensation as the word might mean much or nothing. Dr t Naji was not prepared to suggest a figure offhand but said thut he would be prepared to try to do so after consulting Tabs in Beg 'Ali and after showing him certain figures which he had in his possession. H® said that he was not authorised to put forward a definite figure but that if need be he would be prepared, if the trend of discussions warranted it, to suggest a figure to his Government. He assured me, however, that the idea of compensation was put forward genuinely and was not illusory. 7. I asked what their intentions were regarding the suggested ’Iraqi Customs official, and they said that the idea was that he should be loaned from the ' Iraq Customs Service and would be under the control of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The ’Iraq Government would be assured, however, by the presence of their own man that they would get correct figures of the imports into Kuwait, on which the limitations and the compensation would be based. I asked whether in the event of some arrangement of this sort being made, they would be prepared to accept a British Customs official borrowed from, for example, the Kar.-cm Customs. This did not seem to find favour, though -Jr. Naji did not refuse the idea straight away. He, however, suggested that there should be 2 officials, one British and one 'Iraqi. I asked who was going to pay and he said that the 'Iraq Government will be prepared to pay for the •Iraqi and India might pay for the British official. 1/•5- Ob ) r \3f yi I said that he might be perfectly certain that India would not payl 8* Throughout the conversation! which was on friendly and trank lines f it became clear that the 'Iraq Government were very anxious to settle this matter by arrangement as they manifestly did not wish to incur the considerable expense (and odium) of an effective cordon, and at one point ! I summed it up by saying that I understood that the aim of their coming was to try to arrange a settlement, of the smuggling question on an economic rather than a preventive basis, to which Dr« Naji heartily assented. I made it clear that I thought that there was no chance of establishing the ’Iraqi tariff, oecause it would be impossible to expect the population to accept such a measure peacefully. 9. At one point Dr* Kaji, when discussing compensation, said that from something that had passed in a conversation between him and the Prime Minister, it seemed that the * Iraq Government were likely to include in the compensation a liquidation of the question of the Shaikh’s properties | along the Shatt al ’Arab. I said that I had understood that these were on the point of liquidation in any case in pursuance of the promise given by the late King Feisal, | Dr. Saji said that they had recently nearly come to a settlement, but thatlsomething had arisen and he was not quite sure about it. It is clear that we should have to approach any question of compensation with the greatest care. I enquired, however, more than once, and Dr. ~aji was explicit that the compensation proposal was genuine | and not merely a bargaining figure of speech. 10 . It was arranged that I should talk over the j morning * s conversation with His Excellency Shaikh Sir ^hrnad/• ' ?; 6 n). % -6' Ahmad in 'the evening ? and that in the meantime they would work out their figures regarding the compensation* Kuwait• 24th September 1934*On the afternoon of the 24th September 1934 His ^xceHeiicy y^hailch Sir Ahiuacl bin «Jabar came to see me at the Agency in regard to the smuggling question (I had sent a message saying that I would come and see him but he preferred to come over to the Agency). 2. I told him that I had had a long discussion with the ’Iraqi representatives and that one thing of importance had emerged which should be of benefit to him, that is to say, that the ’Iraq Government were prepared to give compensation for any loss which he might incur through putting a stop to the smuggling trade. The Shaith said at once that he already knew that they would be prepared to give compensation. I explained (without delinitely referring to the Kuwaiti Customs official which I thought would merely irritate him) that their idea was to talk over matters with a view to discovering whether it was not possible to come to some arrangement for stopping the smuggling on a basis of the 5 Iraq Government giving compensation in return for a suitable arrangement in the Customs. The Shaikh took up his original line and said th rt he had not asked them to come and did not want to disease matters with them: if the 'Iraq Government wished to make proposals it would be better for them to ao so in writing when he c®uld say whether they were acceptable or not. rfe then went over much the same ground as before and I emphasised that I feared that a refusal to discuss matters with the representatives would make an unfavourable impression on His Majesty’s Government, quite u^rt from the ’Iraq Government. The Shaikh’s attitude was, however, adamant, and he is clearly genuinely doubtful about the good faith of this deputation. X again begged him to listen/listen to them even if he was not prepared to discuss matters* but he said that he was really unwilling to do this* He obviously regards this mission as a 'plant**, and I am not really surprised at this, especially having regard to the nature of the so-called^constructive proposals', which are nothing more or less than the old idea of an ‘Iraq Customs control of Kuwait in a slightly altered guise* 3. Fortunately the hour of prayer arrived and I took: the opportunity of saying that I hoped that he would think matters over and that X should come and see him the following morning at 0900 hours* Kuwait* 25th September 1934NPte . \ ; On the morning of the 26th September 1934 at 0900 hours I went to see, His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabir accompanied by Major Watts# The usual courtesies were exchanged and coffee and sherbet handed round# 2# After a brief explanation of a misunderstanding which had arisen over the coming of the 'Iraq representatives, the Shaikh and I took up the thread of our previous evening's discussion. I asked him whether he had thought over the matter and he went over much the same ground as on the previous evening# On this occasion the Shaikh asked for further details about the way of arranging for the Customs and I told him about their desire to have an 'Iraqi Customs officer lent to him (I explained to be under him like Mr* de Grenier was under His Excellency Shaikh Hamad)« The Shaikh laughed and asked if I thought that it was possible for him to agree# I asked whether $ if an officer was required in such a capacity* it would not oe possible for him to get a British officer# After lurther discussions I asked h.m what the difficulty was and he said that he saw in this coming 'damage 11 . I enquired what he meant by 'damage' - what 'damage' te eaw V He replied that he saw damage to his prestige, people would say that representatives had just come without his permission and uninvited by him. It was to he inferred, though he did not actually say so in as many words, that he f eared that the visit was a 'plant' and that the representatives would go away saw and make capital out of the visit. I said that I also difficulties in the matter because if His Majesty’s Government were informed that he would not discuss matters with the delegates, or even listen to what they had to say, that His Majesty's Government would feel difficulty in helping/helping hisij and “that “they were actually helping him very i&amp;ucn In * Iraq, l reiterated that the arrangement had been made by the Embassy and the British officials of the ’Iraq Government when Colonel Fowl© was present, and that I felt that it would be rather hard for him Aot to incur a measure of resentment if he would have nothing to do with the representatives* I asked the Shaikh whether it would not satisfy his feelings regarding his prestige, if 1 was to communicate with His Ma t ) e ®iy ,s Government on the subject and perhaps write him a letter asking him to see the delegates, but the idea did not seem to appeal to him* I then asked (as I had m various occasions before) what his own view was in the matter and what he thought should be done* 3. The Shaikh had evidently thought the matter over in the night, for he almost at once said that a course which would H save the face' of everybody was for me to tell the delegates that the Shaikh wanted full details about their proposals which tjiey could give him through me either verbally or in writing and that he would like time to think them over, as things had been put to him so hurriedly and that, after he had had sufficient time to consider matters, he would ask the Political Agent to convey an invitation through the usual channels to the 'Iraq Government to send a representative to discuss mattsrs. On reply to an enquiry, he said that this representative could come either informally, or, if they liked, officially. The Shaikh emphasised that this course would ease matters lor all unearned* I appreciated that it was impossible to move him » the direction of immediate discussions(for he declined «n a suggestion to have a quite informal meeting at the gency), and the political Agent is asking Dr. Haji Beg 1 A8 il and Tahsin Beg 'All to tea this afternoon. I will hen enquire whether they have any figures of compensation, SiXlCI/•3 axiv^ will in any case suggest, that, they should give me viuac information they have and that the Shaikh should he given a breathing space to consider matters before entering into actual discussions* Kuwait * 25th September 1934*Hot? « Qa the aftex*noon of the 25th Septemoer 1934 Dr# N&amp;ji Beg al Asil and Tahsin... Beg 1 Ali came to tea at the Agency* After tea I suggested that we should talk ^hop” a little* 2* 1 said that I had had some talk with the ShaiKh and enquired whether they had managed to produce an estimate of the amount of the proposed ccmpensatioi • With a dis claimer of the figure being anything more than a suggestion on their part and the remark that it might be a thousand more or a thousand less 9 Dr* Naji said that they thought that something like 3000 dinars a year would be a suitable figure* He said, however, that in his discussion with the Prime Minister (^11 Beg Jowdat) it had been thought that the compensation should not be so much a figure based on customs losses as a general token of good-will* He did not, however, refer again to the settlement of the Date Garden question forming part of the compensation* 3. I said that the Shaikh had informed me that he would like to have fuller information, in particular as to how the proposed Customs officer was going fo ensure that goods were not smuggled into 'Iraq. I amplified this by explain ing that the point was how as a matter of administration one was going to ensure any particular goods not going to • Iraq and at the same time not putting a stop to trade in other directions. *e talked on this subject for a considerable time and the 'Iraq representatives did not seem I t0 have any concrete suggest. All they said was that it was a technical point with which they were not well j qualified to deal and that doubtless a way could be found. | i as ieed again whether in the event of a Customs officer being appointed in Kuwait, a member of the Indian Customs ( would/ mmwould not satisfy his Government. His attitude resolved itself into the obvious one that the ’Iraq Government want their own man. I asked again in the course of the talk why they did not stop this smuggling by enlisting the help of their own tribal Shaikhs on the lines of Bin Sa , ud , s system. Dr. Haji replied suggesting that they were rather civilised for anything which might produce troubles and said that they did not want to have incidents up and down the frontier and so ont He also said that they had a plan in readiness to enforce the stoppage of smuggling but that they did not want to put it intoeffeet i because of the cost and possible troubles which might ensue* On the whole it is pretty clear f as has been surmised, that the ♦Iraq Government have not got much control over their tribes. 4. I said that the Shaikh would like time, say 10 days or a fortnight, to think over the proposals and that he was then prepared to invite a representative of the ♦Iraq Government to discuss matters in Kuwait. Dr. Naji: asked whether it would be informal or official and indicated, that the next discussion would have to be official. I said that the Shaikh had told me that he was prepared to make it informal or official as they pleased. 5. By this time I think that Dr.Naji had appreciated the fact that the Shaikh was not really prepared to discuss matters with them and this was a suitable means of avoiding an unpleasant deadlock, for he only asked whether it would be all right if they were to leave the next morning. I said that that was of course a matter in which they could please themselves, and so far as I was concerned 1 should have to wait on for a day or two for the Mail. ^ 6. Dr. Naji told me that the Shaikh had asked them to/V | ^ ^ com® round and see dim after dinner that evening and whether a. had any objection to their talking matters over with the Shaikh if he brought up the subject* I said that X did not think th^t the Shaikh would be likely to bring up the question, but th^t, if so, they might by all means discuss it* j*ter the Shaikh told the Political ) Agent that he had not done so* ) 7• There was some little further talk after which the representatives went away. 8. Throughout all these discussions it appeared quite clear that the ^raq Government have no constructive proposal whatever except that they wish to control the Kuwait Customs, and I think that apart from that, to them, vex*y natural wish, they have not much understanding of the practical difficulties involved. The representatives left Kuwait at 0815 hours on the 26th September 1934 by motor car for Basrah. Kuwait* 26th September 1934Note. On the afternoon of the 27th September 1934 Shaikh oir iihmad bin Jabir came to the Agency to say goodbye. He did this although I had sent a message to say that I was coming to say goodbye to him. representatives and told him that I had informed them of what he had said to me: that is to say, that he wished for time to consider the proposals that had been made by them and that after a short time, say about 10 days or so, he would send an invitation through Major Watts (and the usual channel) to the ’Iraq Government to send representatives to discuss matters, either informally or officially. I said that Dr. Naji had said that he thought that the next dis cussion should be an official one. I also handed to the Jhaikh a note showing briefly the proposals of the representatives in ifnglish and Arabic. 3. At this interview the Shaikh again quite spontaneously reaffirmed what he had said about inviting representatives from the ’Iraq Government, so that there should be no question whatever of his going back on the arrangement. I should, however, place on record that when I mentioned 10 days .gain, he sai&lt;i:'0h yes, but it will be a little longer than that owing to the Crown J-rince's visit'. There had apparently been some mention of this invitation for a further discussion when he saw the representatives 4. 1 gathered that the Shaikh had had a very pleasant telegram of thanks from the representatives for the hospitality and courtesy which they had received. 2 I mentioned the matter of the visit of the to say goodbye</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00004c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/129</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00004c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/129</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/2 II Kuwait-Iraq Smuggling'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-27T23:04:15</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (318 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 320; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
