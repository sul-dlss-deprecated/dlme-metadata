Specifically, the correspondence concerns hostilities between the forces of Ibn Sa'ud and the Ikhwan during the rebellion led by Faisal al-Duwaish [Faysal al-Duwaysh], a conference of Nejd tribal chiefs that was held in Riyadh by Ibn Sa'ud, and Ikhwan raids into Southern Iraq.Much of this correspondence is between British officials at the Political Agency in Kuwait, the Political Residency in Bushire and the High Commission in Iraq, but the file also contains copies of correspondence, in Arabic with English translations, that were sent by al-Duwaish to the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber, in which al-Duwaish offered leadership of the Ikhwan to Shaikh Ahmad (folios 208-212).It also contains an account of a visit made by al-Duwaish and other Ikhwan leaders to Kuwait in July 1929 in which they proposed an alliance with the British Government against Ibn Sa'ud (folios 262-267).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Ikhwan revolt (1927-1930)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003ba#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003ba#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003ba#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
