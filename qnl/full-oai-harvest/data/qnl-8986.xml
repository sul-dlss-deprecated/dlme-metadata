The majority of this correspondence is between British officials but the file also contains correspondence from a number of external parties interested in gaining access to the Persian Gulf pearl market. The British officials are from the Board of Trade, the Government of India, the Political Agency in Bahrain and the Political Residency in Bushire (Bahrain after 1946).Much of the correspondence contained in the file relates to an attempt by British authorities to find an alternative export market for Persian Gulf pearls after the newly independent Government of India imposed a ban on the importation of these pearls into the country.The file also contains correspondence related to the importation of dates from the Gulf into India, the granting of a pearl diving concession in Saudi Arabia and several other matters that primarily relate to external parties enquiring for information regarding the Gulf's pearling industry.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>International trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000119#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000119#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000119#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
