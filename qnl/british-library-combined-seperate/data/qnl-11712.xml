The bulk of the file consists of an account by the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat entitled 'Notes on the Tribes of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman' (ff 9-33), which provides written summaries of each of the main tribes and tables with further details including principal settlements, estimated population, and estimated number of rifles.The correspondence, which mainly consists of letters from the Political Agent to the Political Residency in Bahrain, discusses rumours that the Imam of Oman, during a spell of ill health in 1948, recommended his successor to an assembled group of leading tribal chiefs. Also discussed is the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] attempts to obtain the allegiance of the Omani tribal leaders, and his hope of persuading them to discard the Imamate altogether when the present Imam dies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Āl Bū Sa'īd dynasty, Imam of Muscat and Oman</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000013#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
