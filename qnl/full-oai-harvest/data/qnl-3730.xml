The principal correspondents in the file are the Bahrain Political Agent, Captain Hugh Dunstan Lance, the Political Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay, Ludovic James Dunnett of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and Eion Pelly Donaldson of the India Office.The first part of the file (ff 3-19) contains correspondence relating to arrangements for the arrival of the survey party, including notices of estimated arrival, and the arrangement of taxis for transportation, made between 12 December 1946, when notification was received of the survey party visit (f 1) and the arrival of the party around 29 January 1947. The second part of the file (ff 20-49) is a copy of the report, entitled ‘Ministry of Civil Aviation Technical Survey Party, Report on Baghdad, Basra, Shaibah [Sha’iba], Dhahran, Abadan and Bahrain’, issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation Planning Secretariat and dated 27 February 1947. The report focusses on each aerodrome in turn, with sections and appendices on: runway orientation and size; suitability of runways for aircraft of certain size; passenger accommodation; engineering (drainage, subsoil, bearing strength); meteorological departments; air traffic control; and radio communications. At the front of the report (f 21) is a summary of conclusions and recommendations for the route between Palestine and India, chiefly concerning an extension of the runway at Shaibah and long-term planning for a new civil aviation airport at Bahrain. The last part of the file (ff 50-55) contains correspondence sent after the issue of the report, and a meeting, held in London on 1 April 1947, to assess the report’s recommendations. A letter from the Donaldson to Hay, dated 17 April 1947 (f 50), discusses the case for a new airport at Hamala, south of Manama, Bahrain, with a suggestion that the Bahrain Government might contribute to the scheme by investing in approach roads and a hotel.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Muharraq, British airbase</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dhahran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abadan Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shaibah Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><subject><topic>Surveying</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00033f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00033f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
