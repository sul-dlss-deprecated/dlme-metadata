POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 13th November, 1948. Dear Residency The papers received with your Printed Letters Nos.1132-S and 192-S, dated the 3rd December, 1934, and 8th February, 1935, respectively, seem to give \ replies to the queries in your letter No.13/7/48, dated the 27th October, 1948 - viz:- (a) No record of specific recognition by His Majesty's Government of Ras al Khaimah's jurisdiction over Tanb appears available, but it has certainly been connected with Ras al Khaimah since the extinction of the Lingeh principality in 1887. (b) From 1869 'when the Governor of Ras al Khaimah made himself independent of Sharjah until the present time, with the exception of a brief period (1906 to 1921) in the present century, Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah have been ruled as mutually independent Shaikhdoms by different branches of the Jowasimi family.'

Addressed to Tehren telno 781 of 14th December pnd to B^hrp-in rere^ted for. informetion seving to Weshington. Course lor of Iren Embassy celled on December 1st to spy that the Embassy had. been instructed to take up with us the question of the ownership of Temb and Abu Musa. His Government wished in the course of a reorganisation of their administration to establish admi.nistration offices on the two islands which they claimed to be under Iranian sovereignty. They understood however that we had in the o^st recognized the claim, to these islands of the Shaikhs of Has al Khaimah and Sharjah. They therefore wished to approach us in a friend ly manner before thev took anv action and to make sure that we h^ve no objection. A replv w^s promised to him after examination of the case. 2 . The Iranian Ambaseador called on December 8 th purely to press for a favourable reply regarding the islands which he naively suggested we should make no difficulty of giving to Iran as we were giving P rr sy so much elsewhere - Pakistan and. India for example. The main reason for the Iranian inte rest was the necessity of the conutrol of smuggling. Ihie rea son was not given by the Counsellor ^nd is of course a stock Iranian armament. 3 . The question hrs been dormant since 1935 'but for the follow-up of the Ambassador we would have tnought the Iranians were not exieecting their-move to be taken very seriously but merely as periodic attempt to keep their claim, alive and perhaps have some action to show the critics who may be expecting implementation of t v e point made in the pro/ gramme / announced2 © announced in Majlis on November 21st regeraing the recovery of 'Iranian territory subject to foreign intervention.' ^e still think this is the most likely interoretetion but the his tory of the disrute shove that the Iranian customs or navy had sometimes prone beyona the government policy ana we must be vigi lant the Admiralty has been warned and the visit of a ship to i the islenas in the immediate future is being suggested. A. Will you please telegraph vour comments on the fol lowing stages of action which are designed to maintain our point of view unchanged while allowing the Iranian G-overnment to claim that it is discussing the question with us. (1) Though the Shaikh of Has al Kheimeh has taken little interest in T amb and at one time agreed to the lease of it to Iran he is unlikely to wish to accommodate the Iranians now with the oil still more in evidence ^nd the sea/bed rights to the fore. Accordingly we see no means of holding out any hope to Iran and must adhere to our consistently maintained position that we recognized the claims of the Shaikhs of Has al Khaimsh and Sharjah to Tamb and Abur Musa, resnectivelv and cannot agree to the Iranian Government's taking over territory belonging to Arab rulers under our protection. We propose to rer]y r ver bally to the Iranian Ambassador in the sense of the second part of the last sentence adding that we trust they will take no precipitate action in view of the present friendly relations and the fact that' the question has been dormant for the past 13 years. (2) Should the Ireniens return to the charge we propose to point out that as we have in the past made our position fully clear (Sir H. Clive's notes 1930 193 z ) without rece v reply meeting our case, we consider t 0 -C tib u e. let us have a full (gp/undec.) theirs. We might also add that the Iranian Government were warned in 1905 that 'revival of their claim to Tamb meant the revival of ours to Sirri' which warning was renewed in 1909- We would also at this stage put to the Iranians the strong idea that it is verv bed policy for them to revive these entirely unnecessary and invalid claims / againstpgpinRt us Rlmuly In attempt to pn^e^Re those mischievous Irpnipn politicians who ?re insnirer 1 by Pussien propegonde The internctionpl situetion is too serious to ?llov ('sny' - omit tec 5 ??) of these attempts to rtrive p wedge between count ries whose fundamental interests are identical. ( 3 ) If after comnunicatlons on these lines, the Iranians persisted in their claim, the next step mimht we suppose be the possibility of reference to International Court. We should not want to suggest this and our case might not be so strong as on Bahrain, but in the last resort if the Iranians press for this we should no doubt have to agree. One of the chief disadvantages would be that a decision favourable to the Iran ians on these two islands might encourage them to press their claims to Bahrain and might even seem to provide the court with a precedent for deciding that question in their favour ( though in fact (gp/undec •) 'Prescriptive 11 indicated) arguments are very much stronger in our favour over Bahrain and there is no awk ward question of an Interrugnum)). We should therefore have to weigh verv carefullv the attitude to be adopted. 5 . As it apoears from the 1935 incident and from corres pondence £ent with the Political Resident's endorsement 20 . 207 -S dated January 9 th 19^2, that the Shaikh of Res al Khaimah has not always been forward in maintaining his rights, Sir. R. Hay might both confirm thf% the Shaikh has been vigllan in recent years and advise him to be so in fut?ut?e (gp/un^ec.) of smuggling should also be thoroughly investigated so that we may be able to replv to the Iranians on this point.COPY ID 'K' P.R.

Theclaims have been pressed by the Counsellor to the Persian Embassy who called here on the 1st December and by the Ambassador himself who followed up on the 8th. In view of this we consider it will be advantageous for a Naval vessel to visit the islands as soon as this can be arranged. We should like a visit to be made within a month. There is no need to ar’ange a wider tour in order to conceal our special interest in Tamb and Abu Musa, indeed it will, on the contrary, be of value to show pointed interest in these islands alone, and this may enable you to arrange a visit more expedition iy. ;7ill you please, in issuing any orders to local naval authorities, ensure that the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, is kept informed.

THE 25th JANUARY 1949 Will you please r£fer to correspondence resting with your endorsement No.C/S-7 of 17th January 1949 regarding Tamb and Abu Musa Islands ? 2. I visited these Islands between 19th and 21st January 1949 and obtained the following information. 3. ABU MUSA. Population. About 60 locals engaged in fishing and collect ing Mother-of-Pearl Shells. None of them possess large craft. A further 140 workmen of the Golden Valley Oxide Company are employed there in the Oxide mines, which are at present being managed for the company by Nasir bin Abdul Latif of Sharjah. Dwellings. There are some 50 or so small mud or barasti houses in a village on the south coast of the Island in which live the local fishermen and certain of the coolies. A small settlement at the South East corner of the Island contains the Company’s loading hard and their stores. The inhabitants appear poor. Boats Visiting. In the last 2 months, apparently only some 4 or 5 boats have visited the Island and that, only to lie off and take shelter from storms. There is no evidence at all to suggest that such boats are specifically engaged in smuggling and by no means all craft shelta?ing there have contact with the shore. There is no trace of godowns likely c*. to be used by smugglers, nor is there even bazaar. N 4. TAMB ISLAND. Population. There are about 80 locals engaged in fishing, keeping goats and tending 2 or 3 small date gardens. C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. t-onfideatial Bahrain receipt. —— Dale..- 2 - et&gt; A further seven Indians and two Persians of Persian Gulf Lighting Service live in the lightouse. Dwellings. There are sone 30 small houses on the Southern shore, in one of which lives Shaikh Mahmud bin Muhammad, a man of 65 years who rules the Island on behalf of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah. Boats Visiting. There were no boats at Tamb at the time of my visit and I gather that dhows and launches only occasionally lie off Tamb for shelter in case of storms. These boats may belong to any of the Gulf Littoral States. Their only contact with the shore is occasionally to fetch local water (which is exceptionally good)^ or to purchase by barter such provisions as the Island can supply. There is nothing to suggest that Tamb is particularly used for shelter by craft engaged in smuggling, nor are there any buildings likely to be used as godowns nor, even, is there a bazaar. In fact, the obivous poverty of Shaikh Mahmud and of his people would appear to destroy any suggestion that Tamb is a smuggles base. No Persians ever visit Tarab. 5. I advised Shaikh Saqr bin Muhammad to be vigilant in maintaining his rights in Tamb. He has not visited the Island for some years and seems to be somewhat apathetic about it. I suggested to him that we might one day visit Tarab together and he seemed pleased with the idea. I would propose that on some future occasion, when a warship is in the vicinity of Has al Khaimah, it might take the Shaikh to visit Tamb, and that his visit might be mentioned by our publicity services, if that appears desirable at the time. 6. In general, the Persian contention regarding smuggling would appear to be completely without foundation and the fact that the Islands are inhabited by Arabs and not Persians, would seem further to justify the maintenance of the status quo. 7. H.M.G. LOCH ^UOICH visited both Islands on about 17th January 1949.SECRET Nt. 93/60 Sir, H.M.S. L(XH QUCICH, l^th January 1949. I have the honour to report that on 14th and loth January I visited the islands of Sir bu Iva'air, Bu kusa, Tunb and Nabiyu Tunb. 2. At none did I find evidence of Persian territorial claims, nor of any visits of a suspect nature. 3. The flags of the Shaikh of Sharjah at Sir bu Ns*air anu of the Shaikh of has al Khaimah at Tunb, were hoisted shortly before the ship anchored. 4. At Tunb I visited the Lighthouse Station as well as the Heauman of tne village, and found all well. The Headman was provided with a bottle of cough mixture. 6.

Bj iiflJSA aNL SIR a NA 1 AIR ISLANDS . The following report is based on observation and on information obtained from the Arab Headman of tne respective islands. Both Islands are under the jurlsulction of the Shaikh of Sharjah, who has granted a 22-year lease of them to the Golden Valley Oxide and ochre Company of Bristol. This lease expires in 1956. 2. The Company’s local manager is a Hr. Pocock, who is a mechanical and mining engineer. He was absent at the time of my visit, having gone to Banrain on leave with his wife and two children. HIMKG. 3. Both Islands appear to be compased of rich Iron Oxide Ore covered by a strata of sand and mud. Three mines are being worked on Bu Musa, and two on Sir bu La’air. 4. The open-cast system is used, the maximum depths of pits being about 50 feet. The mining methods are simple, at Bu fcusa Gelignite is employed fairly extensively for removing the upper strata. At both islands the ore is dug with spades. At Sir bu Ka’air it is then brought to the surface by baskets and ropes, but at Bu Musa rails have been laid and trucks operated by a motor wh&amp;eh winch anu cable are used; the power unit was installed by Mr. Pocock in 1948, tc replace a hand-winch. 5. The mind ore is first dumped at the rim of the pit, where samples are taken and, by a chemical process involving the use if Line cxide, the Iron oxide ore is seperatea into three grades. The graded ore is then taken to the foreshore by lorry (one at Sir bp Na'air and three at Bu Musa) where it is stacked to await shipment. 6 « The yearly output of Sir bu La*air is 2000 tons; that of Bu kusa used to be the same, but is now slightly less owing, to a heavier top strata having been encountered. py^MSiiS- 7. The sole reason for the population of each island is mining. 103 men are employed on Sir bu La'air and 200 are onBu i*usa, and they have their families with them. Aaditional labour is imported from Sharjah, on a temporary basis, when considered necessary. There are a few Persians among the resident labcreres, but the great majority are the Arabs. Their straw, mud and tin plate huts are primitive, but they appear cheerful and contented. Provisions are brought from Sharjah by ^how. Beth islands have wells able to meet requirements for drinking purposes, but the water is slightly brackish and is reported to be unpleasantly so in summer. CCMMUNICiiTlCNS. . 8 . A ship calls once a year to load the ore, generally in June. Another calls, generally in January, to deliver stores, the s.s. 'Eastgate' • • •s.s. 'EASTGATE' (Turnbull and Scott, chartered by Strick and Ellerman) was seen leaving the anchorage on 14th January, having brought medical stores, 40 cases of gelignite and various items of mining equipnent. 9. For local comnunication between the two islands and Sharjah, two motor dhows are available, and these are augmented by sailing dhows whenever necessary. Neither island nas radio commun.cation.
