But His Majesty’s Government reserve the right to demand the contribution of a moiety from the Government of India, if the proposed revision is not accepted, and Their Lordships will accordingly keep a note of the amount that may be due from India in this event.

COUNCIL f X JAN 192,3' If the request in your letter is understood aright^ the Secretary of State is asked to obtain the consent of the Government of India to the 'imposition on Indian Revenues, 'definitively, of a moiety of such capital expenditure as may be incurred on the building un to the date of agreement as to the jrevision of the incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia generally and of jConsular expenditure at Kermanshah in particular; and thereafter such other proportion as may correspond to the revised contribution prescribed by agreement as the I ndi anIrvlian share in future oi Consular expenditure at Kenaanshah. If this is a correct interpretation of the request in your letter the Secretary of State regrets that he cannot accede to it. For, in the first place, it would involve Indian revenues in the irrecoverable outlay of a capital sum on a consulate in which India will shortly (under the arrangements proposed in my letter cease to have any financial interest; and secondly, it would oblige the Secretary of State to abandon, in resoect of a particular case, his general stipul-yti-on that the sun?rested revision of incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditureDraft Paper Department, ■tagnvfn cuiisfi |T^ 0UU r t x JAN19^ IL •PEOIAL FiWANCE COMMUTES 2} DEC., )b£j discussion^to commit itself to acceptance of the proposal, /^uiiBral- rev 1 siuiruf incidence gj^ald-havc retrosjjecLive ^feet-to l^Q, the utmost that the Secretary of State tyould be prepared to sunrest to the Government of India by 'vay of provisional contribution to the cost of building a consulate in rrhich they hav-e-a 1 ■ Ct-AAlj 4 ” ly\Xt/\j/zf' £//' uarihu,-id interest onl^ ^ould be the payment, pending the introduction of the revised incidence and subject to readjustment in accordance with the arrangements finally arrived * at, of an annual sum (or proportion thereof) rcpreacntiug a moiety of approved COMOTTBR-, ^DfcC id28 ,/P ^T\0^ the estimated rent of a building of value equal to such capital expenditure as nay/W^ be^ incurred,on the now Kcrmantrhah Consulate before the date from which the 'revised incidence of ^e^pendi ture has 'effect:.

In view of the terms of your official letter * Ho. P.1148 of May 12th last, you may wonder why we have raised this question again and I am therefore writing privately to explain that the Treasury have informed us that unless such an undertaking is forthcoming from India they will not agree to buildingbuilding at all.

It is therefore requested that the Government of India may now be asked to undertake to contribute to the cost of rebuilding the consulate a proportion which shall be that governing the division of consular expenditure at Kermanshah, any changes in this proportion to be applied to building expenses incurred subsequently, but not prior to the date of such change. 3, I am to request the favour of an early reply to this letter.

This question has hitherto been deferred on the grounds that the consul has been satisfactorily housed in leased premises, but it is now understood that the present lease expires on April 1st, ±924, and that no suitable arrangements can be made after that date. 3. It is requested that the Government of India may be asked, if it is decided to proceed with the re-building of the consulate, to contribute a moiety towards the cost of the work, which has been roughly estimated at nine thousand pounds, including two thousand pounds in respect of offices.
