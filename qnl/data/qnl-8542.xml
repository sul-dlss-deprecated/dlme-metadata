The file includes: correspondence dated 1933 to 1935 from the British Consul at Kermanshah, reporting progress of the construction of APOC’s oil refining facilities at Kermanshah; correspondence dated 1939 and 1940 reporting on the Shah of Persia [Reza Shah Pahlavi] and his Government’s efforts to renegotiate the terms of the APOC concession, in light of the heightened strategic importance of APOC’s oil production to Britain during wartime conditions; correspondence dated 1941 reporting on wartime developments, the likelihood of German occupation of Iran, and the threat to APOC oil production in the country. The file also includes: two bound and printed copies of the APOC Concession 1933-1993, printed in French and English, and accompanied by a fold-out map of the concession area (ff 127-149, ff 150-172); an illustrated brochure, published by APOC in 1924 to commemorate the company’s stand at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924 (ff 109-126).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002d#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
