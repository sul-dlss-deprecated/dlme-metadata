T HE fragment which follows was secretly obtained from Russian sources in Persia. It would appear to form part of a scheme drawn up by the Unfortunately only this fragment of the scheme could be obtained, and we are thus debarred from learning the intentions of the writer regarding such interesting topics as Seistan and the great trunk railway to Chahbar. It is significant to note, however, that the scheme appears to contemplate a Russian occupation, not only of the Karun Basin, in which we are now pegging out very considerable claims, but of places as far south as Bushire and Bandar Abbas which, for genera tions past, have been peculiarly under British influence. Russian General Staff for future military action in Persia. The 27th May 1909. Simla : W. MALLESON, Colonel, Assistant Quarter Master General, Intelligence Branch*Notes in Intelligznce Branch. The proposals and opinions of Russian officers who have visited Persia to study the country, and for military purposes gen erally, have led to the following conclu sions being arrived at: — I. That for future military operations in Persia the town of Kum should be selected as the Base of Operations, for the following reasons :— Correct ; but said to be in bad repair just at present. (a) from Rasht to Kum there is a cart-road practicable for every kind of transport; (b) the entire route is safe and secure from any intrigues on the part of the English; (c) it is inhabited by a peace-loving unwarlike people, from whom no hostile action is to be expected; Probably not willingly so ; but possibly from fear they might become so. (d) on the contrary, everything points to the inhabitants on both sides of the route being supporters of Russian interests. Tehran to Kum, 85 miles in 4 stages. II. The importance of this point as a Base of Operations—distant some 5 — 6 marches from Tehran, the capital of Persia, which would be left in rear of our troops, and would thus lose much of its impor- ance and political influence throughout the country. With the capital in our hands we would gain political predominance not only as regards Foreign Powers, but in the eyes of the people themselves. The material advantages to be derived would also be considerable. Kum to Kashan, 50 miles in 3 stages : road level and good except near Kum where it is difficult in rainy weather, and near Kashan where soil is light and sandy. Near Natenz the road runs through a stony ravine. ls£ Line of Operations. 1. By advancing the Base of Operations to Kum we would possess two routes, both more or less practicable for wheeled trans port. The first leads direct due south to Kashan, and thence, avoiding the passage of the Kuhrud, proceeds via Natenz to Isfahan. This road throughout its entire length T I.

Kumishah might, and should, serve as an advance post of observation. A practicable road runs from Yazd to Kashan. 3. The Kavir Salt wastes Secure the left flank of a column moving by this route on Isfahan, and the right flank would be safeguarded by troops advancing parallel, via Daulatabad, Sultanabad, Gulpaigan, Khonsa, Tirun-Kirwen, Najafabad to Is fahan, where the forces by the two lines would concentrate for further operation, i.e., an advance from Isfahan to Shushtar. 4. There is but a sparse population along the road from Kum to Isfahan, and the Supplies scanty by 1st Line : country tra- supplies and forage obtainable would not versed by 2nd Line fairly fertile and well po- p e sufficient to provision a large force ; pula ted up to and a little beyoud Khonsa. ^ ^ r column must take the Thence it passes through a stony wilderness ° t &lt;• i to Isfahan. 2nd Line—Sultanabad, Khonsa, Isfahan, as mentioned in 3 above. 5. The inhabitants along the 1st Line are indifferent by nature and a hostile atti tude on their part is not probable ; for the sake c f personal gain, they are unlikely to offer any opposition. 6. A column moving by the 1st Line is spared certain inconveniences to be met with along the 2nd Line. On the latter in the intervals between stages there is no water. Also at some of the stages the re- There hould be little difficulty in collecting quired quantity of supplies and forage supplies. would not be forthcoming even for a small force, unless previously collected from the neighbouring villages. The defect is, how ever, easily remedied by the fact that in Per sia the main road often avoids populous villages, whence the requisite supplies can be obtained and carried on local trans port to any given point. Lateral communication exists between Ka- 7.

In any case, the main lateral line will run through Kum, Sultanabad and Daulatabad, link ing up all three operating lines.Notes in Intelligence Branch. 2nd Line of Operations. * Road probably in good repair. 1. The force detailed for military oper ations in Persia will move from Rasht and other points to Kazvin, whence the main or central column would proceed to Ha- madan by the cart road,* thence onwards via, Daulatabad, Kumani, Gulpaigan, Route well watered and supplies plentiful.

This 2nd Line passes through well- populated districts, and considerable quan tities of supplies and forage are procur able. Correct. 3. From Hamadan many collateral routes, all leading to Isfahan, can be used, more especially by infantry and cavalry. Yes. 4.

The inhabitants are wealc and most unwarlike, as is usual in Persia. Differ ing very materially from the Lurs, Bakh- tiaris and Persian nomads, there is no chance of hostile action on their part. | Such as streams and ravines. 6. It would be advisable to send all wheeled transport and artillery by the 1st Line of operations, and infantry and cav alry alone by the 2nd or central line. As although along the latter there are no great physical difficulties in the way of passes, gorges or la ge rivers, yet in certain places some minor obstacles,! although easily surmountable would retard generally the movement of troops. This refers to artillery transport only: infantry and cavalry could move freely. On the Tehran Isfahan post road wheeled 7. The movement of troops WOuld be vehicles would also be available, consisting facilitated by the amount of local trans- of diligences, phaetons, fourgons, tongas, etc. port available on both lines, consisting exclusively of mules, pack ponies, asses and camels. 8. The country bordering this 2nd Line from Daulatabad to Isfahan is well cultivated, and there would be no lack of grain and slaughter cattle.1 4 Notes in Intelligence Branch. 3rd Line of Operations. 1. The third advancing Column would proceed from Daulatabad towards Bura- jird and Khurramabad. 2. As far as Khurramabad the local conditions and characteristics of the peo ple closely resemble those of the 2nd Line. A suitable base could be formed here. 3. I n Khurramabad this Column would form an independent force, and select its own base for any subsequent movement. 4. The force should be composed of in- Yes - fantry, cavalry, and mountain artillery exclusively. Daulatabad to Dirful is about 170 miles by 5 _ This c0 ition ig necessitated by the local conditions of the region, which for some 266 miles is peopled by the Lur tribes, and is cut up by considerable mountain ridges, difficult passes and gorges and other physical difficulties. 6. Along the whole route from Khur ramabad to Dizful there are no villages or dwellings and no cultivated land. 7. The whole region is mountainous and uninterruptedly covered with thin, prin cipally oak, forest. High grass abounds, and enables the local tribesmen to keep a large number of sheep and excellent mares. 8. The Lur tribes are very warlike, and scarcely recognize Persian authority. 9. The road from Khurramabad to Dizful was made after a fashion some 20—25 years ago, but is now no better than the other tracks which intersect the region—passable for infantry and cavalry, but quite im practicable for field artillery or wheeled transport. 10. The road passes through the follow ing main Lur tribes :— Ibie Javanshir and Maliki are not mentioned as sub-divisions of the Sagwands. Near Khurramabad as far as Ab-i-Sard, right and left of the road, live the Sag wands, Yusufwands, Bairanwands, Sula- Amrai. The main tribes include the minor branches; for example, f Sagwands * is the general term embracing the Javanshir, it is now merely a fair mule track. No supplies are to be obtained in the country pass ed through, with the exception of a few sheep and goats possibly from the nomads. Water from streams is good and plentiful, and graz ing generally good.Notes in Intelligence Branch. Maliki, etc. Each tribe has its own ♦ The meimag of this term h not c’ear. Kukha, ” * but can at will break away and join another: e.g. the Sagwands can join the Sula-Amrai and subordinate them selves to Nazar Ali Khan. There have been instances of a main tribe dissolving and breaking up into different sections and dropping its original name. In the neighbourhood of Ab-i-Sard the road intersects the country of the small Judaki tribe. t This is a very difficult mule track covered with loose stones, and the Gialan Pass is a con siderable obstacle. No supplies, but water sufficient. Here the road bifurcates, one branchf going to G'alan, where the Dirakwands dwell. This is a very wild tribe, inhabit ing the inaccessible mountain fastnesses. The road descends from the Gialan Pass to Birinj-zar, the Dirakwands being found as far as BAa-Rud. The other road goes off to the right through gorges and hilly country to Vel- mian, Badamek and Pul-i-Tang. This tract of country is apparently un inhabited by any tribe, and although the route avoids the Gialan ridge, it is 3—4 marches longer but nevertheless more prac ticable than the Gialan Pass road. Fur ther on, at the Ab-i-Zal the two roads unite, and the single route continues to Dizful. 11. The Lur tribes, in all probability, will not be induced to afford us any assistance, and up to the time of our actual arrival they are likely to be subject to English influence, as in the case of the Bakhtiaris. The Lurs, however, are less anglophil than the Bakhtiaris, though without doubt they would receive us not as friends, but foes. Slightly the better of the two. No supplies, water plentiful and good grazing. In the first instance, one could not count on obtaining supplies and forage in this region. The occupation would not be an easy mat- .12.

And could only be conveyed on pack ani mals. The success of the enterprise would appear to depend largely on the result of the operations in this region. * Formed by the Ab-i-Gargar and Shatait branches of the Karun river. Probably a wise precaution, though Persian mules have their own saddles and equipment. From Isfahan to Ahwaz by the Lynch road is 293 miles in 18 stages—a mule road, impass able in January, February and March on ac count of snow. Very scanty supplies of grain are obtainable, though sheep and goats are numerous. f Somewhat exaggerated—a kharwar being equivalent to about \ of an English ton. 7 with supply magazines at such places as Ab-i-Sard, Gialan and Ab-i-Zal. The necessary materials, etc., would be drawn from Khurramabad. 13. In view of its importance we must make every effort, adopting peaceful means or force, to secure this strip of country ; by so doing the interval dividing us from our objective is shortened, i.e., Russia— Shushtar—Ahwaz. 14. Shushtar, situated on the northern extremity of Mal-i-mir island,* would sub sequently in our hands become a first-class fortress. 15. For a move into Southern Persia all pack transport equipment must be previously provided in Russia. 16. From Isfahan and Khurramabad the Force would move in two Columns, and enter the plains of Khuzistan. 17. Khuzistan is the richest province in Persia, and although under Persian admin istration, it is at present in a decadent state : the English nevertheless manage to export annually some tens of thousands ‘ kharwars ’ of wheat.f It would therefore be possible to consolidate strongly a posi tion taken up in Khuzistan. 18. An Arab population predominates, speaking Arab dialects, and ruled by their own Shaikhs. 19. The whole country forms a vast valley extending down to the banks of the Euphrates and the shores of the Persian Gulf. 20. Existing local conditions and also strategical considerations compel us to penetrate Bakhtiari and Lur country. To move southwards via Shiraz to Bushire, or via Kirman to Bandar Abbas, would en tail the crossing of a most inhospitable, unhealthy and waterless region, more to be dreaded indeed than the Bakhtiaris and Lurs. To reach the Persian Gulf by way of these desert wastes would mean many extremely harassing marches.( 3 ) 7 Notes in Intelligence Branch. * Not quite accurate. The water at Bushire is brackish, and steamers fill their tanks in the Shatt-al-Arab; but at Bandar Abbas water fit for drinking purposes can be obtained from shallow wells at Naiband, 2J miles east of the town. And then having reached Bushire or Bandar Abbas might be to find, as arrang ed for by the English, the already poor and sparsely populated country a veritable desert, incapable of producing a few days’ supplies for even one battalion. Both at Bushire and Bandar Abbas the water is bad and so scarce that it is brought in boats from springs at the mouth of the Euphrates.* 21. Bushire is an inconvenient port, boats having to lie some 1J geographical miles off the shore. On the other hand, Bandar Abbas is a convenient harbour with good anchorage. Moreover, it is of some strategic value, being well situated and easily fortified so as to prevent any undesirable boat from entering the Persian Gulf through the nar row Straits of Ormuz. 22. With Khuzistan in our grip the drawbacks mentioned above disappear. The resources of the country would enable us to consolidate and maintain our posi tion. There are two routes from Baghdad, and one 23. It is evident that as regards OUr line from Kut-ai-Amarah, which cross the Pusht-i- 0 f operations from Khurramabad to Shush- Kuh - tar, our flank is exposed from the direction of Pusht-i-Kuh ; hence it would be necessary to occupy this region with a detached force and secure our right flank. * * * * G.
