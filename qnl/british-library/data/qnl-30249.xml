September 1913, from the Hon’ble Lieut. Col. J. Hamnay, « C.E.I., C.I.K., Ap;ent to the Governor General in alu- chietan, to the Kon'hle Lieut. Col. Sir Henry Uclahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I am writing to ask v/hether the Government of 'y India would have any objection to the re-opening of the euestion of the rendition of Gwadar by Maskat to Kalat. The question was raised by me in my confidential letter No. 31 dated January 20th., 1904, and in Russell*s offi cial letter No. 2623-E.A., dated August 15th., 1904, Yate was informed that the Government of India did not propose to take any action in the matter. The question is al most certain to arise in some form in connection with a railway or the discovery of mineral oil near Gwadar, or both, for the boundaries of the Naskat enclave. on northern shore of the Gulf of Oman have never been deter- r\ mined, and the opinions of the parties as to their posi tion differ widely. It appears to me that it would be &gt; N far simpler to arrange, if possible, ^for_Jn_!e renditi^i ^ the tract, than to tackle the thorny question of 8 . dis^ pu^ed boundary, and though eastern prejudice against the 9 ' cession of territory is strong, there are circumstances in the case of Gwadar which should, I think, incline the Sultan to consider favourably its rendition for a con- Z • sideration. I do not believe that our Engagement of 1662 with France regarding the independence of ...asKnt y i*i way precludes the raising of this question, for I cannot find Gwadar mentioned by name in any public document as LTinfeegral part of the Sultan's dominions. If *e can 8 rrange for the rendition of Gwadar, we will try to get the document v/orded to read that the Sultan is returning to Kalat what has always belonged to it, and not that he3 r-v r\ y n is disposing of whist- ns.s Jiityisi'to formed sn iniegrtij. portion of ITaskat territory. I do not propose to trouble the Government of India in this matter until I can submit definite propo sals acceptable both to the Sultan of T/askat and to the Khan of Kalat. All that I require at present is per mission to open the question with a view to ascertaining, 7 ; through the Political Agents concerned, or otherwise, on . _ _ -%■» ■» J X ^ **.-« x-» 4^^ ■v*.rP o V* v a 3 r-v r\ y n— Lsj 3 &amp;, CONFIDENTIAL The Residency Bushire, 1st November 1913 Please refer to Colonel Ramsay’s demi-official 1 otter of 22nd Sep + C *™ 1 '“ = * r ‘ +.r&gt; sir* HAnrv McMahon, in regard to the G which I gave you d I now send yc dated 8 th October question for the t Masqat Major S.G.Knox, C.I.E., Political Agenty demi-of i'icial Copy of a/letter dated 8 tli October 1914, from L.»V.

It is obvious that in view of Saiyid Faisal’s death and the fact that the hold of the Ruler of Oman over the hin terland is threatened by a serious rebellion while our relations with France as regards their treaty with Masqat are still unsettled, the present is not an opportune moment for reopening the question of the rendition of viwadar. I am, however, to request you to iieep the matter in mind should a suitable opportunity for initiating negotiation^/present it self•/ N 4th Arthil 1914, I send to you to save time a copy of a letter written by Ramsay to poor Lorimer. It went to Kirman and has just been returned by his brother. You are probably,from your Kalat experiences, a \ good deal interested in Gwatiftr and will now from the an office confidential files in Masqat hare/opportunity of seeing the Masqat point of view. I think that His Highness will,,‘in spite o f his father^ ffer to plac e himself entirely in our hands in this matter, be very reluctant to give up Gwad&amp;r. At the same time, I think it would be possible perhaps for you very cautiously t to convey the idea, should you think it necessary, thaji Foreign interference in Gwadar would almost certainly lead to its being taken away and ,yhat Saiyid Faisal gave me to understand some months before his death, should be a powerful weapon in our hands. I shall be writing to Ramsay myself and will of course let you Lieut-Colonel R.K.E. Berm, C.I.E. know Political Agent, Masqat r-v■■I ir % &gt; L* know what I send, but you might find time perhaps to let me have a note on the subject giving yours and the Masqat point of view. The best man to give you information with regard to 4 numbered questions of Ramsay’s would be Muhammad R emoo. ( He comes over to Masqat every now and then and is His Highness* Customs farmer. He is registered in Masqat Consulate as a British subject. I shall not be able to answer questions 1, 3 and 4, but will tiy to get hold of 2 and reply to the general letter.

As the Persian Government has ceased to exist in Persian Baluchistan it seems to me that we ought to try and get some hold over the transborder people and I see no means of doing this except by attracting their trade to routes which are under our control? this can no doubt be don© by the expend iture of money and trouble but under present circumstahces this will be ? (one word quite illegible) for the benefit of Masqat for it would be difficult to take the trade away from Gwadur. Is there anything to prevent Foreign nations having treaties with Masqatirrom claiming in Gwad&amp;r all the rights they claim in other parts of Masqat territory? If not j very awkward questions for us might arise at any time. I should have liked to have been able 'to discuss the question fully with you before writing to Government but I must now do just the best I can. It would however help me if you could answer my question above and if you could kinoly send me any available documents. 1 . showing the trade of Gwadur for three years. 2. Ditto. ditto.

The present farmer pays Rs 60,000 annually to His Highness, so that this amount minus cost to His ^ighness of administration of Gwadar (Rs 6,000 approximately) represents the present annual value of Gwadar to His Highness = Hs 54.000. It must of xhm course be worth considerably more than the above sum, for the farmer must make his profit. Two years ago the late Sultan is said to have goffered 70,000 for the contract, but refused it as he did not wish to deprive the present man, Muhammad Remu, of it. I doubt myself if the Sultan gets much more than the last figure out of Gwadar but he will probably setj^ a high sonti- mehtal value on it and I rather imagine that his thoughts occasionally turn to it as a possible fearbour of refuge when Arab rebels and Foreign Powers get too much for him. Ramsay asks M Is there anything to prevent Foreign nations, having Treaties with Masqat, from claiming in Gwadar all the rights they claim in other parts of Masqat territory'? France is the only Power that in this particular gives us any trouble. Individual traders are a nuisance and France herself annoys us on principle with a view to making a satisfactory exchange of her 'power to tease' for more subs tantial benefits elsewhere. I can hardly imagine her playing the same game at Gwadar. It is too hemmed in and she would be afraid there of England taking charge. She would be powerless to prevent it and it would be obvious to the Sultan that this had been the result of French folly and she would lose ground with him at Masqat. BennBenn thinks Sultan would be not unwilling to consider question of lease or rendition. I am not so certain once we cane to the point. Another thing is that, whereas if Prance got to interfering in Gwadar, we could probably turn the question of lease or rendition in our favour, while she stands aloof, she might give us some trouble as protesting that our action was contrary to that agreement of 1862 between Great Britain and France to respect the indepdence of Masqat. s*s We used that with some effect when the Sultan was ready to * lease France Bandar Jissah and she will not be slow £o retaliate ' &gt; 'CQNFiDai-rriAL British Consulate anA Political Agency Muscat 87th April 102O« 7^0 (&gt;( Froa ,}r&lt;A aXa *W1.0 Ji»8Cl # X • • S • Political Agent ani H.B.M'fl Con»ul, Muacat Ta Tne Deputy Political Reaident, Buahlre. Sir I have the honour to invite your attention to the question of the statue of Qwalar and of the present situation there as reported to me. Gwaiar is a small town with what is for the Melcran coast a good harbour # in the territories of the Khan of Kalat, but owned by and foralng part of the territories of, the Sultan of Muscat. The boundaries between Kalat state tan and xexaxxtamtxaxaatijcxiaRuataadx the possessions of the Sultan of Muscat have never been exactly demarcated but they seem to be fairly we4l known and never to have formed the basis of serioua dispute. A very fair volume of trade for the interior passes through Crwaiar, and there is large colony of British Indian subjects both Kheja and Hindu resident there. The Sultan's government and effective authority is represented by a Wall and seventeen 'asker'. The actual authority is in the hands of one Mohamed Reaoo, an Aghakhani Khoja and formerly the Sultan's director of customs in Muscat, to whom the customs have been farmed by the Sultan. This man is a resident of Gwadar, the agent of the B.I•Company f&gt;r the Mekran coast ports and the chief merchant in the place. He is also the 'wazlr' of the Agha Khan for the Persian Gulf. He is a Britieh subject. Under the terms of the loan the control of the customs in Gwaiar and Dhofar is especially exempted and the director of customs for Muscat and Oman has no authority tuere. The4 reason f &gt;r thiB is that tne Sultan’s privy purse as far as the revenues of Muscat and Oiaan are concerned 1 b strictly controlled. His ilea was to retain Gwadar and in a lesser decree Dhofar as private estates on which he could draw at will. The former he left in the hands of Remoo who had been hia chief creditor in Muscat. The revenues of Gwadar are ne longer paid into the state treasury # they are net even farmed for a definite sum per year. The Sultan simply draws cheques on Reaoo who honours them at his ewn discretion, and in return Reraoo does what he likes with the Gwadar customs and rules the wall, the British and the Arab subjects as he tnihke fit. The result is not creditable. There are continual aamplak complaints from the British subjects, especially the Hindus whom it is assumed Remoo does not favour. The Wali is power* -less. Law and order seam to be almost nonexistent. It is almost impossible for tne Political A&amp;ent to brin^ any effective pressure to bear, and the Director Persian Gulf Telegraphs is in no better position. The Sultan on representa- -tion in any -articular case instructs the wali. The latter replies with a non-posaumus on the ground that the particular matter concerns the administration of Remoo. The Sultan tied hand and foot to Renoo is then unable to do anything atall. The Sultan wit , hi s somewhat rudimentary ideas of finance seems to have had the theory that the finances of Gwadar in the hands of Remoo were inexhaustible. Reaoo also seems to hav thought that Government would in tha future pay the Sultan’s debts as they had in the past, and tnat in consequence he could with safety involve the Sultan as much as he liked. He has now however been informed that Government will on no account assist anybody who lends to the Sultan to recover a penny. The immediate result of this has been that he has refused the Sultan's latest requests for money.The valueaxadbdbudt** of the revenue# of Gwalar it la difficult tfc eetinmte accurately ae no recorde exiet and in view of the peculiar way in which It la now run it is quite iiapossible to obtain any. In 1*14 it was ascertained that the customs were farmed for Rs.dO^OOQ/- per year* and that had been received for more than tide sum but had been refused as the Sultan was anxious to keep them in tae hands of Reaoo. At present it Is possible that the Sultan receives actually less than Rs. 60,00©/- owin£ to his assumed indebtedness to hemoo. It may at least be assumed tnat tne customs are worth Xukox* Rc.l,00*00/- a year to Romeo kfxxotxom. The possibility of the lease or cession of Owalar by the Sultan of Muscat has on more than one occasion been considered by Government. In l*Cf|t the Government of India owin£ to the position of the town with regard to the arms traffic and the possibility that other powers mi&amp;ht take an interest in the place which was surrounds! by territox? under British control, su^ested that an attempt should be made throu^i the Khan of Kalat to obtain the ceesion of Gwadar on reasonable tems(Secret letter No.159 dated 4/9/02 from the G of I to the S of S for Inila). The Government of India were also of opinion tiiat the An£Lo-Frenoh declaration of 1863 did not present a bar to such a transaction. H.M.G. however negatived the surest! &gt;n on the grounds that it would almost certainly be strongly opposed by the French. At the end of 1913 the question of the possible rendition of Gwadar was again raised over the intention to demarcate the boundary between Gwadar and Kalat. In tills connection the Sultan Sayid Faisal placed the latter of the demarcation of the boundary entirely in the hands of the British government. Sx Owin w to 3ayid Faisal's death soon afterwards and the fact that our relations with Prance as regards the treaty were still unsettled the question was # dropped. It was however raised the next year again by the A.G.G. in B&amp;luohistan, but again seems to have been shelved.The reason* wlilch froro 'the JIuscat point of view m&amp;'Xq previously the oession or renlltlon of Gwaiar lesirabl* are no longer operative, hut In their place ha* arisen an entirely new set of circumstances which ,1 venture to *Ujj&amp;est # makes tue o^Hsion of Gwaiar by the Sultan vary desirable* The reasons which may make the acquisition of Gwalar desirable by Baluchistan throu£xi tae Khan of Kalat are beyond my purview, but presuaabf they are still cogent now* The reasons from the Muscat point of view ar#;- (I) The control of Gwadar by Muscat is ineffective and the cause of frequent complaint and friction. {») The situation by which the Sultan uses an Important possession In the British sphere as a private estate when the only income is of an essentially administrative kind, namely customs, and hands over this possession to the complete control of an Indian merchant who shamelessly loots him, is not one which we should ll&amp;htly tolerate* (J) The Sultan ha* openly stated to Government ills wish to abdicate provided he should be allowed a certain income in India. Provided hb is even only moderately compensated for Gwadar he is therefore not likely to place obstacles in our wgy as regards the possible rendition of the town on the grount4)that such action interferes with his IndepeAdenco* (4) Government have lately taken in hand seriously the reform of the administration in Muscat itself, and have clear* off the Sultan's debts by a loan. This naturally handicaps the state, as though there is every reason to suppose that the state will be able to repay the loan without difficulty, yet with the necessarily limited sources of income it Is very difficult for the state to undertake certain necessary works and reforms without which real progress cannot be made* (5) The fact that Remoo has not supplied the Buitan with all the money the latter hoped he v/ould will make the Sultan far more inclined to look at any offer from us* It is clear that any action on the Gwsdarquestion by us bust, depend on our attitude towards the Sultan on the question of ids abdication, and the present attitude of the French sovermaent towards Muscat affairs. The former has been male the subject of a separate communication by me. I would however in any case arJke the following proposals. (l) the Sultan of Muscat Sayid Teiraur should be a pywama^ approached, in whatever way the Oovermaent of India should t dnk fit on the subject of the rendition of Gwatar. (3) A price should be offered for the place cash down in the neighbourhood of six lakhs of rupees# The price proposed by the Government of India in the correspondenoo above quoted was four and a half lakhs. (3) Of this price if accepted one lakh should be paid to tue Sulatn himself in the event of his abdication being agreed to by government, and the remainder should be paid in% the state treasury. Till# would form an excellent fund for finane 'ng various essentidl undertakings. There is no doubt that t the present moment the possession of Gwadar is a disadvantage rather tnsn an advantage to the state of Muscat. At the same time it is rapidly becoming as far as the Sultan’s own pocket is concem_- -ed considerably lees profitable than he had originally hoped# There are therefore reasoanable grounds for supposing that he may view a proposal to cede Gwadar in a not unfavourable light# Should therefore the Govmm.oent of India still hold the view that the cession of Gwad&amp;r is desirable, the present is a suitable time fbr opening the negotiations.

V/ith reference to your demi-official letter iJo.289-S. dated the 16th October 1921, I am deaired to aay that it haa been decided not to proceed v/ith the queation. The Sul oan of Maakat has signified hia intention to include Gwadurin the Maakat cusoOras control, and thia aolved the problem from the Maakat point of view since it would greatly increase the revenue of the State and do away with the regime of Mohammed Remoo. The sale ol* rendition of Gwadur thus became unnecessary from the point of view of Maakat and it would be difficult to ma^e out a case on the sole ground of resultant benefit to the Kalat State. It was indeed the essence of the case to ahow first and foremoat that benefit would acqlj^e to Maskat from the rendition, and,fai 1 inf^this, it was feared that any attempt to press the nauter would only be classed as another instance^ of land-grabbing on the cart of the British Government.J .'I'lUWMR! 1 ! m T' / CONFIDENTIAL.

Status of Gwadur• X forward herewith for the orders of the Government of India a copy of a communication received from the Political Apent, Kalat, regarding the rights of His Highness the I han of Kalat and the Gitchkis in the port and revenues respectively of Gwadur. 2 . It will be seen from Colonel Keyes’ letter that His Highness’ claim is based on the ground that Mir Nasir Khan the Great, gave the port of Gwadur to Sultan Said as maintenance, only until such time as he could regain his own kingdom; while the Gitchkis contend that the Khan of Ialat only alienated hie own share of the Gwadur Revenues and that they are entitled to half of them less a deduction for cost of collection. 3. As mentioned in Colonel Keyes* letter the question has been before the Government of India on several occasions and as lately as 1920 the rendition of Gwadur to Kalat was urged in the interests of Muscat State; but owing to a subsequent change of circumstances the proposal was dropped. 4. In 1903 however at the instance of His Highness the Ilian, the status of Gwadur and the origin of the grant to Muscat were exhaustively examined by this Administration and the claims of the Kalat Durbar were put before the Government of India in Major (now Sir John) Ramsay’s letter No.31, dated the 20th January 1904, together with such documentary and other evidence as it had been found possible to obtain in support of them. In reply this Administration was informed that the Government of India did not at that time propose to take any action in the matter. Colonel Keyes informs me that no further informationinformation has since b^en obtained regarding the terms on which Gwadur was assigned to Sultan Said* and that His Highness bases his claim on the same grounds as were placed before the Government of India by Sir John Ramsay. It is unnecessary therefore for me to add anything to what he has already written. 5. It is possible that international or other difficulties may have rendered the consideration of these claims inopportune at that time, but as mentioned by Sir John Ramsay the evidence which has been obtained constitutes at any rate, a strong prlma facie case in support of the Ilian’s contention. I trust therefore that recent changes in the political situation will permit of the case being considered on its merits. Should it be ultimately decided that the Kalat Durbar have established their claims to Gwadur, it will not be necessary to consider the claims of the Gitchkis, since they will have to settle the matter with their own suzerain. If however, for any reason the Kalat claim is held to be inadmissible I would request that the Gitchkis* claims may receive consideration, and that I may be informed in due course of the decision of the Government of India in respect of it. Copy of a confidential letter No.3761, dated Mastung, the 3rd September 1926, from the Political Agent, Kalat, to the Secretary to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, Quetta. Status of Gwadur. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the rights of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in Gwadur. I do not think that the raising of this question by His Highness the Khan of Kalat and the Gitchkis has any direct connection with the matter of 'Sung' in the Dasht District of Makranr \ Makran which has recently been raised by the Muscat authorities. I believe that the question has been brought to the fore by the rerularization of the Makran revenues and the watchfulness which the Gitchkis consequently exercise on the Pasni customs. The death of Sarfaraz Fhan has also caused the Gitchkis to examine the ancient shares of revenues. 2. The Gitchkis, who were assembled in Kalat for Jirgas last month, had made a formal request for the half share of the Gwadur customs which they used to receive and His Hiphness the Khan, whom the Gitchkis also approached, has requested me to obtain the recognition of his sovereignty over Gwadur. 3. They base their claim on the rounds that Mir Nasir Khan the Great permitted Sultan Said, who had been driven out of Muscat, to live in Gwadur and enjoy the i'han^s share of the revenues thereof until he regained his own kingdom. They state that, affter returning to Muscat, the Sultan retained Gwadur and continued to enjoy the Khan’s share of the revenues, but paid the Gitchkis their share for a considerable time. The Gitchkis have maintained ever since our officers first began to make enquiries in Makran that the Gwadur revenues which amounted to about 7,000 dollars, were divided as follows:- To the Gitchkis 3,000, to the Sultan of Muscat 3,000 while 1,000 was allotted to the expenses of collection. They state that they have san&amp;da to prove that payments were made by Sultan of Muscat to Gitchkis upto the recent times. This statement is supported by a report from Major Ross, who, in 1868 found Bibi Miriam, a lady of Buledi origin, but married to a Gitchki, living, as he believed, on the charity of the Sultan of Muscat, but, as the Gitchkis state, on her share of Gwadur revenues. The Khan’s evidence as to payments of tribute by the Sultan is more recent. Slaves preeenced to Khan Khudadad by the Sultan were alive in 1903. 4. The purchase of Gwadur by His Highness the Khan was sugrested in 1902 by the Government of India as a solution of certain difficulties, and in the course of the enquiry the claims of His Highness the Khan and the Gitchkis came to light. 3 &gt; ^ Theirc ^3 c. Their claim was presented to the Government of India by the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in his 31 of 20th January l904 f but f apparently, the acquisition of Gwadur by Kalat no longer interested the Government of India, and the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General was informed (26^33- S*A« of 15th August 1904) that the Government of India did not propose to take any action with regard to its rendition. No opinion was given as to the claims of the Gltchkis or the i-han. The matter was again raised in 1920 by the Resident in the Persian Gulf who considered that the acquisition of Gwadur by Kalat was very desirable from the Muscat point of view (897 of 27th April 1920). The Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General again favoured the proposal, but the Government of India decided not to proceed with the question. 5, On both these occasions the decision of Government appears to have been arrived at on grounds connected v/ith Muscat policy, and the claims of the Khan of Kalat and of the Gitchkis have never been answered. 6. I am unaware as to whether the State of affairs In Xuscat permits the question being raised but trust that the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General will consider that the Gitchkis * are entitled to a reply to their claim to a half share of the Gwadur customs. As regards His Highness the Khan, his memory is still excellent and his natural shrewdness is unimpaired. He has, ever since enquiries were instituted in 1902, claimed sovereignty over Gwadur, and now considers that the Gitchkis* claim is so good that his own claim must gain force from being attached to it. I have the honour to request that I may be furnished with the decision of the Government of India to convey to His HighnessConf IdeatiaX 2 ^ Ao* 'From To folitleal Agency and H«A.M v a Consulate, ttuseat 10th joaroh 1027 • Major G.

It was then contended by the Ruler of Kalat that the town and port of Owadur had been lent to ^alyld Hultan, the Imam of Muscat about the middle of the eighteenth oentury to enable him to quell an insurrection in some of his territories on the coast to tfce weet- ~ward,after which it was to be restored to its owner; but that the then Khan dying and the country falling into a state of anarch; the sueeessors of Salyld Sultan had token advantage of those olr* •etnastaneee to retain posseselon of uwadur. In hie official report no.9 dated 3rd of June 1861,the Revd.G.x'. Badger states that the xainHCt moot probable account of the manner in which Gwadur fell into the hands of salyld Sultan was given him by an old Belooehee Chief at Muscat whose relatives had been in the servloe of the Imam for several generations and whose narratlv of facts correspond-generally with the native chronicles of these times. He stated that Saiyid Sultan, the fifth but the bravest son of Imam Ahmed,the first of the reigning Muscat dynasty,having rebelled against his fathe^ repaired to the Khan of Rhelat and sought his aid in dethroning him. The Khan,wlshlng to have a friendly power possessed of a naval force to protect his coast,and foreseeing that Sultan would eventually succeed to the Muscat sovereignty,so far volunteered him assistance as to give him in perpetuity the town and port of Gwadur,the only attached condition being that he should always defend the place against the enemies of Khelat. Considering the unimportance of Gwadur at the time and the Mian’s inability from want of ships to guard it from attack,the Revd.

In 1920,when the sJtate was In financial difi icultiee one of ny predeoeaaore again raised the question of the sale of Owadur as a solution of these difficulties. I would point out that Kusoat Is an Independent ao- -vereign State so that the question cannot be decided by the OoTemnent of India as paramount power In the sane way as slnilar questions arising amongst tpe Satire States of India* It would presumably hare to be submitted to the League of nations for arbitration under International Law.hy the general law of nations and Immemorial usage a peaceable and uncon tented possession of more than half a century would appear to constitute a strong presumption of right by prescription. (Vfharton's International Law 3rd edition 1889 ^J168). I subsalt that the possession of Owadur by Tuaoat since 1792 constitutes a very strong tlUe by prescription which would be hard to shake wren thought payments may hare been naSax extracted from the State at odd times during the first half of the last century by means of expeditions and threats. ij J hajor.

The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bu shire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No. C/198 dated the 25th July 1939. 2 * At His Highness^ request I went to Qantab to see him 0 n Saturday July 29th returning to Muscat on the morning of July 30th. I had a long interview with His Highness on the morning of the 29th and several private conversations at various times later in the day and again on the morning of the 30th of July. 3# After dealing with various minor problems which form the subject of separate communications to you such as the appointment of a Jemadar from the Indian Army to the Levy and the request for a skilled and energetic man from India as ! Secretary to the Biladiya, His Highness asked me for my opinion regarding the restoration of the Arms Subsidy and if I thought that his request would be granted. I replied that I was not in a position to express any opinion on the subject. His Highness then referred to the various arguments that he has already pu t f orward from time to time and said that the tinancial position of the State was causing him considerable / concern2 concern and that he hoped that hearing in mind his obvious need the Government of India would see their way to assisting him. I mentioned here that his financial position as shown by the statements that were received by us showed that the finances of the State were better than they had been and that the budget was being balanced. He stated that this was so but that there was nothing to spare for improvements and unforeseen expenses nor was there a margin from which to meet a serious reduction in revenue. He also stated that his rese rves were inadequate. I said that I had examined the last statement that he had sent to the Consulate but that I could not remember the actual figures. His Highness then said . 1 that his reserve was about two lakhs. That the figures in the statement did show a balanced budget and that they were accurate as a reference to his bank passbook which he kept himself would show. His Highness stated that he was endeavouring to regain control of Oman and thereby become ruler of the whole of his State. He worked and hoped for the reunion under one rui..r of Muscat and Oman. He had been extending his influence with the sheikhs of the interior and had been spend ing his own private funds to aug ment the budget allotment for presents. The method that he was employing to attain his object was by making contacts with the tribal leaders and in some cases alio ting to them monthly stipends. The only other way to regain control of the country was by force which was not only expensive but left enmity and bitterness which took years to overcome. He had thought that by peaceful means alone ne would be able to carry out his plan successfully but that now he had come to the conclusion that he must have force as well as funds. He anticipated that he would require a / forceforce (permanent) of 1)000 men to reassert his authority and maintain control* He did not think that it would be necessary to make use of this force in warlike operations against his tribes as its monil. effect would probably be sufficient. His Highness said that he had nothing to spare for social work in the towns of Muscat and Matrah. He could not undertake necessary Public Health measures* He was unable to carry out any scheme for a closer control of the Customs as he had no capital- In fact he was unable to develop his country way in any/owing to his lack of funds. 6* His sole reserve amounted to only two lakhs of rupees. A very inadequate sum considering the size of the country and the possibility of unforeseen expenditure occurring at any time. Once these two lakhs were exhausted he would be bankrupt. 7 . His Highness said that he was working single handed as he had no one he could rely upon. That he had no one who was capable of independent action or who could work without continual supervision. He was doing his best but he found that the constant effort to balance his budget and his financia inability to carry out necessary works very disheartening. 8. His Highness went on to say that he had thought of every possible way to raise the necessary funds for his purposes but he could only see one possible course of action. &lt; He was loath to mention his intention but it had come to the point where he must either obtain financial assistance to carry out his ideas or give everything up and retire to Dhofar and let Muscat carry on as best as it could while he occupied himself with improving the Dhofar province or else follow his lather s example and abdicate. His Highness then asked me whether I thought that the Government of India / would lease mmwould lease Gwadur from him or if they were not prepared to do that would they be prepared to accord him financial assistance if he ceded Gwadur to them. In other words sold Gwadur. I said that I was really unable to express any views of the subject but that I would seek your advice. His Highness pressed me for my personal opinion but I told him that I had no idea of the value of Gwadur to the Government of India or if it was of any value to them at all and could not possibly therefore give an opinion. s. His Highness thought that the ceding of Gwadur would cause some comment in the interior but not sufficient to materially affect his prestige. He felt that it was a question ox Gwadur or Cman and Oman was the more important. 10. On more than one occasion His Highness remarked that he was tired of the present state of affairs and that if iiuiauc.ai assistance was not forthcoming he would leave matters to sought themselves out. If he had had a son he said that \ the position would be different. If he did leave he had no idea who would follow in hie footsteps. Saiyid Nadr was no longer well and the other members of the family would not unite in favour of any one individual. He ended up by hinting that .:xu Majesty's Government would have to solve the problem. 11. The situation as I see it is that the Sultan has come to the conclusion that to carry out his political plans in regard to Oman he must have force as well as money. The finances of the State are not sound. The State has not an «aequate reserve and I believe that payment of daily and mon thly commitments from the Treasury for the ordinary working of the Government depends on whether sufficient revenue has been collected. Up to date there hae been sufficient revenue but it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Sultan / cannot obtain—cannot obtain any financial assistance from the State towards the cost of the force he hopes to raise. He has been using the income he derives from the Oil Concessions to meet the bill for gifts and stipends to tribal chiefs but I am inclined to think that he is unwilling to continue spending this money unless he is convinced that his ambitions will be realised. I suspect that a fair percentage of the money from the Petroleum Concessions Limited is banked in a private account as an insurance against a rainy day. If he is to continue his policy money must be found. If money is not forthcoming he must abandon his attempt at domination of Oman and be content to continue as di facto ruler of only half his State. He is not content to do this. Either he will find the money ■v and carry out his plan or else he will give up the attest and leave the management of Muscat to other hands and ’ retire to Dhofar or leave the country altogether. He has examined every possible way of raising money and at last has been driven to suggesting the ceding of a part of his State in return for financial assistance. 12. There are three alternative courses of action which I will examine generally. I am not competent to speak with authority on some aspects of the case and the selection of the most advantageous course to be pursued must necessarily follow alter consideration of the many factors involved including the I Anglo-French Agreement (1862) but I wish to record now my views on the position. The alternatives are j- va)«To accede to His Highness's request and make a substantial financial contribution in return for Swadur. (b) .To refuse further financial assistance. (c) .To take over control of the State of Muscat and Oman. His Highness would retain the title and control of the / province of mav*province of Dhofar. In addition he would receive a reasonable stipend from the Muscat revenues. 13. The first of these alternatives means the grant to His Highness of a very considerable sum of money in return for very little. The revenue this year from Gwadur will probably amount to Hs. 70,000 as opposed to Hs. 1,03,000 last year. I am unable to speak on the subject of the value of Gwadur to India or rather to Kalat State but it is clear that the fall in revenue is largely due to the Kalat blockade which should Gwadur revert to Kalat will be removed with a resulting improvement in the revenue. The Sultan considers that the revenue from Oman will compensate him for the loss of Gwadur and will meet the additional expenditure on the maintenance of his standing army of one thousand men. He hopes to further improve his financial position by introducing a customs preventive service to stop evasion of duty. I feel that His Highness is overestimating for I do not consider that the Oman revenue will meet these extra commitments. It may be possible to develop the country and thus increase its revenue but surveys must be made first and a capital sum will be required to meet the cost of development. Years must pass before a return can be expected. I believe that the grant of a large sum of money will be only putting off the crisis for a year or two. 14. The second alternative is to do nothing or rather to refuse financial assistance. The result of this will be that the Sultan will leave Muscat to its fate and will retire to Dhofar. He will have the revenue from the province which is considerable and in addition for three or four years the Rs. 8,000 a month which Petroleum Concessions Limited are paying / Muscat and7 Muscat and Oman will be left to any one who is strong enough to hold them. There will be trouble in Oman and in the Batinah. The Importance to us of Muscat and Oman strategically will no doubt determine the policy which we will adopt. The damage to British Indian commercial interests and the necessity for the protection of British Indian lives and property must be taken into consideration. I feel that we shall have to interfere and at least maintain law and order on the coast and in the principal towns. The adoption of this policy will result in a very unsatisfactory state of affairs which will prove very troublesome and e^ensive. ^h® last alternative is to come to agreement with France and the Sultan and place him in much the same position as the Sultan of Morocco. As long as he is in receipt of a regular income he will be more than happy in Dhofar .. As long as he is the titular head there can be no question of a successor and dynastic rows will be avoided for the time being. Such money as may be necessary to carry on Government will be controlled by us. With careful management and supervision I believe that the financial position can be much inmroved and the that the presence of a squadron of Jloyal Air Force in Muscat or Matrah with a detachment of Indian Troops will be sufficient to maintain security. Operations might and probably would have to be undertaken in the interior but these would be exclusively air operations. Political Officers could do much towards a better understanding with the tribes. The strategic value of Muscat would be much increased and its commercial value would be greatly improved. 16 • 1 apologise for the length of this letter but I / have onlyhave only dealt with the subject very briefly and have not examined the alternative courses of action in any detail* I regret that distance makes consultation so difficult.

The Sultan did not take at all kindly to the proposal. I pressed him to shelve the question for the time being hinting that his inmediate needs would be met by the Subsidy. His answer that the Subsidy was for a specific purpose and his indication that it must be used for that purpose was of course entirely correct, although I am certain that a portion will be diverted into channels which could scarcely be considered legitimate, however careful a watch is kept on the expenditure.

Reference correspondence ending with Express Letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, ho.C/2, dated 6th January 1939. 2. a copy of memorandum 1TO.Z-143/38-IS-668/P.Z., dated the 4th July 1939 from the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General, Resident and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, is forwarded herewith for favour of such comments as you may wish to make. The Government of India agree with the Resident in Baluchistan that the course recommended in paragraph 5 must be rej ected. 3. If Indian Oil Concessions Limited who have already obtained the oil concession in the Mekran area also secure the concession for Gwadur, there would appear to be no immediate necessity for the demarcation of the Gwadur-Kalat boundary. If, however, oil is subsequently found in the vicinity of the supposed boundary or if some other Company obtains the Gwadur concession, it will be necessary to carry out the demarcation regardless of the attitude of the Khan of Kalat. 4. It would be convenient if you could obtain from the Sultan of Muscat particulars of any documents relating to Gwadur which may be in his possession(Cf.Memorandum No. 2327 dated the 18th October 1938 from the Wazir-i-Azam, / Kalat2 Kalat State to the Political Agent in Kalat, a copy of whj.ch ia enclosed) together with a statement of the boundary claimed i by him. A suggestion was previously made by you to thiseffect, vide your D.O.No .0/377 dated the 27th June 1938, but it does not appear that any reply has been sent to you. It may be difficult to obtain any similar statement from the Khan of Kalat in view of the attitude he has taken up, but the Resident in Baluchistan will be asked to approach him on the subject. 5. A copy of this memorandum is being sent to Baluchistan. sd. W.R.HAY. Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. t1 s, Copy of a memorandum No.2327, dated the 18th October 1938, from the Wazir-i-Azam, Kalat State, to the Political Agent, in Kalat, Gwadur Boundaries, Reference correspondence ending with my memorandum No, 2268, dated the 10th instant, 2, Your express letter No,4888 dated the 26th September 1938 shows that the position at Gwadur is at present in a state of such confusion as to require clarifying to enable a correct conclusion to be arrived at. The actual facts as can be gleaned from the different versions and correspondence, printed and otherwise, lead one to believe that Gwadur port -s and its hinterland formed part of the territory which was undeniably included in the borders of the Kalat State and that the income of the port of Gwadur was allowed by the then Khan of Kalat to be enjoyed for his maintenance by a relative of the then Sultan of Muscat, who had left Muscat and come to the court of Kalat as a refugee about the end of the eighteenth century. The practice of the Khans of Kalat has been, and still is, to grant a sanad to the person on whom they bestowed grants of land or jagir showing pretty well the area thus ^ bestowed with a clear indication of the boundaries of such area. This being the case, the Sanad of the then Khan of Kalat conferring the enjoyment of the income of Gwadur to the refugee relative of the Sultan of Muscat must be in possession of the present Sultan and can no doubt be produced by him. This Sanad will not only show the extent of the Kalat territory given as a jagir to the Muscat refugee for his subsistence, but will also show that the concession was given in the same manner as such conceeaions were granted, and are’even now granted, by the rulers of Kalat to their subordinate Sardars and other / personages• 2 - personages. The grant of such concessions did not, and does not, mean that the Khans relinquished their suzerain powers and rights over JkkK the areas, but that on the other hand it always meant that the Khan retained, as they do even now, their suzerainty over them and thus possessed the powers of either allowing, at their discretion, the continuance or discontinuance of the concession. This will show that Gwadur is a jagir granted * by the Khan of Kalat to a refugee of standing from Muscat and is held by Muscat in the same manner as the other jagirs are held by the Kalat Sardars etc. This fact leads to the corollary that at present the question regarding Gwadur is not one between an independent foreign power and the Kalat State, but that it is, without any doubt, one between a principal and his concessionaire, and is a purely domestic affair between the Khan and his jagirdars, be he a Kalat Sardar or any other personage from outside the State. As such, it should as a rule be dealt with by the two parties chiefly concerned and the question of the intervention of the British Government or the Government of India in the caseof / a dispute does not arise. The question at presentunder / consideration merely relates to the demarcation of the boundary of the concession granted by the Khan of Kalat to the Muscat refugee as a jagir and does not at all concern either the proprietary rights or the suzerainty of the Kalat State over Gwadur. The Muscat refugee was, as already stated above, allowed to enjoy the income of Gwadur, which was a small place at that time, and the produce of the surface of the land which was attached to the Port. Kalat being the suzerain power in respect of Gwadur, was and is, like other suzerain powers, fully entitled to the proprietorship, possession and disposal / of-3- 11 disposal of all mines, rivers, hills and forests in the concession and has every right to exercise this prerogative in any manner and at any time they like* It would thus appear that Muscat has no right whatever to enter into negotiations with any body for the exploitation of oil or other minerals in the Gwadur area without the knowledge and express permission of the Khan, who still holds absolute and complete suzerainty over the place, which for purposes of Civil and revenue administration is a part of the territory of the Khan, although administered by a Jagirdar* His Highness the Khan feels very keenly on this question and entertains strong hopes that this aspect of the matter will be brought to the notice of the Government of India and the British Government and that it will receive their full and sympathetic consideration* 3* It may also be mentioned that, as you are aware, the present question of the fixation of boundary is not one affecting the Kalat Durbar only as the Gitchkis of the Kech valley, which is coterminous with the Gwadur concession hold revenue interests in the area outside the concession, any alteration or amendment of the Gwadur boundaries as laid down in the Sanad granted by the Khan of Kalat, which are still very well known to most of the local inhabitants of Kech, will naturally affect the Gitchkis as well and are likely to create troublesome complications*/-V nr Copy of Memorandum No.1141, dated the 12th June 1939 from the Wazir-i-*Azam, Kalat State* to tne Political Agent in Kalat, Mastung. Claim of the Kalat State in respect of GwadurJ^ Kindly refer to your confidential memorandum No.9, dated the 3rd December 1938, in which it is stated that the Government of India are not willing to support the claim of Kalat State to exercise the rights of Sovereignty over the Gwadur area and that these rights as well those of ownership have both lapsed by adverse exercise of them by the Sultan of Muscat* 2. I must say that His Highness the Khan of Kalat is very much disappointed at the reply of the Government of India and its reluctance in recognising the rights of ownership and sovereignty of the Kalat State over Gwadur area. 3 . The single fact that the Sultan of Muscat has been exercis ing his powers over Gwadur area for a long time in the past does not in any way mean that Kalat State has waived its rights of ownership and sovereignty over the said area. In this particular case the position of the Sultan of Muscat is similar to the position of those many persons who hold similar grants but have no title to the rights of ownership or sovereignty. 4. Gwadur is a port of Mekran and it is quite evident that Khan Mir Nasir Khan Azam had, by an act of grace, granted, as Inam, the revenues of Gwadur area to the brother of the Sultan of Muscat who was then a homeless exile, it is totally against the practice of the State that the rights of ownership or of sovereignty should, by lapse of time or otherwise, pass over to the holder of the Inam land. I am directed to make it clear to the Government of India that Kalat State is not at £1 prepared to waive its rights / of mm i mk’a :—. . rf 111*1 - 2 - of ownership or sovereignty over the said area. 5. On the basis of friendly and mutual relations that exist between Kalat State and the Government of India, His Highness would therefore suggest that the Government of India advise the Sultan of Muscat to send his representative to Ifife-bar-i- Kalat for the settlement of this issue. Such a course would foster the mutual and friendly relations between the Government of Kalat and Muscat. It is only after this issue has been finally settled that the question of the settlement of boundaries between Kalat State and the Sultan of Muscat can be taken up.Confidential ■■■■■■■ Copy of Memorandum No•Z-143-658/P.Z. dated Ztarat, the 4th July 1939, from the non’ble the Agent to the Governor General, Resident and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, to the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla* • • • • • Kalat Gwadur Boundary* Reference correspondence ending with External Affairs Department memorandum No.F.256-N/38, dated the 2nd December 1938. 2* The deciaon of the Government of India was communicated to His Highness the Khan, and I forward for the orders of Government a copy of a memorandum No.ll4i, dated the 12th June 1939 from the Wazir-i-Azam Kalat State.

A f V British Consulate-General, BUSHIBB. Dated. Camp, Mi scat• Political Resident’s Note dated the 16th February Gwadur♦ 1940.i I diBOuesed the question of the sale of Gwadur with the Sultan at my interview on the 10th February. I told him that in my opinion he would certainly lose -face’ 1 with his brother Arab rulers, and that I did not see any purjChaser forthcoming who would pay over a sufficient a .cunt to compen sate him for the loss of this port, beyond observing that the income had diminished recently, the Sultan contented ^ himself with non-committal noises, and my impression is that he has no intention whatever of selling the place and has only brought up the question in order to stimulate our interest in subsidies* A copy of this note may be given to Political Agent* sd* C.G*Frior* 16•2*40• Muscat*I discussed the Gwadur question with the Sultan today and said that as the Khan of Kalat had now acceded to Pakistan it was possible that the Pakistan Government would interest themselves in the place. The Sultan said that if the Pakistan Government wanted to carry on 'this Kashmir business in Gwadur' let them do so as his honour would not be affected. The Pakistanis were British subjects. His \ Majesty^ Government had recognised Gwadur as one of his dependencies and the matter would be one for His Majesty^ Government to deal with. I asked him what his attitude would be if Pakistan wished to negotiate for Gwadur and he said that he could not willingly part with any of his dominions, and that in any case His ifajesty^ Government were responsible for his relations with Pakistan so long as it remained within the Commonwealth and he had no direct connection with the Dominion. Copy to PJk. Muscat. (ltd.) Y'.R.H. 3rd April 1948. .1 v. scatI talked to the Sultan at some length about Gwadur today. I explained the situation there and strongly advised him to appoint a capable and intelligent Wall. I said that the best way he could Justify his retention of Gwadur was to introduce an administration there much more efficient than that of the adjoining territory. I said that now that the Khan of Kalat had acceded to Pakistan it would be for the Pakistan Government to enter into negotiations far the return of Gwadur if they desired to do so. X thought that they were too busy to concern themselves with this for the present, but that I considered it probable that if they beoame more firmly established they would eventually take up the Gwadur question on the grounds Cl f that the Sultan's rule was an/one and that gaadur which was inhabited by Baluchis ought to be incorporated with the rest of Baluchistan. 2. The Sultan said that ever since 1945 he had been anxious to improve the administration of Gwadur and that then he had asked for a British administrator but that we had only been able to supply him with an Indian. He would be grateful if we could find him a British administrator now. I suggested that if the British Minister of Foreign Affairs were appointed for Muscat another British Officer could be appointed his assistant for the express purpose of administering Gwadur. 3. The Sultan further said that in 1939 he had suggested leasing Gwadur to His Majesty's Government. He would not mind dealing with His Majesty's Government over the disposal of Gwadur but did not like the idea of handing it over direct to either of the new Dominions. He added that he was ready to be guided by His Majesty's Government's advioe. 4* Copy to F.A. Muscat. 7th April 1948.la££Lkti &amp;MUK QVUE. Dated the 14th April, 1948 I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Muscat dependency, Gwadur• 2# Towards the ere* of the eighteenth century a mt* ; ber oi' the Muscat rallng family was forced to fly the State and took refuge with the Khan of *al*t who conferred upon hliu the port of Cwadur - then a snail fishing village - situated about 60 allies east of the present Indo-lersian border* After a few years the refugee returned to Muscat and became ^ultan, but he and his successors have ever since retained possession of Owadur. Successive Khans of Kalat have laid claim td the place but His Majesty*• Government and the former Government of India always recognised tna ue facto position. 3* The boundary between Gwadur and Kalat wt*»te is not defined* fhe Khan claims that such rights as the Gultan may possess are confined tc Gwadur town while the Sultan claims a large slice of the hinterland. The latter certainly exercises some kind of authority fer a considerable area round Gwadur and in 1946 the Gcvernoert of* India prescribed a presumptive boundary giving Muscat roughly an arc with a 20 miles radius round Gwadur for the guidance of political officers, but no communication was !?u*d© about the boundary to either of the Pulers concerned. It is not known whether the Pakistan Government are in possession of these papers, and even if they are It Is unlikely that they would consider themselves under any obligat ion to observe the boundary decided on. 4* Gwadur itself is a town of about 6C0C inhabitants situated on an istnmus connecting a hammer-headed headland with the mainland. In the area controlled by the Sultan and within the boundary referred to above there are two fishing-villages on the coast containing about 2000 inhabitants between them and a few hamlets inland the population of which varies with the a&amp;our.t of rainfall. The total population -\ of the enclave probably does not exceed 1C # CCC. In Gwadur itself there is a wealthy Agakharl community about 400 strong and some twenty or thirty families of Hindus but apart from this the town and coastal villages are occupied by the :eds, *hc are believed to be the ^ Ichthyophagi of Kerodotus, and low class Baluchis who lead a primitive existence and live mostly on fish and dates. The hamlets in the interior are occupied mostly by Baluchi tribesmen many of whom go to Karacnl to seek employment in years of drought. B. The Sultan administers Gwadur through an Arab V«al 1 or Govern or who has a bodyguard of about thirty -arabs from Muscat. He is usually a man with little experience cf any kind of administration and no knowledge of Urdu or Baluchi. He is forced tc rely largely on two Baluchi headmen in Gwadur whose main concern is to fleece the people. The Agakhanis and Hindus are also aliens who have settled in Gwadur for their own profit and take no interest in the welfare of their neighbours. It is however entirely on them that the prosperity of the place depends. In 1947 the Guitar's Government derived an income cf over 2s lakhs (£.lb.76C) from Gwadur as against an expendit ure of less than half a lakh {£.: ,760). Most of the Income is derived from Customs. Dried fish art exported to Ceylor, shark-fins to China and fish-manure to Europe. Produce of Kalat State such as The Pt. Hon. Ernest levin, r.C., M.p., etc. etc. etc., The Foreign Office, lo&amp;iii /da t '■ $ s. •.d«t«i 9 grain and cotton reach Caadur fro» the Interior while tea. •ugar f rice f plecegoods etc. are i?Rported froas India and fesala* •re is a considerable transit trade much of it of an illicit nature. 6 . In 1946 the Sultan asked the Government of India for the loan of a British administrator for Gwadur. no British officer could be spared but the services of an Indian official from Baluchis- tan were put at the Sultan's disposal. He arrived in Gwadur early In 1947 ana since then he has opened a school in which over ISC boys are studying, and with a great deal of difficulty has ployed a doctor and sanitary inspector who are expected to arrive from India during tne current month. He has endeavoured to introduce a ration ing system but has met with constant opposition from the Wall, the Baluchi headsmen and the Sultan*s Customs official who have been th#lr °' n purposes much of the quotas of cloth and food stuffs allotted to Gwadur. 7. although the people of Gwadur cannot be expected to have any feeling of loyalty towards the Sultan there is little or no internal agitation against his rule* The people as a whole have no political consciousness and in any case are better off than the population of the adjoining parts of fcakran who owing to the maladministration *ftd rapacity of the Khan's officials are reported to be almost starving and to be unable to obtain any cloth* There was a so-called Peform Association at Gwadur consisting of ten or twelve young Baluchis who may have secretly cherished the idea of throwing off the Sultan's rule out this has recently been disbanded owing to a communal incident in which its leader was Involved* Kalat State National Party, which has affiliat ions with the Indian Congress, has the return of Gwadur as one of the planas in its programme. Although with the accession of the Khan to Pakistan this party has presumably lost its influer.ee. local sentiment in the State must generally favour this object* and the Khan had undoubtedly set his mind on It. According to the news papers however the Pakistan Government has now recognised tfakran as a separate State under Nawab Bai Khan. Whatever the upshot of this may be It would seem probable that both the Khan and the Nawab will be too much concerned with the question of the future of Makran as a whole to worry about Gwadur for the present while the Pakistan government are hardly likely to take up the matter on their account owing to their many otner preoccupations. In these circumstances it *.r***expect that the return of Gwadur to Kalat or Hakran will not become a live issue for a year or two at least, and perhaps id . 9.

Kven so the Pakistanis were rrKlsh subjects, His Majesty's Government had recognised Gwadur as one of his dependencies and the matter would be one for His Majesty's Government to deal with. With regard to possible negotiations for the sale ot Gwadu* he reminded me that 1939 he had offered to lease the dependency to Kis Majesty's Government and said that he was still wUling to negotiate regarding it with His Majesty's Government but lid not at all like the idea of handing it over direct to either of the two new dominions. In particular he showed that he had no very high opinion of the Pakistan Government. Finally he said •Ottld be willing tc accept His Majesty's Government's advice. *4 1 on to ® iy ***** * h# **** v«y could justify his retention of Gwalur was to make its administration much better than that o£ the rest of tfekran.
