This proclamation was issued following the 'Fall of Baghdad', a decisive victory for the British during the Mesopotamian Campaign. Maude largely focuses on the various parties (in particular the Turks [Ottomans]) who have previously been involved with the oppression and division of the area and assures the people of Baghdad that the British Government only seeks to improve their situation.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Frederick Stanley Maude</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Mesopotamian Campaign (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000291#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
