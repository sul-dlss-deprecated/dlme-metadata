Stannus attaches a translation of an extract from a letter from the Agent at Sharga, dated 31 March 1824, which reports that a boat belonging to inhabitants of Debay [Dubai] was seized and that seven of her crew were killed. Stannus reports that the part of the coast where the act was committed is dependent on the Government of Bahrein [Bahrain]. He states that he has deemed it his duty to convey to Shaikh Abdoolla Bin Ahmad [Shaikh Abdullah ibn Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah, co-ruler of Bahrain] the necessity of bringing the guilty to immediate punishment. Stannus forwards a translated copy of his letter to Shaikh Abdoolla, in which he offers the assistance of the Company's marine force in inflicting the punishment due to the violators of the treaty [the General Maritime Treaty of 1820]. There is a discrepancy regarding the dates of these letters: Stannus's letter to William Newnham is dated 24 April 1824, while his enclosed letter to the Shaikh of Bahrein is dated 29 April 1824.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x00003f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
