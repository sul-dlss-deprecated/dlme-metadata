Both these traps were included in the list attached to my predecessor’s letter Ho•1445-3/22, dated the 28th May 1936 (serial numbers 2 and 4), and it will be noted that in regard to 'Um Ratal** it was stated that it has been wholly damaged. Subsequently it was reported that it had been damaged only to the extent of two thirds and accordingly two thirds compensation amounting to Ss 2666-10-9 was paid as compensation. ( ’’Damage to fish traps does not necessarily mean constructional damage but may - and usually does mean damage to utility by diversion of currents etc )© 2© The present position is that the owner of these traps is anxious to reconstruct them, and that the Senior Naval Officer has the strongest possible objection to this for service reasons. / In theseIn tih.6S6 circumstances tiie only course open* in ny opinion, is for tiie Aimiralty to provide tile funds required for tiie outrigiit purphase of both traps. In the case of 'Um Ratal* a futther sum of Vs 1333-5-3 will be required (this sum was actually refunded, vide my predecessors No.3137-3/22 dated the 26th November 1936); and for 'Maqsusa* a further sum of Vs 266/- will be needed. 3. Pending final settlement the owner of the traps has been forbidden to reconstruct them, but it is obviously desirable that the matter should be settled without delay. I have the honour to be.

The Treasury have however drawn our attention to case No.22 on the list enclosed with the Political agent’s letter of the 28th May which is peculiar in that compensation is recommended although the aaet- was not damaged. We can find nothing in the papers to account for this recommendation. In authorising the Political Resident to make the payments, would you therefore instruct him to satisfy himself before payment is made for No.22^that the compensation recommended in this case is really justified.

From To Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A,, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre. Sir, Jttfalr Fishtraps. I have the honour to address you on the subject of compensation to be paid to the owners and tenants of fishtraps, which have been damaged by the construction of the Haval pier at Jufair. 2. A plan of a trap is attached. The fish pass it on the incoming tide, enter the ’V* at high water and eventually are forced into the trap by the ebb tide leaving the mouth of the ’V* high and dry. 3. The principle of the payment of compensation ms accepted and was safeguarded by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 1 Isa A! Khalifah, who made a proviso to that end in his letter dated the 16th April 1934 in which he agreed to the estab lishment of the naval facilities at Jufair. 4 # A number of complaints and protests were received from the time that it became known that the pier would be constructed. In order to ascertain and assess the amount of compensation to be paid, the following ■ ? '0 vfollowing (i) (ii) (ill) The Superintendent of the Land Department also attended as he was conversant with the subject (mentioned in paragraph 4(11) above)* 5, As the result of the meeting and of certain further enquiries, made at our Instance, we came to the conclusions set forth below* 6* A statement is enclosed showing the findings of the Expert Committee, as modified in some cases by the Bahrain Government and at the meeting mentioned in paragraph 4(ill) above, and the amounts of compensation which we recommend should be paid to the owners of damaged fishtr&amp;ps* The amount of compensation has been based (except In the cases mentioned in paragraph 7 below) on ten years* rental, which is the usual local custom in purchases of immovable property* 7. Certain of the amounts (under Wos.1,2,4,5 and B) are higher than the reminder* The reason Is that at the time when the land m&amp; acquired for Government, certain owners £Z stion has been taken8- As the result of the correspondence ending with a telegram Ho*931 dated the 30th June 1935 from His Excellency the Haval Commander- in-Chief, the Bahrain Government were requested to issue a notice (in the form usual in such cases) calling upon any owners of fishtraps who considered that their fishtraps had been damaged to submit representations on the subject within one month. A committee of persons with expert knowledge of fishtraps was then appointed by the Bahrain Government to examine the complaints on the spot and to submit a report* On the 22nd April 1936 a meeting was held at the Agency of the Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf (Captain V.S* Butler), the Political Agent (Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch), and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Mr. C* Dalrymple Belgrave)/to consider the report in (ii) above* A iowners (the heirs of the estate of a man recently deceased) of land so bought c vned fishtraps adjacent to their land and made the sale conditional upon the payment of compensa tion for the fishtraps, should they be damaged in the futurd, at the rates fixed by a Committee appointed by the Bahrain Courts for the purpose of making a division of the estate* These rates had been fixed well before there was any question of the purchase of the land by Government* It is, however, fortunate that the prices of fishtraps have since fallen and that the compensation of the other traps can be made at the lower rates now obtaining* 8* It is also necessary, in order to prevent grievances which would react unfavourably on. our position, to pay compensation to the tenants of the fishtraps, who are poor people and have undoubtedly suffered financial loss (a) owing to the building of the pier on their o fishing grounds during the time of their leases (b) owing to the fact that in future they will be unable to rent these sites which are in their neighbourhood and for which it is unlikely that they will be able to get substitutes elsewhere and (c) owing to expenditure on labour and material for the seasonal construction of the trap* The Bahrain Petroleum Company have, moreover, paid compensation to the tenants, as well as the owners, in the case of traps damaged by their pier at Sitrsh, and the people will undoubtedly expect similar treatment at the hands of His Majesty's Government. 9* Only two individuals are entitled to compensation* The Bahrain Government have carefully investigated these two claims and consider that Hs.70/- (Hupees Seventy only) should4 should b© paid to Jumdh bin Hnji * Abdulof Glxmifa tenant of trap AX UBhlmkim and *%*S0/ to Unllah Abdel Hussein bin # Abdullah al (Threfi teimnt of tmp Al Tan&amp;sah* Tbeae mounts appear reasonable* It is desirable that the oompensation to the tenants sliould be paid without delay as they my rmk% a demand t which would not be easy to resist^ for oomptmsation carer the period during which the question has been under consideration* 10 * people* and especially the poor* should have any grievance over losses sustained by the establishment of the naval baas at Bahrain* as any such grievance would afford a wimble handle to mischieibmktra tmd this view Is shared by the denier H&amp;ml Officer and the Adviser to 'the Bahrain Oovemment* X hope* therefore, 'that you will feel able to recoeriena to His l&amp;J#sty f 8 Oovexnment these proposal© which Imve been framed with great cai*e and consideration for mommy* 11* A copy of this despatch is being given to the Senior Hava!

Having seen the interest taken in Jufair by Kaval Commanders-in-Chief and Senior Naval Officers, coupled with the fact that it does not appear to be suited to the air, intelli gent people guessed that Jufair was probably for the Navy, do not think that local knowledge goes further than this and X doobt if people are now much interested.

Sir, I am directed to reier to your letter g.lloOo dated 6th February,1935, and to previous correspondence on the above subject, and to state that it has been agreed, on representations being made by the India Office, that correspondence in regard to Government land at Bahrein should in future be conducted solely through the India Office ana the Kesident. I am to say that this course in no way prevents you from sending to the Resident copies of correspondence you address to the Air Ministry and this Department will continue to forward to you copies of all correspondence they address to the India Office on the subject. Thus the only difference from the existing procedure is that the Resident must now await instructions from the India Office beiore taking an:/ official action required of him in a matter that involves £ha sanction Admiralty or Air Ministry - a procedure that appears desirable in order to avoid risk of confusion if orders are issued ana replies received through quite different channels.

By this I mean that the Air Officer Commanding, in putting forward a^ proposal for some action to be taken at Bahrein should first write to the Air Ministry, who would then approach you, and you the Resident, but at the same, time the Air Officer Commanding should have permission to send a copy of his letter to the Resident at Busnire so that no time would be lost in initiating action when the official instructions come through from you to him. /tTcs- . &lt;3 .

Subsequently I wrote the Air Officer Common ing again on the 7th November and I ought to have sent a copy of this letter to you. This I do now with apologies for the oversight. I am also now forwarding to you a copy of a letter we have just received from the Air Officer Commanding in reply to the above mentioned two letters, and to Air Ministry telegram X.794 of 6th November, a copy of which was sent to you. In regard to Laithwaite’s letter of the 19th February I see no objection to his proposal that all correspondence in regard to Government land at Bahrein should, in future, be conducted solely through the India Office and the Resident, provided that copies of such correspondence are circulated with the same freedom between the interested parties as now. By that, I mean that should, say, the Chief Engineer of the Iran Command, wish to have some action taken on our property at Bahrein, the official channel would be the Air Officer Commanding - Air Ministry - India Office - Resident Bushire - Political Agent,Bahrein, but at the same time he herald be entitled to forward a copy of his letter to either the Resident, Bushire, or the Political Agent at Bahrein. latter could then take any preparatory action re&lt; l ui ^® d , so . on receipt of the official instructions no time would be lost. lA.Seal, Esq., Admiralty, 3. # . 1 •/ # COPY mm S.11080* Air Headquarters, British Forces In Iraq.

As regards Major Papworth f s remarks about obtaining copies of the titled eeds, we note that in your letter P.Z.3297/34 of the 22nd May 1934, you informed the Political Resident that the deeds, after they have been checked, should Jj| be reproduced f or r ecord by a photographic or other process, and the originals deposited at the India Office. The Admiralty would like to b e furnished with translations when available of t he deeds relating to the t wo Admiralty areas. 3. We also note that Major Papworth has suggested that Bahrein Government should be asked to grant the strap of land separating the two Admiralty areas.

Mr. Belgrave had Been invited, through the India Offi to Visit the Admiralty with a view to giving additional , + + rv-r flptfiil in connection with the land information on matters ox aexaix m purchased at Bahrein £&gt; r the Admiralty. He sxated that complete secrecy had Been preserved about the land having been acquired for the Admiralty, tte local belief being that it had beai obtained for the Air Ministry, and that the latter propose to give up Basra and Baghdad and move to Bahrein! ' Ashed as to the nature of the land acquired Mr.Belgrave stated that in the n,in it consisted of open or common land „ -io-uncr of houses surrounded with enclosures here and there consistxng n lv at &gt; eaki ng no physical boundaries existed, by gardens; generally speahi g nTV . r0 te t w recently caused a number of concrete bu„ his Government had lana acquired. .o ' tlnl,K *“ 1 “ p „ i.e. equivalent to an The Admiralty’s title was a s ^ ^ ^^ference with the English freehold, and there^^ ^ ^ (who unaer Admiralty’s possession. ^ 000 ao r es for their prospecting license could take u ^ to ld their oil field) wanted the Admiral y fore available and was net that that area had been so lfflpr obable however to them. Mr. Belgrave considered that••* [0 I 1 !;hat the Oil Company would want to extend their operations so Par North- They already had some 7 or 8 wells in action ibout the centre of Bahrein Island, and had actually commenced snipping oil to Japan. These wells^ere connected by pipe line to tanks on Sitrah Island, which had been connected to the main Island by a bridge; here also they had constructed a Jetty, with an oil pipe line out to deep water. A tarred motor road had been built from the wells to Sitrah and another to Manamah. Asked whether the Bahrein Government would endeavour to dispose of oil concessions over their remaining territory after the Bahrein Oil Company had taken up their 100,000 acres, Mr. Belgrave replied that in hxs opinion it would be impracticable to have two Companies operating, but mentioned that the Bahrein Oil Company had some time ago endeavoured to negotiate for rights over tbe remaining area. Those negotiator* had fallen through on the guestion of price, but there were again indications that the Company wish to acauire rights.

No dredgers capable of dealing with the coral were available at Bahrein. Local buildings were usually built with walte of etone won from the foreshore or seabed, with flat roofs constructed on shuttering of cement and plaster. Practically all timber was imported from India and Persia ard was expensive; fittings and ironmongery have to be imported. Piers or jetties would be of solid construction with facings of the harder kind of coral and fillings of spongy coral. There would be no difficulty in building this class of jetty by native labour. Underwater work would be done by nati ve divers without dress or any special apparatus.

Mr. Belgrave’s attention was called to the statement in the correspondence that some of the land acquired had been taken in the absence of the owners; he stated that the owners had been communicated with by correspondence and the transaction was quite in order. The areas in question, however, were i bought on Air Ministry and not Admiralty account. Translations of the deeds of the Admiralty land and copies of the plans pasted on the hacks of the deeds will be . furnished to the Admiralty through the India Government. The mosque situated in the centre of the Admiralty land has not been purchased. A strip for access had been provided for in acquiring the surrounding land; this will shewn quite clearly in the plans illustrating the deeds. As to the suggestion that the Admiralty should make a small payment towards the upkeep of the Mosque for itS by the Admiral iy'a Mohammedan personnel, Mr. Belgrav. e.

In any case, allof way have been extinguished by the acquisition. Ask©d whether the arrangement for the previous owners to remain in occupation of their houses and gardens until these were requi^ ed ^ t* 16 Admiralty would entail any risk of squatters’ titles being created against the Admiralty, Mr* Bel grave thought not, but stated that in Bahrein law a squatter’s title could b® acquired in ten years, and suggested that to avoid any future difficulty the Admiralty might grant tenancy agreements to the former Owners at nominal rents of say an anna per annum on monthly, quarterly or other terms. Mr. Belgrave explained that he could arrange the tenancy agreements if asked to do so by the Political Agent, without in any way revealing that the Admiralty were interested. He saw no reason for doing this through the Air Ministry. r&gt;«farance was made to a recent newspaper statement 4 lavine claim to the Bahrein Islands: that Persia was laying cxuim + that Persia had been doing this at Mr* Belgrave stated that rei&amp;x ^ + inn vears. and had been again intervals for the @ st 100 years, stimulated to make the claim by the discovery o Government. and Ur.

As the political Agent points out, the estimates were drawn up under rather difficult conditions and while the excess is not inconsiderable it is, we think, understandable in the circumstance s. 4o 3o far as I can see the whole of the excess is debitable to the Admiralty. The extra piece of ground (Rs.3,300) dovetails in with the areas which die political Agent was authorised to acquire on their hehalf. The excess expenditure of Hs.14,231 appears also, so far as can he judged from the papers, to he wholly m respect of properties within the Admiralty area, for, as you will see from the statement appended to fee Political Agent's despatch, the expenditure in respect of land acquired in nudhaihiyah and Muharraq (for Air Force purposes) amounts to RS. 131,000, being tne original estimate, c,nu ihe additional expenditure is wholly in respect of acquisitions in Jufair. 5// 5.

My dear McClaughry, I enclose a copy of a letter sent to Powell of ■the Admiralty, on the subject of the cost etc. of the land recently acquired for naval and air purposes at Bahrein. You will see that the Political Agent, in his report to the Resident, suggests (paragraph 11) that at some convenient date in the near future an officer of the r.A.F. with a knowledge of surveying should be deputed to go over the title deeds with a representative oi the Bahrein Government to check the deeds and also to see whether the boundary pillars put up by the Bahrein Government are sufficient and to arrange for tneir upkeep. If the Admiralty see no objection we would agree, subject to any further comments that may be received from the Resident, that the officer in question should simultaneously deal with the Jufair land. Do you agree? If so, will you send the necessary instructions to the A.O.C./ Wing Coimander W.A. ^laughry &gt; D&gt;p(C( Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C. 2.A*0«G. and let us know, so that we can inform the authorities in the Gulf? 2 agree also with the suggestion in paragraph 15 of Loch’s despatch that when the deeds have been checked they should he reproduced for record hy photographic or other process.

The development of the Bahrein petroleum Company’s concession ana the possibility that we may find difficulty in retaining our existing naval facilities at Henjam, have made it necessary to consider the purchase of certain areas of land as an insurance at Bahrein. Treasury approval has now been given for the purchase of coy^a^ areas selected by the Naval C-in-C and the A.Q.C., Iraq, respectively, at an estimated total cost of Rs. 178,500. The whole cost of acquisition will be borne by H.M.G.

Z. 1 M.03641/33 nn U o 1933 ^Llth Dec ember Sir With reference to recent semi official discussions as to the purchase of^laad at Bahrein, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners 5f the Admiralty to infite attention to the Memorandum No ♦MS (li) 29 recently circulated by the First Lord of the Admiralty to the standing Ministerial Sub-committee of the C # I.D, for questions concerning the Middle East, also to the Minutes of the 5th Meeting of that Committee held on the 28th NoTember* 2. In paragraph 3 on page 4 of the Memorandum the desirability was pointed out of purchasing as soon as possible land at Bahrein which could, if necessary, be developed for use as a Naval Base# This proposal is put forward purely as a matter of insurance in view of the uncertainty of the future of Hen jam, and it is not proposed at present to expend any money on development, the cost of which is tentatively stated on page 3 of the Memorandum. Part Secretary, H.M. Treasury, S. W. 1.Part of the land required is already in the market and it is estimated that the whole eould be obtained for the sum of about £3,100 (Rs.41,500). The Sub-Committee decided that the question of the purchase of this land should be dealt with departiaentally. 3. It was originally proposed by the Senior Haval Officer to take up the two areas enclosed in red lines on the attached map at an estimated cost of £1,500 (Rs.20,000) The area bordering on the sea would be intended for development as the actual base itself, with storehouses * offices, etc.; and the inland area for use as a recreation ground. The Commander-in-Chief has, however, recently reported that in hia opinion it would be advisable while the price of land iiemains low to purchase a further area outlined in blue on the map at the approximate cost of a further £1,600 (Ks.21,500), as there is a serious danger that a native village might spring up in the area, which would greatly lessen the amenities and the value of the original site, and might indeed make it necessary subsequently to acquire the additional area at an enhanced cost. After consultation with the Civil Lord of the AdmiraltyAdmiralty 9 who has recently had an opportunity of studying the question on the spot in consultation with the Commander- in-Chief, Their Lordships are satisfied that the proposal to buy this additional area is sound. 4. My Lords understand that the Air Ministry also wish to purchase land in Bahrein, details of which are given in telegram No.2946 from the Secretary of State for India to the political Resident, Bushire, of the 28th November * a copy o.r which is attached* Their Lordships concur with the Secretary of State for Air in his opinion that it is advisable for financial reasons to buy all the land required by His Majesty’s Government at the same time, in order to minimise the effect of the Government purchase of land in forcing up its value. 5* Furthermore, in view of the desire of H.M. Government to resume negotiations with Persia over the question of Hendam.it Is essential that no information *ith regard to any purchase of land for Naval purposes should be allowed to leak out. 6. To meet these two requirements Their Lordships propose that, subject to any views which may be expressed by the India Office or Government of India, the land requiredrequired by the Air Ministry and Admiralty should be purchased in one transaction on behalf of H.M. Government by the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who would be &amp;iven a iree hand in conducting the negotiations and would be charged with responsibility for ensuring that a good title is obtained. 7. At an inter-departmental meeting held at the Admiralty on July 27th last it was agreed that from the accounting point of view there were certain advantages in leasing any land required rather than in purchasing it outright. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf* has* however, reported since this date that it would be preferable to purchase the land outright, both because this would be iaore economical in the long run, and also because leases are not regarded with favour by the inhabitants of Bahrein. Their Lordships are in agreement with this view and propose therefore that any land to be acquired should be purchased and not leased. 8. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will be aware that under the oil concession granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1925 the Bahrein Petroleum Company will shortlyshortly proceed to take up their mining lease. Recent indications are that the Ras al Jasra, upon which the land is situated 5 will not 'be included in the area of 100 fOOO acres to be deiaarcated hy the Companyj and furthermore there is reliable information that the oil will be shipped from Sitra Island, which lies well to the South ward, and where presumably any refineries and other works would be situated. In spite of the fact that under Article 2 of the lining lease powers of an indeterminate character are given to the Company for the acquisition of land at its market value, Their inordships understand that for the above reasons the India Office regard any inter ference from the Oil Company as extremely improbable. On the oth«r hand it seems possible that the development of the island of Bahrein as a result of the Company^ o perations will increase the value of the property. 9. It is also true that the Persian (Government have in the past advanced a claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Their Lordships understand that the Foreign Office consider that they can successfully resist the Persian claim to Bahrein which they regard as entirely unsubstantiated, and indeedindeed as having a 'nuisance value' only; also that the Indie Office regard our position at Bahrein as of such cardinal importance in the Persian Oulf, that its maintenance must be one of the major objects of the policy of H«M* Government in that area* 10. I am therefore to request that you will move the Lords Commissioners of H.M. Treasury to sanction the purchase of the land marked in red and blue on the attached map at Bahrein as a charge to Vote 10, Subhead f&gt;. 11.

'I— - ANGLO PERSIAN REI .ATIOTTR, IT A VAL STATION 1]^ L HL ^RSIAT^ GTTTJ?, Memoran dum by the First Lord of* the Admiralt y. I make no apology for bringing to the notice of my colleagues on the Middle East Sub-Committee, as a matter of urgency, the difficult situation which has arisen in Anglo- Persian relations, with particular reference to the future site of our naval station in the Persian Gulf. This matter has recently been the subject of prolonged and anxious consideration in the Admiralty, and I have also had the advantage of discussing it with the Civil Lord, who has just returned from a tour of the Middle and Par East, during which he has had the opportunity of studying the problem in consultation with the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, and the local Officers. I am impressed by the danger which undoubtedly exists that if the matter is allowed to drift we may be left without a naval station in the Gulf - a situation which might well make it necessary to re-consider our whole position and policy in the Middle Last. This questiun was recently considered by the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, viio were unable to agree on a satisfactory solution. The matter seems to me of such imports ice that I am glad of the opportunity thus afforded of discussing it with my colleagues. There are three places in the Persian Gulf viiich have been regarded as suitable sites for a naval station in the past. These are Basidu and Henjam, situated on&gt;'v) ^ Q Persian islands at the mouth of Hie Gulf, and. Bahrein an island under Arab rule and British protection, lying off the Arabian Coast about half way up the Gulf, Of these Basidu, v/hich has been in British occupation for over a century, has recently been the subject of a reference to the Law Officers of the Crown, who have advised in effect that there is insufficient evidence to establish a British title either by prescription or otherwise, although they point out that the question of a prescriptive title is not free from uncertainty, and that the arguments in favour of auch a title are sufficiently strong to ’’strengthen the ha ds of His Majesty’s Government in any negotiations they may think, proper”. Phis,in my opinion, makes it unnecessary to consider developing Basidu as a Naval Station; but does not preclude the use of Basidu as a bargaining factor. There remain, therefore, Henjam and Bahrein. The Naval Station is now, in fact, situated at Henjam, and one of the prime objectives of the long drawn out treaty negotiations has been to attempt to secure torsian recognition of our position there, which at the moment has no legal foundation. The Persian Government have shown little readiness so far to meet our wishes in this matter, and the question for decision, therefore, is whether to persist in our attempt tp persuade them to do so. I am strongly of opinion that we should maintain this attempt for tne following reasons Henjam is by far the best site for a Naval Station, possessing as it does a good anchorage and a good position adjacent the Trucial Coast and commanding the mouth of Hie Gulf. Its climate also is generally less unpleasant than that of Bahrein; and all the facilities werequire are already available there. At Bahrein equivalent facilities 'would cos# probably £400,000, although the place could be made suitable for use by Sloops at a cost of about £40,000. Assuming, therefore, that we can induce the Persians to behave in a reasonable manner and refrain from a policy of pin pricks in the future, the only important disadvantage of lien 3 am is that if Persia were neutral its use as a ilaval Station in war night prove impossible; but in view of its advantages in peace, the Admiralty are prepared to accept this disadvantage and to rely, if necessary, on an improvised station near the mouth of the Gulf in war. In my view Persia gains more than does this country from the Treaty a s now drafted* If Hen jam is dropped cutj die would apparently receive the friendship of this country, the remission of her debts, a gift of the Duzdap Sailway and of ¥/T Stations at Hen jam, Bushire and Lingah, recognition of her very doubtful claim to Sirri, in addition to the rendition of Basidu, in exchange for nothing more substantial than recognition of the independence of Bahrein and other Arab States and of our special treaty relations with the Arabs. Such a treaty would be very one sided, so much so that I am of opinion that it would, not be worth pursuing. I suggest, therefore, that a satisfactory arrangement for the continued use of Hen jam by HoM.Ships free from petty Persian restrictions should be made a sine qua non of the treaty Negotiations.(3) Our departure from Henjam, coupled with the rendition of Baaidu, would have a had effect upon our influence in the Gulf, which has already heon seriously shaken. Once we leave the Persian shore we can never return. An agreoment giving us the right to remain even for a short time, can he subsequently extended if the present regime is maintained; and if the present regime comes to an end, and Persia das integrates, we shall he left in in possession* As for Bahrein, I am informed that the probable development of the as a result of the discovery of oil makes it desirable, if a Naval Station is ever likely to be required there, to buy the necessary land now, and in fact that cf the matter is left much longer suitable land might prove unobtainable* In these circumstances, and in view of the uncertainty of the future of Henjam, I propose to seek authority ts purchase land now, purely as a matter of insurance* Fart of the land required is, in fact,at present in tne market, and the whole could be obtained for the estimated sum of .£3,000* I would propose that for the time being no money at all should be spent on development. I do not anticipate that my colleagues will differ from my view that Henjam should continue to be our objective in negotiation with the Persian Government, but I hope further that they will concur in my opinion that we should now endeavour to reach agreement with the least possible delay, I urge that the Treaty should be presented to the Persian Government as a whole, and that if they re-open detaile' discussions over ground which has been examined time and time again, the Minister should ask for an audience with the Shah (who ^lone appears to have the necessary power to negotiate) and give him to understand that the British Government are notcf any ! occupat: at Basi( binding period a side. I treated 1 lit’] Gres in the si laintenar ?alue to is should oi the inprepared to resume a long and abortive process of haggling with subordinates; that they regard the draft Treaty presented as a fair settlement: and that unless he its prepared to accept the essential features of the Treaty they can see no useful purpose in proceeding with fie matter. I woulo. leave discretion to our representative at Tehran as to details, but in my viev/ the essential feature of any Treaty is the va ilin g assent of the Persians to our occupation of Henjam in return for the surrender of our rights at Basidu. It will be of course be necessary to secure a binding agreement vhich will remain in force for an agreed period and continue thereafter unless determined by either side. I am informed that the Shah considers himself badly treated by other aowers and would welcome a Treaty of friendship with Great Britain. be could offer to co-operate with him in the suppression of slave and arms traffic, and in the maintenance of peace in the Gulf, objects which are of as much value to him as to His Majesty’s Government. In return for that v/© should expect his loyal co-operation and the discontinuance of the incidents which have in the past tone so much to disturb our good relations. Vhether an effort to secure such an early decision would succeed or not, I do not khow, but I think the attempt is wort: making. in the meanwhile I consider that no steps should be taken at Basidu which would lead the Persians to suppose that we are abandoning any of our claims at that place. ' r e should offer to withdraw the guard, our ships and flag, but only when agreement has been reached as to the essentials of the Treaty itself. The policy I suggest may therefore be summed up as follows (l) Resume Treaty negotiations forthwith, making the grant of facilities for .b.Sftips at Honjam a sine qua non of the Treaty.X min m - AIR MINISTRY P.

With reference to our telephone conversation today on the subject of Bahrein, and your letter P.Z.7550/33 of the 20th Uovember, 1933, the matter has now been discussed between D.C.A.S. and D.G.N.S. and I understand that the Admiralty have decided to refer it to the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerning Middle Bast, and Air Ministry requirements will also be brought forward for a decision at the same time. In the meantime we are preparing a paper on the subject. I enclose herewith for your information copies of sketches received from A.0.0. Iraq, in which he indicates the extra land he suggests should be acquired by us. We would be grateful if you could obtain from Bowie as soon as possible an estimate of the cost of purchase of that land. With reference to paragraph 5 of your above- auoted letter, we agree that copies of relevant correspondence should be sent to the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department, and I will take the necessary action in so far as we are concerned.

Dear McClaughry, IvAriy thanks for your letter of the 18th November, No. 3.3I443/pt. II. I quite agree that the Air ministry are entirely uncommitted at this stage as regards the purchase of any supplementary areas for the purpose of landing ground or seaplane bases in Bahrein, and that throughout the discussions which have taken place between us on the subject it has been clearly understood that the whole matter was one which must form the subject of discussion once the A.O.C.’s detailed recommendations had been received and that no decision of any sort could be taken or suggested until that discussion had taken place. 2. Your letter rather suggests, however, that the Air Ministry may feel reluctant to engage in expenditure for the purpose of acquiring additional land as an insurance against the future at Bahrein. That is, of course, essentially a matter for them, and if tney are satisfied, after considering the A.O.C.’s report, tnat their/ (Up , j.Vi'wi . , DF Cornnander W.A. McClaughry, DSO.

I should like, however, pending detailed examination of the A.O.C.'s recommendation to draw attention to the following points, which perhaps you would bear in mind. The first is that it is arguable that the Company might contend that such undertakings as they have given cannot reasonably be construed as extending to sites not in our possession and in respect of which we are only in a position to say that at some time during the currency of the mining lease we may wisn to acquire them. The correspondence which has passed between us and the company (and the Eastern and General Syndicate) in respect of safeguards for landing grounds and seaplane bases in Bahrein is surrmarised in my letter of 29th September last, No. p.Z.6219/33, to Seal, of which/3 which copies were sent to Turner at the Air Ministry as well as to the Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, India and Bushire. My second point is that even if* we assume that the Company are prepared to agree that the undertakings given oy them extend to any areas which we may now mark out for landing ground and seaplane oases, even if these areas are not in our possession, it will inevitably become known sooner or later (ana probably in the very near future) that we have or may have the intention of acquiring those areas for Government purposes. Will not the effect of this be to raise the price against us very substantially if we wish to acquire at a future date? 4. I am at your disposal if the Air Ministry wish to talk matters over further, ana in the event of the Air Ministry, with Treasury approval, desiring to make further purchases of land we shall, of course, De very glaa to send any necessary instructions to the political Resident. 5. if you see no objection I should like to send copies of this letter to the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department, as they are all indirectly interested in the position. In that event, perhaps you would/would seo no objection to sending them a copy also of your letter to which this is a reply? Yours sincerely, J.G-.

My dear Laithwaite, „ referen ce to my letter S.31443/Part II of the ^ 15th Instant, I think! it has been made very clear in our various telephone conversations and in telegrains between ourselves and A.O.C., Iraq, of which you have had copies, that there is not at present and there may never be any intention on the part of the iiir Ministry ox acquiring the extra land at Bahrein described in A^O.C's telegram, copy of which was sent to you under cover of my above-quoted letter. The estimate of possible future requirements at Bahrein upon which A.O.C. has based his proposals is nothing more than a guess, and it was only made because you said we must look something like 50 years aheah. There is at present no financial or other authority in existence either for increasing the Air strength in the Persian Gulf area, or for readjusting the disposition of units already in the Iraq Command. TheD.C.A.S* has therefore asked me to write to you again to emphasise that while we wish the additional sites recommended by A.O.C. to be safe guarded, there is at present no likelihood of our acquiring such additional land. enclosure r ), 14 7.

Dear Powell, I aiii sorry to uave Kept the draft &amp; inutes of ou. meting of 6th Kovner about the purchase of land at Bahrein so long* first place, i agree with the amendment* suggested by bhclaughry. b* Secondly, I will. If I may, take advantage of your suggestion that by way of putting if on record I ehoulu elaborate my remarks on the legal position. I suggest that the following might be substituted for my remarks on pages 1 and 2;* 'Mr. h&amp;ithwaite said that we had hitherto hoped that it might be possible to secure legal cover for any ■ul base in Bail re in by inciuaing it within Uiu area to be covered by the guarantees given by the Company in respect of landing ground and seaplane bases. The •N.O* 1 s report made it clear Uiat it was not possible to combine the two. In tnese circumstances* it ms Powell, fsq., -i. i . 1 ** 2 • necessary to consider In greater detail our position vis-a-vis the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Uie event oi our now acquiring an area lor naval purposes at Bahrein, not being covered by the guarantees given by the Company in respect of landing grounds or sea- plijae bases, whether in our own name or in that of a Gummy, not being the Jhelith, ana whether on lease or absolutely. The matter had been carefully examined with toe usgal Adviser at toe India office, whose views were as fallows:- ( 1 ) During the currency of toe prospecting licence an existing terms or any exteriaiou thereof on the same terms, toe Company, for the purposes of the prospecting licence, would have free access to any area (jdheaule II(i)) ana the right (subject to toe compensation provisions of xheduie 1 1(1 i)} to carry out in that area any worics necessary for uie purpose of prospecting. ( 2 ) The Company would have toe rigut to select and incluae any such area within the area to be covered by toe mining lease under article VI of toe Concession, ana in that event the area would become subject to toe provisions in xneuule III (Mining Mease). 3 /(3) on the taking out of toe lining i ma » covering me urea in Question, toe Company; (a) woula have the right to anil ato prospect in that area unaer schedule ili(i), a na to erect wharves, jetties, railways, telegraphs, storage tanks, etc. within it; hut (h) i.oula acquire only with toe consent of toe proprietors £4M on eucn conditions as might he arranged between the Company and the proprietors, the land and builuin ; s in that area to such extent as might be necessary for pipe lines, refineries, oiflees, ana atoer works; (c) outside toe leased area unaer toe mining le&amp;se they are preciuaea from occupying saiy land which mi t nt otherwise be ieagea for toe production of oil to a third party, save in so far as it is necessary in oroer to amble their pipe lines and railways to pass freely to their destination ana unless they can satisfy the cheito that no other land suitable for their purpose is available. me/4 • ^aviaar ®uicia4 tliiit* upon tiia construe uion oi tiia Mining Xaasa iia die not laal on vary fim ^rouna about Article Il # mich was anaoubtedly a aiXflculty, but that in Me opinion it M^jit be eala taut the 'right given to the ioapany to acquire all l&amp;nus ana builaings'ls subject to its being ©no ?si that they are 'necessary for the said purpose* which in his opinion mans ’needed by the Company for their operations.' It might in Mr Herbert I carson's view at least be saia that so long as other buildings or lands were available which would enable their purposes to be carried out, they eouia not effect an absolute acquisition of our land, ana he had adaea that he was not clear how the proprietors coula os forcea to consent, when it ms said to be a i.Jitter tor arrangement between the Company sad the proprietors. The point had also been raised with the Legal Adviser, whether, if the area of &amp; naval station fell outside the area of the mining lease (not being covered by the understanding as to landing ground and seaplane basest it might be possible to make soi-.etuing of/of 1&amp;’&amp;% paragraph of Artieia II* Ha uau ^xprtgsod tiia opinion tfiis isoniu prot^s.Piy b# -so^ tut only if - : ,t couia be mom mat there was other Igm suitable for the Company*s purposes. Xhe expression «ianb outsiae the area which might otherwise be leased for the proauctlon of oil 3 would not in his opinion cease to nave application merely because we a„,a purchased it* especially having regard to the fact that our purchase would be with full notice of the rights of the Company unaer the lease. It appeared also to be arguable that the right ’to erect and operate wharves mid jetties in any part of the territory under the control of the Jieikh was an absolute unlimited right under Article I t®£ the mining lease and that me reservation in the last paragraph of Article II was not a Qualification of that right* but only of Uie rights given wider the preceding conditions of Article II* dir Herbert fearson aid not* however, think that argument was sound, because the construction appeared to him to reQuire that the two clauses mould be read together* ^ The legal Adviser finally suggested that the best way to obtain the reQuiraments oi me Government appeared/6 appeared to fee 'to mako tae reservation of such lana as fee neeuea for a naval base a coauition of the extension of the prospecting licence ♦ ,, r. Laithmite -aid that he uoubted if this «as practicable at the present stage, ihe company had put forward a financial offer to the Jieito in return for an extension of the licence; time was vary snort oaf ore tae present prospecting licence expired on ana Decemoer; and the introauctlon of a new question such ag inis would he likely to present considerable difficulty* fortover, tm acquisition of land from the naval point of view was primarily in the interests of H.m.f* ana if the needs of E*M»G« were put before the pocket of the Sheikh, he might, not unjustly, feel a sense of injury against us* In conclusion Mr* Lalthwaite said that it was of course necessary for us in con slue ring this quistion to look at matters in toe light most unfavourable to ourselves, and that it seemed clear from the advice which he had quoted that our position was fey no means strong.

The meeting haa before them the report submitted by the Senior Naval Officer and the chart appended thereto. 2. I explained the legal position as we saw it (in the terms accepted hy the Legal adviser in his reference of 7th November below)* 3. The general sense of the meeting was finally that, subject to the opinion of the Law Officers on the status of Basidu (ana possibly to any consequential Cabinet decision on the question whether we should be content with a '*gentlemen*s agreement ' at Henjam and relinquish Basiau to the Persians in return for a satisfactory treaty settlement), it woula be desirable to acquire the whole area east of the red line on the S.N.O.*s chart and also the area shown as 'open ground aisputed H ; ana that the acquisition shoula be in the name of the Air Ministry. If necessary, the southern half of the area east of the red line could be surrenaered to the Company should they press for this (on, of course, repayment terms). For the moment it was agreed that the Inaia Office shoula at once ask the Political Resident by telegram for certain further information as to the probable cost of acquisition of alternative pieces of grouna and as to whether any difficulty need be anticipated in purchasing the three small plots in private ownership shown in the southern section of the area covered by the S.N.O.’s red line. X i 5000 8.33It*/? t\. • The present position is that the Company are working under the prospecting license, which is governed by Articles III and Iv of the 1925 agreement. Article III contemplates such a license 'over areas to he selected by the Company', (a vague expression giving no indication of the total area) but your note explains uiiat no sucn areas have in fact been selected, with the result I presume that the prospecting license is unlimited in extent and applies to 'biie whole of the territories' under control of the Shaikh, just as the exploration license did (under ^Article I). I also observe that the Company is now working under an extension of the prospecting license, expiring on 2nd December 1933, and that a further extensionnay be agreed to. It is in connection with these extensions that there seems to be a possibility of obtaining what we want. Article III contemplates the grant of a prospecting license 'for a maisimum period of two years', and is the form of an express undertaking conferring that right upon the Company. Article IV however is different in form: it provides that the prospecting license may be extended for a further period of two years, and even if this confers a right in the Company to claim the extension, on the footing that they are able to show to the satisfaction of the Snaikh that such extension is justified, I understand that that extension of 2 years is now about to expire There is no provision in Article IV or anywhere else for any further e tension, and there appears therefore to be no right in the Company to / claim it under any term in the agreement. It may therefore dot possible to stipulate for the exclusion^ox the prospecting license as such, either in its present unlimited extent or in 'selected areas'. As regards the schedule to the prospecting license, clause 1 is certainly extraordinarily wide and comprehensive in its terms; it is questionable whether if areas had been 'selected', it could be argued that the scope of the iree access could be limited to those areas only: on the other nand access except for the purposes of the prospecting license seems quite unreasonable.SECRET. '71 - / ! * !93 u Legal Adviser, We are consiaering the possihility of moving the naval station in the Persian Gulf from Hen jam to Bahrein*. It may oe that the move, even if up Droved in principle, would not take place for some time, and in any event we are anxious, for political reasons arising, out of our relations with Persia, to keep entirely secret the fact that a move is even under discussion* on the other hand, it seems prohahle ehat the Bahrein Petroleum Company may wish to secure the area which would test suit the Admiralty for their own purposes, and that area is in any case hecoming increasingly huilt over and of increasing value. It may well, therefore, he necessary to acquire it at once hy way of insurance - possibly in the name of the Air Ministry or in some other manner which would conceal the fact that our real interest in it is naval. We are anxious in these circumstances to know quite how we stand vis-a-vis the Company. It is, of course, most important for our purpose that we should he secure that the Company cannot interfere in any area which we acquire for the purpose of a naval base. 2. me Company, as you will remember, took over the concession originally granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a copy of which is attached, on the terms set out in the Indenture and schedule of the 12th June 1930, reproduced on pages 6 and 7 of the print. Certain modifications have been made in the Schedule, which deals with the projecting licence, but they are not relevant to the present point, me Company is at present working under the prospecting licence, having been granted an extension which expires on 2nd December 1933. They may possibly be granted a further extension to 2nd January 1935, but this is not yet settled. 3/5* I n addit/ion to tne obligations undertaken by them in the Indenture of 12th June 1930 there has been an understanding (in writing) that the Company shall not take any steps which would prejudice the sites to be chosen by Uo for landing ground and seaplane oases* These sites were to have been comrfiunicated to them some time ago, but have not in fact yet been so communicated. 4* We originally thought of including in the sites to be notified to the Company as those for the landing ground and seaplane bases sufficient land to meet our naval requirements (our assumption being that so long as the areas in question were in fact used as landing and seaplane bases as well as for naval purposes they would be covered by the guarantee given us by the Company). But the senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf now reports that it would in his opinion be impossible to use any of the area to be set aside for or adjoining the proposed landing ground ana seaplane bases for naval purposes ana he has recommended the consideration of a different area. 5. The rights of the Company under the prospecting licence are set out in Article III of the Agreement oi 2nd December 1925 ana in the Second schedule thereto. It may be noted that they have hot in fact been required to select any areas over which to prospect and that they are, with our acquiescence, prospecting over the whole area of tne island. Ihe^iShedule is drafted in very general terms and appears to give them the right of free access to all parts of the Sheikh’s territory “whether private or public property, saving only sacred buildings, shrines ana grave yards” and “the right to carry out in any part of the said territory such works as may be necessary ior the purpose oi prospecting/V „ v s v ' 4 TEk 'V ! - 3 - 1 prospecting*’, subject to payment of a rent in the case of cultivated land and to the restoration to its original state of uncultivated land, unless such uncultivated land is included in the area to be taken out by them under their mining lease. 6. Their rights in respect of a mining lease are set out in Article V of the original agreement ana in the Third Schedule to that agreement. It will be seen that they are entitled to take out an area not exceeding 100,000 acres in not more than three blocks. Within this area they have exclusive rights to prospect, drill, etc. and to construct and operate pipe lines, refineries, railways, wharves and jetties, tramways, roads, etc. Article II of the Third Schedule grants gratuitously to % the Company all uncultivated land belonging to the Sheikh over which they may need for their operations; and/any land so granted they shall for the period of their agreement enjoy full proprietary rights. ’’The Sheikh also recognises that the Company has the right to acquire all and any other lane and buildings necessary for the said purpose with the consent of the proprietors on such conditions as may be arranged between the Company and the said proprietors, without their being allowed to make demands of a nature to surcharge the prices ordinarily current for lands and buildings situated in their respective localities.' 7. The point on which I should be grateful for your advice is whether having regard to the terms of (a) the prospecting licence and (b) the mining lease, in the event of their acquiring,either in their own name or in that of a dummy,an area falling with the area selected by the Company for the purpose of their mining lease and not/ i 11not covered dy the guarantees given hy the Company in respect of landing ground ana seaplane bases, could sa could safely regard themselves as immune from intuference by the Company, /i/ould tneir position be secured by the fact that tne consent of the proprietors is necessary unaer Article II oi the mining lease to the acquisition by the Company of land and buildings etc. not being uncultivated iana am the property of the sheikh and that the conditions of such acquisition are to be matters for arrangement between the should declare as public land required for Government purposes the area in which we are interested. Would this in any way safeguard the position of that area having regard to the terms of the prospecting licence ana the mining lease?3 h C PROM , , SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER . ^SHORLHAM’' .

It is well built over. There are pleasant houses and well laid out gardens. The ownership is much divided and very complicated and I am advised th t there would be no prospect of obtaining a lease except at considerable expense, or even arranging a transfer by purchase of an area sufficient to meet our requirements. There is plenty of evidence to show that the sections of land 7 not now occupied by buildings 5 are liable to inundation from the sea and are not suitable for our purpose. (f) My predecessor vao most anxious that Naval intereots should be concentrated in one area ; with recreation grounds either in that area or available near by. I concur in this view. 5. There is no doubt that Ras al Jasra 3 or at leas that part of the district which goes by the general name of Jafaij? is the most suitable site for the Naval Base, The a ctual. 4, Having satisfied myself that it was not practicable to give effect to the proposals put before me. I proceeded twice to Ras al Jasra to go into the question of establishing the Naval Base there 5 and I also visited other points along the shores of Ehor IN.lyha.Senior Naval Officer 9 Persian Gulf, 17th October, 1930 ITo o 179/0425 of ihe actual limits of the land required in this district have never been determined, but it is now .ossible to make^concrete proposals on the annexed large scale tracing, which shows with reasonable aCv urcic/ the present s cate of affairs as it affects the ownership of the various roperties situated in the area 0 6 0 rty predecessor’s idea was to acquire the area shown as_ belonging to Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman and to set Up the actual base buildings there. The recreational grounds were to be laid out and canteen y club house and wash place set up on the area referred to in the tracing as ''open grounds - disputed*. I_ am informed that Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman is a most difficult man to d eal with and it &lt;*ould he well- if possible s to-avoid having any business relations with him. 7, Fortunately, gust now the property of Abdul JRalman bin Abd-ql kahab is in .rocess of liquidation ~ owing to the death of the owner, so I suggest as an alternative that the whole of that property he acquired for Base buildings together with the plots owned by Bin Jbdnr,, syed Badar and Majid Bin Noser Nairn! and the waste ground bounded by Fadhal bin Mohanna Al Naimi’s house and garden and Shaikh Khalifa bin Salim.n’s property marked in red pencil. o 0 As to the recreation grounds, etc, 9 I favour the views of my predecessor and concur that the ground shown as ’’open grounds ~ disputed' 1 should be acquired on a long lease, or preferably by purchase outright. I am informed that it would be better to purchase outright because it is likely to be more economical in the long run and long leases are not viewed with favour by these Arabs. 9. As to the so called waste ground in this area, all of it ; which is not protected by title deeds of the owners noted as such on the tracing, is claimed by Shaikh Muhammed bin Isa. brother of the ruling Shaikh of Bahrain.

LDepartment Please see'previous submission on P.Z. 6051/33, s on the question of removing the naval station in the | Persian Gulf from Henjam to Bahrein. The question was j discussed in the Middle East Committee on 10th October, i on the basis of the notes recorded by Colonel Fowls and Mr.Metcalfe, but, owing to a change of attitude by the Admiralty on the question of Basidu, which raised issues affecting the negotiations with Persia as a whole, it proved impossible to make any material progress regarding the question of moving from Henjam to Bahrein. The ; minutes of the meeting, which are attached, are self- | explanatory. Its conclusions are flagged. / 2. The position as regards Basidu is that we have i held a concession there since 1820. Departmental researches since 10th October go to confirm the view which has consistently been held by the Government of India that the concession is Persian territory, and that the most we could do would be to plead, if challenged by Persia, that uninterrupted possession of over a century gave us strong prescriptive rights to retain it. &gt;-6 ^ have hitherto proposed to surrender our rights in Basida to Persia as part of a satisfactory treaty settlement, and the terms of can article in the Treaty have been agreed with the Persians. 3. Aa regards Henj an, it was agreed in August after discussion with Sir R.Hoare, and with the concurrence of the Admiralty, that we should aim at securing in the Treaty a twenty-five year tenure under a 'gentleman's agreement' - the prospect of a longer term, or of a • „ -i -i a Q q p weing in the Minister* s view I satisfactory formal lease, oemg i negligible. : 4. The Admiralty at the meeting on 10th October intimated/' i mr~ intimated that (in the light of tne recent hasidu incident) they no longer thought a ’gentleman’s agreement’ a satisfactory basis for their remaining at Henjam, that at the same time they thought it essential to retain a post in the narrow neck of the 5ulf: and that unless by any chance a really satisfactory lease of Henj am for a * long period could be secured, they now wished to retain j Basidu, which they regarded as British territory, and turn it into a naval base in wnich they would have complete liberty of action whether in peace or war. 5. A decision to take Basidu out of the Treaty at this stage,* particularly now that the recent incident has focussed attention on it, would clearly be a serious one. Apart from this, neither the Foreign Office nor Sir R.Hoare feel that there is any hope of securing frcm Persia anything better than a gentleman’s agreement for 25 years at Henj am. It was decided in these cir cumstarneji to postpone Sir R.Hoare’s return to Teheran, and to refer the matter to the Cabinet. It is understood that it may be raised to-morrow by Sir John Simon, but at the moment neither Foreign Office nor Admiralty are circulating mem oranaa■ 5. The Department would submit that there is justification for supporting the Foreign Office view. .'.e are not in fact on strong ground at Basidu, and might be unaole to maintain our position were we to claim that it v.as Britisn territory held in full sovereignty ( a reference is shortly to be made to the Law Officers on the question of our rights in it). On the probability „ettin 0 what we want at Henjam we can but be guided by the Minister and the Foreign Office (The real solution of the question of the naval base looks increasingly to lie in removal to Bahrein; the use as emergency stations in a war in which Persia was neutral an&lt;iS as iariD and AtlU Musa, which command the neck[inute Paper Department neck of the Gulf; or, in a war in which Persia was engaged,of Basidu or Henjam.) The Foreign Office are too on strong ground in maintaining that whatever prospect there may he of a satisfactory outcome to the proposed negotiations, it would he suhstantially reduced hy an effort on our part at this stage to hold on to Basidu. In all the circumstances the right line seems on the whole to he to let Basidu go (the bargaining use to he made of it to turn on the Law Officers opinion as to the strength or weakness of our position there): to proceed urgently with consideration of the possibility of using Bahrein as an alternative to Henjam; and pending detailed investigation to allow Sir R.Hoare to begin negotiations on the basis of a gentleman’s agreement for 25 years at Henjam which he can press or abandon later in the light of the results of that investigation. fai. 17th October 1933THE COMMITTEE had before them the following papers Copy of letter No e PZ 6051/33 of 2nd October, 1933, from Mr. J.G-. Laithwaite, India Office, to Mr. G.1L Rendel, C.M.CK, Foreign Office, covering notes by Lieut.-Col. Fowls, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Mr. A. Metcalfe, Secretary„ Foreign and Political Department, Government of India, (Paper No. M,E = (0) 104). Copy of letter No, E. 5864/1620/34 of 3rd October, 1933, from Mr. G.W. Rendel, C.M.G., Foreign Office to Mr. J.G. Laithwaite, in reply to the above. [ Pap er No, M, E, ( 0 ) 105'). 4, Memorandum by the Admiralty and Foreign Office dated 23rd February, 1932, on the subject of the British Naval Depot at Hen jam. (paper No. M.E (0) 57). Minutes of a Meeting of the Sub-Committee held on December 17th, 1931. (M.E.(0) 15th Minutes.) In the absence of Mr. Parkinson, the chair was taken by Mr. Rendel who briefly explained the position as it had been in 1931-32 and as outlined in paper No, M.E. (0) 57 and in the Minutes of the fifteenth meeting. The question had then been postponed owing to various developments, such as the departure of Sir R. Clive, the Persian demand for our withdrawal from Hen jam, and, subsequently, the Anglo-Persian Oil dispute. In view of the impending resumption of negotiations for an Anglo-Persian Treaty settlement, it had now again become a live issue. MR. LAITHWAITS said that in the past successive Secretaries of State for India had been disposed generally to support the Admiralty view as to the desiraoilit;y of retaining Hen jam if this was in any way possible. Sir Samuel Hoare.was, however, now inclined to think that there was much force in the arguments contained in the notes by Colcnei Fowls and Mr. Metcalfe union nad been circulated, but he proposed to postpone a decision until the results of the present discussion were available. - 1 - 1 . 1 - ll m 'f 1 II If/tJo — o — The essential facts were that, desirable as it v;as to remain at Henjam if this ^as at all possible, in the first place ^e had no real standing there; we had consistently admitted that it was Persian territory; we had no concession for a naval station; and at the most if we had real difficulty with Persia we could only hope for a brief delay to enable us to evacuate without discomfort before giving up our concession. It would be impossible to try to retain it against the will of the Persian Government. Secondly, our anxiety to remain at Henjam constituted a most important hostage to the Persians, not only in the present treaty negotiations, but in our general relations with them. Thirdly, there seemed little prospect of securing a Treaty article to regulate our position such as we desired, save on disproportionately onerous terms and the latest suggestion that we should be'content with a ’'gentleman’s agreement' might be a rather unsatisfactory basis for our presence. Finally, in the event of war, we could not use Henjam so long as Persia remained neutral save at the cost of violating Persian neutrality. In these circumstances there seemed much to be said for leaving Hen jam and concentrating elsewhere, if an equally, or even slightly less, satisfactory alternative could be found. It had been generally accepted that the only alternatives to Henjam were Basidu and Bahrein. As regards Basidu, our position was, in tne vi^w of the India Office, probably legally much better than m Hen jam and we had been in unchallenged occupation • L °n a much longer period. But they did not think that it was Hy any means impregnable and on the whole the balance of advantage seemed, if we decided to move from Henja.m,definitely to rest with cutting our connection with the Persian shore and going to Bahrein. The arguments against removal to Bahrein had Been summarised in Colonel Fowle’s notes. They were essentially for the technical departments to pronounce on. So far as the strategic argument was concerned, Henjarn or Basidu had obvious advantages of position. But would it not be possible to command the neck of the Gulf in time of war by emergency stations on Tamb, Abu Musa, etc.? Moreover, if in time of war Persia were on our side we could use either Basidu or Henjam. The second difficulty was climatic. It was not clear that there was real^r very much to choose between Bahrein and Basidu or Henjam, but the point might, as suggested by the Resident, be investigated on the spot. The third and most substantial argument was finance. The water at Bahrein was shallow and dredging would, be needed before it could be made a convenient station. The Admiralty had estimated that it would cost £40,000 to do the necessary dredging for sloops, and £400^000 for cruisers. Was the cruiser point of much importance? Cruisers very rarely came up the Gulf: when they did they could use the same anchorage as was at present used by the B.I. boats. It seemed unjustifiable in any circumstances to spend nearly half-a-million merely in order to enable occasional cruisers to enter the harbour. On the other hand, if expenditure of the order indicated would fitMWB Bahrein for use by sloops It was for consideration wnether it might not he faced, in view of the apparent advantages, political and otherwise, of concentrating on Bahrein. it was relevant, too, that if, as seemed probable, the Bahrein Petroleum Company struck oil in commercial quantities, they would, in their own interest, have to do a certain amount of dredging and clearing of tne harbour approaches. We should .benefit indirectly oy this and the probable ultimate expenditure might be substantially reduced. The final argument against removal was that of prestige. There was obvious force m this. But it now seemed clearthat if for any reason the Persians were at any time to make and press a request that we should evacuate Hen jam, or if, alter natively, they were to agree to allow us to remain at Henjam only on quite unacceptable terms, there would he nothing for it but to go. Prom the point of view of prestige it would be very much better to go in our own time and in circumstances which we could explain to the Arab sheikhs and make appear (as in the case of the removal of the air route to the Arab littoral) to involve no loss of face on our part, rather than in face of, e.g., a public ultima turn and time limit set by the Persian Government. Mr. Metcalfe and Colonel Fewle expressed their general agreement with Mr. Laithwaite’s statement of the position. MR. RE I© EL said that the question of our possible removal from Hen jam could toe considered under three aspects. In the first place there was the political issue, which had been developed toy Mr. Laithwaite - i.e. the desirability -4--5- or otherwise, from the point of view of our relations with Persia, Ox pUuoing an end oo a situation the continuance of which would mean uhs t Persia would always ha.ve a leve - ^ which she could use against us. Our lack of any legal right to he in Hen jam, and our anxiety to remain there, in the view of the Foreign Office seriously weaken our political position with Persia. Secondly, there was the technical aspect of the question - i.e. whether the proposed move would he physically and financially practicable. Phis involved technical and strategical arguments which could only he developed hy the experts. Thirdly, there was what he termed the tactical aspect - i.e. if it v/ere agreed that the proposed move was politically desirable and technically practicable, what should he our line about it in dealing with the Persians? Should our intentions he announced at once or kept secret as long as possible, and should the proposed move he represented as a concession ^o Persia or as a decision taken independently for our own convenience, as in the case cf the transfer of trie air route? As regards the political aspect, the Foreign Office ^&lt;-u always urged the desirability of the move, and entirel., - ! x.- with the views expressed hy th$* India Office. -• aspect would have to he considered after a decision on question of principle had been reached. Meanwhile, he suggest ed that the Admiralty should explain their v r ie^s on technical side of thd matter.! mj ft i ■ ; CAPTAIN ilOORL said thatj with refsTsucs to th 6 change of policy advocated in paragraph 1 of Colonel Fowle f s note (i.e. voluntarily giving up Henjam) the Admiralty did not agree that if Henjam were evacuated, the importance of Basidu would he lessened; rather would it he increased, as some advanced base at the entrance of the Gulf was necessary. In 1928 the rendition of Basidu was only considered as a concession in return for a satisfactory settlement at Henjam. Since then the chances of obtaining a satisfactory agreement seemed to have steadily dwindled until we reached the position recorded at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on 1st August last, when it was thought that our position at Henjam would have to hang on a 'Gentleman’s Agreement'. In view of recent incidents in the Persian Gulf which had occurred since the meeting of the Sub-Committee on the 1st August last, the Admiralty now felt that not much value could be attached to any 'Gentleman’s Agreement' with the Persian Government. They noted the political objections to remaining in Henjam as put forward by other Departments. The Admiralty did not consider that our position at Basidu, which was now recognised to be much better than was supposed in 1928, should be given up in order to obtain a 'Gentleman’s Agreement' for the use of Henjam, which, in their view, would not be satisfactory. The Admiralty could not agree with the view that Bahrein was the best strategical site. oven for the peace time duties of the sloops it was not as good as Henjam or -.asi * which were nearer to the Trucial coast. Naval r atings v/ere not allowed to land on the Trucial coast, and, in view of the arduous nature of their duties there, the continued u=e of Henjam or Basidu with their recreational facilities was a great help to them. In time of war, in the waters of/ ] \lthe Gulf, tut m ios approaches would have to te protect ed- against hostile attacics for which work cruisers and not sloops would te necessary. Bahrein was definitely 'badly oituated, ■while Basidij and Henjam were Both wo' 1 ! placed at the entrance to the Gnlf. The previous objec tions to the use of Basidu had been for reasons of health and the fact ^hat the depth in the approaehes to the anchorage was unsuitable for heavy ships. Both thes* questions lion lately 'been re-investigated and it appeared likely that, under modern conditions, Basidu could he made comparatively healthy and that the depth in the approaches to the anchorage would he sufficient to take modern cruisers which drew less water than former types. His instructions, therefore, were that the Admiralty were again considering Basidu as a naval station. Our legal position in Basidu had been examined by the Admiralty and appeared to them by no means untenable as suggested by the Foreign Office In view of the latter’s opinion, therefore, the Admiralty considered that the case should be referred to the responsible law officers for a legal opinion as to whether our rights thero could be upheld. If henjam was to be given up*in the Admiralty view, thors were two alternatives. The first was, to use Basidu as a naval station in lieu of Hen jam*, while, if, after examination of our legal position there * this c.ou rse was undesirable our second course wouldJso to use Bahrein as the main station, Basidu remaining available ac an advanced anchorage under the existing conditions. If and when a war came it could be decided in the light 01 existing circumstances whether Basidu should oe used or not.lib-« i\.said tna t 'tua Adinii*alt.y appear©d now to b p pressing x or rettxntiOii ot Basidu cn strategical grounds. ¥hen the question of our continued use of Henjam had Been 'under discussion it had Been pointed out that the station could not Be used as a Base in time of war if Persia were neutral, and the Admiralty had oeen at pains to emphasise that they desired to retain the station not as a strategic Base But for its re creational facilities. The word 'Base” had therefore purposely Been avoided in all these discussions. The Admiralty were now demanding the retention of Basidu on strategic grounds 'which, as he had explained, could not apply in the case of Hen jam. The two questions therefore did not seem to depend on each other and it seemed to him that the Admiralty were raising the Basidu issue cn an entirely new Basis. MR. GRIEVE agreed, and pointed out that the new Admiralty attitude in regard to Basidu was the crux of the whole matter. SIR R. HOARD considered that the Admiralty view regarding Basidu set the clock Back on our negotiations several years. The Admiralty said that they now wished to retain Basidu in view of the difficulty of getting a formal and satisfactory lease of Henjam. In his view we were far more likely to get satis faction as regards Henjam By a’’Gentleman r s agreement' with tne Persians than By a formal lease. In either case the success or failure of the arrangement 'would depend on mutual goodwill* mth regard to the war aspect raised by Captain Moore, he had always understbod that the harbour at Basidu could nou easily be defended against submarine aucsck, ana that our ..•ivan~ base would be the Alphinstone inlet on the MusandumCAPTAIN MOORN said that in the past the Admiralty policy as regards the hase had taken more account of the neace factors* Now that a change of policy as regards Henjam had been suggested the Admiralty considered that jn a fresh review of the situation 'both the peace time and strategical points of view should he taken into account * Prom the strategical point of view the Admiralty attached great importance to having some station at the mouth of the G-ulfh In his view the possibility of a submarine attack againsc .basrdu was remoue and certain anti-submarine measures were possible * MS. RENDEL said that from what had just been said it seemed clear that if we could not obtain a long formal lease of Hen jam (which it had been agreed would be practically impossible ) 9 and if the only solution therefore were a “gentleman’s agreement” on the lines recommended hy Sir E» Hoare 9 the Admiralty v,ould no* prefer to leave Hen jam as soon as an alternative coula be arranged 3 rather than continue there under a gentleman s agreement 5 notwithstanding Sir Loar&gt;.. o 'gentleman f s agreement* would be eq_uiAaj_enu o* MR. GRIEVE pointed out that if we transferred the depot from Henjam to Bahrein, our tenure at Bahrein would „ + - Persian claim to still be precarious in view of Ai that island. -i 4 -v, 4 + &gt; 14 o -peed not necessai iu.y MR. REIBDSL explained .hat t.n.- t,he suggestion had been be an insuperable difficulty? a. , 'Dohrein should be made in that the transfer from Henjan IMHPMconiiexion with a general treaty settlement with Persia^, and one of the main objects of that settlement would be to secure the abandonment of the Persian claim to Bahrein. As regards the Admiralty suggestion that we should establish a w a.r case qg Basi du 9 Mr. Rend el wished to point out that Basidu was not British territory* The present Admiralty attitude suggested thft they regarded the concession uiiere as equivalent to a British colony. The Foreign Office could not agree with such an attitude. The concession had been granted to us in rather obscure circumstances by a previous mler 9 and 5 in the opinion of the Foreign Office 9 could not in any case be regarded as conferring on us any sovereign rights over the territory,, which must therefore be regarded as remaining Persian, in these circumstances it seemed to him that the strategic arguments advanced by the Admiralty were no more applicable in the case of Basidu than in that of Henjam ? since we siiould not legally be able to use Basidu in time of war unless Persia were an all.y 9 in which case we could equally use Hen jam or any other point on the Persian coast. CAPTAIN MOORE suggested that the question whether Basidu was British should be referred to the Law Officers of the Crown. He did not consider it necessary now to raise the question of its use in time of war. If the Law Officers' opinion were favourable^ and medical reports were satisfactory^ the Admiralty might transfer the naval depot from Henjam to Basiduc,where they vrould regard themselves as completely free to tame whatever steps they liked. If the Law Of fi cers f opinion were unfavour able 9 we should be no worse off than we were at present,, and it would still be open to us to try to retain our present position at Basidu P whatever attitude the Persians might adopt 0 MPc. RENDSL ? while he could not conait his higher authorities without consulting them 5 , did not consider that the Foreign Office would raise any objection to a reference of the question of our rights to Basidu to the Law Officers, It would,, however 5 be quite impossible to consult the Law Officers without raising the question of sovereignty and if 9 as he personally thought certain^ the Law Officers decided that Basidu was not under British sovereignty,, he considered that it would be legally impossible for us to use it as a base in time of ware Bat in any case he was convinced that the action contemplut ed by the Admiralty would provoke a first-class conflict witii Persia. The Persians were convinced that Basidu was Persian territory, and if we started increasing our claiias or ac Givi ties there, t^ey .&lt;oald inevitably challenge our position. perfectly easy for then to take us to arbitration, and even in the unlikely event of the Law officers' opinion being in favour of the Admiralty view, x- Jr ~ s by no neons certain that we should be able to estaolisn our case before an international tribunal. If the Law Officers' opinion were unfavourable, it would be the height of folly to provoke a conflict with the Persians as we should only be ignominiously defeated before any intemotional tribunal, and our subsequent evacuation would, put us in a most humiliating pool fcion.n '! He did not, however^ wioh in any way to oppose a reference to the Law Officers, provided that it was understood that the action to he taken thereafter should he reconsidered in the light of the opinion given. His chief objection to a reference to the Law Officers was the delay which would he entailed. He pointed ouu that che attitude which the Admiralty were now adopting involved a reversal of the conclusions which had been agreed to at the meeting of the sub committee of August 1st. It had then been agreed that Sir R. Hoare should be authorised to try to secure a 4 Gentleman * s agreement providing for our continued use of Hen jam for, if possible, 25 years, and that the agreement of various departments on other points to form part of a general settlement already given, should be taken as still holding good. On this basis draft instructions had already been prepared for Sir R. Hoare, who was due to leave for Persia on October lithe The Admiralty now proposed to reverse these conclusions, and said that they could no longer accept a Gentleman’s agreement fr the continued use of Henjam, which was all that Sir Ro Hoare and the Foreign Office thought could oe obtained, and that they must insist on the retention of Basidu?which we had already offered to give up oo A-e Persians as part of a general settlement, and in regard to which, in the opinion of the Foreign Oifice, ou.r legal position was extremely doubtful. This meant that if the Admiralty persisted in their present j i cv, it would be impossible to issue the proposed instructions to Sir R, Hoare and almost certainly impracticarle to resume negotiations at alioSIR REGINALD HOARE said that if we withdrew our offer to relinquish Basidu it would he necessary to offer a makeweight of first class importance ? and past discussions showed conclusively that there was nothing available for this purpose. An offer to relinquish Hen jam instead would he regarded hy the Persians as of no value ? since we had no right to occupy Heniam and had admitted that we had none. His position on his return to Tehran vis—a—vis the Shah vould he imposoibis ? if he had to withdraw our offer to return Basidu. before leaving this country he would, like to have definite instructions on this matter. (At this point the Foreign Office were communicated with , 4 -^+- 04 -vi cl Hoarc’s departure should and nt vms arranged tna g oil Kegmoua ^oai • ~ he delayed until a decision had been reached). CAPTAIN MOORS stated that it was not so many year^ ago that the Commander-in-Chief, hast Indies, had been instructed, with the agreement of the Foreign Office, to use force, if necessary, to prevent the cpllection of taxes oy lorsians m Basidu. He thought this bore out the Admiralty view as rights at that place. The recent change on the Admiralty point ic o entl©man 1 s Agreement'* was the result ox of view as regards a Genrueman &amp; the behaviour of the Persians during recent weeks, and also of the Resident's opinion given m the p^pcro -. 4-1 Q n or other arrangement would Committee that nei+her a 1 r - 0 _p n-n-pthpr incidents( i.

It was obvious that the Persians eou.a n - . .v.f +hpt them were therefore justified m and the Adm i ra 11 y tho ug*x ^ reconsidering their a u ci. made«MR. RENDER pointed out that the decision to resist the collection of taxes did not affect the question of sovereignty and he reminded the Admiralty that they had agreed, though no doubt with great reluctance, that the Basidu incident could he regarded as closed provided a satisfactory reply to our last note were received from the Persian Government, It would he impossible hoth to regard the incident as closed, and at the same time to invoke it as a justification for the modification of our policy towards Persia 0 CAPTAIN MOORE pointed out that a satisfactory reply had not yet heen received from the Persians, Even assuming that the Basidu incident was closed, it was still necessary to take into account the attitude of the Persians since that incident, COLONEL FOWLE, in reply to a point raised hy Colonel Mackesey, said that the Musandam Peninsula had heen fully explored with a view to finding a suitable alternative anchorage near the mouth of the Gulf. Climatic conditions, however, rendered this location impossible, ov^n wit modern amenities, WING COMMANDER MeCLAUGHRY also stated that a i scent reconnaissance of this peninsula had revealed that a peace time flying boat station could not be located there also for climatic reasons* CAPTAIN MOORE observed that the use of Muscat had heen considered. This, however, had been ruled but owing to an international arrangement with the French. MR, RENDER said it was clear that there neo a difference of opinion on a matter of principle, which could only be resolved by reference to Ministers. If Minister, decided to endorse the conclusions of the meeting of August 1st0 and to override the view now put forward by the Admiralty, it would still he possible to issue instructions to Sir R. Hoare on the lines of the draft instructions which had Just been prepared in accordance with the conclusions of the meeting of August 1st, and Sir R* Hoare would then be able to resume negotiations on his arrival at Tehran as soon as the Basidu incident could oe regarded as finally disposed of, if, on the other hand, the view now put forward by the Admiralty were endorsed, it would probably be impossible to continue negotiations at Tehran, and it would be necessary to give some explanation to the Persians to show why, notwith standing our expressed readiness to reach an agreement with them, we were now prepared to abandon further efforts to reach a treaty settlement. The Persians would, he felt, bitterly resent such a change of attitude on our part, and would then certainly embark on a definitely hostile policy which would, in his opinion, necessitate our early evacuation of Hen jam in. any case, and probably our enforced evaucation of Basidu also, as a result of an arbitral award. We might also be faced with a demand for arbitration over Bahrein. It was possible that Ministers migh decide that the matter should be referred to the Law Officers before a final decision was taken, but this would involve very considerable delay, which might have just as damaging an effect on Anglo-Persian political relations as a definite re fasal to resume negotiations. MR. LAITHWAITE and COLONEL FOWLS agreed that the question of possible arbitration over Bahrein could not be contemplated*, The India Office did not regard Bahrein and Basidu as jui_joar_i nateiia so far as arbitration was concerned. WING COMMANDER McCLAUGHRY stated that from a purely air point of view, the Air Ministry were not greatly interested in either Henjam or Basidu, but they were equally interested with the Admiralty in Gulf affairs generally. If, therefore, the Admiralty considered there was no other suitable alternative to He njam or Basidu, the Air Ministry were inclined to support them fnom a strategical point of view in pressing for retention of either one or the other. -15- : h H 1«/■ V ivlk. PHILLIPS, in reply to a r ecpiest Ly Mr* Laithv/aite, said that the Admiralty had prepared a rough estimate of the cost involved in making a suitable station at Bahrein. CONCLUSION. The ■diD-oaunttee were unable to reach any conclusion on the immediate question at issue - i.e. that of the possible voluntary evacuation of Henjam. The Admiralty took the view that they could in no circumstances agree to the voluntary evacuation of Henjam unless Basidu were retained. But they further took the line that, in viev/ of changed circumstances, they could now no longer agree to the rendition of Basidu except possibly in return for a long lease of Hen jam on terms which His Majesty's Minister in Persia and the Foreign Office consider to be unobtainable. A twenty-five years' tenure under a ’’gentleman' s agreement', as contemplated in the conclusions of the 25th meeting of the Sub-Committee held on the 1st August, 1933, would not now in their view give sufficient security for the continued use of Henjam even in peace conditions. The Foreign Office are of opinion that the alteration in the basis of the proposed negotiations involved in the acceptance of the Admiralty point of view/ would make a resumption of negotiations impracticable, would react disastrously on the attitude of the Shah towards this country, and gravely endanger Anglo- Persian relations. It thus appeared that there was a basic disagree^ ment on a fundamental issue of principle, which it was felt could only be referred to Ministers for decision. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l. 12th October, 1933..^aeret ana i. .6407/33.

October 5, 1935. My dear Gilbert, &gt; Many thanks for your letter P.Z.6051/35 of October 2nd regarding our position at Henjam and the possible desirability of transferring the naval depot to Bahrein. 2. I need hardly say that we entirely agree with the notes by Fowle and Metcalfe on this subject. Indeed their view, that our continued presence at Henjam without ■ adequate legal sanction badly weakens our whole political position with the Persian Government, coincides with that which we have ourselves long been urging on the various departments concerned. 3. As you know. Sir R. Hoare expects to leave for Persia some time next week, and we are anxious to let him have his instructions regarding the possible resump tion of negotiations as soon as we can. Apart, there fore, from the desirability of taking advantage of the presence Laithwaite, Esq.,2. i presence here of Fowle and Metcalfe, we should be glad if any discussion on this question could take place at the earliest possible moment, in order that we may know how we stand in preparing our instructions to the Minister. In these circumstances I hope that it may be possible to arrange to discuss this question in the Middle East Official Sub committee on the afternoon of next Friday, October 6 th, as was suggested in our conversation over the telephone this afternoon. 4. You may perhaps remember that the question has already been discussed in the Sub-Committee - see particularly the final minutes of the 15th Meeting of the Sub-Committee held on December 17th, 1951. As a result of that dis cussion a joint Foreign Office and Admiralty memorandum was prepared and circulated (see paper M.E. (0) 57), but, owing first to the suspension of negotiations following on Sir R. Clive’s departure, and later to the issue of the Persian demand for our withdrawal from Henjam, followed as it was by the Anglo-Persian Oil Companycrisis, the question was notn not pursued. I think, however, that the Foreign Office views on the question of principle involved remain much as stated in those two papers* 5* I am sending copies of this letter to Moore (who has already received a copy of yours to which it replies), and to Parkinson and Hind, Yours ever,c V Secret PoZo£tei/33, Cypher telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India Foreign and Political Department Dated SolOoSS, No 0 of words 174 and 1^4 XXX 2431, It was agreed in connection with the assignment of the Bahrein oil concession to the Bahrein Petroleum Company that a landing ground and seaplane base should be reserved by His Majesty's Government area of which was to be indicated later 0 We wish to be in a position to inform Company of areas selected in immediate future and Admiralty are therefore anxious to consider at once possibility of combining naval station with seaplane base and acquiring necessary area now in case we should later have to move from Henjam 0 S o N o 0o has been instructed to reach Bahrein on 6th October and submit immediate telegraphic report, In view ©f urgency detailed instructions from Admiralty were sent him c/o Gastrell by Air Mail of 30th September (copies to you on same date and to Bushire by Air Mail @f 6th October), Please ask Resident to instruct Grastrell to give SoNoOo*ll possible assistance.

The point appears to have Been raised in Air Ministry letter to the Colonial Office of the 13th fey 1929 No. 3.28333/3.6. On the 24th Pay 1929 (No.69035/29) the Colonial Office replied enquiring whether the Air Council had obtained possession of the site of the landing ground, by lease or otherwise, or if not, in whose possession it at present was. They hinted that since the concession already granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate contained no clause prohibiting the erection of obstructions in the vicinity of the landing ground it might be difficult, if not impossible, at this stage adequately to safeguard the position &gt;PY SE of (41 , nsq., Admiralty, 3.W# 1. • , oaUUE W Ym EKLY UTTVV f ~ 4 0 5 OCTV fBOJ StCHETARY, POLITICAL A&gt;*J ?

The Syndicate's representatives said that they did not anticipate any difficulty with their American associates on this score and they promised to mention the natter to the latter at an early date. It was agreed that in any letter sent to the Syndicate setting out the conditions governing the assignment of the concession a clause to the above effect should be inserted.' 3. The letter sent as a result of interdepartmental discussion to the Syndicate on 16th September 1929 by the Colonial Office (No.69035/29, copy sent to Admiralty) remarked: fti ii ■ ** 3 - 11 (3) H.k.G. also desire to receive an assurance from the Synaicate that neither the Syndicate nor the Company to which it is proposed that the rights of the Syndicate should he assigned, will take any steps which would prejudice the position ox the proposed sites for a landing ground and sea plane station in Bahrein, the precise location of which will he coMiiuniuatea to the Syndicate as soon as possible Trie Syndicate replied on S4th September (copy sent to Admiralty on 5th Ucuober Dy Colonial Office) !f i note the contents of your letter of the 2 0 th instant in reference to the site or sites for the landing ground in Bahrein and await your further letter on this subject as promised. n 5* A letter of 24th October from the Bastern Gulf oil Company to the Eastern and General Syndicate remarked that subject to certain exceptions which did not affect the position oi the landing ground 'the Colonial office letter of September 16th, 1929 is satisfactory.' 6 &lt;&gt; The Colonial Office letter of 3rd January 1930, No.69035/29 (copy sent to Admiralty) finally stated that H.McG* noted 'that the Eastern Gulf Oil Company are prepared to accept, save in so far as the specific points referred to in their letter of 24th October are concerned, the conditions set out in Colonial Office letter of 16th September last.' -m m 7. In the light of this correspondence it seems, I think, fairly clear that we can claim that we have already secured certain undertakings from the Company in respect of landing ground and seaplane accommodation. On the other hand, as was mentioned yesterday afternoon, it is, I think most desirahle that, even if we make a reference in general terms only to the area concerned in any communication made in the immediate future to the Company, we should he in a position, if they point out that it is now four years since we first promised an early communication as to the exact location of the areas in question and that it is unreasonable to expect them to wait longer, to make an immediate statement to them* 8 * I am sending copies of this letter to Colonel Turner at the Air Ministry, ^ A sr Yours sincerely, J.G.

UMy dear Powell, As arranged at yesterday afternoon’s discussion, I send you a copy of Major Holmes’ letter of 23rd April 1928 to the Political Agent* Bahrein, in paragraph 6 of which he indicates the concessions which the Eastern and General Syndicate were anxious to secure in the way of harbour facilities,etc. in and around the Khor Kaliya,and also of his further letter of 5th May 1928 which I did not refer to yesterday but which is relevant in the same connection. We cannot of course be sure that the Bahrein Petroleum Company would wish for similar facilities, but in so far as they have been advised by Major Holmes it seems probable that this would be the case, and in any event Khor Kaliya appears to be the best commercial anchorage.

I hereby apply for and on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. for permission to negotiate an Oil Concession covering the remaining portion of the whole of thejBahrein group of Islands not alienated under the Bahrein Concession Agreement of 2-12-1925 and their Territorial waters. The area for which permission to negotiate for is requested is that portion of the Bahrein islands and its territorial waters which is not included in the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement by which 100,000 acres of the Bahrein Islands was granted to the Eastern &amp; *' General Syndicate Ltd. by H.E* Sheikh Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa Governor of Bahrein on December 2nd, 1925. The total area of the Bahrein Islands including its territorial waters is roughly 198,000 acres approximately 309 square miles. The area granted under the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement is 156 square miles. Therefore this request is for permission to negotiate for the balance of uhe total area including territorial wafers which is 153 square miles equalling 97,920 acres. The terms upon which this area is requested are exactly the same as those laid down in uhe Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement of December 2nd, 1925, FurtherFurther permission is also requested that the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. be allowed to negotiate with H.S. Sheikh Hamad bin Isa A 1 Khalifa for permission to develop the deep waters of Khor Kayila lying to the south of Muharraq and east of Hal at-an-Manas and Has a! Jasra (Essex Point) and the sea and land approaches thereto as a safe harbour for the ships engaged for transporting the Oil and its products won from the Bahrein Islands. Sole rights to the use of the harbour of Khor Kayila are not asked but preferential rights, use and facilities for developing these waters and approaches thereto and preferential rights to the use of the developed harbour and full control over all piers, causeways, docks etc, erected by the Concession holders to develop and make the harbour safe for ships to enter, load and depart oherefrcan If permission be granted to negotiate the writer (who holds a full power of attorney from the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd) will be pleased to submit a draft Concession Agreement for your approval. An early reply to this application is respectfully requested.ILL*— 1 “ —wggMBJiia Letter from Major Prank Holmes of the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. to the Political Agent at Bahrein dated 5th May, 1928. I have to acknowledge and thank you for your letter No*C149 of 1928 dated 3rd May, 1928. I am pleased to note that H.E.Sheikh Hamad is prepared to consider negotiations for further concessions for which I thank him. I am enclosing, herewith, three copies of a draft Concession Agreement drawn up, except for a few alterations required to describe the area now applied for, and a small addition in Clause 1 Schedule III (Mining Lease) referring to harbour rights upon exactly the same terms and conditions as specified in the Bahrein Oil Concession dated 2nd December, 1925. You v/ill note that the area now requested has an area of approximately 97,920 square acres. The harbour, the Company will require to develop in order to facilitate the handling of the Oil won from the area hereby applied for and from the area of our present concession, must have deep water and Khor-Kaliya and adjacent waters is the only one fulfilling this condition. There is one area, however, it is not agricultural land, which my Company would prefer not^ to see alienated from Government hands at this moment. This area in / greater part lies within the Territory covered by the present Bahrein Oil Concession. 1The above mentioned area lies S.E. from Sheikh Ali's Bridge (Sakhir Road) a distance of 4 miles along the coast and two miles wide inland from high water mark, no part of the area lies North of Sheikh Ali’s Bridge, so does not interfere with date gardens. It extends to a point opposite the Southernmost point of Sitra Island. This is almost entirely rocky land except for a few yards from the coast line, there are a few date palms at the Sitra end, but they will not interfere with works necessary to develop the entrance and ohe harbour. ’This area is required upon which to build tanks, refinery and pumping plants and make jetties and wharves etc. to connect with deep water of Khor-Kaliya. Any other unoccupied land can be passed over quite readily without damaging the agricultural efforts to any appreciable extent, if at all« In regard to the Agricultural project mentioned in your letter, as now being considered, that is the leasing out of unoccupied lands I do not thinK that this will interfere with the Company's operations, if we should find it necessary, to run pipe-lines, tramlines or roads over any portion of such lands it will not affect the leaseholder except to a snail extent owing to the small area occupied.

Mr. Metcalfe* could not, of course, commit the Government of India, hut thinks it unlikely that they would dissent from the views expressed in his note and in Colonel Powle’s. fhe extract attached from a private letter from the late oil Hugh Biscoe shows that he was disposed generally uo snare trie views now expressed hy the Besiaent and mr. Metcalfe, and that the hesitations of the political authorities in the Gulf as to the inevitability of Henjam as the Naval Station are not new. : 2. The Henjam question is one of long standing which has been the subject of considerable controversy. The essential facts are that we have no real standing in Henjam. We have consistently admitted that it is Persian territory; our concession is in respect of a Telegraph station within a closely defined area and for specified personnel - both of ■ ’which have long been exceeded, and not for a naval station; and at the most, if we had ream difficulty with Persia, we could only hope for a brief period of delay to enable us to evacuate without discomfort before giving up our concession there. It would be impossible to defena an attempt to retain the concession against the will of tne Persian Government, 3. Secondly, as Colonel Fowle points out, our anxiety to remain at Henjam constitutes a most i important hostage to the Persians, not only in the i present treaty negotiations, tut in our general relations/relations with them, so long, that is, as we have no regular concession entitling us to maintain a naval station there. (We have aimed at securing such a concession as part of a general settlement (cf. Foreign Office instructions of 1932 on F.Z.6100/32 flagged); and the latest suggestion is that we should he content with a 'gentlemen’s agreement'. The latter may he a rather unsatisfactory basis for our remaining at nenjam; while a Treaty article, such as we desire, seems likely to he very difficult to secure save on onerous terms). On general grounds, therefore, if an alternative equally, or even slightly less, satisfactory coula he found, it would he most desirable to leave Henjam and concentrate our forces elsewhere. ( The obvious alternative is Bahrein, which is aaily becoming more definitely the capital of the Gull, which is on the air route and commands the atq.j coast; which may, if the Bahrein Petroleum Company refine their oil locally he a convenient source of oil supply in the future; and where we should oe free from pinpricks, aie Sheikh would welcome our pr further argument In favour of e at Bahrein is that it still fur view of the independent status savour of establishing ourselves still further emphasises our ^ status of that territory. ipricks.

I have confirmed from the Admiralty that they estimate the cost of such facilities, without dredging, at £40,000. I gather confidentially from Colonel Powle that local estimates “ re iaouer lower, and that a figure between £ 20,000 ana £30,000 has been mentioned. It is relevant more- 0 V 6 i &gt; iii this connection theit the prospects of 8, ^ considerable oil development in Bahrein, are at the moment not inconsiderable. If such development takes place, the .Americans, in their om interest, will have to do a certain amount of dredging and clearing of the harbour approaches. We should benefit indirectly by this and the probable ultimate expenditure on equipping Bahrein for use by the naval squadron might be substantially reduced. b. The suggestion has, of course, been made that we should in any event be at a disadvantage at Bahrein because cruisers cannot at present come alongside, while the de v Bpehing (etc. necessary to provide for their doing so woula/BWsefsoice £400,000.I doubt it there is really great substance in this point. Cruisers very rarely appear in the Persian Q-Q 2 .ij save when the Comnandei~ 1.1a— Chief payo one of nig periodical visits or vviienj ±01 poliuiCcti leasonsj! it is thought desirable to show the flag in a cruiser^ and expenditure on the scale mentioned v/ould be quite! disproportionate to the value of the resultant facilities. But the B.I. boats, as Colonel Fowle has mentioned, at present anchor about a mile out of Bahrein; and there is no reason why cruisers in the normal course of events should not do likewise. There might be some inconvenience in landing parties etc., but this is a relatively minor consideration. 6 . The Admiralty have in the past been very strongly opposed to any move. Their arguments are partly strategic; partly that Hen jam suits them and that the climate is better than that of Bahrein; partly that on general grounas it is undesirable to leave Henjam, where we have been since 1867, since our evacuation would be a blow to prestige. As Colonel Towle remarks, we have never been given the strategic arguments in any detail (I gather that they are unknown to the present S.N*Q. ) and the Aeport of the Cnieis or Staff to tiie Persian Gulf sut Committee in (copy attc-Guod; is not of much assistance in on is connection.

As regards the third - -prestige - this I Office has consistently felt that if f or any reason tiie Persians were at any time to make and press a request that we should evacuate Henjam or alternatively were to agree to allow us to remain at Henjam only on quiue unacceptaole terms, there would he nothing for it hut to go, and that from the point of view of prestige it would he very much better to go in our own time and in circumstances which we could explain to the Arab Sheikhs and make appear (as in the case of the removal of the air route to the Arab littoral) to involve no i loss of face on our part, than to go in face of, e.g., a public ultimatum ana time limit set by the Persian Government. The general political advantage of being rid of the Henjam problem has been discussed in paragraph 3 above. 9. Certain of the considerations involved are technical in character and not primarily for this Office. But the point of policy involved is one of #1 first importance, particularly in connection with the ! treaty negotiations, if these are resumed in the near I future. The Department would suggest that we might at once send copies of the notes by Colonel Fowle and lx. Metcalfe to the Foreign Office and the Admiralty ! (copies of our letter could later be sent to the other i Departments represented on the Li dale Last Conmittee) under/6 under a draft on the general lines of that now attached. Arrangements coula then he made before Colonel Fowle and ivm*. Metcalfe leit this country for a discussion of the Question generally either in the Middle hast Committee or interdepartmentally• A decision in favour of evacuating HenJam might oe of decisive importance m connection with treaty negotiations, the value of a successful outcome ho which (and the arguments Indeed for proceeding with which) from our standpoint would he very substantially reduced. If the negotiations were continued we shoul have so much the more to throw into the scale in order to secure our desiderata In regard to the Persian recognition of the position in Bahrein, iamb and Abu Musa, ana possibly retention of the Residency at Bushire. 10 . If the departments concerned agreed as to the xorce of the Resident's arguments, possible alternative recommendations would be (a) an immediate decision to evacuate Hen jam and move to Bahrein. It would be necessary simultaneously to decide whether the whole cost should be borne by H.M.G., and if not, In vhat proportion fie Government of India should contribute. (d) a decision to move to Bahrein if, on negotiations being resumed, it proved impossible (or possible only on unduly onerous terms) to secure our desiderata at Henjam fr( Persia,linute Paper. Department. (ior 1 % n bO iiti itlaiij' lai tiie ajai ae u stS 1712b 5000 3/33 It is to be feared that the Admiralty will raise various objections to this proposal. At the present time the financial difficulty is perhaps by itself a serious one. The strategic objection, apparendy, is that Bahrein is 300 miles away from the entrance to the Gulf, which it would be desired to control in time of war; see the report by the Chiefs of Staff dated 11th , 1928 (P.G. 12), below, v/here it was suggested that, if we could not stay at Henjam, we should seek a base on the Musandim peninsula, on the south side of the entrance to the Gulf. If we stayed at Henjam under a long lease, it may be that our occupation as lessees would enable us to use it in time of war without infringing the neutrality of Persia; the latest proposal, however, is that we should not ask for a lease, but seek merely a gentleman’s agreement. The climatic argument has also to be considered and it might be a good step to obtain expert medical opinion, as suggested by Col. Fowle. It does not seem likely that any firm decision to move from Henjam can be taken at once, but the question might be discussed again in a preliminary way, with a view to preparing the ground for a move, in case developments occur which may make the move desirable at short notice; it might be decided, for example, to take, provisionally and without committing ourselves to a decision, such steps as the preparation of detailed estimates of the cost of the facilities that would be required at Bahrein^, and an expert medical examination of the comparative climatic and health conditions at Bahrein and Henjam.

COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. THE PERSIAN GULF. Report by the Chiefs of Staff. IN July 1928, we were requested to examine and report on the following [uestions :— “(a.) In the apparently altered conditions, is the maintenance of British supremacy in the Gulf still essential to the security of India and Imperial interests ? (6.) If so, what precisely constitutes British supremacy, and what measures are necessary to maintain it ? (c.) The Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 excluded Russia from that part of Persia, where she would have been most dangerous to India and from the waters of the Persian Gulf. The Anglo-Turco-German negotiations of 1912-14 similarly aimed at keeping Germany as far as possible from the Gulf. What means have we now of keeping Russia out of what was once the British sphere ? {di) On the Arabian coast, Koweit and the so-called Trucial Chiefs are constantly threatened by Ibn Saud. Is the maintenance of their independence (and that of Muscat, which is also threatened, though less immediately) necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (e.) Can the existing coaling stations at Kishm and Henjam be moved, without disadvantage, to Bahrein ? ” 2. Subsequently, we were invited to consider the military implications of any concessions which might be made to Persia in respect of navigation in the Shatt-al- Arab, with'special reference to the alteration of the frontier from the lelt ban o mid-stream, and to advise what concessions, if any, could be offered without detriment to our essential interests. 3. We will discuss the above questions seriatim : In the apparently altered conditions, is the maintenance of British supremacy in the Gulf still essential to the security of India and Imperial interests. 4. In order to express a military opinion on this question oi, indeed, on any of the questions which have been referred to us—it is necessary to take stoc o e situation as a whole, and, in particular, to analyse the military implications ot t e changes which have taken place, and of the new developments which ave arisen since the Persian Gulf problem was last reviewed by the Committee ot Imperial Defence. Accordingly, we shall, in the first place, compare om present m e ^ e s s an commitments in the Gulf with those which existed formerly; and we shall en consider whether the potential dangers to those interests are now greater or less than of old. [18256] B‘2 5. In what may be termed the old days, the Persian Gulf was a cul-de-sac leading, so far as we were concerned, nowhere in particular; and our interests in these waters were limited to the following : 'edb j|| assistant {a.) First and foremost, the security of the western frontier of India from invasion from the west; (b.) Secondly, the integrity of our great arterial line of communication w Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East; and (c.) Thirdly, and of course in a far lesser degree, the maintenance of law and order in the Gulf, in the interests of our trade, and for the sake of civilisation. rema 1 Tt the ^ assistant Lever and If be Ireto thronj ion, separt Hav 6. The above interests were deemed to be of sufficient importance to warrant (a.) The declaration that we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by another Power as a very feGulhe grave menace to British interests, and that we should certainly resist ^ ^ n( it with all the means at our disposal; and J§rticnl ar at The maintenance in the Persian Gulf of such minor naval forces as were hired by ^ necessary to police its waters, and to fulfil our treaty obligations with the W ml -. 0W1 Sheikhs on the Arabian littoral. (b.) 7. The interests indicated above are as important to-day as they were in the tie Gulf m past. The commitments involved are in no wise diminished. We will now review It is tn the effect of the developments which have taken place since the subject was last jlikelyintl examined. translate 8. First, the situation in respect of the South Persian oil-fields has substantially altered, by reason of— (a.) The acquisition by the British Government of a controlling interest in these fields; (b.) Their great develoment in recent years; and (c.) The substitution of oil for coal as the fuel of the British Fleet. kkid and As things now stand, the South Persian oil-fields would, in the event of complications with America, constitute the only major source of oil supply under British control. It is clear, therefore, that our interest in the security not only of the fields them selves, but also of the Persian Gulf—as being a vital line of communication to them —is now considerably greater than formerly. 9. Secondly, there is the changed situation at the head of the Gulf. With the collapse of the Turkish Empire, and the emergence of a quasi independent Iraq under British supervision, we have undertaken a new commitment of considerable magnitude. Consequently, the Persian Gulf ; as the principal line of communication to a country in which our interests are now so closely involved, has acquired a corres pondingly enhanced importance. 10. In this connection we also desire to draw attention to the possibilities which are presented by the discovery of oil in Iraq. If this should lead—as seems likely—to the construction of a railway connecting Iraq with the Mediterranean, the result will be an alternative line of communication between Great Britain and India; and the Persian Gulf, which, at the present time, might be described as a terminal branch line would thus become an integral part of an important Imperial highway. 11. Finally, there is the change due to the advent of air power. The provision and security of strategic and civil air routes linking up the widespread component parts of our Empire are now Imperial interests of the first magnitude. In tms connect! 011 it must be remembered that it is a characteristic of aircraft, especially o e arger classes, that, while they are highly mobile under their own power, they are slow and difficult to move by any other means. Accordingly, the establishment ot an organised chain of air bases is an indispensable prerequisite to the full participa tion of our air forces in the scheme of Imperial defence Under present conditions, the only practicable alignment for the air route to the East and Australia is via gyp , raq, the Persian Gulf and India. In fact, the Persian Gulf is now an integral link in^a vital Imperial airway.

So 'lidom iaty relat : q m ^ rom preceding paragraphs that our interests and ccm^ first, , o tir second mitments are undoubtedly greater at the present time than they were in the past s la ^now consi er the dangers to which those interests may be exposed m r In ^ old ^ere was a danger of a challenge from two directions Germany and Russia; but, as regards the latter, a considerable measure of securi y |di| pandGull' i-dajastltjJ : ed. I* incelesM oil-fielisks was assured by the Angio-Russian Convention of 1907, and by the need of Russia for our assistance in Europe. To-day, Germany is eliminated from the problem. But Russia remains, and, moreover, a Russia with whom our relations are now very different. The Convention of 1907 has been wiped off the slate; Russia no longer A ognises the status quo in the Gulf, or, indeed, anywhere else; she no longer desires our assistance in Europe; and she is engaged in activities subversive to our interests whenever and wherever the opportunity presents itself. 14. In considering our commitments in Iraq and our essential communications thereto through the Persian Gulf, we must always bear in mind that we are, in this region, separated from an avowedly hostile Russia only by the weak buffer State of Persia. Having regard to Persia’s military inability to carry out the proper functions of such a buffer (to which we refer again in paragraph 16), and to the pro jected improvement of communications in Persia, the potential menace to our interests in the Gulf regions needs no further emphasis. 15. And there is a new development in the situation to which we invite particular attention. In the old days our interests in the Gulf were held to be secured by the denial of a naval base in those waters to any foreign nation. Now, however, owing to the advent of air power, combined with the improvement of communications through Persia, and the development of the cross-country vehicle, the possibility of the sudden emergence of a Russian air menace on the Persian shore of the Gulf must be faced. It is true that Russia at the present time does not possess, and, indeed, is unlikely in the near future to possess, either the aircraft or the organisation required to translate this threat into action. But it is only right to point out that the materiel and organisation required are far from extensive, and that the technical difficulties involved in an enterprise of the kind envisaged are by no means utoiep; 1 lead' 3 ^:' litenrf Imp® 31 'fi stic of^ Artl#;: i»g« EaVV e per# 11 thef ilr^ unsurmountable. It must also be borne in mind that the narrow seas of the Persian Gulf are an area particularly well suited for air operations against shipping, and that the port of Karachi—an important terminus of the Indian strategic railways—is within striking distance of air forces operating from a base on the Persian littoral. 16. It might, at first sight, seem that the establishment in Persia of a Nationalist regime, determined to rid itself of everything it considers derogatory to its independence and sovereignty, would tend to lessen the menace which we have envisaged in the preceding paragraphs. But there are two serious flaws in such an argument. In the first place Persia, however loudly she may assert her indepen dence, is entirely powerless militarily to defend it. Her navy consists of one small gunboat which is unsea worthy, and her army is negligible. Secondly, while it would certainly be to our advantage if Persia, under the impetus of nationalism, were to emancipate herself from foreign influence and become a really strong sovereign State, there is, we are assured, very little chance of her so doing. Sir Robert Clive told the Persian Gulf Committee that there was no real spirit of nationalism m Persia as a whole,” and that, ££ if the Shah were murdered to-morrow, there would be chaos.” We consider that it would be unwise, in a matter in which our imperia interests and security are so closely involved, to regard the present regime as ot er than an interlude in the historical disorder of Persia. In any event, it would, from a military point of view, be the height of folly to place any reliance wha soever m the ability of the new Persia to act as an effective buffer against Russian aggression. 17. So far, we have considered only the Persian littoral and the major dangers to which our interests are exposed; and it is unnecessary, at this stage o_ our epor , to make more than a passing reference to a potential source of anxiety that n . developed on the opposite shore, namely, the rise 0 tpgemony ov greater part of Arabia, and his constant threats to the Sheikhs, with whom we have treaty relations. We refer to this at some length later m is e P£ r • . p ^ 18. The foregoing analysis of the ££ altered conditions m the Persian Gulf leads us to the following conclusions :— First, our interests and commitments in the Gulf are greater at the present time than they were in the past; and + 11T . inforoeia Vmo Secondly, although the source of the potential changed, the dangers remain ; and, with the advent of air power, they have increased rather than diminished. Accordingly, our answer to the first question addressed to us is that the maintenance of British supremacy in the Persian Gulf is even more essential to the security of India and Imperial interests at the present time than it w as m } [18256] B4 What 'precisely constitutes British supremacy, and what measures to maintain it f are necessary 19. The supremacy that we require in the Gulf must be such as to ensure the integrity of what we hold to be our essential interests. A number of these interests have already been examined, and the remainder will be discussed later in t V Report ; but, in order to present a complete conspectus, they are summarised below (a.) The security of the western frontier of India, and especially of the port of Karachi, from attack based on the Persian Gulf. (b.) The security of our arterial line of communication with Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East, from attack based on the Persian’Gulf (c.) The security of sea passage through the Gulf itself. (d.) The establishment and security of our strategic and civil air routes alrno- the shores of the Gulf. desp ate M h Lite at Portug hevital for toBeut: On tk (e.)

The preservation of cur ordinary trade and other interests in the Gulf regions. 20. The measures which we consider necessary to maintain our supremacy, as defined in the preceding paragraph, are :— (a.) It is as essential now as it was in the days of Lord Lansdowne’s Declaration to prevent any foreign Power establishing a naval base or fortified port in the Persian Gulf. (b.) We should do all that is diplomatically possible to exclude the establishment of foreign air undertakings within striking distance of the Gulf. (c.) We must retain sufficient harbour facilities for our Navy; and these must be conveniently situated for the operation of minesweeping and other vessels that would be required to safeguard the sea passage through the Gulf in time of war. (d.) We should press on with all the measures that are necessary to establish and secure our strategic and civil air routes along the shores of the Gulf. (e.) On the Arabian littoral we should retain the status quo' in its entirety. On the Persian littoral we should maintain the status quo to the utmost limit that political considerations will admit. These questions are dealt with m more detail later in this report. 21 h pejd, ba JltlieYar iiMcontii aiainsupn her, in mry fo sition, or bkUthei 25.

Is the maintenance of their independence necessary for British 'purposes, and if so, how is it to he secured? £ A t 24 i f 01116 fi me past, the whole of the Arabian littoral, with the exception • k ee Fi visually a British Protectorate, resting on a series of treaties with the various Sheikhs, who have been formally promised that ct their independence would continue to be upheld, and that the influence of the British Government would remain supieme. These Sheikhs are now threatened by Ibn Saud, and we are asked whether, in these altered circumstances, the maintenance of their independence is necessary for British purposes. It would be outside our province to express an opinion as to the political advantage, or disadvantage, in abdicating from our present position, or as to the erfect that this might have on our trade or our prestige; and we shall therefore confine ourselves to the military implications of the proposition. 25. A Wahabi occupation of the Trucial coast would, of course, no more endanger our sea communications than does their present occupation of the Red Sea littoral; but it would operate to our disadvantage in many other respects. First, in order to police the Gulf in time of peace,and to exercise control of its waters in time of war, we must have adequate and conveniently situated harbour facilities for our Navy. In view of the possibility of our being compelled to give up the facilities which we now enjoy in the islands off the Persian shore (see paragraphs 27-31), the importance of retaining our special position on the Arabian littoral is considerably enhanced. Secondly, we now have an essential Imperial interest on the Arabian shore, namely, the establishment and security of our strategic air route, which, for political reasons, cannot follow the Persian coast. On this count also, it is most important to retain our present privileged position. Thirdly, we are given to understand that the Wahabis are dependent on India for many of the necessities of life. Consequently, so long as we retain our hold on the Arabian posts, we retain the power to bring pressure to bear on Ibn Saud, effectively and economically. Were we to give up our present position, the same object could be achieved only by a regular and expensive blockade. Finally, there is a question of minor importance in connection with Koweit. This State serves, to some extent, as a buffer protecting the oil refineries and posts on the Shatt-al-Arab against Wahabi aggression, and its absorption by Ibn Saud might increase our difficulties in protecting those important British interests. 26. Our answers, therefore, to this question are as follows :— (a.) Both by our obligations and our own plain interest the maintenance of the independence of Koweit and the Trucial Chiefs is necessary for British purposes; and . . (5.) From a military point of view, the adoption of this policy does not involve any heavy commitments, provided that the necessary naval and air base facilities in the Persian Gulf are maintained. Can the existing coal stations at Kishm and Henjam he moved, without disadvantage, to Bahrein? 27. We have already stated that, in order to exercise control of the Gulf in war, we require bases for our mine-sweepers and other vessels. At the head ol t e ’18256] * See Enclosure 1 to P.G. Paper No. 4, p. 58. B 3(d.) It is possible that a solution of the problem might be found in a Tri-partite Agreement, between Persia, Iraq and Great Britain, under which each of the contracting parties would enjoy freedom of navigation at all times for all their vessels and aircraft. Concluding Remarks. 33. In conclusion, while it is not for us to express an opinion as to the political advantages to be derived from any particular policy, it is our duty, under the terms of our Warrant from the Prime Minister, to estimate, and advise, as to the militarv greater or less than those involved in acceding to it? In the former case we risk the hostility, or, at least, the unfriendliness, of hhy Persia. In the latter we relinquish our present privileged position in the Gulf; and, having done so, we may find ourselves confronted with the necessity of re-establishing it, in order to prevent a hostile Power, such as Russia, dominating Persia and assailing us in the Gulf. We have no hesitation in saying that, from the military point of view, the commitments involved in making any concessions that would weaken our present position are considerably greater than those involved in maintaining the status quo.

AT the present time the frontier between Persia and Iraq on the Shatt-el-Arab is at low-water mark on the Eastern bank except for about 4^ miles in the vicinity of Mohammerah, where it is the centre of the Thalweg. The change under consideration is to shift the frontier to the centre of the Thalweg or to the mid-stream line of the Shatt-el-Arab for the whole or part of the remainder of its length. 2. British naval interests in the Shatt-el-Arab are— (a) freedom of navigation at all times for vessels carrying oil supplies from the Persian oilfields; (b) freedom of navigation for naval armed vessels, transports and vessels carrying warlike stores, in the case of war operations either in Iraq the Persian oilfields area. 9, As ft or 3. If we are at war, whilst Persia is a neutral, she is within her rights— (i) in prohibiting the export of oil, though it is not part of her duty as a neutral to impose any such embargo; or (ii) in prohibiting the supply of oil to any belligerent, though again it is not part of her duty as a neutral to prevent such supplies leaving Persia. 10. As sels/’ifi! ! sake of oi it be an e Such Prohibition on the ground of neutrality might be exercised by Persia in spite of British complaints, either from unfriendliness or as the result of bribery or pressure from a hostile Russia. In such a contingency, whether the frontier was on the Thalweg or as at present would make no difference. 4. If, however, Persia observes the normal rules of neutrality, supplies of oil may be shipped direct to any territory under British or Neutral control. Again, the position of the frontier would make no difference. Freedom of Navigation for Oilers. 5. On the other hand, the question of oil being supplied regularly, e.g., more man once within three months, direct to a belligerent warship in Abadan or through in aval Auxiliaries or Merchant Vessels acting as Tenders from Abadan, and pro- of\he fronti^ ^ ^ e ^^ ere nt warship, is one which might be affected by the position , position if Iraq is a Neutral .—If the frontier was shifted to the cen re o ^ e Ihalweg so that the waters off Abadan were Persian, it would certainly e eisia s uty as a neutral to prevent supplies being furnished regularly direct to a Belligerent warship or fleet. nn 5 &amp; ^ : p , W ltl ' the frontier in the present position it might, in theory, be contended that, !ArAl 1S neutra r; a Naval tender having Abadan with oil direct for the fleet, would ,, y r ?,p n . s ? , eisl . a s neutrality until such time as the Persian Government takes fromVV wA 19 , 61; for ’ in th eory, it is Iraq that is compromised, as it is nreveA bi, Wat t erS . t l iat the ' s ' essel P roce eds, and it is Iraq’s duty as a neutral to repeated supplies 18 ecoimn S a base for the naval operations of a belligerent by is our -\ \\\ Iraq is an Ally. —If Persia is a friendly neutral and Iraq comoromised hf I i neu . tra lty n Would &gt; il is thought, and as indicated above, be direkTs the nnANTfl 0 wars h 1 ps and naval tenders actually supplying the fleet the chanoc of frmiH Abad fl 1 would appear to become “ a base of operations.” H 80 ” ttie change of frontier would not alter the position. '!■ As ^ f»r '•a of a i -0W Nsttifc %IC 0 A]' Summary. 8. To summarise the situation regarding the supply of oil to us as a belligerent from the Persian oil-helds, Persia being a neutral, the following is the position {a.) Persia would be within her rights in prohibiting supply of oil to us (vide 4 paragraph 3). ^ v (b) If, however, Persia observes the normal rules of neutrality, oil mioht be shipped to any territory under British or neutral control ° (mate paragraph 4). In both the foregoing the position of the frontier on the Shatt-el- Arab makes no difference. (c.) Under normal rules of neutrality the supply of oil regularly direct to a warship either at Abadan or through auxiliaries or tenders loaded at Abadan would be affected by the change of frontier as follows : (i.) With the present frontier.—li Iraq was neutral, such supply would violate Iraq, but not Persian, neutrality. If Iraq was oiir Ally, Persian neutrality would be violated. (ii.) With the frontier at the centre of the Thalweg. Such supply would violate Persian neutrality, whether Iraq was neutral or our Ally. If Iraq was neutral, Iraq neutrality would not be violated. Conclusion. 9. Asa regular supply of oil direct to the fleet in war is not contemplated, the concession of a change of frontier to the centre of the Thalweg would probably not in practice be detrimental to our interests. Freedom of Navigation for Armed Vessels. 10. As regards (fb) of paragraph 2, “ freedom of navigation for naval armed vessels,” if it were necessary to undertake operations in the Persian oil-fields for the sake of our oil supplies, then a change of frontier to the centre of the Thalweg might be an advantage, in so far as it would theoretically allow us to navigate the Shatt-el-Arab without embroiling Iraq. (In practice, however, it would be impossible to avoid entering the Iraq part of the Channel.) Iraq may become a member of the League of Nations in 1932, according to the Treaty signed in London last December. In the circumstances, however, in which it would be necessary to take such action in Persia, it is probable that our relations with, or requirements in, Iraq would also necessitate Iraq being an Ally, in which event the position of the frontier would be cf little operational importance, but the present frontier would give us a larger control over neutral vessels. 11. On the other hand, if it were necessary to undertake operations in Iraq and Persia was an unfriendly neutral, it might be exceedingly objectionable to have the frontier line in the centre of the Thalweg, as Persia would be within her right in laying mines in her half of the river—even if she had ratified Hague Con- venticn VIII, 1907, which she has not done. Moreover, it would, in practice, be impossible to avoid entering the Persian half of the Channel, and Persia might object to the passage of transports with personnel or stores and of warships through her waters (cf. Holland attitude in the Great War). Conclusion. ii# : let# G# $1$ 12. As regards freedom of navigation for armed naval vessels, therefore, a change of frontier to the centre of the Thalweg would never be of practical advantage to this country, but might be disadvantageous. ^ i i &lt;? . The frontier in the region of Mohammerah is the centre of the Thalweg boi a distance of about 4^ miles. Any extension of this portion, even if oftty to include Abadan Town, might increase the difficulties envisaged above. On the other hand, a short stretch of alteration of frontier off the port of Abadan might not be a practical disadvantage to us and would form a concession to Persia if such is earnestly desired. General Considerations. 5 # 13. A practical consideration in regard to the centre of the Thalweg as the ly frontier is that it would be difficult to establish this line owing to the shitting nature of the banks forming the bars and shallower parts of the river.10 14 A further consideration both in pence mid m nr 'which is nffected by n chimp*© ^ . ti ’ 1 1 * ^ £ 4-l^y-v K I o I 1-vr -f rxD ^ „ m Q o£ frontier is that of the dredging of the channel, especially the Rooka Channel, which may reasonably be claimed now to be the exit of the Shatt-el-Arab into the Gulf Any change of frontier which gave part ol the Ghannel to Persia would have to be accompanied by stipulations as to the upkeep of the Channel; otherwise \ supply of oil might be seriously interfered with. 15 The present position as regards the frontier at the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab and in the area of the Rooka Channel is not perfectly clear. By the Treaty of Erzeroum, 1847, £C Persian ships shall have the right to navigate the said river in full liberty from the place where it flows into the sea, as far as the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties. i ^ rr i i This appears to give the river mouth to Turkey, and consequently now to Iraq. In the Turco-Persian Protocol, 1913, the frontier line was shown in red on maps, and according to map 4, the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab and all the Rooka Channel are Persian Territorial waters. Persia has lately tried to repudiate this Protocol as not having been ratified bv her, but we maintain it to be in force on the grounds that it did not^require ratification. The scale of the map was, however, a small one, and the Southern end of the red line finishes somewhat indefinitely, and probably was drawn in ignorance of the exact position of the Channel where it flows into the Gulf. 16 In this connection, it should be noted that the channel through the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab is being dredged by the Iraq Government as the result of an agreement made between the Iraq Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1925, in which the Persian Government had no part whatever. The Iraq Government, through the port of Basra Directorate, levies dredging dues on shipping crossing the bar. | 17. It is important that the situation at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, including the Rooka Channel, shall not hinder free access to the channel by Iraq, and this should be borne in mind in any negotiations. 18. Lastly, it must not be overlooked that Persia derives a very large part of her revenue from her oil-fields, and it is in her interests not to disturb their activity,; 19. It is possible that a solution of the frontier problem might be sought on the lines of a Tripartite Agreement between Persia, Iraq and Great Britain (the Mandatory Power), allowing freedom of navigation for all vessels and aircraft at all times. Such an Agreement could be represented to Persia as a concession to her nationalism, especially if the change of frontier opposite Abadan Town was conceded, and to Iraq as a confirmation of her right of unrestricted access to the Gulf, taking into consideration the present position of the frontier opposite Mohammerah. Om place in the Agreement would rest on our position as a Mandatory Power, buf continue after the termination of the Mandate if the Agreement was made for ar indefinite period. Tinder the Mandate we are entitled at all times to use the pork of Iraq for the movement of armed forces and the carriage of fuel and supplies. Persia should also be offered by this Agreement suitable representation on the administrative body for the Shatt-el-Arab. If such a solution was found not to be feasible, then it is not considered there would be any serious additional disadvantage to the present position if Iraq was to concede the portion of the River opposite Abadan Town as far as the centre of the Thalweg. General Conclusion. 20 . There appear to be three courses open, viz :— (1.) To grant Persia nothing, i.e., to stand by Treaty rights. (2.) To make a tripartite agreement {vide paragraph 19). (3.) To grant Persia up to the centre of the Thalweg opposite Abadan. rtf' i (3) is not a gift in our hands, but in those of Iraq. (1) may be desirable but makes no concession. solution If it is necessary to make a concession then (2) is put forward as a h wrmlri j. • p i pT ^-r&gt; Persia s pan, which would safeguard our interests, but if a change of attitude on r u. and her recognition of Iraq were forthcoming, either (2) or possibly (3) negotiated between the three parties interested &amp; September 27, 1928.

I agree entirely with Colonel Fowls 1 s main point which is I understand that, if we could say to the Persian Government that we no longer require Hen jam, our position with regard to the general Treaty negotiations would be very much strengthened and we should no longer have to submit to pin-pricks from the Persians in order to avoid eviction from a £&gt;lace, where we admittedly have no right to be without Persian consent. The only further point which seems to deserve consideration is what would be our position at Hen jam in the event of war with a third Power e.g. Russia or Japan, in which Persia remained neutral Would our occupation of Henjam with our naval forces not constitute a violation of Persian neutrality to which j* Persia would be bound to object as long as the Island remains Persian territory* The position at Bahrein would presumably be different as the Sheikh is already in close alliance with us and would have no inducement to remain neutral. At any rate it seems desirable that the whole question of a transfer of the naval base from Henjam to Bahrein should be considered in detail from the points of view suggested by Colonel fowls without delay.y} r7 ' H .i / $ -••v. \ m n~f rO 'X ■ ' H? \JL ’^-' xx.. ^ ) Mr. Walton^ In my note of the 4th on the Basidu Flag incident I dealt with its immediate repercussions. I feel, however, that even wider issues are concerned affecting our general policy in Persia and the Persian Gulf. If our naval base, for instance, instead of being in Persian territory at Henjam was elsewhere, in Arab territory, Bahrein for instance, the incident would not have occurred, as presumably our main interest in Basidu is as an alternative base to Henjam in case the Persians at any time definitely order us to quit the latter place. Once the base is installed at Bahrein, Basidu would presumably lose interest for us and possibly the question of renouncing it altogether in return for some quid jrro q-qq from the Persian Government could be consiciered. 2* The questions of Henjam and Basidu are thereiore, in a certain sense, interdependent^and politically our presence in the former place appears to me a definite source of weakness.

In the considerable volume of official d literature with which Henjam is entrusted, I do not remember to have seen them detailed, though perhaps I may have missed them. If they have not been detailed I venture to suggest that it would be of interest to learn what they are. With regard to B. This is also a weighty consideration but I do not think that a detailed estimate of the cost of a move to Bahrein has ever been drawn up.

'They qui^ 6 appreciate the soundness of your proposal from a business point of view* But they feel that if we were to buy land without making use of it when bought, there is a real danger that the reason for the purchase would become known to the Persians and that we can afford to take no action which would give the Persians the impression that H*M# Government are weakening in oheir intention to remain at Henjam. It appears to them that the possible financial advantage in a speculative purchase J.G.Laithwaite Esq.., India Office, S.W.I.of land at Bahrein now is remote in comparison with the political disadvantages. They have decided, therefore, to take no action - at any rate for the present. I am sending a copy of this letter to Evans.

The Air Force have leased a landing ground at Manama from the Sheikh of Bahrein for a period of ten years, with a right to extension for a further ten years. We acquired this landing ground both for purposes of Service and of civil aviation and have also a rest house and a W/T Station on Bahrein Island. Lately we have had difficulty, as the surface has proved to be unsuitable for the heavy aircraft used by Imperial Airv/ays, who have consequently obtained on short lease another landing ground on Muharraq. Island, where another rest house has been provided. Our Works people are, however, trying to improve Manama sufficiently for it to be used by all types of landing machines, and, if they are successful, Muharraq. will probably be given up. No early decision is, however, likely on this point. We have had a good deal of discussion lately with the India Office and Foreign Office about the policy with regard to landing grounds on the Persian Gulf Air Route, and the arrangement, which is most likely to be followed in the future, is that all action for the purchase of lease of land in the Persian Gulf will be taken through the Resident, and that there will be no more direct settlements between Sheikhs and the local Air Force authorities. If the^Admiralty^ therefore wanted anything at Bahrein the Resident, rather than the Air Ministry, would be your appropriate agent. I enclose a map shov/ing the location of the two banding grounds and of the rest house and petrol house at Bahrein. May I have this back at your convenience? J.S.Banes Esq.., G.B., Admiralty, Whitehall, S.W.I.j ^ +1 ^• e 't nie know if there is ahy farther information which we can supply. Apart from what I have indicated, no further facilities are likely to'be required at Bahrein at present, either for Service or for civil aviation.

OrVj * c Dear Moore, ,, V,-.^/T- ■ / ( Would you kindly refer to your letter to Parkinson of the 1st May, No.P.D.04289/33, about the Bahrein oil concession, in which the Admiralty indicated that they were anxious to secure, in the event of removal of the naval station from Henjam to Bahrein, the positions suggested for base buildings, recreation ground, etc. shown on the chart of which I return a copy to you herewith? 2. It is quite clear that if and when we have to make this move, the areas in question, if bid for in the open market and if it is known that attach importance to acquiring them, will cost a very substantial sum of money, and I&gt;rite to put on record the suggestion made at our meeting yesterday by Captain Prior, late Political Agent, Bahrein, that much the best course would be to purchase them strai^it away. Captain Prior indicated that the title to the areas in question was a matter of some doubt, a vague claim to them being maintained by Sheikh Mohamed. He added that he was inclined to think that an amount of, say, Rs.10,000 or^ Rs. 15,000 at the outside would probably sufiice au this stage to purchase outright the whole ofjthe areas desired, but that as the town has already reached the line shown in red and there are signs of further extension in the same direction, the market value will certainly increase in the near future.

I personally do not think Hen jam is the only alternative, neither does the S.N.O. I think we could with a certain amount of expenditure, establish a much more convenient Base at Khor Kaliya on the Southern side of Bahrein. Haworth had it surveyed by the Nearchus. The pros and cons are as follows:- Pr&amp;s. (1) We could do what we liked there. At present, if the Navy want to level a cricket pitch at Hen jam, authority has to be obtained from Teheran. This is a concrete case, at present under reference to the Minister. (2) If the Residency is transferred there, they would be in close contact with the Political Resident. (3) Normally one sloop is on the South of the Gulf and one on the North. It would be a convenient centre, for we could arrange greater amenities, and naval officers would meet outside people. Cons . (X) Jt would cost about £15,COO, possibly more, to dredge the entrance, light and buoy the place and erect canteens etc. (2) For 3 months in the year the climate is bad; worse than Henjam, but not, I think, worse than Basidu. During these 3 months, however, one sloop could spend a good deal of time at Basrah, oiling at Abadan, and the other at Khor Jarama and Muscat, oiling at the latter place, where it is proposed to put a barge.INDIA OFFICE. - Oil Concession signed by the Shaikh of Bahrein in favour of the Eastern and General Syndicate on the 2nd December 1925.® AGREEMENT between Shaikh Hamad Bin Shaikh Issa At qi -n of Bahrein of the one part, hereinafter called “the Shaikh” and the Eastern^ 1 ^ General Syndicate Limited of the other part, hereinafter called “ the Company.” d Article 1.

(paper No. M.'E.(O) 57). 4. Minutes of a Meeting of the Sub-Committee held on December 171 UiJ .931. (M.E.(O) 15th Minutes.) In the absence of Mr. Parkinson, the chair was taken by Mr. Rendel who briefly explained the position as it had been in 1931-32 and as outlined in paper No. M.E. (0) 57 and in the Minutes of the fifteenth meeting. The question had then been postponed owing to various developments, such as the departure of Sir R. Clive, the Persian demand for our withdrawal from Henjam, and, subsequently, the Anglo-Persian Oil dispute. In view of the impending resumption of negotiations for an Anglo-Persian Treaty settlement, it had now again become a live issue. MR. LAITHWAITE said that in the past successive Secretaries of State for India had been disposed generally to support the Admiralty view as to the desiraoility of retaining Henjam if this was in any way possible. Sir Samuel Hoare.was, however, now inclined to think that there was much force in the arguments contained in the notes by Colonel Fowl© and Mr. Metcalfe which nad been circulated, but he proposed to postpone a decision until the results of the present discussion were available. iThe essential facts vjeie that, desirable as it was to remain at Henjam if this was at all possible, in the first place we had no real standing there; we had consistently admitted that it was Persian territory; we had no concession for a naval station; and at the most if we had real difficulty with Persia we could only hope for a brief delay to enable us to evacuate without discomfort before giving up our concession. It would be impossible to try to retain it against the will of the Persian G-overnment. Secondly, our anxiety to remain at Henjam constituted a most important hostage to the Persians, not only in the present treaty negotiations, but in our general relations with them. Thirdly, there seemed little prospect of securing a Treaty article to regulate our position such as we desired, save on disproportionately onerous terms and the latest suggestion that we should be content with a 'gentleman’s agreement' might be a rather unsatisfactory basis for our presence. Finally, in the event of war, we could not use Henjam so long as Persia remained neutral save at the cost of violating Persian neutrality. In these circumstances there seemed much to be said for leaving Henjam and concentrating elsewhere, if an equally, or even slightly less, satisfactory alternative could be found. It had been generally accepted that the only alternatives to Henjam were Basidu and Bahrein. As regards Basidu, our position was, in the view of the India Office, probably legally much better than in Henjam and we had been in unchallenged occupation fhr a much longer period. But they did not think that it was by any means impregnable and on the whole the balance of advantage seemed, if we decided to move from Henjam, -2-definitely to rest with cutting our connection with the Persian shore and going to Bahrein. The arguments against removal to Bahrein had Been summarised in Colonel Fowle’s notes. They were essentially for the technical departments to pronounce on 0 So far as the strategic argument was concerned, Henjarn or Basidu had obvious advantages of position. But would it not be possible to command the neck of the Gulf in time of war by emergency stations on Tamb, Abu Musa, etc.? Moreover, if in time of war Persia were on our side we could use either Basidu or Henjam. The second difficulty was climatic. It was not clear that there was really very much to choose between Bahrein and Basidu or Henjam, but the point might, as suggested by the Resident, be investigated, on the spot. The third and most substantial argument was finance. The water at Bahrein was shallow and dredging would be needed before it could be made a convenient station. The Admiralty had estimated that it would cost £40,000 to do the necessary dredging for sloops, and £400^000 for cruisers. Mas the cruiser point of much importance? Cruisers very rarely came up the Gulf: when they did they could use the same anchorage as was at present used by the B.I. boats. It seemed unjustifiable in any circumstances to spend nearly half-a-million merely in order to enable occasional cruisers to enter the harbour. On the other hand, if expenditure of the order indicated would fitBahrein for nae sloops it \&lt;vas for consideration vvnetner it might not he faced, in view of the apparent advantages, political and otherwise, of concentrating on Bahrein. It was relevant, too, that if, as seemed probable, the Bahrein Petroleum Company struck oil in commercial quantities, they would, in their own interest, nave to do a certain amount of dredging and clearing cf tin., hc,i ooui approacries. v/e should loeneiit indirectly oy tais and the probaole ultimate expenditure might be substantially reduced. The final argument against removal was that of prestige. There was obvious force in this. But it now seemed clear t hat if for any reason the Persians were at any time to make and press a request that we should evacuate Hen jam, or if, alter natively, they were to agree to allow us to remain at Hen jam only on quite unacceptable terms, there would ce nothing for it but to go. Prom the point of view of prestige it would he very much better to go in our own time and in circumstances which we could explain to the Arab sheikhs and make appear (as in the case of the removal of the air route to the Arab littoral) to involve no loss of face on our part, rather than in face of, e* g,, a public ultimo turn and time limit set by the Persian Government. Mr. Metca 11e and Colonel Pew1e expresced their general agreement with Mr. Laithwaite’s statement cf the o o s i t i o n. MP. KEHDEL said that the question of our possible removal from Hen jam could be considered under three aspects. In the first place there was the political issue, which had been developed by Mr. Laithwaite - i.e. the desirability -4-technical side of tho matter or otherwise, from the point of view of our relations with Persia, of putting an end to a situation the continuance of which would mean that Persia would always have a lever v/hich she could use against us« Our lack of any legal right to he in Hen jam, and our anxiety to remain there, in the view of the Foreign Office seriously weaken our political position with Persia, Secondly, there was the technical aspect of the question ~ i.e. whether the proposed move would he physically and financially practicable, rhis involved technical and strategical arguments which could only he developed hi the experts. Thirdly, there was what he termed the tactical aspect i.e. if it were agreed that the proposed move was politically desirable and technically practicable, what should be our line about it in dealing with the Persians? Should our intentions be announced at once or- kept secret as long as possible, and should the proposed move be represented as a concession to Persia or as a decision taken independently foi our own convenience, as in the case of the transfer of tie air route? As regards the political aspect, the Foreign Office had • - 1 • 11 +cr n-f the ^ove, and entirely agreed always urged the desirahili with the views expressed by the India Office. The tactical aspect would have to be considered after a decision on the question of principle had been reached. Meanwhile, he suggest ed that the Admiralty should explain their views on theGAPTAI- : MOORE said that, v;ith reference to the change of no 1 icy advocated in paragraph 1 of Colonel Powle f s note (i.e. voluntarily giving up Kenjam) the Admiralty did not agree that if rienjam v/ere evacuated, the importance of Basidu would he lessened; rather would it he increasedi as sane advanced base at the entrance of the Gulf was necessary. In 1326 the rendition of pasidu was only considered as a concession in return for a satisfactory settlement at Henjam. Since then the chances of obtaining a satisfactory agreement seemed to have steadily dwindled until we reached the position recorded at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on 1st August last, when it r&amp;a thought that our position at Hen jam would have to hang on a 'Gentleman's Agreement'. In view of recent incidents in the Persian Gulf which had occurred since the meeting of the Sub-Committee on the 1st August last, the Aamralt./ n^„ that not much value CO uld he a ttached to any 'Gentleman’s Agreement' with the Persian Government. They noted the • ^ t ~ - n 'hc-'o isr .-as out forward political objections to remaining m ne^j&amp;n « _ by other Departments. The Admiralty did not consider tnat our position at Basidu, which was now recognised to be nucr -. -»r^p sin mi Id be ~iven un in or lor tetter than was sunposeo m 1 =&gt;* 8 , snoj^ ° i , -r-.prt' f for the use of Eenjanij to obtain a ’'Gentleman s which, in their view, would not be satisfactory. ^ ilr! p-ree with the view that Banrein The Acmiraxty coux^ ^ - -t wpn for the oeace time was the best strategical sxue. x,/en xor . . 0 rot , a3 good as Benjam or Basidu duties of the sxiops i, wao not as b + f he ^racial coast.

Both these questions had lately 'been re-investigated and it appeared likely that, under modern conditions, Basidu could be made comparatively healthy and that the depth in the approaches to the anchorage would be sufficient to take modern cruisers which drew less water than former types. His instructions, therefore, were that the Admiralty were again considering Basidu as a naval station. Our legal position in Basidu had been examined by the Admiralty and appeared to them by no means untenable as suggested by the Foreign Office In view of the latter f s opinion, therefore, the Admiralty considered that the case should be referred to the responsible law officers for a legal opinion as to whether cur rights there could be upheld. If Henjam was to be given up?in the Admiralty view, there were two alternatives. The first was, to use Basidu as a naval station in lieu of Henjam; while, if, after examination of our legal position there ?this c.ou rse was undesirable our second course would Goo to use Bahrein as the main station, Basidu remaining available as an advanced anchorage under the existing conditions. If and when a war came it could be decided in the light of existing circumstances whether Basidu should be used or not.MS. REND EL said that the Admiralty appeared now to be pressing Dor the retCfUtion ox Basidu en strategical grounds. Nhen the question of cur continued use of Hen jam had Been under discussion it had Been pointed out that the station could not he used as a base in time of war if Persia were neutral, and the Admiralty had 'been at pains to emphasise that they desired to retain the station not as a strategic base hut for its re creational facilities. The word 'base' had therefore purposely been avoided in all these discussions. The Admiralty were now demanding the retention of Basidu on strategic grounds which, as he had explained, could not apply in the case of Hen jam. The two questions therefore did not seem to depend en each other and it seemed to him that the Admiralty were raising the Basidu issue on an entirely new basis. MR. GRIEVE agreed, and pointed out that the new Admiralty attitude in regard to Basidu was the crux ox the whole matter . SIR R, HOARE considered that the Admiralty view regarding Basidu set the clock back on our negotiations several yv^^rs. The Admiralty said that they now wished to retain Basidu in view of the difficulty of getting a formal and satisfactory lea^e of Henjam. In his view we were far more likely to get satis faction as regards Henjam by a 'Gentleman s agreement' Persians than by a formal lease. In either case the success or failure of the arrangement would depend on mutoal goodwill. - mh regard to the war “aspect raised Captain Moore, he had always understood that the harbour at Basidu could no. easily be defended against submarine attack, and that air advanced base would be the Alphinstone inlet on the Musandum peninsular.-9- CAPTAIN MOORN said that in the past the Admiralty- policy as regards the lass had taken more account of the peace factors* Non that a change of policy as regards Kenjam had been, suggested the Admiralty considered that in a fresh review of the situation both the peace time and strategical points of view should be taken into account* Prom the strategical point of view the Admiralty attached great importance to having some station at the mouth of the Gulf. In his view the possibility of a submarine attack against Basidu was remote and certain anti-submarine measures were possible. MR, RENDER said that from what had just been said it seemed clear that if we could not obtain a long formal lease of Hen ism (which It had been agreed would bo rractically impossible )9 and if the only solution therefore were a“gentleman’s agreement” on the lines recommended by Sir R. Hoare 9 the Admiralty would now prefer to leave Henjam as soon as an alternative could be arranged, rather than continue there under a'gentleman's agreement', notwithstanding Sir E. Hoare's view that a 'gentleman's agreement'would he equivalent to a lease. MR. GRIEVE pointed out that if we transferred the depot from Henjam to Bahrein, our tenure at Bahrein would still he precarious in view of the Persian claim to that island. MR. rekrEL explained that this need not necessarily he an insuperable difficulty, since the suggestion had been that the transfer from Henjam to Bahrein should be aade in IKconnexion with a general treaty settlement with Persia., and one of the main objects of that settlement would he to secure the abandonment of the Persian claim to Bahrein*, As regards the Admiralty suggestion that we should establish a war base at Basidu 9 II r 0 Pend el wished to point out that Basidu was not British territory. The present Admiralty attitude suggested thht they regarded the concession there as equivalent to a. Bricish colony* The foreign Office could not agree with such an attitude. The concession had been granted to us in rather obscure circumstances by a previous ruler, and, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, could not in any case be regarded as conferring on us any sovereign rights over 'one territory which must therefore be regarded as remaining Persian, In these circumstances it seemed to him that the sciategic arguments advanced by the Admiralty were no more applicable in the case of Basidu than in that of Hen jam, since we should not legally be able to use Basidu in time of war unless Persia were an ally, in which case we could equally use Henjam or any other poinu on tnc i ^rsien coast, CAPTAIN HOOKE suggested that the question v.hether . . n T “1 P 3 'U.

If Law Officers’ opinion were favourable, and medical reports were satisfactory, mu, Aumnaity might transfer the naval depot from Henjam to Basidu,where they would regard themselves as completely free to take whatever steps they liked. If the Law Officers ? opinion were unfavour able 9 we should he no worse off than we were at present 5 end it would still he open to us to try to retain our present position at Basidu 3 whatever attitude the pe rsians might adop 1 0 MR, RE 1 TPEL 5 while he could not cemait his higher authori ties without consulting them 5 , chd not consider that the Foreign Office would raise any objection to a reference of the question of our rights to Basidu to the Law OfficerSe It would 3 however^ be quite Impossible to consult the Law Officers without raising the question of sovereignty and if 9 as he personally thought certain,, the Law Officers decided that Basidu was not under British sovereignty, he considered that it would be legally impossible for us to use it as a base in time of ware But in cny case he was convinced that the action contemplat ed by the Admiralty would provoke a first-class conflict with Persia, The Persians were convinced that Basidu was Persian territory,, and if we started increasing our claims or activities there, they would inevitably challenge our positiono It would oe perfectly easy for then to take us to arbitration, and even in the unlikely event of the Law Officers' opinion being in favour of the Adairalty view, it was by no mans certain that we should be, able to establish our case before an international tribunal. If uho Law Officers’ opinion were unfavourable, it would be the height of folly to provoke a conflict with the Persians as we should only be ignominiously defeated before any international tribunal, and our subsequent evacuation would put us in a most humiliating position. •IdHe did not, however, wish in any way to oppose a reference to the Law Officers, provided that it was understood that one action co 'be taken thereafter should 'be reconsiderec in the light of the opinion given* His chief objection to a reference to the Law Officers was the delay which would he entailed. Le pointed out that uhe attitude which the Admiralty were no?/ adopting involved a reversal of the conclusions which had 'been agreed to at the meeting of the sub committee of August 1st * It had then been agreed that Sir R. Hoare should be authorised to try to secure a Gentleman ? s agreement providing for our continued use of Hen jam for, if possible, 25 years, and that the agreement of various departments on other points to form part of a general settlement already given, should be taken as still holding good. On this basis draft instructions had already been prepared for Sir R. Hoare, who was due to leave for Persia on October lithe The Admiralty now proposed to reverse these conclusions, and said that they could no longer accept a Gentleman’s agreernen tbr the continued use of Hen jam, which was all that Sir Ro Hoare and the Foreign Office thought could be f obtained, and that they must insist on the retention of Basidu?which ?/e had already offered to give up to tho Persians as part of a general settlement, anu in regarG. to which, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, our legal position was extremely doubtful. This meant that if the Admiralty persisted in their present view, it would be impossible to issue the proposed instructions to Sir R,, Hoare and almost certainly impracticable to resume negotiations at alioh -13- w SIR REGINALD HOiNIE said that if we withdrew our offer to relinquish Easidu it would he necessary to offer a makeweight of first class importance ? and past discussions showed conclusively that there was nothing available for this purpose. In offer to relinquish lien jam Instead would he regarded hy the Persians as of no value, since we had no right to occupy Hen jam and had admitted that we had none. His position on his return to Tehran vis-a-vis the Shah would he impossible, if he had to withdraw our offer to return Basidu. before leaving this country he would, like to have a ef ini to instructions on this matter. (At this point the Foreign Office were communicated with and it was arranged that Sir Reginald Hoare's departure should he delayed until a decision had been reached). CAPTAIN MOORE stated that it was not so many year.j ago ■i • wo q t indies, had been instructed, that the Coinmander-in-ohiel, -nn.t - L - ~ ? + n-p -Khp Pm^ei pm Office, to use torcc, if v/ith the agreement oi tne roieign - ? necessary, to prevent the collection of taxes hy Persians in Basidu. He thought this bore out the Admiralty view as to our rights at that place. The recent change on the Admiralty point of view as regards a 'Gentleman's Agreement' was the result of the behaviour of the Persians during recent weeks, and also of the Resident’s opinion given in the papers before the Comaltteo that neither a lease nor other arrangement would obviate the risk of further incidents (K.E. (0) 104). It was obvious that the Persians could not bo relied on, .... tb ought that they were therefore justified in and the Admiralty thougm, --i reconsidering their attitude.MR. RENDER pointed out that the decision to resist the collection of taxes did not affect the question of sovereignty and he reminded the Admiralty that they had agreed, though no doubt with great reluctance, that the Basidu incident could be regarded as closed provided a satisfactory reply to our last note were received from the Persian Government. It would be impossible both to regard the incident as closed, and at the same time to invoke it as a justification for the modification of our policy towards Persia, CAPTAIN MOORE pointed out that a satisfactory reply had not yet been received from the Persians. Even assuming that the Basidu incident was closed, it was still necessary to take into account the attitude of the Persians since that incidentc COLONEL FOWLS, in reply to a point raised Toy Colonel Mackesey, said that the Musandam Peninsula had seen fully explored with a view to finding a suitable alternative anchorage near the mouth of the Gulf. Climatic conditions, however, rendered this location impossible, even with modern amenities. WING COMMANDER MeCLAUGHRY also stated that a reconnaissance of this peninsula had revealed that a peace time flying boat station could not be located there also for climatic reasons, u 4 -ioo 4 - -tup. -nQp of Muscat had 'been CAPTAIN MOORE observed that t-e use to-is ’ViP'PTi ruled but owing to an considered.

While the Bahrein Petroleum Company have not so far raised the question, it seems not improbahle that their policy would follow that of the Syndicate. The possibility that the Bahrein Petroleum Company will proceed to take up a mining lease in next December is an additional reason for immediate action, since if, as H.M. Government hope, the Company decide to erect a refinery on the island, it is highly probable that they would select a site adjacent to the deep water which lies to the south-east of Ras-al-Jasra* 3, The matter is complicated by two further considera tions. The first of these is that if, as is probable, the Bahrein Petroleum Company on taking up their lease, include the North-East corner of Bahrein Island in one of the three blocks of land which they would be entitled to claim, there will be no means of preventing them from occupying and operating on any of the suitable land bordering on the Hor Kaliya, except by explaining that the land is required for a landing ground and a seaplane base. The reason for this is that the Company have, at an earlier stage, accepted a condition whereby H.M. Government reserve to bhemselves the right to take up land for this specific purpose, although under their lease they will have the right to take up any other land they require within the areas allotted to them. 4. The other consideration is that if, at the present stage in the Anglo-Persian negotiations, land is taken up provisionally far the purpose of the Naval Base at Bahrein, it is of first importance that the matter should be kept secret. It is proposed to ensure this by explai ning uo the Bahrein Petroleum Company that the land reserved is intended for the landing ground and seaplane station which have already been mentioned to them, and to lend colour to thisexplanation by arranging for the lease to he taken up in the name of the Air Ministry and not the Admiralty. 5 * As you will he aware, the Air Ministry already have a landing ground which lies south of al Manamah and to the south west of Halat an Mannas, in addition to a seaplane station which is not yet fully developed, and in c onnection with which it is understood that the heginnigs of a pier have been laid down, adjacent to the landing ground. 6 . It will, therefore, he apparent that Naval require ments could possibly he met if the existing landing ground could he utilised as a recreation ground and land suitable for officers, go-downs, etc., taken up in the vicinity of the Air Ministry pier. The idea would accordingly he to establish a Naval Station adjacent to the existing site of the landing ground and flying boat base. 7 . I am, therefore, to request that you will report immediately by telegram whether you consider the xoregomg to be a feasible proposition having regard to the nature the ground and existing buildings. tfhile financial tions are of great importance, it will not of cours overlooked that it might be possible to arrange that any existing buildings of suitable type in private ownership could be purchased and converted to Naval use. Your report should give full information to enable rhe position and dimensions of the existing landing gro^d, pier and seaplane station, and also of any land you suggest should be taken up, , ternined on the Admiralty chart. You to he accurately determmeu tumors of any huildings, which are at present should give particular s oi ui„ situated on any ground you r ecommend as suitable for _ ototi-ncr also their ownership, acauisition for Naval purposes, stating8 . It is necessary that the report should he forwarded urgently as it is desired to communicate to the Bahrein ^ Petroleum Company, in the very near future, full particulars of the land II.K. Government desire to reserve for the ostensible purpose of establishing a landing ground and seaplane base. As stated above, you will appreciate that it is of the greatest importance to avoid giving tne impression locally that II.M. Government have any interest from the Naval standpoint in tne location of a site. The Political Agent, who will be instructed by the Secretary of State for India through tne Political Resident to give all possible assistance to you, will no doubt be able to devise a satisfactory pretext for personal inspection by you of the area. 9. Should you regard this arrangement as quite impracticable you should suggest any alternative site for the base and recreation ground which appears to be suitable, having regard to the necessity for secrecy and the probable commercial development oi the island. xx such alternative site could not reasonably be described as a seaplane base, you should consider in conjunction with the Political Agent whether there is any other reason for acquiring the land which could be made public. to* .-t-u. however, bear in mind that the undertakings secured from the Bahrein Petroleum Gompany apply to a handing trju 1 .a ana seaplane base only, and difficulty may arise in safe- . .. ~ orrT o rea which is not in fact used guarding the position o -- j *i P3 ^7 V-*, -i jo 't' 0 J L W 1 t i 11 •Li as a seaplane base or landing. fe roan , , , r t ' h o 1T for the purpose of their one of the blocks taken out by thmt - - mining, lease.

It has therefore become necessary to refer it to tho Ministerial Sub— Gomiaittee,, 2 P The small island of Henjara lies close to and on the seaward side of the large island of Kishm which adjoins tne Persian coast near the mouth of the Persian Gulf, It possesses a valuable anchorage, and has important climatic and strategic advantages. The Admiralty regard it as by far the most suitable point in the Persian Gulf for a Naval depot mor His Majesty's Ships operating in the Gulf; and tney attach great importance to the advantages which tne continued use of this island offers to the British Navy in connection with the duties of His Majesty 5 s Ships on the Trucial Coast and the coast of Muscat and Oman e 3 „ The history of our position at Henjam is briefly as follows. In 1868 sanction was obtained by His Majesty's Since this memorandum was dratted there haie been subsequent developments which will be dealt with separately* • !G-cve rumen t from the £h£.h. of Per si telegraph station on the islsno.. the maaber of employees ana t-ne e not in future exceed those agree telegraph station was estallishe when it was temporarily abandoned 1904. fhe Persian Government s of the intentions of His majesty the telegraph station ? and. an iixconc as to the precise limits of the In the course of this correspondence formally recognised* as they had a occasions* that the island was und P er sia.

During the Par - 2 --4- B—mmwnaninBiw ■been constructed for them in Italy and are to he commanded hy Italian officers in the Persian service* These ships are due to arrive in the Persian Gulf next March, and their arrival will mark an important change in the situations, for hitherto His Majesty's Ships have been the only warships stationed in the Gulf* It is at present intended that the Persian vessels shall be based at Bushire; but, while the shore accommodation at Bushire may present certain advantages y it is understood that unless some dredging is carried out the vessels will only be able to enter or leave the harbour at certain stages of the tide, and for a period of some two months in the year will either be precluded from using the harbour ? or confined to it without the possibility of putting to sea 0 The practical disadvantages of Bushire may well cause the Persians or their Italian advisers to seek a more suitable port* Of the other ports available Mohammerah might be selected® it is ? however 5 separated f 10.01 the sea by over fifty miles of river under Iraqi sovereignty through which Persia only has transit rights* At the Northern end of the Gulf s Khor Musa y on which is situated the terminus of the completed southern section of the proposed Trans-Persian railway, might he a suitable harbour, but it may prove difficult to construct adequate shore facilities at what is now little more than a desolate swamp. The Italians and Persians are not unlikely therefore to consider Kenjam as the best available alternative to Bushire, and the Foreign Office consider that, if the Persians wish to use Hen jam for their own warships, they are the less likely to continue to tolerate the use of Hie island by those of a foreign Power,, y wh'*3e the forthcoming arrival ol Persian warsripo may render the British position at Henjam more difficult, there are already indications that the continued use of a Persian L-5- island by foreign naval forces is obnoxious to Persian national feeling 0 Various minor difficulties have been raised locally by Persian officials: objectionable articles have appeared in the Tehran press; and although the official atti- tude of the Persian Government has been satisfactory hitherto, the Persian Minister of Court referred specifically last year, in the course of a controversial correspondence with Sir P 0 Clive in which he endeavoured to show the reasonableness of his attitude in regard to the Treaty negotiations ? to the right which ? amongst other rights which could not in principle be disputed, Persia had M not to wish an important naval base to be created near her coast, and consequently to take her own precautions in leasing a part of her territory, or even not to agree to lease her territory at all ” 0 Although the British depot at Henjam can hardly be referred to as a ’ ? base ,f , there is little doubt that Teymourtache was referring to it in this letter* 8 * It is, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, most improbable that the Persian Government will allow the present anomalous situation to continue much longer* It is conceivable that they may give us formal notice to go, in which case it may be possible to arrange for sufficient time to make alternative arrangements elsewhere; but, in the opinion of the Foreign Office - it is more probable that they will resort to less direct but more immediately effective methods, by which our position could be made untenable without any need for the Persians to resort to force* They could, for example, pass certain legislation, ostensibly of universal application, out in reality directed against the British position at Henjam, and direct their local officials at Henjam strictly co enforce it* There is nothing to prevent Persian military forces from-6 'being stationed in the island or to prevent this garrison from 'being increased. The result might be that unless His Majesty's Goverument v?ere prepared to use tor 005 i^ /iiould. be imp 0 ssiDie; for His Majesty’s ships to continue to use the depot* If dinlomatic representations at Tehran were to have no effect, the question would arise whether His Majesty’s Government were prepared to authorise the British. Havy in the Gulf to take sue- forcible or other measures against the rersian local authorities as might be necessary to ensure the continued use of Henjan for the period of about fifteen months necessary to make alternative arrangements elsewhere* The Foreign Office cont&gt;idex that as His Majesty's Government have no treaty justification for using Hen jam, it would not be possible to de^ena the use Of forcible measures against the Persians in such circumstances. 9 . The Admiralty, on the other hand, do not consider that the question is likely to arise in this form; and n it should arise they feel that it would probably be possible to solve the dispute by diplomatic representations at Tehran. T-ve Persian Government would not, in their opinion, be prepared ;i ** . « -u»„ « t ~-. ,0 «r«. to rttttrf. too “ tu a “ . t , br ^ to make other arrangements * Government had had ^ 1 v i t well to point out 1C.

They consider that it is at present impossible for His Kaaesty’s Government to take any step likely to he displeasing to the Persians without exposing themselves to the risk of Persian retaliation at Hen jam, and that this renders it most difficult to negotiate with Persia in regard to other Question on egual terns c 12 In view of the above considerations, the foreign Office^have strongly urged that, notwithstanding the undeniable physical advantages of Hen jam as a naval depot, every effort should he made at the earliest possible moment to remove this naval depot from Persian territory and to establisn an alternative naval depot elsewhere. 'The Foreign Office considerit of the utmost importance that a decision should he reached without delay regarding the preparation of such an alternative depot? since they regard it as greatly preferable that His Majesty T s Government should leave Henjam of their cun free will azxd in advance of acute Persian pressure? rather than that they should wait passively until the. Persian action which they anticipate has rendered their continued use of the island impossiblee They fear that if it is decided simply to wait upon events, sooner or later there will be a widely heralded Persian attempt to socurs our abandonment of the use of Henjam. Such en attempt could hardly fail to be ultimately successful, and our subsequent withdrawal would then be exploited by the Persians as a moral victory, which would deal a severe blow to British prestige throughout the Gulf. On the other hand, the Joreiga Office consider that tho blow to British prestige would be less serious if His Majesty's Government should have previously announced their intention to establish an alternativ depot at Bahrein since the removal from Henjam could therosite. be represented an having been already decided upon in British interests e.g. with a view to strengthen the British positron at Bahrein and on the Arabian coast of the Gulf. 13 .

In their view, the fact that Persia has not definitely demanded our withdrawal, suggests that she is either uncertain as to her policy or at least reluctant to force an immediate issue. They consider it possible that Persia may even prefer our presence at Henjam, which we have definitely recognised as Persian territory, than at .Bahrein, to which they have put forward a shadowy claim which might be weakened by the establishment of a British naval station on that island, 17, As regards the Foreign Office view that our prestige in the Gulf will suffer less from an early transfer of the depot before any demand for our evacuation has been made by the Persians, than from evacuation later as a direct result of Persian action, the Admiralty consider that our withdrawal, whenever it occurs, will be generally attributed to Persian ires sure, so that the effect on our prestige will be practically the same in either event 0 Any argument that we nad already decided to remove in our own interests would be unconvxnvxng in view of our efforts during the last two years to get a formal lease for a long term of years, 18, The Admiralty consider that a further reason for not , .

The difference of opinion between the various Departments may, therefore, be briefly summarised as follows. \ e Admiralty desire to continue to use Eenjam as a naval depot as they have used it with the taoit acquiescence of the Persian Government for the past twenty years, notwithstanding the lack of definite legal sanction for the depot and the possibility that the Persians may at any moment attempt to render our continued use of the island impossible.

CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM said that the Admiralty had asked this question in view of the importance of a suitable base In order that the duties assigned to the Naval xorces .lii the Gulf may be effectively carried out* MR. RENDBL said that so far as he was aware no one questioned the necessity of maintaining the British position in the Gulf* It was indeed on the hypothesis that that position must be maintained that the proposal was put ionward that we should try to establish an alternative to Henjam without delay * in order that if and when we were obliged to abandon Hen;]am hurriedly our position in the Gulx migut be maintained without interruption Question number one in* the Admiralty memorandum therefore did not seem to effect the main question at issue, which turned on whether we could maintain our position at Hen jam in face of the growing Persian opposition. In reply to a question, he explained that our position at Hen jam had no legal section whatever other than a right to maintain a telegraph station. maintained CAPTAIJ5 CTJNPIKGHAi.; said that the Navy had/a depot at Hen jam during the last twenty years, and that Persia, had signified her willingness to give us a lease of the site.

CAPTAIN CUNITIITGEAK considered that should any such incident occur, the Persians would he putting themselves in the wrong and thus playing into our hands. MR. REND2L in reply to a question as to the position of negotiations regarding a lease for Kenjam, said that very little had in fact been achieved. The main difficulty had arisen over the important question of jurisdiction, hut actually there were very few/ points on which agreement had been reached* and there was at present no reason to regard the conclusion of a settlement of this question by negotiation as likely. It appeared, as a result of a recent interview between Sir John Simon and Teymourtache, that the prospects for a resumption of general treaty negotia tions were still unfavourable. MR, HANCOCK pointed out that the Navy maintained no armed forces on shore at Ken jam and that the naval depot was, he understood, in charge of an Indian storekeeper. Armed men were not landed there, landing parties being simply for recreational purposes. COLONEL MURRAY asked vehether Teymourtuche’ s attitude did not express his personal point of view ratner than the normal views of the Persian Government*MR. RMNDSL considered that the present hostility of Persia to British interests could not he entirely fathered on certain individuals. The recent v/ave of xenophohe nationalism appeared to have affected the whole country more or less. It was useless to talk of taking a ''strong line' in a question such as that of henjam where our position was in fact untenable*. The Persians had now learnt to call our bluff* ; nd on the whole, as our interests in Persia were considerable* (particularly us regards the A.P. OoC.) they were in a position to do us more harm than we could do them. In reply to a question as to why it was that the Russians appecjred to be able to deal with the Persians so much more favourably than we could, Mr. Eendel explained that the Russians were able for various reasons - geographical and other - to put far stronger pressure on Persia than we were* MR. GRIEVE said that he was surprised at the stress given to the argument that we had no 'legal right' to continue using Henjam in view of the facts that (a) we had been there some twenty years* (b) no notice to quit had been received, and (c) actual negotiations with the Persian Government for a lease had been opened. Ee considered that should the Persians provoke .an incident they would be placing themselves in a very unsound position, as the fact that no formal notice to quit had been served on us would prove a sound argument on our side. In / ny case we were not using the place as a par Base, but as a recreation station and stores depot. * THE CHAIRMAN said that the first two questions in the Admiralty memorandum had been covered by the discussion* and that the question now to be considered was whether we could rely on sufficient notice to quit being given to enable us to prepare another base. Some period (apparently fifteen months) was essential before evacuation.MR, EEI^IDEL considered that even if such notice were given (which he thought imijrobahle) the period of it would he exceedingly short-, As he had previously explained, the Persians were unlikely to admit that we had any rights ^ arising out of our long use of the island. The Persian Government were now restoring their authority in the outlying districts of Persia and might endeavour to assert that authority against us at Ken jam at any moment* MR. BAXTER pointed out that, if the Persians should decide to secure our removal from Hen jam, they would not have to use force. They might pcssihly proceed in the following way. They night enact legislation which would he ostensibly of general application, hut which would in fact he directed against our position at Henjam. They would then direct their local officials strictly to enforce that legislation, Persian military forces were already stationed in the depot and there was nothing to prevent the Persian garrison from being increased* The result would he that unless we were prepared to use force, it would he impossible for us to continue to use the depot. In reply to a question, he stated that there was in fact an indication that the Persian Government might proceed in this manner. In the course of the recent negotiations, the Persian Minister of Court had shown Sir R» Clive a draft law regarding the use of Persian territorial watexS, •^■ud as the result of Sir R. Clive’s remonstrances had stated that the draft law would only he proceeded with if the negotiations broke down* The effect of the possible enforcement oi this law at Hen jam was uncertain. In any case, objectionable provisions might be added before it was passed by the Persian Parliament, MR, RENBEL suggested that the law might contain strin- gent regulations regarding passports, the landing of foreigners. etc -5-CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM considered the.t special legislation requiring passports for naval ratings would 'be so opposed to international usage that it could not he enforcedo Certainly no such 'action was taken hy any other civilised power* If the Persians expect to he treated as a civilised Power they must not behave like a primitive tribeo MB* RdNDSL explained that it was difficult to foretell exactly what form such Persian legislation might ta The Persians were however quite clever enough to devise legislation against the enforcement of which on Persian soil it ««ould he impossible for us to protest* hut which it would at the same time he necessary for us to violate if ,ve were- to continue to use Hen jam as at present.

To make the harbour usable by a light cruiser would mean an expenditure of some £400-,000 for dredging purposes* Henjam. was, however, usable by light cruisers* MR. GRIEVE said that the Treasury were averse to expenditure on the new station at Bahrein until the situation was clearer« As regards our remaining in Henjam, the primary considerations appeared to be of a political or strategic nature rather than a financial one* Tne Treasury would, therefore, prefer to pay rent for Hen jam up to £ 2,000 a year, or even more, for a limited period, than be committed to undefined expenditure elsew'-iera at an admitted- ly inferior station* CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM stressed the climatic advan tages of Hen jam over Bahrein, Hen jam, be.uig at -no miutn the Gulf i there is usually a Toreese, consequently it is more suitable for health and recreational purposes.

Referring to paragraph 10 of the Admiralty memorandum, MR. RENDER explained that in the Foreign Office view there was not the remotest hope of Persia ever agreeing to the use of Henjam as an air base. As regards its use by imperial Airways, the whole difficulty connected with the air route was due to Persian objections to the use of Persian territory on the coast of the Gulf by British aircraft. That difficulty would not be met by substituting th e use of Henjam for the use of the stopping places on the present South Persian route.
