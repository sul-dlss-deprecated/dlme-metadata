Sent 12.30 p.m. 15th March,1936. Addressed to Aden No:25 Repeated to Jedda No:36 ^•k., v Reference Jedda despatch to Foreign Office No.351 of the 10th December,1935, a copy of which was sent to you direct. His Majesty r s Government have decided that in the first instance and as the next step Saudi Government should be asked for further information as to agreement stated to have been concluded before 1916 between Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Qatar by which latter is stated to have accepted former’s sovereignty over Jebel Nakhsh. It is not proposed to issue further instructions to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on general question of frontiers until this point has been cleared up. As matters stand at present there is no intention of offering Ibn Saud any further concession of territory but it is important that His Majesty’s Government should be in possession of fullest possible information when the time comes to issue final instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan. Do this end your early views are invited on Fuad Hamza’s suggestion (reported in paragraph 22 of second enclosure to Jedda despatch under reference) that a line might be drawn to run somewhere between the line proposed by His Majesty’s Government (see paragraphs 6 and 7 of first enclosure to Jedda despatch under reference) and that proposed in the Saudi memorandum of 3rd April 1935. In particular I should be glad to learn whether in your view any Imperial or local interests would be adversely affected if the proposed line in this sector were carried/ \ t J V:carried somewhat further to the South at any point. The Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf are heing consulted with regard to other sections of the frontier..2123/1936 Cypher Telegram from the Resident, Aden to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Dated 19th March, 1936. Received 11.35.a.m. 19th March. Addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies repeated to the British Minister at Jedda Your telegram of the 15th March Aden is concerned only with boundary line west of approximately longitude 53. In paragraph 8 of Ingrams’ note of 19th August 1935 forwarded to you with Lake’s secret despatch of the 20th August 1935 certain principles were proposed to govern our attitude regarding this frontier which most important was that no steppe land or territory occupied by^., our tribes to the north of Hadhramaut valley should be surrendered. I agree with this view and in accordance with it line proposed in your telegram to me No.80 of 1935 represents the utmost concession that can be made. Line suggested by Fuad Hamza would violate this principle as it would cut through territory of Mahra Manahil Awamir and Seiar tribes. The first of these is racially and politically connected ?;ith Q,ishn the second and fourth with Mukalla and the third with Kathiris and prospectively thus with Aden Protectorate. The proposed line in this sector cannot be therefore carried further south without giving Dha footing within outlying border of Hadhramaut and a possible opening for further extension of his influence that would have politically a disturbing effect on treaty chiefs and their people in that part of the Protectorate. There would also be a likelihood of interference with grazing and watering rights of tribes concerned. These developments would thus adversely affect both Imperial and local interests. I am also strongly opposed to any boundary that intersect tribal t erritory. Our experience of divided control over Audhali/61/31 &amp; 33/51« Telegram isYorn TO political Keaident, ± 5 Ushire.

Paragraph 1 of ISiote . A very small point. The AL KHARUSI are perhaps better described as a tribe and not a family. Paiugraph 5 of Note . Another small point. The Imam is not the Father-in-law, or, in fact, in any way related to the ex-Sultan Sir Taimur bin Faisal. 4. \ f\&gt; S 6 MFP— 400S&amp;P—(M-480 - 26-7-34—2,00. * 0.2 4* P aragraph 6 of Note ♦ If Shaikh Isa bin Salih sometime age suffered some what of an eclipse at the hands of his sen Shaikh Mohamed, he has new reasserted himself and is, there is little d®ubt, not ©nly the predominant personality in^but the actual Ruler of the Oman. He has won this position for himself by sheer force of character and from his residence at Qabil collects taxes from the tribes of Oman and exercises an effective control ©ver the country. The Imam, Mohamed bln Abdullah al Khalili, is stilly of course^the spiritual head but he is a mere puppet in the hands of Shaikh Isa. It is to the latter and not te the Imam that the Muscat Government address 'unofficial' letters regarding various matters. 5. Paragraph 8 of N o te. In my opinion the Omanis would be little perturbed at any threat the Sultan might make unaided against their independence. They have (probably quite rightly) a thorough contempt for any force the Muscat Government could by them selves put into the field against them unless hacked with men and munitions by some Foreign Power, as such a contingency may I presume, be considered outside the practical bounds of possibility, I consider that the likelihood of a rapprochment between the Omanis and Ibn Baud can be dismissed from consi deration. The Ibadhi sect, it is true, has certain affinities with Wahabism but it is at the same time very definitely jealous and frightened ©f complete absorption by its infinitely stronger rival. The Omanis, secure in the enjoyment of their virtual independence are well satisfied with the present state of affairs and only the danger of some great and unforeseen up heaval, is ever likely to make them wish to change it.61/31 &amp; 35/51.

The negotiations cover the whole question ol the south and eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and are part of wider negotiations which, it is hoped, will consolidate the cordial relations existing between His Majesty's govern ment and ibn uaud but as parts of the frontier to be nego tiated are of interest to Muscat His Majesty's government desire to inform four nighness of the present position. Ibn gaud has made claims in Mouth east Arabia to a wide area the whole of which His Majesty's Government are not prepared to recognise. They however see no objection to recognising Ibn Gaud's claim to an area in the Great Sands extending eastwards as far as Meridian 56° r-ast between ,'ara- IIcls 22° and 20° and Gouth to a line drawn from the latter point to the intersection of Meridian 62° and rarallel • Hia Majesty’s Government would be glad to hear what -/v\/ l /vvtf 1' ■ AxJ, lai //, /-* /.*.4 l-\/t . • l ''. -v,i /l L at ,4 c. ,&lt; Cn-~ 8 - what /our Highness regards as the western boundary of your dominions and whether it would encroach on territory to which Muscat has a supportable claim or would adversely affect Muscat interests if offer of boundary to be made to Ibn Saud mentioned in the preceding paragraph were now to run as follows (For ease of reference the various points indicated have been given descriptive letters).

I am sorry to bother you personally with this detail of office routine but it is of the utmost importance at this end to avoid any danger of papers so confidential getting into wrong hands. Another equally or even more confidential paper viz. your printed despatch No.l^S-S of March 5th&gt; enclosing a copy of your letter of th^ same number and date to Metcalfe about tlie foreigp relations of Kuwait, reached us by the same post. /\ 7~t ?

Moreover accide ents may happen e.g. not very long ago a confidential report from Aden was delivered to a wrong address here and was opened. It reached me in due course through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Everyone seemed to have acted in good faith and I had no difficulty in accepting the explanations and apologies of Fuad Bey Hamza; but the fact remained that the report had passed through several hands and reached me open. I may add that I read your above-mentioned letter to Metcalfe about the foreign relations of Kuwait with great interest. I am not sure that it entirely convinces me but I am impressed by the argument developed in paragraph 5. Anyhow, I now leave the matter to higher authorities. I am sure that you will forgive me for having butted into a subject which primarily concerns you but which is of great importance to me also, as Minister in one of the only tv/o countries, besides ourselves, who matter much politically to Kuwait.

May 19, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 2828/152/91] Copy No. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. Eden—{Received May 19.) (No. 116.) HIS Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him the record of a conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the Anglo-Saudi Negotiations: Eastern and South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia. I HAVE recorded separately the portion of my first formal conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin yesterday, in which we resumed the discussion of the proposed prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda and connected questions. 1 have explained in that record that I did not wish Sheikh Tusuf to think that I was confining my attention to that subject because I had taken it first; and that I therefore purposely went on to the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. 2. I reminded Sheikh Yusuf that, when discussing the frontier question with me at Riyadh, Fuad Bey had invoked an agreement between Ibn Sand and the Sheikh of Qatar prior to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 and had held that, whatever the position might be now, the sheikh was then a free international agent. He had said that by the alleged agreement Ibn Sand had recognised the sheikh’s right to the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq, but that the Jebel Naksh had been left to Ibn Saud. Fuad Bey’s contention as to the sheikh’s position before 1916 raised a very difficult legal issue, but my Government, as practical people, wished in the first instance to be informed on the simple question of fact. The Sheikh of Qatar had no recollection of any such agreement. His Majesty’s Government would like particulars of it and a copy. I had put this to Fuad Bey on the 16th March. He had not reverted to the subject. This astonished me. Surely, if the agreement existed, it could be produced at short notice. We had given all our agreements with the Persian Gulf rulers to the Saudi Government and were justified in expecting the information for which I had asked. 3. Sheikh Yusuf was most evasive. It became clear in the ensuing conver sation that he knew very little about what Fuad Bey had said and equally little about the whole business. He suggested at an early stage that the King might have C£ allowed ” the sheikh to have certain places. I retorted sharply that I took exception to language of this sort, used as though it rested with Ibn Saud to determine the sheikh’s rights. The sheikh was an independent ruler, who had confided the charge of his foreign affairs to His Majesty’s Government. He was not Ibn Saud’s vassal. 4. At a later stage Sheikh Yusuf tried to make out that the authority of the Sheikh of Qatar did not extend beyond what he called the Safhat-al-Qatar. This expression being new to me, I asked whether the Safhat included the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq. Sheikh Yusuf replied in the negative, and tried to make out that Ibn Saud exercised authority in those two areas. I expressed amazement. Fuad Bey had said that the King had ceded those two areas over twenty years ago. Sheikh Yusuf now accused the King of having hung on to them 23rd April, 1936. Jedda, April 23, 1936. ever since. [706 t—2]2 5. Sheikh Yusuf invited me to ask the Sheikh of Qatar whether it was not a fact that Ibn Saud held the areas in question. I said that I should not like to ask the sheikh to bring such an accusation, which I was sorry to hear from the lips of Sheikh Yusuf. As regards the main issue, the sheikh had already been questioned. He held in principle that his rights extended to Salwa, but he wa,$ not now claiming that place, as Ibn Saud had taken it. He claimed most emphatically the Jebel Dukhan and the Jebel Naksh, as being in relation to Qatar and the Jebel Dukhan “ as the nose is to the face.” | 6. Under further pressure to produce the alleged agreement, Sheikh Yusuf suggested that Fuad Bey would have to be asked about it. I scouted this. Fuad Bey had invoked an agreement, and I presumed it was either in the archives of the King’s diwan or those of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 7. After some more wrangling, Sheikh Yusuf asked whether the frontier question was to be settled on the basis of Saudi proposals or our proposals, or on what basis. I recited with what patience I could the main stages dui ing the past year. Fuad Bey had informed me of the Saudi desiderata on the 3rd April, 1935, 'The subject had been discussed in London in June-July. I had taken ne? proposals to Riyadh. These had been rejected One of the Saudi objections to them was that our proposed boundary ran south of the Jebel Naksh, and Fuad Bey had invoked the agreement for which I was asking. The negotiations must proceed on the same basis as that on which I was about to leave Sheikh Yusuf: one foot before the other, step by step, and not by a flying leap from one end of the room to the other. j 8. I was deliberately provocative in this conversation, which I have described only in its main outlines. I irritated Sheikh YTisuf all the more as it was very late and he was longing to get rid of me. He is notoriously most difficult in negotiation and it is desirable sometimes to go for him hot and strong, He irritated me too, so that the conversation, though most friendly in form, was acid at times and sub-acid throughout. My objects were threefold, viz. : (a) that stated in the first paragraph above; (b) to keep it well before Sheikh Yusuf, without making it a main point, that we controlled the foreign relations of Qatar: and (c) to press him as hard as possible about the alleged pre-1916 agreement.

It is satisfactory that the Saudi Oov^rnsent have at long last acknowledged the Agr.es.nt to be sr, entire fabrica tion, but as Ryan points out it has taken thea six months to admit this, and in the meantime we have ail had to do an unnecessary amount of telegraphing and despatch writing on the subject i I cannot imagine how Fmd Ha*«a, * ^jatever he may be - is no fool, can have been so stuuld as to make hi® statement that the Agreement existed, when he knew perfectly well that it didn't, thus, apart from anything else, letting down Ibn Baud badly - unless the latter also knew that it did net exist, which I can hardly believe. The Baud Government must surely have realised that His Majesty's Government would want to see the document before committing themselves in any way. However, whatever the Saudi motives may have been, the whole incident leaves me with a personal impression that the mentality of th. Saudi Government is distinctly peculiar, and that one must take all their state ments end pretensions - at all events as far as the Gulf is concerned - with a large helping of salt.

Subject:- Saudi-Muscat Frontier , Dated 10 th June f Q* m o. \ /r ^ Beference correspondence ending with your telegram No* 444. of 4th June 1936. If, ^ ^ 2. I enclose the correct copy of my letter No.C/63 dated April 25th 1936 which I gave to the Sultan on my last visit to Dhofar. A reply from His Highness sent by dho^ ^s^eceived on 3rd instant and I enclose herewith a translation of his letter. 3. As regards the definition of the Western Boundary of his State it will be noted that the Sultan is not prepared to — r ^ ~ 1 . -■ | ? i; ■ ' ,l ' 1 ' ' ' . &gt;»» rT ,„ commit himself at present. This does not appear an unreasonable attitude to take up in view of the fact that, as pointed out by His Highness, no attempt has ever been made previously to define the land boundary of any part of the Muscat State* The difficulty here is probably similar to what I gather has been the case in many other parts of Arabia where Rulers have been asked to work out S 6 MfP— 400i5&amp;P—(M-480 —26-7-34—2,00,'X/O.2 out a boundary in the Western meaning of the term which to- them has been hitherto am unheard of proposition* 4. As regards the question of his acceptance or not of the various boundaries proposed to be offered to ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government the Sultan f s replies are not satisfactory. It will be seen from paragraphs 4 and 5 of his letter that he is evading the issue for his statement is not a definite reply to the questions asked him, 5. From what I have seen of His Highness I believe that the real reason for his unwillingness to give a straight forward answer to the points raised concerning the Saudi- Muscat Frontier is chiefly his reluctance to take the trouble to plot on the map the lines of the various boundaries suggested. When discussing the matter with him at Dhofar I showed him on a map I had taken with me the tracings of the three different proposed boundaries and he at once declared he would have no objection to the line described in paragraph 4 of my letter to him Ho. 1 C/63 i.e 0 the line joining the points C. D. E. G. H. and continued thence to the intersection of Parallel 18° and Meridian 46° East, since, as he stated, this came nowhere near the western limits of his State. I offered to leave my map with the various points marked with His Highness but he declared it was unnecessary as he could easily have them plotted on his own large scale map which he has with him at Dhofar. 6. If the Sultan were present in Muscat I think I could persuade him to agree in writing to the boundary line mentionec in paragraph 5 above but I am afraid that until His Highness returns from Dhofar nothing further can be done in the roatter for the present. Letters from Dhofar for the next three months can be received by dhows but not despatched except by special messenger overland which as you are aware is a costly and lengthy business. -POLITICAL-.1 f ? No. C/63 Balalahy Uhofar• ^4pril 26 th, 1936 To His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Salalah. Saudi Muscat Frontier . Your Highness, With reference to our conversation on the subject quoted above I a© writing formally to state that I have been instructed by His Majesty* s Government to inform Your Highness that they are endeavouring to negotiate a treaty with His Majesty Ibn Saud which would determine amongst other matters the Muscat Saudi frontier. 2 # The negotiations cover the whole question of the south and eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and are part of wider negotiations which, it is hoped, will consolidate the cordial relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud but as parts of the frontier to be negotiated are of interest to Muscat His Majesty*s Government desire to inform Your Highness of the present position. 3. Ibn Saud has made claims in south east Arabia to a wide area the whole of which His Majesty's Government are not prepared to recognise. They,however,see no objection to recog nising Ibn Saud's claim to an area in the Great Sands extending Eastwards as far as Meridian 66° East between parallels 22° and 20° and South to a line drawn from the latter point to the intersection of Meridian 62° and parallel 19 • 4. His Majesty's Government would be glad to hear what Your Highness regards as the western boundary of your dominions and whether it would encroach on territory to which Muscat has a supportable claim or would adversely affect Muscat interests if offerif offer of boundary to be made to Ibn Saud mentioned in the preceding paragraph were now to run as followst- (For ease of reference the various points indicated have been given descriptive letters). From the intersection of Meridian 52° and Parallel 23° (C) to a point at intersection of Meridian 64° 40' and Parallel 20° 40* (D) thence to a point at inter section of Meridian 55° 40* and Parallel 22° (jE) and thence to intersection of Meridian 55° and Parallel 20 @ (G), thence in an approximately straight line to the intersection of Meridian 52° and Parallel 19 (H)* (but so as to leave Sabkhat Majors to Ibn Saud and itamlat Mugshin to Muscat) and thence in a straight line to ohe intersection of Parallel 18° and Meridian 46° East. The abovementioned sectors are those with which Muscat would be concerned. 5 , Would your Highness also please state for the information of His Majesty's Government whether you consider that Muscat interests would be adversely affected if (a) the proposed line between points G and H were taken furtner to south (b) the eastern sector of the line between points G and J were taken to Meridian 56°. (Point J is the intersection of a line, drawn irom point D through point S, with Meridian 55°). Your Highness's sincere friend, A A* ! \\y V V Sd. R.P. WATTS.

After Compliments, With reference to our conversation during your last visit to Dhofar where you stayed two nights and your letter dated the 25th April which you delivered to me before your departure. 2 # X have understood the contents of your letter and what you have told me verbally in accordance with the instructions received from my friend His Majesty^ Govern ment in connection with the Western boundary of my country# 3. in reply I thank His Majesty's Government for the trouble they are taking in a matter which concerns the interests of my Government but as I have already iniormed you verbally this is a very difficult question and requires considerable time before I can send an answer to it# I have to refer to my records and papers and then I shall be able to let you know about the proposed boundary and give the names of places which define the said boundary. Several months will be required to go into this matter* &amp; s regards the boundary which has to be fixed between me and Ibn Saud as has been indicated by you by reference to points of latitude and longitude and which His Majesty's Government proposes to give to King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, 1 state that although I know something about geographical maps perhaps the marking of the boundary by references to points of latitude and longitude may not define the correct line of my boundary. It is therefore , necessary to make careful enquiries as to whether these lines correspond with the places which define my boundary# At present I state without binding myseli that I have- 2 - I have no objection to the boundary line marked on the map as detailed in your letter provided that it does not en croach or affect the rights of my Government# 6. its to the request of my friend His Majesty^ Government to define the desired boundary I state once again that I am not prepared at the present time to fix an accurate line of the boundary of my dominions as the matter requires careful scrutiny and investigations since such a thing has not been previously been carried out.

My dear Loch, ^ Would you kindly refer to Bushire express letter Bo. 545S dated 4th July in regard to the Saudi frontier negotiations. That letter covered an express letter dated 10th June from the Political Agent, Muscat, in which he said that he enclosed the correct copy of his letter No.C/63 dated 25th April which he gave to the Sultan on his last visit to Dhofar. The copy of the letter dated 25th April which we have received does not, however, appear to be correct. For instance, in paragraph 4 the intersection of Meridian 54° 40 1 ' and Parallel 20° 40” is mentioned when the parallel in question should actually be Parallel 22° 40“. Also at the end of the paragraph the intersection of Parallel 18° and Meridian 46° is mentioned when actually the point in question is the point at which Parallel 18° intersects the violet line of the Anglo- mnt Colonel P.C.Loch, C.I.E., i Turkish/ Consulate General, BUSHIRE.2.

He nad no counter proposals to make to latest offer of His Majesty*s Govern ment, claimed that southern boundary proposed by baudi Government was based, on essential needs of tribes ana professed indifference to suggestion that line along longtitude 55 E might be moved eastwards, on the ground that country thereabouts is desert. Taking aovantage of change of Minister he tried the transparent manoeuvre ^ pretending that His Majesty*s Government nad always been most keen about Khor al Odeid and much less so about Jabal Nuaksh which Saudi Government regarded as most important, I held out no hope of any concession beyond one mentioned above and said I could only report to you.&lt;?( - 2 - If Problem had not been complicated by oil I should hc.ve been in lavoui'* oi leaving it in abeyance ioi a while. As things are I can only suggest this: (1) to counter Fuacls manoeuvre and leave Saudi Government under no illusion I should tell him that His Majesty^ Government regard both Jabal Nuaksh and hhor al Odeid as essential. Pt the same time I should ask him on what other pa-rts of frontier he thinks he and I could produce joint proposals that would appeal to our Governments. (2) Meanwhile it should be considered whether His Majesty 1 s Government could afford to offer further slight concession e.t bufuk and on borders of Oman and Aden Protectorate. ^ know difficulties in second su gestion and I am extremely doubtlul whether such concessions would induce Ibn Gaud to make formal renunciation of Jabal Nuaksh, but alternative seems to be to do nothing* I have impression that Xbn baud would regard Sufuk as a. substantial gain but I know nothing about the merits of his claim to that place.

Khor al odeid apparently is a good possible port (see Persian Gulf Pilot and consult Senior Officer) and though at present no trade presumably passes through it in case of oil being found inland it might form convenient pipe line terminal.

Bin Baud’s attitude is of course important, but sol must point out is that of the Rulers of the Arab ShaikMoms of the Persian Gulf, and the importance of the Arab coast, which is now the 'Suez Canal of the Air', and where there are important oilfields springing up, was indicated in my demi-official letter No.82-s of the 13th January 1937 to Metcalfe, copy forwarded to you under ^ ^ A Printed Letter Mo.83-3 of same date. We must therefore be careful that in retaining the co-operation of Bin Saud, who after all is not our protege, we do not in any way sacrifice / • C.Walton Esquire, C3. ,UC. » The Inaia Office, London.sacrifice the interests of the Arab Shaikhs whoa we are bound legally and morally to protect* 3* /ith regard to a further possible offer which it is now proposed should be made to liin Baud, I entirely concur in the doubts of the India Office on the subject* As you are aware in this affair we hav-p all along been *on the run** There was first The Green Line, in two stages, (Foreign Office tele- ^ 7)A\Q ^ ‘ IkM' gra» H°. 8 t dated the 1 6 th January 1936, to Jedda), then The Brown i*ine and The fellow Line, (Foreign Office telegram Ho*70, dated the 1st Hay 1935, to Jedda), and finally the ^ iadh* |«. IbM Line, (jedda despatch Ho*351, dated the 10th Oecenber 1935). All these Lines, variegated in hue as they were, had one thing in common: they gave more anti more territory to Bin Baud. I quite agree that there are occasions when in order to t ain that on ® f8 object one must bargain, andj/the only way one can find out what terms the other side is re.. lly prepared to accept is by a series of offers and counter offers, each side lowering its terms until finally a bargain is struck, in exactly the same way when one buys a Persian carpet l In the present bargaining over the Arabian ’carpet*, as you know, I have been lax from being intransigent, and have always been ready to agree, as far as possible, to any proposal which could serve to induce the Baud! Government to come to terms* 4. But surely the time has now come for this bargaining to cease ? It is the essence of bargaining that there should be '’give and take 4 ', but up to the present it is His Majesty’s Government who have been doing all the ’giving* and Bin Baud all the ’ taking* * Moreover His Majesty’s Government have categorically informed the Saudi Government that their last offer was the final one. The relevant sentence occurs in paragraph /\ \ &gt;3 m l &gt; 0 'j)' ( &gt;l paragraph 13 of the Foreign Office despatch of the 23rd October 1935 to Ryan at Jedda, and reads as follows:- 11 You should then proceed formally to put forward the new offer which Hia Majesty’s Governnent, in the light of the foregoing considerations, have now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with every desire to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding in no ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majesty’s Government will not be able to increase* I trust that you will thus dispel as far as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, in now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already offered, His Majesty’s Govern ment would be likely to yield still further in response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware, this is a point to which the India Office attach much importance”. If after this His Majesty’s Government make another offer, the effect in other areas where we have to negotiate with the Saudi Government will not I imagine be too happy, (though of course that is not my concern}, but as regards the Gulf, (which is my concern), I have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion it would be most unfortunate. There is at least one important question, besides the &gt;audi frontier now under consideration, which we have to settle with the Saudi Government, e»g. the Saudi Blockade against the Shaikh of Kuwait, for the raising of which His Majesty’s Government have a special responsibility by reason of their assurance to the Shaikh in 1929 (Colonial Office telegram dated the p- f 25th /1 -4- 25th July 1929 to the Political Resident), and there will doubtless be other questions in the future, the Saudi Govern ment are already* very difficult to deal with. Only last year, for instance, in the course of these very negotiations over the frontier question, they statea. categorically that they had a letter from the Shaikh of }atar to Bin Baud, surrendering certain territory to the latter, but when asked to produce it they had to admit, after a delay and waste of time of some six months, that it never existed (vide correspondence J.w connected with Jedda telegram ¥o.74, dated the dlst May 1936, to the Foreign Office), A further offer now from His Majesty’s Governraent, after the final offer referred to above, will I that am afraid give the Saudi Government the impress ion/in any with regard to the Gulf negotiations^/they have only to stick to their position long enough tn order to get what they want out of us. The undesirability of such an impression is of course obvious* 5. go much for general considerations. With regard to the form in which a further offer can now taxe, this would seem to be as followss- (a) Towards the last or South in the direction of Hus cat. (b) Towards the Gulf in the direction of the territories of the Shaikhs of ^atar and of the Trueial Coast. (c) Renders suggestion of a compromise with regard to JChor el Qdeid, such as free transit for Bin Baud. 6 . With regard to (a). The position is that the section J*G«*H of the Ri&amp;dh Line was subject to confirmation of the .. a S ultan of Muscat (paragraph 2 of Foreign Office telegram, of the 18th November 1935). A further advance on that Line was suggested at the end of paragraph 2 of India Office telegram /• 5' Q'j c ^ / ^'V telegram ^o*967, dated the 19th March 1936, to the Government of India, and was concurred in cy the Government of India and a^self (Government of India telegram No.757, dated the 23rd March 193 6 ) provided that the sultan of Muscat agreed, which then appeared likely, I instructed Jatts to approach the n Sultan and the latter’s reaction is as reported in his letter of the 15th M$r 1936 to /atts, copy forwarded under my Express letter No,543-S, dated the 4th July 1^36, Briefly, the Sultan refused to bind himself to any boundary, and I saw nothing for it but to postpone any further approach until he returned to his capital, which I hoped would be last October. In point of fact the Sultan postponed his return for another five months and has only just got back. Watts is for the moment sick at Kara chi but can again tackle the Sultan when he gets back to Muscat, which should be within the next fortnight. 7. &lt;yith regard to (b). as you are aware the question of the frontiers of -:atar and of the r fracial EhaiKhdoias has been exhaustively gone into both on the map and o» the ground, Loch paying various visits to the Shaikhs concerned as well as flying over the relevant areas, and nothing was withheld from Bin Baud to which he could advance any reasonable claims. I am therefore definitely of opinion that no more territory can be given to Bin Baud in this ( iraction without our sacrificing the legitimate interests of the Shaikhs in question, which naturally I assume is not the intention of His Majesty’s Gov eminent. 6 . rith regard to (c). I see various strong objections to this proposal. u) /ti - 6 - (1) ?8 oan only make it by presaing the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to give eomething to 3in Baud without aq/ quid j££. a H a wtiaterar, and the effect of this both on him and an the other Shaihha of the Arab Coast, who will of course get to hear of it, would be distinctly prejudicial to our prestige. (2) ihe granting Bin Saud of fyee transit at KJbtor el udeid would tend to undermine the position of the B* hr a in CrOTerna«ttt in cnarging transit dues on Saudi goods entering Has a. (3) Bin Baud haring been given the privilege of free transit at Khcr el Ode id would then (if I know anything of his tactics, which from an impersonal point of view I admire} press for a Saudi official to be stationed at the Fhor in order to see that this free transit was observed. This would give him to some ext ent a footing in the Gulf, and a means of extending his influence and authority over the Shaikhs of the Truoial 3oast, which it is part of His Majesty* s Government’s cons idered policy to prevent - vide e.g. paragraph 4 (*) of India Office ^ letter Ho.2?.3.4535, dated the 12th January 1935 to i $0 the Foreign Office. (4) For the moment very little traffic goes through Khor el Ode id in view of the desolate area behind, it, and at present the Khor ds apparently only fit for small craft* But it might be possible by dredging and buoying to make it a passable port for steamers. If at any time oil was struck by the California Oil Company within a reasonable distance of the Coast it might pay chem to develop the Khor, as at present they are considering the development of R&amp;s fanurah, and run /9 / «7« run a pipe-line to its as we know pipe-lines in these days can cover considerable distances. If this occurred free transit of the oil might mean considerable loss to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.

Odeid liaa all along been claimed by the Chief of Abu .Dhabi as a part of his territory and we have supported his claim. The first paper on file 626 is a letter (dated 11th lay 1861) from Shaikh Jasem bin Thani of Katr in which he asks the Resident to allow nim to re-build Odeid. In reply he is informed that his request cannot be complied with as the place is an appanage of Abu Mhabi. A.P.a* considers that Odeid is one of the most secure harbours for native craft, but from Colonel Talbot's report to Government (Ho.31 of 15th March 1892, page 176 file 323 Vol. XXXVI) it would appear that the harbour is unsurveyed and consequently unsafe. H.M.S. 'Brisk* had to anchor about 30 miles from Odeid, and only communicated with it by a boat (p. 184). In former years a small colony of discontents who had seceded from the main body of the Beni Yas tribe of Abu Dhabi had been living at Odeid under a Shaikh of their own. This Shaikh bad asked to be treated like the other Trucial Chiefs, but we could not do tnis without ignoring Abu Dhabi Chief’s cleim to Odeid. The Shaikh of Odeid therefore appears to have taken up the Turkish flag to show that he was under Turkish protection. Odeid was considered a nest of pirates. In 1877 a piracy was committed on an Abu Dhabi boat by a party of Kl Hurra tribe. The Shaikh of Odeid did not appear to have encouraged the pirates, but was considered to© weak to prevent them from using his port as a starting point. The Chief of Abu Dhabi had been hitherto prevented by us from bringing his refractory tribesmen into order, but in view /- 2 - view of the piracies which vtere constantly taking place, a change In our policy was adopted and Shaikh _aeed marched ttgainst Odeid with the support of the British OoTemment, the Resident being personally present (1378), Before however he could reach Odeid, the colonists had left the place, and since then the place appears to have reraained uninhabited (see printed correspondence pp.39 and 50 -res Turkish jurisdiction along Arabian Coast -unnumbered file)* In 1890* the Turks* at the instance of Shaikh Jaeem bin Tt!a,ni took steps to re-build Odeid and had appointed a Mudir who actually arrived in January 1891 at Bahrain en route for Odeid zo take charge of his post, but diplomatic representations made at tne Porte compelled the latter to abandon the project, PP.70* 127, 165 and 175 to 189 file SaS.Vol.XXXVI.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Colonel Kemoall’s letter Ho.102, dated the 6 th April 1904, regarding the occupation of Odeid by the Chief of Abu Dhabi. 2. The Government of India agree in your view that Shaikh iiaid , e right to Odeid is undoubted, but the Chief can have no claim to British support in re-occupying a place which he admit © his inability to hold unaided and which has apparently r©nained deserted ever since the flight ot ohaikh Bafcay and the demolition of its habitations by the Chief of Abu Dhabi himself in 1878. Past experience, moreover, shows that the place has been a source of con siderable trouble to the shaikh. vide letter from the Political Resident Tnthe Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Ho.232 dated 30th October 1878, and ...

If the Shaikh were now again to people the place, it is probable that the settlers would again secede and would form a fresh cause of embarrassment to Shaikh haid. 3. From the point of view of British interests there appears at present to be no reason why the Government of India /- 2 - f Inaa should lend their support to the enterprise. The sanction of His Majesty* s Government has recently been asked to the conclusion | vide despatch ilo.77 Becret - External, I dated 3 1 st March 19040 of which copy has of an agreement 0 been forwarded to you this day# with the Shaikh of “ ™' ' — El KSatr, and if this proposal be approved, the chances of Turkish encroachments in this quarter will in the future be much reduced. There will be no reason for wishing to establish a port to rival those of dl vafer, and indeed it will probably be inadvisable that the Shaikh of Abu habi should re-occupy a place which has been a cause of contention between himself and the Binthanl family in the past, and the re-population of which might easily become a source of fresh quarrels in the future. 4© 'or the above reasons, the Government of India are inclined to think that in present circumstances the place should be left uninhabited and that, unless there are other strong reasons which have not been mentioned, there are, at the present time, no sufficient advantage in lending any encouragement to the r e-occupati on of the place by the Sha ikh of Abu Dhabi, Before parsing final orders in the matter, however, I am to enquire whether Colonel Kenball* a suggestion was actuated by any considerations other than those mentioned in his letter.

I urged the great importance, in view of these considerations, of making a renewed effort to reach a settlement of the frontier question with Ibn Saud, if possible within the next few weeks (i.e. before tne . alestine report is issued), and suggested that we ahoul review the whole of that part of the proposed Line with /nich tne Political ' es ident and the Goverrent of India are concerned, in order to see whether there was any point where we could go rather further towards meeting bn Sard’s desiderata than we md been prepared to do at the time of the yadh proposals. 5 . e agreed after considerable discussion that it was desirable to deal with this question as far as possible from the Imperial rather than from the purely local po.nt of view, but that at the same time there could be no question of our letting down our Arab protegee on the rrucial least ox offer ing bn Sand any concession which would involve a bre ch of faith on our pert towards the haikh of ^atar, the 'iiiaikh of Abu :3hatei, or tr e iultan of Muscat. un the other . hi, In view of the general considerations I had advanoed, it was clear that there could, now be no question of our merely holding ibn Sand back behind any particular line unlees we /•* 2~ wb could eata^li stij on ticnalf’ of 3 orae Arab T ul®r under our protection t a really s 0 nd claim to the territory up to that line* It was therefor a desirable to review very carefully the claims of the ihaiith of atar to Jebel i^aksh, and of Abu Dhabi to the Khor el deid and the wells of 3ufuk, in order that we might toe quite certain that there wa® no doubt about these claims and that we were on really firm ground in resist ing Ibn Saud’s pretensions to these places* 4&lt; 6 then took the line in greater detail and we cam to the conclusion - which had already been re; oned in London - that no concession was possible to Ibn Baud over the Jebel Jteksh, since, apart from the fact that it is clearly a n integral part of the ^tar peninsula from the geographical point of view, and has always been recognise* as part of afar, tni® area is already included, in the concession greeted by the Ihaikh of ''‘atar, with the full approval of it is Majesty*® Government, to Petroleum lone ess ions Limited some years a ; o* nTom every point of view then it would be impossible to hand over this foothill of the .rebel .Dukhan to Ita ,aud. I * suggested that Ibn Baul’s claim to this hill was something in the nature of a *ramp H on the part of fuad haaza - just as Fuad Hamaa’s reference to a non-existent letter from the Shaikh of qatar on the subject was *n obvious ’♦try on** on the part of this proper slippery individual. 5* as regards Ahor el Ode id I explained th t it had occurred to me that the cla im of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to this inlet might perhaps not be quite so water-tight as we had been inclined to imagine* if so, possibly Ibn Baud might be given some rights there, since it now appeared, from what had been said at the fiddle Last (Official) ’eetIng of February /-3 February l»t # tn^t tnere would fee no serious strategical or political objection to this frora trie point of view of hie Majesty 1 a Oorernment. On tne other hand, if we had in iaot definitely and categorically recognised tne rights of Abu Dhabi over this area .*e could not of course give it away to any other Ruler. Tne first thing then seemed to be to look into the foundations of .bu Dhabi^s claim to the hor @1 Ode id. 6 . Colonel ?owle arranged to have this done and an immediate investigation was made into tne Residency archives d ring the relevant period ( 1892-1906). X went through these papers very carefully with Colonel Fewle on the mors lag of February 25th, and it is clear from the eorreapon ence, and particularly from Sir Feroy Cox’s letter so.359 of December 1st 1906, to the Shoiich of Abu Dhabi (copy attached - annex I) that His Majesty’s Government have for’tally recognised the latter’s r ght s over this area, and that they could not possibly hand it over to ibn hand without violating their obligations to tne Shaikh. u» the other n*nd., Colonel Fowls agreed that in any farther discuss ions with Ibn Gaud it might be useful for us to produce tne text of this letter, Since Tbn Gaud would almost certainly fully appreciate our inability to go back on a promise such as that contained in uir Percy Cox’s letter to the Shaikh* , 7. This seemed to ma^e it clear that, however important the general considerations may be* no further concession to Ibn Baud is possible at the base of the ,atar peninsula. On the other hand, our case in regard to this part of the line seems stronger even than we thought, and it ought to be possible to make bn Baud appreciate our inability to make any f rther concession in this sector. a. /4- ■tr 8 . /* tnen &lt;i ieo aaeed tne next sector of the Line i.@. from the point between Hula wain and Ala mat al hakhaia (referred to in the previous oorrespoaience as point B) where the line turns slightly to the south-east, to point B in the neighbour hood of meridian 55 where the line turns south* 9.

The definition mi.ht run somewhat as follows*- *7rom point B ( between Mttlawa in and Alamat al ^akmla). The line then proceeds in a south-easterly direction, followin• so far as possible the diris ion between the hilly country of tne hinterland and the salt marshes of the Sabafchah Hatti, but so as to leare to the Uftaihh of Abu dnabi tne whole of the iSabakhah ^atti, and the whole of the caravan route from * Dhabi to Doha together with the wellfc known :iufuk where travellers nompilly water on the route to i bu Dhabi before crossing the Dabaknah 'atti. The frontier shall however in no case approach nearer than b miles to the caravan route. It shall then proceed in a south-easterly direction to a point to tne south-west of tne most westerly wells (via# 1 Ida aha Kimnawr) of the quia Liwah as shown on the revised edition of Hunter 1 a raapi tnence it shall proceed in an easterly direction to tne south of the qufa liwah wells as shows on tne revised Hunter map, running approximately along meridian 23 up to its intersection with meridian 54 ; and thence in a south-easterly direction to s point to be dete mined later where It shall join the frontier between Abu lhabi and Muscat'''• 10 . I suggested that a definition on these lines would still give the Shaikh of Abu &gt;habi everything to which m has a reasonable claim, but would at the saae time be virtually identical with i bn Baud’s own claims in this area, so that a good deal of play might perhaps be made with the fact that we were thus meeting him fully ever this long an i important sector of the line.11 A* regards tint eastern sector of the line * i.e* trie frontier between I bn 3%ud anJ Muscat - tn© positi m le that Ibn daud has made it clear that he really attaches comparat iTely little Importance to this sector, while on the other hand tne Sultan of Muscat me not yet definitely expressed hi a yie^s* As regarde the southern sector of the frontier, i # e. the boundary to be established be:ween Ibn uaua* &amp; territory and the territory of the Aden irrotectorate to the north of trie Hatiramaut, the Colonial Office nave telegraphed again to the Hciident at Aden, and nothing can be done pcBd ing his reply. It .had occurred to me therefore that there might now be consider able adrantage in trying to deal with the Various sectors of the frontier separately, and that we might be more likely to reach a general settlement with Ibn Baud if we co&gt;lci take these r- r i oua problems one by one, an:' begin by disposing of the northern end of the frontier ~ which I think is tne most difficult and the one to which ibn Baud attaches most import ance. If this is got out of the way I think tne problems of tne other sectors mf y possibly be cons Hera biy simplif ied, and we slktl! at any rate nave one source of friction the less. 12 . 1 suggest therefore that when i get to jedeta 1 should, subject to the approval of ills Majesty's Government and of tne Government of India, suggest to ir H. Bullard that, unless he sees objection, he should reopen the question with bn iaud on the above lines, dealing only with tne northern sector. Hr H. Bullard could explain to Ibn Baud that His Majesty's Sovern- ment are anxious to reduce to a minimum the possible sources of friction between theme elves and bn Baud and that they nave therefore again carefully considered tne question of the frontier. They nor think the beet means of making progress will /7- wiil be to deal with tne various seotors of the frontier separately and they have carefully reconsider d the whole question of the northern sector of the frontier* Tne position as regards the Jebel MaKsh and the iihor el udeid is that they are in honour bound to protect the rights of the Shaifcns of Qatar and Abu Dnabi to these two areas. They cannot contemplate violating these obligations, they cannot there! .re maKe any further concession on these points, they e re however prepared to adopt what will be virtually I bn laud’s own line on the second sector of the frontier, ana they now propose that this sector should be defined on the lines suggested above. they con aider that there would be every advantage, from tne poi it of view of Anglo-Saudi relations, in getting tnxa question oi tne northern sector of the frontier disposed of without further delay, since they view with some uneasiness the present indeterminate situation in this area and would deplore any incident which might lead to difficulties between tnem and Ibn Uaud as a result of continued failure to reach agreement, they therefore trust that ibn Saud will show in this natter the eame political wiedoift which ne has recently suown in so many other quest ions, and agree to a rapid and simple settle ment on the lines they have now proposed. sd.

In addition, in company with Loch we examined yesterday the areas in question from the air in a flying boat kindly put at our disposal by the Royal Air Force. are are of the following opinion. ^ ^ , &gt; 3. (i) nothing can be conceded to Ibn Saud at Jabal Haksh - vide for instance paragraph 2 of my telegram 92 of 1st February 1936. It is clear from air inspection that the Jabal is even more integrally a part of %atar (Signature) than / S. U. (Designation)- 2 - * i than as already thougnt. (ii) Similarly no concession can be made witn regard to IChor el Odeid. here His Majesty^ Government nave accorded tne Shaikh of Abu Dhabi definite recognition that the Khor is in his territory as well as assuring him that tney are prepared to prevent its occupation by anybody else, vide Sir Percy Cox*s letter 3 S 0.359 dated the 1 st December 1906 to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, despatch ed on instructions contained in Government of 10 % (ii i) India Foreign Department letter ho.4151 E B dated the 23rd October 1906 to the Political Resident A in reply to his letter ho .2210 dated the 16th September 1906 to the Government of India. Copies of this correspondence are attached. In the B-C-J sector (of the Riyadh line) we see some hope of settlement. The reason why point C of this sector was put so far inland was to give SUFUK wells to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and on all maps these wells were shown at least 30 miles inland. But in paragraph 3 of Locn^ telegram ho.150 of the 4th November 1935 these wells from local information appeared to be only some 10 miles inland. If this is so then it seems to us that we can draw a line leaving to the Shaikh (a) SABAKHAT Ai EAT?I (b) qUFAT AL LITA (both of which areas Saudis are prepared to give to Abu Dhabi, vide paragraph 2 of Saudi Memorandum of 3rd April 1935) (c) SUFUK wells (and the caravan route tnereon), which would at t he /the same time approximate to the frontier claimed by the Saudi Government# 4. ife were unable to fix the position of Sufuic wells in our flight of yesterday but Locn is arranging for tne Residency Agent, Sharjah, together with a reliable representative of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, to proceed to the wells and mark them so as to be recognizable from the air* When the Residency Agent and representative are at the wells Loch will again fly over the area, fix their position definitely and telegraph accordingly. It should be possible to do this within about a fortnight. 5. Should Sufuk wells be found to be much nearer the Coast than we had thought, this could, I venture to suggest be frankly explained to I bn Saud, when our change of our line will not appear as a further concession after our last H final w offer. This is a point to which (vide the 4 ^ * end of paragraph 4 of my letter of 20tn February quoted above) personally I attach importance with a view to other negotiations we may nave to conduct with the Saudi Govern ment on other Gulf questions. sd* T.C.Fowle, Lieut, -Colonel.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5. / (E 1633/206/91] Copy No. 107 Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden. — {Received, March 22.) (No. 27.) Sir, Jedda, February 28, 1937. IN accordance with the instructions conveyed in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 13o, dated the 5th December, regarding Air. Philby’s expedition into the Aden Protectorate, I had the honour to send you, in my telegram No. 9 of the 22nd February, an outline of Air. Philby’s attitude. I now transmit a full summary of statements which he made to me in the course of a conversation on the 18th February. The collapse of his motor transport and, later, heavy floods delayed his return so long that he had only a few hours in Jedda before leaving for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the Legation and he talked freely about his journey. 2. As I anticipated, Air. Philby was in his most heroic Prometheus mood. Indeed, he was even more difficult than I had expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now added a quite ferocious intention to expose the alleged duplicity of His Alajesty’s Government towards the Arabs of the peninsula. He asserts that the second part of this programme was added only under the provocation which he considers he received from the Aden authorities. I did not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or alleged to have been given in respect of Arab independence. I had never studied the McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and, in any case, it would be unwise to treat Air. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab claims. Moreover, I had in hand the less nebulous argument that Shabwa lay outside the extreme limits ever claimed by the Saudi Government. Mr. Philby’s attitude towards that fact is shown in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record. He professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he, however, claimed to be fully aware. He informed me that he had on his maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and the Saudi. In that case, he was aware before he set out for Shabwa that it lay beyond the limits claimed by the Saudi Government. 3. Mr. Philby is unable to see that he treated Ibn Saud badly in obtaining an escort for topographical work and exploration in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. As to the Aden authorities, he regards their claim to Shabwa as a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Alajesty’s Government in favour of Arab independence in the McMahon correspondence. In that correspondence His Majesty’s Government agreed to recognise “ the independence of the Arab countries” within the limits laid down by the Sherif Flussein, which included the whole of the Arabian peninsula except Aden and, possibly, the Arab States on the Persian Gulf, but they added the proviso: “without prejudice to the existing treaties with Arab chiefs.” Probably Mr. Philby would say tnat His Majesty’s Government had no treaty then and have none now with the Arab chief of Shabwa, and regard that as the last word on a subject of great practical and legal complexity. I assume that the observations of the Chief Commissioner of Aden on Mr. Philby’s claims will be recorded in due course. At first sight it seems to me that there is just enough truth in Air. Philby s contention to afford a moral shelter behind which he can indulge his personal tastes and feelings and interests to the full. . ... 4. Mr. Philby’s claim that from the political point of view his expedition was on all fours with that of Mr. Bertram Thomas is unfounded. It is true that Mr. Thomas was at the time in the employ of the Sultan of Muscat, but he had no official escort, and the Sultan had never given reason to anyone to suppose that he wished to increase his territory. Moreover, the whole of Mi. Thomas s route lay to the east of the blue line which at the time of the Ale Mahon [956 y—5]f H 'WlltJ 'e galitll ked ich aiesk! itirektel dtym n, lie tiilbysEffil rabianw ce ' I •ab polite J ibwa, Ik| Goverifl to Ai [M 3 \ 2. To show that the journey had originally no concern with politics, he could state that he had written all he had intended to say about the Hadhramaut before he started back from Shibam, i.e., before the breakdown of one of his cars compelled him to go to Mukalla to try to get a new back-axle. The chapter was colourless, in spite of the fact that he had seen a lot of things ,5 about which he might hare written. But after the reception he received when he applied to the Resident at Aden for assistance he had changed his mind. Having been attacked, he proposed to defend himself, and he would add chapters to his forth coming book which would tell the world the facts about the Aden Protectorate He was prepared to give His Majesty’s Minister all these facts, but he also proposed to give them to the Saudi Government. 3. The criticism directed against his visit to Shabwa was entirely unjustified. His journey was on all fours with that of Bertram Thomas across the Rub-al-Khali. He was quite right in claiming that, apart from the Hadhramaut, his journey lay in unexplored, undemarcated territory. To claim Shabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate was fantastic, for no protection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of leaving the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs, for they bombed them. The Aden attitude towards Shabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards Walwal at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British -were trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs. 4. His policy remained what it had always been, viz., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the Great War. He had challenged His Majesty’s Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had refused. There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published. He would tell His Majesty’s Minister a cc secret ” : he used to possess copies of the correspondence in English, given to him by T. E. Lawrence, but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5. He was interested to hear (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn Sand, alleging that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact, he had not gone to Marib, but had taken photographs and hearings from a height from which it was visible. (Mr. Philby evaded, or at least did not answer, the question whether the height in question was in Yemen territory.) 6. No, it was not quite correct to say that he was asking for more for Ibn Saud than Ibn Saud was asking for himself, though it was near the truth. What he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the promises. Mr. Philby claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the southern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to have the two lines marked on maps in his possession. When His Majesty's Minister said that in that case he must have known that Shabwa lay well to the south of the proposed Saudi line, he said that the position of Shabwa on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Shabwa was even farther to the south than the map shows, and therefore at a greater distance from the extreme limits claimed by Ibn Saud than appeared from the map. n o I U i ;By Air Mail.

Downing Street, 4th March, 1937. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram iio .6 of the 12 th of January, and to previous telegraphic correspondence, and to inform you that the question of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia has recently formed the subject of further discussion by the Departments concerned. 2* His Majesty’s (Government have reached the conclusion that, in view of certain important Imperial and international considerations which are briefly set out below, it is desirable that every endeavour should be made to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the question of these disputed frontiers. In the first -place the contingency must be envisaged that the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine and the subsequent decisions of His Majesty’s Government will not give general satisfaction to the people of Palestine, and that as a consequence there may be a recrudescence of disorder in that country on a more serious scale than has hitherto been experienced. Moreover, it is likely that the effects of such developments, in so far as they arise from Arab opposition, v/ould not be confined to Palestine alone, but that the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the independent Arab States throughout Arabia would be adversely affected; and there is the obvious RESIDENT 11 ADEN. possibility /ml @) possibility that Italian activities in Arabia would be directed, in such an event to widening the breach* It is oi importance that no unnecessary strain should be placed upon the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Saudi-Arabia at such a critical time; and the conclusion of a friendly agreement in this frontier dispute should appreciably improve those relations. 4* In these circumstances, it has been suggested that the position of the frontier negotiations should be reviewed, and that consideration should be given to the question whether some further concession cannot be made towards meeting King ibn Saud’s claims both in the more northern area and in the Aden Protectorate zone. So far as the Protectorate is concerned, I shall be obliged if you will consider whether, in the light of t «is despatch, some additional concession might not be made in the area between parallels 17 and 18, particularly to the west of meridian 51. It is desirable that the question should be examined from the point of view of the limits of the area over which our tribes have indubitable claims, rather than with a view to the exclusion of King ibn Saud from districts of which the ownership is quite indeterminate- It is realised, that the cession of any mart of the territory to the north of the Hadramaut would mean sc fib deminution in the desert area v/hich separates the Protectorate from foreign territory, and on the retention of which great importance has been laid in the past. Nevertheless I feel that the special considerations mentioned above justify me in asking you once again to review the posicion and report whether some further concession can be made in the Protectorate zone without sacrificing local interests. I have etc. (Sd.) W.

T'-- is true that the nosition of the southern end of the hahana has never been fixed, but such evidence as we have seems to show that a line drawn south 30 degrees east from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Pahana would cut the coast well to the east of Dharbat Ali, the point of division between the Hadhramaut and Oman.

Philby’s 1932 route. it is true that the Rumailah through which Mr. Philby passed is described by him at page 344 as ''generally regarded as a southerly continuation of the Dahna' and on the man as 'sand tract similar to Dahna', but it is clear from his words that it is not called Dahna (Dahana) and both the statement at page 344 and the map indicate that there is a gap between the Dahana and the Rumailah. Thus it is possible that there is a considerable portion of the area desired by the Iraq Petroleum Company (i.e. any area in Saudi Arabia lying east of longitude 48 east and not already covered by a concession granted, to some other company'i which lies between the southern boundary of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company concession and the Violet Line - still more the Violet Line as modified by the latest offer of His Majesty’s Government. 3. Even if the contention set forth in paragraph 2 above is correct I would not suggest that the Iran Petroleum Company should be encouraged to apply for the unallotted area. On the contrary, I agree that such an application at this moment would increase Ibn Caud’s desire to secure a larger share in the Ruba’ &amp;1 T halt than it suits His Majesty’s Government to concede to dim and perhaps complicate the issue by inspiring him with the suspicion that His Majesty’s Government have been biassed all along by the belief that there might be oil in the area in , disnute. / 4. According to the last paragraph of Mr. Rendel’s note °f October 20th (Eoreign Office despatch Ho. 302 dated October 32nd^, Mr. Longrigg proposes to push on with the■concessions over Abu Dhabi, ’Discat and the Aden Protectorate. It is assumed that if a ny such concession is obtained before a frontier agreementagreement with Ibn Saud is concluded, it will not be worded in such a way as to imply a unilateral decision as to any area in dispute. I recognise, however, that this is only s reasonable att-ilucle so Ions' as nn j. as an agreement is arrived at fairly soon, and tiiat it is not dpcii o -fi-i + noL a ©siraole that procrastination should leave a potential oil area either undeveloped or exposed to the encroachment of an African company m virtue of a vague concession from Jbn Gaud. 5. The prospects for the negotiations, when they are reooened, are not encouraging, Ibn Gaud has been given satisfaction on several points which he had much at heart - the manumission of slaves, the eouality of Arabic with -.nglish m the treaty of Jedda, difficulties at Bahrain, and the control of the Legation disoensary and medical staff: on the frontier questions it is difficult for us to go farther than we have already gone; ^uad Bey Hamza’s enquiries about a loan met with a discouraging reception in the City; in the matter of the Hej&amp;z Railway no solution is in sight; ana m the three other major questions - Kuwait Blockade, landing facilities for aeroplanes, and the debt due to His Majesty’s Government, we want something from Ibn Saud and have nothing to offer in return. The only important factor that i G &amp; .n find on the other side is Jbn Gaud’s undoubted desire to remain on good terms with His Majesty’s Government and it ^ay be that having accepted aeroolanes and technical assistance f nom the Italians as a gift he may feel called upon to be accommodating towards His Majesty’s Government to emphasise his imnartiality, The limitation which the doubt about the frontiers places upon the search for oil and minerals may also serve as an inducement to sneed in negotiation, • J would not .p.

The Information obtained in Abu Dhabi (see paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 150 dated the 4th November 1935) proved reliable and we saw the white cloth at the second turn.4 . Bearings \.ere tal^en from about 7000 feet on various points and a comparison of them makes Suful, Yfells twelve miles due south of Has as Sila, v.ith a pos. ibility of an error of half s mile either way. An attempt to check by wireless bearings on Sharjah and Bahrain was not successful, It should be remembered that the coast line in that vicinity as shown in the Hurt is not very accurate, so that bearings taker on points shown in the Chart may have the effect of putting Sufuk on the Chart slightly out of its actual position, but its position is now fixed suffi ciently accurately for our present purpose. 5. During our first flight inland, while quartering, we proceeded probably some 40 miles roughly south west from near Dohat an Nakhalah and the country appeared all the same — patches of sand with low dunes alternatin^g with patches of salty plain. The land over which we passed was a barren waste without even desert bushes to alleviate its desolation. 6 . I am most grateful to the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in T Irav;, for placing aircraft at my disposal for this reconnaissance and to Flight-Lieutenant A.Allen of Ho. 84(Bomber) Squadron who carried out the flight and would request that, if there is no objection, my thanks may be con veyed to them. 7. I should like to commend the Residency Agent for the arrangements made for proceeding to and marking the Wells, which enabled us to pick them up without difficulty or delay.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 1960/92/25] 3/. J\ April 12, 1937. Section 1. ^7 Copy No. 1Q7 Mr. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received Avril 12.) (No. 40.) Sir, ; Jedda, March 23, 1937. Mr. RENDEL’S tour in the Near and Middle East brought him to Jedda on the 17th March, a few days after Ibn Sand’s first appearance in Jedda since my arrival at this post last September, and when I presented Mr. Rendel to him I had myself only seen him once, a few days before, and that only for a short call such as was paid by all the foreign representatives in Jedda. It was to be expected that Ibn Sand would wish to use this opportunity to speak of various matters affecting the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia, and after we had had two meetings on current questions with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba we were invited to call on His Majesty for a conversation on matters of mutual interest. This resulted in three meetings lasting some two hours or more each, and a fourth which might have lasted as long had not Mr. Rendel been obliged to leave to catch his steamer for Egypt. 2. Fuad Bey had left Jedda unexpectedly a few days before Mr. Rendel’s arrival. The alleged reason for his departure at a moment when the presence of the Deputy Foreign Minister might have been regarded as essential was the health of his little boy, about whom he professed to be exceedingly anxious, but information from other quarters does not bear out the plea that the child was seriously ill, and it may be that his jealousy of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Minister in London, who would naturally be present at any interviews accorded to Mr. Rendel, made him glad to leave, and that the King, who perhaps does not trust him fully, was glad to let him take a holiday. During one of our conversations the King mentioned with emphasis as the three men he trusted Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and his son Faisal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Amir joined the group on two occasions, the other two were present throughout. From statements made during the conversations, I am forced to conclude that I have been misled by Fuad Bey on one or two points, and for this reason, and also because of the general pro-Italian reputation which he has acquired, it is impossible to believe that conversations such as we had could have been as full and as frank had Fuad Bey been present. 3. The lavish hospitality which Ibn Saud always displays to guests threatened to assume an alarmingly public character in Jedda. We weie embarrassed to discover that not only were dinners to Mr. Rendel to be gi\en b} the King and the Amir Faisal—festivities which might be taken as a leasonable return for hospitality enjoyed by the Amirs Saud and Faisal in England—but a dinner was to be given by Sheikh Abdallah Sulaiman, the Ministei of r inance. At our request the third dinner was cancelled, but it was replaced by a tea-party, which was attended by the King. The personal character of the party was, however, emphasised by the presence of Mrs. Rendel. The King made a very rare exception to his rule not to receive European ladies, and had her placed m the seat of honour on his right. 4 Not onlv did we endeavour to avoid some of the external signs ot an official visit, but Air. Rendel was careful to explain both at the beginning of his visit to Jedda and also just before his departure, that his journey was personal and private. It was undertaken, he explained, m response to the generous invitation of His Highness the Amir Saud. Nevertheless ^ ^Loio Saudi opportunity to study carefully on the spot various matters affecting Anglo-Saudi relations, in particular the Qatar boundary, and he would be glad if he could assist in arriving at a settlement of this or of any other ^‘f^ng qu 6 ! 1 ”'; 5 At my urgent request Mr. Rendel took the leading pait whenevei theie was a question of explaining the point of view of His Majesty s Hovm— on matters of importance. This was not only reasonable m that he was y going again over ground covered on many occasions with the Saudi representative2 / vSA in London, but there was the even more cogent reason that Ibn Sand would certainly expect to hear the views of an official of the Foreign Office who, to his knowledge, had dealt with Saudi affairs for many years. I venture to believe that Mr. Ren del s visit and the conversations to which it gave rise have been of the greatest value, and will have helped to launch my personal relations with His Majesty under the happiest auspices. Certainly nothing could have been more cordial, friendly and familiar than the King’s words and manner, which never changed, however delicate the point under discussion, and it was interesting to learn from my new Italian colleague, with our interviews fresh in my mind, that he had found the King extremely guarded, and concluded that he was an extremely clever fellow, who would never commit himself. 6. I am fully conscious of the danger that excessive cordiality at the beginning of an acquaintance may lead to disappointment later on. As I informed the Foreign Office in personal letters soon after my arrival, I found that the King regarded me, on the strength of quite normal official letters written by me to King Hussein in 1923-25 and discovered in the Shereefian archives after the fall of Jed da, as a partisan of Ibn Sand’s, and I regretted this assumption, since the oriental builds far too much upon personalities and the King might expect to gain impossible favours from His Majesty’s Government through my efforts and might afterwards be more dissatisfied at failure than if he had never entertained any hope of success. Similarly there is the danger that he may build too much upon Mr. Rendel’s visit, and may hope to influence His Majesty’s Government in matters where it is not possible for them to make concessions or grant favours. But it is sufficient to keep this danger in mind. On the whole I am sure that the cordial conversations have been of very great value. 7. The subjects discussed during Mr. Render's visit were these :— (1) With Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba : (a) Qatar frontier. \b) Transjordan frontier. (c) Koweit blockade. (2) With the King, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba being present:— (a) The general relations of Saudi Arabia with His Majesty’s Govern ment (this includes the Qatar frontier and relations with the Persian Gulf rulers in general). {b) Relations of Saudi Arabia with Italy. (r) The Yemen (with the Italians in the background). (d) Iraq (with the Turks in the background). \e) An appeal for assistance from His Majesty’s Government (not dealt with in detail except to some extent in regard to aviation). (/) Palestine. These questions, which frequently overlapped each other in the course of the conversations, will be dealt with in detail by telegram or despatch. 8. Copies of this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. I have, &amp;c. R, W.

(No. 41.) v &gt; Sir, „ ^ ‘ Jedda, March 23, 1937. IN my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during Mr. Rendel’s short stay in Jedda, from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Rendel’s departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where comment seems to be called for I hope to send it by the following bag, and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.g., references to Ibn Baud’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always roving back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got precious little out of it. I am not saying, at the moment, that any bitterness that Ibn Baud feels on this score is justified, but only that it exists. 4. I have been more than six months at this post, but it was not until now that I could come into contact with the man who directs foreign affairs, as he directs everything else in Saudi Arabia. The peculiar position in which foreign representatives are placed in this country is familiar to you, but it may be of use to illustrate it from my short experience. I arrived at Jedda in the middle of last September, and presented credentials to and dined with the Amir Feisal, a purely nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at once retreated to the hills of Taif/ The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey, was on leave, and did not return until towards the end of November, and for two months I saw no one connected with foreign affairs except the King’s secretary, Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda at the end of September to arrange for the exchange of notes about the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, communicated a long statement from the King'about foreign affairs, and retired to the other side of Arabia. Between the return of Fuad Bey towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising departure on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey, whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I think has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in the enclosure the King twice said that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Riyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda, the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo, Jerusalem, Bagdad, Bushire and Aden. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD.I 1/VO 2 Enclosure. Record of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First Interview, March 20. The King began by laying down the principles which governed his life: (1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self made man, haying started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue ^a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty’s Government that they were nonsense Mr. Rendel said how much the King’s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty’s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2. Ibn Saud said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office '‘telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at this mark ol appreciation of his efforts and repeated what he had said to the mufti (he had advised him to co-operate with the British in maintaining order and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that he had also warned the mufti not to let himself be made an instrument for Italian intrigues. He went on to say that he wanted the whole £ ‘ bundle ’ ’ of Arab States to be on good terms with His Majesty s Government. He was not thinking of Palestine for the moment; that question was being considered, and he trusted that a solution would be found that would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, to the P a ^ es fi ne ’ and to the Arabs in general. No, he was thinking of danger which thieatened the Arab world in two places, the Yemen, and Iraq. • ^ ^ emen - I ^e Yemen was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent, Ahmad, while the Imam said “yes” to everyone. u lc * nothing. When three of the sons of the Imam came on the pilgrimage recen y, bayyid Husain spoke to the King about the situation in the Yemen an askecl for his advice. If there was a revolt in the Yemen, what would be the attitude of (1) Ibn Saud, and (2) the Italians ? According to Sayyid Husain- a /l c lh , n kne W it to be true—the whole population without exception hated Ahmad and the Foreign Minister, Raghib, a Turk who is in Italian pay. They i ac , aS Yki °r t ^ ie remov al of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad. They ax ser C e mam a written protest (here the King gave us a copy), but without enect. !f they were free they would revolt and sweep away both Raghib and ma , an e Imam too if he opposed this popular movement, p *, i •° A 8 ea T ull Y f rom Sayyid Husain, Ibn Saud said he had replied that, ' - 1 , , ims f- ’ , le P 10 P 0se d to observe a policy of complete neutrality and n A 1 2 r 11 111 ^ emen a ^ a i rs - He had withdrawn once when he might have p e em Gn, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there T i e 10u ^.® m the Yemen, the most he could do would be to consult other L T n ™ U , Utri - eS lf asked both sides t0 tr y t0 make peace, and to see what could hud tnlH w glVG eff u Ct to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Saud tC Th'iti f r. b0 Ti be R ? me understanding of 1927, and had said that both and the Italians had assured him that it was their firm desire that[981 m—5] B ^ [If EL ni i( the independence of the 1 emeu should be maintained. In conclusion, Jbn Saud deelai-ed vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen-perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty s Government? o. Mr Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation m the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been and still are, intriguing actively m that country and would be very read} to fish m the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was peihaps moie dangerous than it had been, he was inclined for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” (At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevant text, which had already been communicated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Ryan.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it was obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to establish herself in the Temen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Government. No doubt Italian hotheads, possibly Italian local officials, cherished designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indications suggested that for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but was rather seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think King Ibn Saud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemen. Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development which threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event, Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him. though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports all tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had been much to be said against Yasin-al-Hasbimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Government, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to acquire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to anyone who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence, Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military coup d’Etat, Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake .4 himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Gov i i 1. _ ^ ^ 4- X-V ^ -n -nr-r m 1TT/'\n I I /'VOfN /d /-J 4- i 1 UllllO^iX XX^V/ xxx xxxxxxx-xx^® — !

UQ0| would have scouted the suggestion that Turkey might embark on a policy of arlvpntnrp In this oninion he had been seriouslv shaken hv Tn^A.&gt; adventure. In this opinion he had been ^seriously shaken by Turkey’s Alexandretta policy, but the Turks, had not ‘ £ got away with it” over Alexandretta, and they had, he thought, felt themselves much isolated at Geneva and had retreated from the extreme position they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had received so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he wanted to make some remarks under four heads (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. (2) The Arabs in general. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for over two hours, but never got beyond the first head. Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty’s Govern ment from the moment when he first entered into communication with them through the Political ikgent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish themselves strongly in the Arabian Peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the Sherif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the “ guarantees ” which he had received from Sir Percy Cox. Nothing whatever had come of these ££ guarantees,” though he had been promised ' all sorts of things.” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the Turks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein— offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw this offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had. and asked that, if he sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Saud thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two conditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the xMabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba, which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further; when he refrained at the request of His Majesty’s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappointment of some of his followers. I oi’ all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads :— i a ) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (h) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. (o) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein. li example maiiofA liaDvsdn any clog i ] N Arabia ^ Ethic fin?id I lr l'oii u v v win' ;, 9 ®8'1I fllieli, llajfetfii': loisli \xmw .SirPffil aiter| fij ofei aslifl nm itislRf gPl 3.PJ i #| 4 t«i&gt;i Whereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him he had had no help from His Majesty's Government, Look what His Majesty's Government had done for Lgypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Smiid] Arabia could, m his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 11. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rendel suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources,’ could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, how ever, Ibn Saud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Saud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would speak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister through “ that man ” (pointing to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin) a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Britain. As to the Italians, he swore as a Moslem and an Arab that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived, he wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full all our resources for the manufacture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should therefore be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance in matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 12. The subject was again referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government with their scheme of rearmament, and spoke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.g., Egypt, to produce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Reader Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close relationship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themselves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots trained in Italy were no good. At one point in the con versation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Saud was assured, would receive the most careful attention. ; T Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account Hie negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of friendship and Alliance In so fnn as it had a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud that6 MM Ltoregi^ Litniat)' Litialw mH s 1 .'rfimiPl I c: Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Sand, and that Ibn Sand should deal with the Imam about his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Saud had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must act together in both matters He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter of securing the adhesion of the Imam to the treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to sign anything in which there was a reference to the League. Mr. Rendel explained that members of the League could not assume any obligation which might be incompatible with their existing obligations under the Covenant, and that they were therefore bound to make a reservation to that effect in any treaty involving military assistance, &amp;c. Moreover, Iraq was also bound by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which, as His Majesty’s Government had pointed out to the Iraqi Government, involved a similar reservation on the part of Iraq. Mr. Rendel said that, of course, such a reservation would not affect a party not a member of the League, and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nor the Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the part of Iraq. 15. The King then said that he had often been asked whether the Arab States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. He had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, but he would ,o ir n P be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running piracy, the slave trade &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the 5* (v Ireatv of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms were m the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs and therefore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State. Ibn Saud seemed to accept this if® statement without demur. mmw. 16. This subject led to the question of the frontiers. Mr. Rendel repeated the arguments which he used with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, saying PB t at His Majesty s Government had made great concessions in this respect, wheieas His Majesty was holding firmly to his original demand. In the northern pa it ot the eastern frontier there remained nothing between the parties but the f6tir /&lt;? ? h^aksh and Khor-el-Odeid. with perhaps an adjustment in the Sufuk (Sa aq) region that might go some way towards meeting the King’s wishes. ou not His Majesty make some concession here? It would make an excellent impression on the Foreign Office if he could. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar statement that the whole of the coast belonged to his ancestors and that the present yt; rueis would not deny it. Koweit, for instance; all the tribes living in Koweit weie leally Saudi tribes. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement,C) but am i 6 ^ boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. e Qatar was well known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. K maps which were at hand were examined, but Araik was not LfNio mai \e on them. Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on which. ;%to unless his memory was at fault, Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh. Males m that case there would no longer be any disagreement on that point, \ AY, . . • 8 to Khor-el-Odeid, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saudi /And . rabia, he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as ot his own, for no one but himself could keep order there When crimes wereWkh. committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. Qy _ AAl seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appealed at first that he was wanting to evade the boundary question, but when ;rvvr\ ° f GT SU * wn k roa( ffied it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war? buppose war began m Europe, or in the Yemen, or anywhere? Could not His jajes y s lovenunent make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking with him ? It could be secret if they wished. i • Mu Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any o secie guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system. L) This reference should be to Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda.%0{ij ? s Gom part of y wietidil qTreitfi tateiiy ’iooW ieGI,| long Jill 1 to M 'at tie®! laolll ptt-| lim itlesrt 1,1 g 1 '*! or #, which would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain Sir It Bill In rvl added that His Majesty s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine anv occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Maiestv’s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war m particular, and could not gave one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927 Hm Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a “ vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22. 21- The King said that m this the last conversation before IVlr. Rendel s depaitme he wished to speak about Palestine. 1 he Arabs were now really alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would s be established in Palestine and would include 1 ransjordan m its scope and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomet. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposition, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, e.g., Egypt, Iraq and India. There were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for propa ganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Government, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where inany of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestine. 22. ^ His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. 23. Ibn Sand said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do; what should he say? Should he reply to this effect:— He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Aemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-intervention. Rendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT 9 EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. I? [E 2123/92/25] BUG!

THE moment I received your Excellency’s letter of the 23rd March, 1937, I hastened to put right the point which your Excellency raised. In the interview I had in haste with your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday, the 10th Muharram (22nd March, 1937), I explained to you that I did not believe that His Majesty the King, in his conversation to which you referred, meant A1 Ureyq but Dukhan. There was a slip of the tongue. After I left your Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concerning the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place, which is south of Naksh, but the one which is south of Dukhan, which makes Naksh within the Saudi Arab Kingdom. During the conversation His Majesty did not think of giving up the claim concerning the frontiers put forward by the Government of His Majesty. His Majesty’s statement was accidental and did not concern the details of the case. The question was not one of discussing the exact position of the frontiers, and I therefore think the question still stands where it did. With highest respects, YUSUF YASIN. [981 t—3]Enclosure 2 . Note by Ibn Saud amplifying his Statements about \his Position in regard to the Arab Riders on the Persian Gulf. (Translation.) I HAVE spoken clearly about the historical stages in the relations between 1 me an'd the British Government, all of which have been courteous and consistently amicable on my part, and sometimes on the part of the British. But what filled me with misgiving, much annoyed me and affected my honour are the two following points : — ( 1 ) The question of the frontiers of Qatar, Oman and other principalities of the Gulf. ( 2 ) The question of trade and marine transport. As regards the first point, these territories themselves, as you are aware, were under the suzerainty of my ancestors, and until the time of my grandfather’ Faisal, paid an annual tax for the preservation of the relationship of vassal to overlord. But in view of our desire for the continuation of our friendship with the British Government and the said Amirs to whom we are bound by old ties, we have recognised their positions in the Persian Gulf and their principalities,’ and have respected the treaties between them and the British Government. But it never entered my head that this could be a reason for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when every one admits that the peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us. It is not reasonable that such pressure should be due to suspicion of us or to doubt as to our intentions or our friendship, or to the accusation that we covet a territory which is ours. For the covetous man does not covet a mountain or an inlet; he covets rather a densely populated country. What we care for is the protection of our honour and the defence of the rights of our subjects and tribes. As to the question of trade, I know 7 that ships call at, and carry goods and all kinds of merchandise to, ports on the Persian Gulf which are less important than mine, and I who count myself the oldest friend of Britain and the greatest of the Arabs am placed at the mercy of Koweit or Bahrain; and whenever the question is raised, it is said that it is one for the shipping companies. I did not believe that friends could treat each other in such a cruel manner. Praise be to God w 7 ho granted me and my country more power than that of Kov 7 eit, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, &amp;c. Why should ships call at those places and mine suffer deprivation in that no ships call there ? I hope you will, as you have stated, consider the situation as it is and a veil vdll be drawn over the past if its mistakes can thus be corrected. Otherwise you may inform me of the real reasons. I have summarised in this letter what I have told you at length in my conversation. March 23, 1937. f.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a record made by Mr. Rendel of a discussion which we had with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on the 19th March about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia in and near the region of Qatar. The record is accompanied by two sketch maps /■ made by Mr. Rendel, viz., ( 1 ) the Jabal Naksh area^ 1 ) ( 2 ) Khor-al-Odeid-O 2. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 1 of the 4th January, I had for some time been discussing the southern frontier with Fuad Bey, as neither His Majesty’s Government nor Ibn Saud felt able to give way about either Jabal Naksh or Khor-al-Odeid. The information collected by Mr. Rendel on the spot seemed, however, to be so clear that I fully agreed with | him that it would be worth while to make an effort during his stay in Jedda to . come to an agreement on this, the most difficult part of the frontier, in the hppe' that this potential cause of friction, perhaps dangerous friction in time oLefisis, might be cleared out of the way. The history of the case subsequent to the discussion recorded by Mr. Rendel is given in my despatches No. 41 of the 23rd March and No. 46 of the 27th March, but for convenience of reference I summarise the relevant portions of those despatches here. 3. At an interview with Ibn Sand on the 21st March Mr. Rendel made an appeal for a settlement of the Jabal Naksh-Khor-al-Odeid-Sufuk (Safaq) portion of the frontier. Ibn Baud repeated his familiar argument that the whole of the coast used to belong to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement, but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik (Uraiq) which was in the nufud. The maps which were at hand were examined, but none showed Araik. I said that unless my memory was at fault I had seen a map on which Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh; if that were so, there would no longer be any disagreement on this point. Ibn Saud then turned to Khor-al-Odeid, and said that in claiming it for Saudi Arabia he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own. No one else could govern that region. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 4. On my return to the Legation I found that in the only map that showed iMaik (that enclosed in Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 16th January, 1936, to Sir Andrew Ryan) it was in fact shown just north of Qasr-al-Salwa, i.e., exactly where we have proposed that the boundary should run. I also consulted telegram^... No. 92, which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sent to the India OfficeJ^' LC&gt; on the 1 st February, 1936, which supports this view. I therefore wrote to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin suggesting that the definition of the boundary given by the King left Jabal Naksh to Qatar. His reply, which is given as an enclosure to my despatch No. 46, dated the 27th March, if confused in some respects, is clear enough in denying that the King admitted that Qatar included Jabal Naksh and in implying that the boundary runs between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh. I have since discussed the matter with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin as well as one can discuss a subject with a man who admits that he knows nothing about it. He quotes Fuad Bey’s statement of the 3rd April, 1935, a copy of which was sent to you in Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 100 of the 7th April, 1935, and declares that that letter still expresses the King’s views. Now this statement assumes, in its first paragraph, that there is an area lying between Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh, and. although we know, from Mr. Rendel’s observations, that Jabal Naksh (9 Not reproduced. [981 t—1] B2 is only a part of the Jabal Dukhan, which is slightly higher than the adjacent crest, this difference in our premises will never be settled by looking at maps in Jedda, and I feel that, if the argument is to be pdrsued profitably, responsible representatives of the two sides will have to visit the spot together and te come to 1 ; 251 an agreement about the physical features. ^ 5. I have, however, suggested in my telegram No. 24, dated the 25th March, that it is not desirable to try to force a settlement on the frontier question at the present moment. If what seemed to be the overwhelming evidence obtained by Mr. Rendel had convinced Ibn Saud it would have been excellent thing, but the note which forms the second enclosure to my despatch No. 46, dated the 27th March, shows clearly that he is not convinced, and that the frontier on the east remains a very sore point with him. Given this feeling, and the difference of opinion about the physical features in the Jabal Naksh, I feel that to continue to urge Ibn Saud at present to accept our point of view would be useless, and would go far to counteract the good effect of the conversations which took place during Mr. Rendel’s visit. In any case, I think that no decision to continue to press for the frontier we want should be taken until you have had an opportunity to consider the matter in the light of the recent conversations, and J have recommended this in my above-mentioned telegram No. 24i In the meanwhile, I have sent replies to the two communications on this and kindred subjects which formed the enclosures to my despatch No. 46, but I have foreborne to press our claim. Copies of these replied are enclosed. In one I acknowledge receipt of Ibn Saud’s complaint against being hemmed in by His Majesty’s Government on the east, in the other I transmit to the Saudi Government the information about the position of S ufuk which has been received in Bahrein telegrams Nos. 64' and 65, dated the 23rd and 24th March, and give my opinion that there is some serious discrepancy between the Saudi information and our own as to the physical features in the Jabal Naksh region. 6 . It may be said that as we have made up our minds about Jabal Naksh and Khor-al-Odeid, Ibn Saud has nothing to gain by delay, while we stand to lose in that a cause of friction is left which might lead to trouble at a time of crisis. I do not think that either of these arguments is completely sound. Ibn Saud may feel that he cannot hope to obtain either of the two coveted areas, but that is not the same as signing the places away in writing and thus belittling himself in the eyes of the Arab world. As to the danger likely to result from an undetermined frontier, I suggest that the fear of such a danger can be exaggerated. If there should ever be war in which His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia were on opposite sides, it is not a description of the frontiers on paper that would prevent Ibn Saud from trying to advance to the shores of the Persian Gulf at various points, while if Ibn Saud were on our side or neutral he would not disturb the status quo. Everything now suggests that he realises that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are bound up with each other, and if we are unable to give him all that he asks for we should at least, I think, refrain from pressing him to make an admission that we can do without. 7. In order that our claim may not go by default, we might suggest that a .jjtafluKo t f/mies of i JlHADE htidlinistn - i Sir Read ilehad se i!

Then I would urge that we should examine carefully the possibility of giving Ibn Saud a loyalty on any oil that may be struck in or near Jabal Naksh on the pretext that 'xt oo s ^ ra ^ a mus t run partly under his territory. In my despatch No. 38 E., dated the 11th March, 1937, on the finances of Saudi Arabia, I stressed he poverty of this country and the strain that will be placed upon Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals in his territory continues to be unsuccessful, and n u u r i ^ lsco Y ere( ^’ as R h as been at Bahrein, in the territory of some minor sheikh like the Sheikh of Qatar. Anything that can reasonably be done to reduce this risk should be done. . 8 - From correspondence going back to 1904, of which copies have been received from Bushire, it is clear that the Government of India have always regarded Khor^EOdeid as belongin g to Abu D habi. On the other hand, it seems equally clear that the'~SheTlHroP Abu Dhabi never exercised any authority there then, and Ibn Saud claims that it is he who exercises authority there now. though it seems that the population is very scanty, if, indeed, the area contains any inhabitants at all.

Enclosure 1 . Record made by Mr. Rendel, March 20. 1937. South-Eastern Arabian Frontiers. bIR READER BLLLARD and I called on Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March to discuss the frontier question. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and a secretary from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Muhammad Shaikho) were also present. Sheikh Hafiz interpreted with Sir Reader Bullard’s assistance. I. 2. Sir Reader began by explaining that not long ago, according to the records he had seen, there had been some thirty questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. These had now happily been reduced—as regards questions of major importance—to three, i.e., the eastern and southern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, the Transjordan fontier, and the Koweit blockade. He explained that I had taken the opportunity of my present journey to make a special study on the spot of the first of these three questions, and suggested that the occasion of my visit to Jedda might usefully be taken to discuss it in the light of my investigations. 3. Sheikh Yusuf replied that, though certain questions might still be out standing, no question at issue could make any difference to the firmness of Anglo-Saudi friendship. 4. I explained that, while it was happily true that Anglo-Saudi friendship rested on so solid a foundation that such local issues were unlikely ever to disturb it, it was, nevertheless .wise to take the opportunity of the calmness and cordiality of our friendship to clear up all outstanding points and eliminate as far as we could all potential causes of local friction. An unsettled frontier, as had been shown over and over again elsewhere, was always a potential danger. It would renewed thoroughness. I had discussed it with the British authorities in the Persian Gulf, I had gone through the relevant archives at the British Residency, and, in order to satisfy myself personally that we were not making any exaggerated or unjustified claims, I had, in company with Colonel Fowle, Colonel Loch and Captain de Gaury, flown over and round all the disputed points of Our subject, as the Saudi Government well knew, was to meet King Ibn Saud’s wishes to the utmost possible extent. But, unfortunately, my hopes of finding our case ill-founded or of devising a means of suggesting some compromise over the more difficult parts of the line had not been realised. II. 6 . I then suggested that we should consider the various sections of the frontier in detail, and that we should begin with the Jebel Naksh. I showed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin our latest map of the Qatar Peninsula, and also a sketch map and elevation of the Jebel Naksh and surrounding district, which I had the frontier on the northern section of the line, particularly the Jebel Naksh and the Khor-el-Odeid. I confessed that I had hoped that the facts would prove such as to enable us to offer some further compromise in regard to these two points. 5. With this end in view I had taken the opportunity of the King’s invitation to me to visit Saudi Arabia to go into the whole matter again with surely be well, then, to get the matter finally settled and out of the way as soon as possible.drawn myself as a result of my observations from the air (copy attached)^ 1 ) I left him a duplicate of this sketch, which showed unmistakably that the Jebel Naksh is geographically an integral part of the Jebel Dukhan and of the Qatar Peninsula. I pointed out that the obvious line for the frontier of the peninsula ran across the flat sand south of the Jebel, and I developed the obvious general arguments against establishing unnatural and unsound frontier lines. 7. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin replied that the King could legitimately claim a great deal more than the Jebel Naksh. All the tribes in this area really owed him allegiance. But he was, nevertheless, prepared to abandon his rights over the greater part of the area, if the Jebel Naksh remained^ in his possession. 8 . I answered that this might perhaps have been an argument if he were claiming the whole of Qatar. But this was not practical politics. We had, by our treaties, guaranteed Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhs against absorption by any other Power, and King Ibn Saud had recognised and accepted this situation by the Treaty of Jedda. The integrity of Qatar must, therefore, be maintained, and we really could not reasonably be expected to accept any claim which would involve its dismemberment. Had any concession in this area been at all possible I could assure Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that I should have been the first person to urge it. 9. I added that, in all the early stages of this dispute there had never been any question of a Saudi claim to the Jebel Naksh. The claim, indeed, which had only been put forward by Fuad Bey Hamza at an advanced stage of the controversy, had come as a complete surprise to us. Was it worth then risking a settlement for it? HI. 10 . We then passed on to the second part of the frontier, i.e., that between Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. This brought us to King Ibn Saud's claim to the Khor-el-Odeid. 11. I explained that here also I had very greatly hoped that something might have been done to meet King Ibn Saud’s wishes. But my reading of the archives of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf had shown that the claim of Abu Dhabi to this area was far older and stronger than I had imagined, and that the Khor-el-Odeid had been formally recognised by us for the past sixty years at least —long before there was any question of any Saudi claim—as the property of the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. 12. I then gave Sheikh Yusuf Yasm a summary of some of the relevant history notably the correspondence of 1878, 1881, 1890 and 1906 (see attached note, of wdiich Sir Reader Bullard gave the sheikh a copy later), and read him the second paragraph of Sir Percy (then major) Cox’s letter of the 1 st December, 1906, to Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa of Abu Dhabi, which Sheikh Hafiz Wahba translated, and which Muhammad Shaikho took down. 13. 8 &gt;heikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba attempted to argue that Kmg Ibn Saud’s recognition by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of our special treaty relations with the Trucial Sheikhs did not imply any recognition of any particular frontiers; but I pointed out that our recognition of a valid claim by such a sheikh to any particular place formed part of our treaty relations with that sheikh, and must be regarded as covered bv Ibn Saud’s recognition of our special relations with him. 14. I added that as regards the Khor-el-Odeid itself King Ibn Saud would not be losing anything of any value. The sea here, as I had seen from the air, was a mass of reefs, while the entrance to the Khor was so long, narrow, winding and shallow, that I could not conceive of its being any use to any one as a harbour, v li ^0 the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the continued possession of this area had a different importance, which it could not possess for King Ibn Saud. We did not want the Khor-el-Odeid as a harbour; but the land immediately to the west of it afforded the only land passage between Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and it was ai more important for Abu Dhabi to retain the caravan route and to keep a coterminous frontier with Qatar, than for King Ibn Saud, who already had good potential harbours at such places as Ras Tanura, to obtain a new fragment of sea coast of very problematical value. But in any case, as King Ibn Saud would be the nrst to realise, we could not go back on the categorical undertaking contained in Sir Percy Cox’s letter of 1906. &amp; fcttliwellsi hI tote n |j« matter w p to find &lt; I lpible fo irked upi 4 to serio bed. in fll. . iitle south- pined as a yiild be no AtiHehplay A bad been ® against S 17.

We then considered the next section of thg frontier, ?.&lt;?., from the point south-west of the Sabkhat Matti where it turns jit, to the point where it joins the iTiZ l US ° at aD 1 ° m ri I T sal , d that ^gard to this sector the situation seemed to me rather more hopeful. In their nofe of the 3rd April, 1935, the Saudi Government had agreed to the Sabkhat Matti and the line of wells described on the latest edition of Hunter s map as the Qufa Liwa remaining to Abu Dhabi All we wanted to be sure of was that the wells of Sufuk, which according to our information lay on the caravan route from Abu Dhabi to Doha, should remain together with the caravan route itself, within Abu Dhabi territory The discrepancy between our line and the Saudi line in this area, which was in any case slight, was due to Sufuk being marked where it was on Hunter’s map. But there was some reason to believe that this marking was inaccurate, and that feuiuk wells and the caravan route really lay rather nearer to the coast. I had hoped to be m possession of accurate information on this point in time to clear up the matter with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at once. Unfortunately, we had not been able to find the wells during our flight, and I had just learnt that it would be impossible for Colonel Loch to complete the further investigation he had at once embarked upon before well on in the next week. The point ought not, however, to lead to serious difficulty, since we were really agreed on the main principles 16. Sheikh Yusuf said that Sufuk was a Murra well. I replied that we could not accept these progressive claims for the Murra tribe. We had agreed that Banaiyan was a Murra well and given up Abu Dhabi’s claim to it in^con- sequence. But all our information showed that the normal Murra dira ended well to the south-west of Sufuk wherever it was. If the Saudi Government always claimed as a Murra well the next well beyond the last well we had conceded, there would be no reason why they should not eventualy claim Muscat town. I made as much play as I could of our concession at Banaiyan, in order to show how ready we had been to concede a point whenever earefuf enquiry showed that the facts were against us. But this was not so now. V. 17. After a good deal of further discussion in which the historical and legal aspects of the question were touched upon, only to be set aside in favour of a more practical solution on the basis of the situation now existing, Sir Header Bullard explained that he had at first expressed the view that it would be best to leave discussions on this part of the frontier in abeyance for the present. But the investigation I had made into the matter had led him to change his mind, and he now agreed that it would be far better to get the matter settled and disposed of as quickly as possible. 18. I suggested that, although we had at first proposed that the frontier question should be dealt with as a whole, we were now more likely to make progress if we took the various sectors of the frontier one by one. The sector between Saudi Arabia and Muscat involved consultation with the Sultan of Muscat, which was not yet completed and would involve further loss of time. The sector between Saudi Arabia and the Hadhramaut area of the Aden Protectorate was still being reinvestigated by the Aden authorities, and I could not yet say what might emerge. But for the northern sector, i.e., the frontier with Qatar and Abu Dhabi, we now had practically all the material we could need, and I greatly hoped, therefore, that a settlement of it could be reached without further delay. I felt sure that, after all that had passed, it would now be best to tackle this frontier bit by bit. 19. Sheikh Yusuf did not demur to this suggestion, but said he must refer the whole matter to the King. He would do this at once and let us know the result as soon as possible. 20. In conclusion, I again urged the desirability of reaching an early settle ment. I pointed out that three years ago the position had been that we were taking our stand on the strictly legal position and claiming the “ blue ” and “violet” lines. As a result of much very hard work and of our great desire to go to the utmost limits to satisfy King Ibn Sand we had eventually agreed to concede a very large area to him and had finally put forward the &lt;£ Riyadh Line.” I showed Sheikh Yusuf these lines on the map and emphasised the extent to whichwe had modified our attitude in order to show our friendship for the King. But what was the position of the Saudi Government? They.had put forward, on the 3rd April, 1935, a line, which I showed Sheikh Yusuf on the map, from which they had never retreated an inch. I was no supporter of a policy of bargaining, and I did not believe in progressive concessions. But now that the new lines were so close to each other as to approximate within a few miles, I felt the time had really come for the Saudi to make some concession too and reciprocate the con ciliatory spirit we ourselves had shown. There was really now very little between us • but, as Sheikh Yusuf would realise from what I had said earlier in the discussion we really could make no further concession. Sir Reader warmly endorsed this appeal and the conversation concluded with a renewed promise from the Sheikh to refer the whole matter to the King without delay. 1 . 1878. Sheikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi was assisted by Her Majesty’s Government to send an expedition to exterminate the pirates of Odeid. The pirates fled before the expedition arrived, but it was made clear that Her Majesty’s Government regarded the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as responsible for what happened at Odeid and recognised that place as his territory. 2 . 1881. Sheikh Yasin bin Thani of Qatar was told, in reply to his enquiries, that Her Majesty’s Government could not agree to his rebuilding Odeid “ as the place is an appanage of A hu Dhabi” 3. 1890. The Turks tried to send a mudir to Odeid, but on his arrival at Bahrein, Her Majesty’s Government immediately made diplomatic representations to the Porte, on the ground that Odeid belonged to Abu Dhabi, and the Turks abandoned their project in consequence and the mudir was recalled. 4. The correspondence of 1904-6, ending with Sir Percy (then Major) Cox’s _ letter of the 1 st December, 1906, to Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifa of Abu Dhabi, the first two paragraphs of which read as follows : — £t You will remember that on the last occasion on which we met you asked your friend to look again into the question of the reoccupation of Odeid by you and to make a reference to Government in the matter. I did as you requested. The Government have given careful consideration of the question and I am desired to tell you that while they recognise that the place is in your territory and are prepared to prevent its occupation by any one else, but yourself they are not satisfied that its reoccupation by you would have any good or peaceful result, and for that reason are not inclined to assist you in reoccupying the place.” . ^ l e H er of the 23rd March you kindly sent me a note in which His iajesty King Abdul Aziz was so good as to develop the statements which His lajesty had made during the conversations with Mr. Rendel and myself, about e Arab teriitones on the Persian Gulf and about the question of trade through e ports on the Persian Gulf. I am sending a translation of that note to the oreign Office immediately and I am sure that it will be considered by His Majesty s Government, like all the communications from His Majesty, with close and sympathetic attention.

It may, howeTer, be convenient to examine tiieee olaima ae &amp; whole, iren Ibn ;iaud, I presume, does not antedate his 1 anoestral cla in&gt;e * to the ^rab Shaikhdoms of the Gulf to &amp; period prior to the f unding of his lynaety. In order, therefore, to assess the worth of his claims a very brief sketch of the rise of the /ahabi Dynasty* as well a a of the Arab Sheikhdoms, is necessary (see Lorimer 1 s •Gaaetteer of the Persian Gulf* Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter VIII* and other authorities}. 4* (a) On ft has become so accustomed to Ibn Baud's long rule over an ever-exponding Saudi arabia, together with an impression of a centuries-old Empire skilfully created by his reiteration of * ancestral claims*, that one is inclined to forget how comparatively recently the Saudi ( fahabi) Dynasty was founded. In point of fact this did not occur until about father of Ibn Baud, on being driven out of Kejd by Ibn Rashid, sought refuge in .Kuwait with hie son 1760 when luhamjaad bin Baud adopted /ahhabism and with its aid rose to power as Amir of Hejd (b) Kuwait , which was founded in about 1716 by settlers from the *trtub tribe, was by 1756 a and became a pens ionei/of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. The latter gave Ibn Saud much active assistance in the field and it was from Kuwait as a base that/ loo 3aud succeeded in making, dims elf jyoir of lejd ; j I i\l~ l'^04* Since that date, up to the present time, luwait has remained, as before, independent of Jlejd. f -Lw^ t (c) Balarain was taken frma the Pereians in 1782 by the , j j 4.’Utub tribe, whose descendants now rule Bahrain, I * tram ^ufcarah* it was not till 1810 that the Wahhabis exacted tribute fro;tt the local Shaikhs and placed an agent there, who, however, wms fyl driven out the next year by the Sultan of Muscat J&gt;. f and by 1814 .I'aJahabi influence in Bahrain had ceased. In 1820-8i the Wahhabis again forced . 'ft f* 3&amp;hra in to acknowledge their supreus&amp;ey but the Ruler of Bahrain repudiated this two years later* In 1856 the Shaikh of Bahrain undertook to pay | nominal tribute to the /ahhabis, who were, however soon expelled from Ihea by the Bgyptians arid were therefore cut off from excrete ing ar^ influence in Bahrain. In 1847, after the expulsion of the Egyptians by the vahhabis, the Ruler of Bahrain again undertook to pay tribute to the /ahhabis but this was evidently not paid as the question of tribute again arose in 1851, which was the last occasion the Ruler of Bahrain in any way submitted /■7 / ,?15 0 &gt; - f?$' to the ahliaOia. |C' rr {d} qatax.

His Majesty*s Government cannot let him conquer the Arab Sheikhdoms (to which he has no claims) because they are under their protec* tion, and because * apart frcm^aaterial cone ids rat ions * there are two British interests of first class Imperial importance connected with these Shaikhioias, which it would be quite imposeibl( to allow I bn Baud to acquire control over* the Air Route and the Oil Fields. The former is of course vital to us, and the latter of considerable importance, considering that our only other supply of oil in this part of the world is in a foreign country - Iran. in case of war suj&amp;ly of oil from a neutral Iran might be a matter of some difficulty, and from a hostile Iran might cease altogether - at any rate for a time, This being so it is obviously essential that we should retain control over the Arab Coast in which new Oil Fields, actual and potential, are situated. ■■**«*«»^*'**o^ Us •'aj esty 9 s Government nave not given him that measure of support which he lias had the right to expect.

Major Watts did not inform the Sultan that this line had been offered to Ibn Saud (Major Watts has not had a copy of Sir A. Ryan f s Note of 2oth November 1935^. However, xjqc inparagraph 3 of his letter to the Sultan Major Watts said that H.M.G. saw no objection recognising Ibn Saud*s claim to an area extending Eastwards to a certain line ( points FrGrH ) which in fact corresponds to the Saua in the sectors in which the ft ■ &amp;&lt;&gt; line ( points F^G^H ) line offered to Ibn Sultan is interested. 3. The line described to the Sultan in paragraph 4 o Major Watts’ letter is correctly taken from paragrapns 3 and 6 of 1.0. tel. 3645, d. 12-11-35. Taking the points severally. C is correct. D. The parallel mentioned in its description should have read 22 o 40 ,, . (This is probably only a clerical error as it is correctly described in the (first) copy of the letter/at p. 28a). E, G and H are correct. Last point. Meridian should have read 48 o 30 ,, (see Bertram ^homas 1 map marked) instead of 4d° This is however the f^rst t&lt;me. we have had thi point described in terms of geographical co- - ordinates: Major Watts avoided defining it by reference to the Violet Line, which would not have been readily understood by the Sultan.
