PERSIAN GULF GAZETTEER. PART I. HISTORICAL AND POLITI CAL MATERIALS. PRECIS OF PERSIAN ARABISTAN AFFAIRS. IS969ED1PREFACE. This Precis abstracts our records of political affairs of the plains of Arabistan, the ancient Elam and Anzan, watered by the Kerkha, Karun and Jerahi rivers. Once the garden of the world and as modern discoveries would go to show the indigenous home of wheat and wine, it is still one of the most fertile provinces of Persia—though capable of producing a hundredfold of its present crops with a proper system of irrigation and much more a good Gov ernment. It is curious that this magnificently fertile region was until recently closed to the commerce of the world. The piratical tendencies inter-tribal feuds of the Arab settlers on the mouths of its rivers and the jealousy of the Persians, were the spirits and the 'flaming sword' placed before the paradise of the earth to keep it from the approach of mankind outside its limits. It is only the enterprise and diplomacy of the British that has succeeded only recently in opening its largest river, the Karun, to the commerce of the world. Yet much remains to be done to revive its pristine prosperity. Many a scheme has been put forward to restore its ancient irrigation works or to start new ones, but only to be shelved in the archives of Teheran. In this Precis an attempt will be made to draw out as much as possible out of the correspondence in our records relative to these matters, especially the Arab settlements, the Karun river navigation, and the irrigation schemes. Such passages, as are intended to lay stress on, have been italicized, 1st December 1903. j. a. saldana. [S969FD]i LIST OP CONTENTS. CHAPTER I. Internal Affairs, 1876-1904. Section. Paragraphs.

The earliest record we have got of Arabistan Affairs is a despatch* of the Agent in Council of Basrah to the • Se. page 47 of the Turkish Arabia Frici, Court of Directors* dated the 9th April (1646 1846. 1767&gt; referring to tlie Kaabs, which is a very interesting document and deserves to be quoted here :— * ( 'We forward this address to Your Honors by the way of Aleppo to give cover to a packet received the 31st ultimo from the Presidency by the Eagle, and at the same time to eticlose a duplicate letter from th»8 factory bearing date the 23rd of the last month. Incon sequence of the orders received from the Presidency by the Eaglty we now transmit Your Honors the best accounts we can collect as to the rise of the troubles with the Sheikh Shack Soliman. The Chaub is originally a subject of the Turks, and ha^ for many years possessed a considerable territory within their dominions bctderihg upon the Persian Empire fo&lt;- which he ouo-ht, and did for some years, annually to p^y a large sum of money into the Treasury of this Pachaship. A few years after the death of Nadir Shah, and in the troubles that followed it, he also got possession of a territory in the Persian dominions ; by this means he became a subject of both powers. The territory of Gaban and its districts is the name of that be possesses oil the Turkish, and Durack, that in the Persian by being in possession of such large territories, and not paying the usual tribute to either power. Owing to the general decline of the Turks in these parts, and the troubles that then reigned throughout the Persian Empire, he grew in a manner independent of either, and so^ n became rich by possess- in 0 * the whole revenue. Judging, however, that he should in time be called on by both powers foV an account of the arrears due to them, he foresaw that a Marine force would be his greatest security, and accordingly by degrees raised it to the strength it is at present. Uemands have been constantly made on him both by Turks and Persians for these arrears, and he as constantly has eluded the payment of them. This disobedience and several petty robberies his people were daily committinof, both by sea and land, at length brought the arms of the Turks upon him. Soliman Pachi in the year 1761 ordered his Mussalim of this place out against them, who with a numerous army marched to Gaban from whence tha Chaub fled to his fort at Duraek, which is so situated as to render the coming at it a work of great time and trouble. By this he gained his ends, and by means of presents at Baghdad bought his peace with the Pacha when his fort was near falling into the hands of Ali ^Aga, then General of the Turkish Army, On the commencement of this war with him in the y^ar 1761 the Government requested of Alexander Douglas, Esquire, and Mr. Stewart, the assistance of the Swallow, then hera, which was accordingly judged necessary to be com plied with ; but the Turkish forces withdrawing the Swallow returned hither. In the latter end of the year 1763 All Pacha came down himself with a considerable army against him, but kno' ing they were not equal to the attempt 1 y sea, as his Marine force was considerably increased since the last war, he requested William Andrew Prince, Ksquire, then Ag^nt, to assist him with two vessels of Your Honors' then here, the Tariar and Swallow, which it was judged necessary should be complied with, and was accordingly done. They had several encounters with ihe gallivats of the Chaub, but peace being as;ain established, our vessels returned hither. In the year 1765 Curriu Caun came against him, on which the Chaub fled with his gallivats to sea, and the Caun destroyed his fort it Durack; yet he was not able to overcome him as he had no Marine force, he therefore contented himself with what he had done and retired from thence. The Caun had in this war requested the ass-istance of the Turkish galleys and forces that he might utterly destroy him, but the dilatoriness of this Government so chagrined the Cauti, that after waiting a short time he retired in disgust. A very short time afterthe Caun was gone forces came from Baghdad, with oiders to the Mussalim to go out against him. This he accordingly did with his forces and the Captain of the Pacha's galleys, but judging thdr own Marine force not equal to the Chaub's the Pacha by letter and the Mussalim here applied to Mr. Wrench, their Agent, for the assistance of an English vessel (the only one then here) called the tanrn/ Snoiv y Captain Parkinson. And Captain Parkinson, in consequence of some stipulation with this Government made in his favour by Mr. Wrench, was prevailed on to go on this service ; he accordingly went down the river and joined the Turkish galleys which were lying on this side the river with the camp of the Mussalim, while the ChanbVforces and gallivats were opposite to them, and a few shot were some times exchanged. Your Honrs' sloop was also employed on this service for the assistance of the Government, but nothing material happened on either side, and a seeming accommodation soon took place : the Mussalim returned to town, and the Chaub retired. r lhis was about the end of May 1765. On the 10th and 17th July the Chaub took the ' Sally ' aiid-'^ F^tt William/' Your Honors' affairs under the direction of this Agency ha\e met with little or no alteration since the date of our last respects. Notwithstanding the en deavours of A^asy Caun, the Persian Ambassador, with the-Chaub Sheikh Soliman to reconcile the disputes in which this country has lately been involved, the Chaub still continues the same evasive methods in hopes to anmse us for another season, concluding it the only means be has of escaping. Agasy Caun has had a conference with him, and, as the Caun informs us, received rather insult thai anything satisfactory, either with respect to the Turks or us : we have been too long amused, and we are afraid Your Honors will think so. With the hopes of bringing this Chaub to proper terms, we would willingly embrace pacific measures ; but consistent with your credit, they are not in our power, your interest is our only aim. It is ♦ For an interesting hiatory o£ the K»ab tribes and Mohamuierab see Sir fL Eawliueou's meiaoraudum printed as Appendix to tbU 1 recis. v3 with the greatest relnctance, we beg leave to assure Yonr Honors, that we find oureeWes under the necessity of applying to Carin Caun for settling the tranquillity of this Gulf; it is oertamly in hia power to do it. The Turks are afraid to attempt the reduction of the Chaub without the Caun's perniission, and this permia-'ion has not yet been granted. 4. The events narrated above were followed by a piratical attack of Sheikh Salman on some British vessels. Curson'* Per.ia, it, page 323. ^ brougllt dowI1 U p 0n a flotilla of four of the East India Company's vessels. Except a successful attack upon the island of Kharak in May 1768, the expedition effected little and returned less one vessel, which had blown up. 5. Next we hear of the Kaabs making in 1775 a common cause with the Pertian Gulf Mission Dmvy, Bombay, Vol. 264of Persians under Kerim Khaniuthe Persian 1775-76. war against Turkey. The Kaab and Persian fleets blockaded the Shat-el-Arab with their fleet, while a Persian force attacked Basrah by land. It was reported that in order to clear the way for the JSast India Company's servants down the river on leaving the Basrah fac tory, an English cruiser attacked Kaab gallivats and captured one of them. 6. In a letter,* dated the 1st January 1792, the Besident at Basrah communicated the following intelligence • Pages 70-71 o£ Turiuh Arabia P-ecu (1646- to the Bomhay Government relative to a rupture between the Turks and Kaabs:—- ' In our address of the Ifith October 1791 we had the honor to communicate information that a rupture would probably tike place between this Government and the Chaub Sheikh, in consequence of the destruction of the principal part of the fleet b4onging to the latter. Such a rupture took place on the Chaub Sheikh giving diredions for the construction, on the banks of the Basrah River, of strong batteries with a view of intercepting the vessels which had, after destroying his gallivat«, imported at Basrah on their return from thence to sea On the departure of the vessels in question from Basrah, they were accompanied by the Turkish fleet commanded by the Captain Basha, and on their arnval ofE the betorementioned batteries an engagement took plaoe between them and the people belonging t.. the Chaub Sheikh stationed therein, which tfrminated without any serious advantage on either side, t e people belonging to the Chaub Sheikh retiring from the batteries to Dor.h by th* vessels belonging to the coffee fleet proce-iing to sea, and by the Turkish fleet returning to Basrah The conduct of the Chaub Sheikh in erecting batteries on the Basrah side of the river, and in demanding from the Pacha restitution, either in money, or vessels, for the loss which he has lately sus ained, has extremely irritated the latter, and may possibly induce him to act offensivelv against the former. We have much satisfaction in informing you that during the late dispute between this Government and the Chaub Sheikh, the Chanb Sheikh gave vorv acceptable proofs of his friendship towards the English nation in permitting the gallivat hired by the Resident for the conveyance of Major Mac Donald from Basrah to Maskat to pass his batteries in the most honourable manner as on other occasions. 7 The Muhaisen tribe was once subordinate to the Kaab Arabs. Their , Sheikh Mardu was tho first of the tribe Robertson's memoraadum in Gulf Adnnuistratjon . . . ^^,,1 Report for 1878-79 »ud Curzon's tersU, Vol, ii. that rose into importance and rounaea Mohammerah.f The rise of Mohammerah hampered the trade of Basrah, and the Turks would not tolerate a rival within what was regarded by them as their own territorv. IMohammerah was therefore attacked and plundered by the Vah of Baghdad in 1837. Baghdad and Basrah practically were then enfeebled by plague, which fact joined with the hereditary ill will of the Kaabs for the Turks, paved the way for the Persian occupation of Mohammerah. The Persians created Haii Jabir Khan Governor of Mohammerah. The chief of the Kaabs, Sheikh Thamer of Fellahieh, was reduced to subjection at the same time and soon com- nelled to fly for his life to Turkish territory. He was succeeded by a class ot feeble Sheikhs to be set up and deposed and reinstated Governors according to the whims of the Persian Governor General of Arabistan. 8 The delta of the Euphrates and Karun was gradually engrafted by Persia in the' province of Khuzistan, which later on became known as Arabistan. The administration of this province has been conducted by a Governor General, usually a prince of the Royal family, whose temporary headquarters while m Arabistan was formerly at Shuster as mentioned m the Gulf Administration Report for 1883-84 and has now been shifted to Dizful. The Governor General practically left ail administration in the hands of the local Governors nominated from the families of the old chief. The principal of these were the Sheikhs or M ullahs of Q Mohammerah, ( 2 ) Pellahieh, ( ) Ramis (Ram Harmuz), ( ) for a more detailed history of ilohuinmo. ah air A. oie-aoraaluui pnated as Apyeahx to Prec.s.w 4 Shuster, ( 5 ) Dizful and ( e ) Hawizeh. These local Governors had to collect and pay to the Persians a certain fixed revenue, one part of which called Diwan, was paid into the Shah's treasury and the other JPish/cash, was paid to the Governor General. The chiefs thus enjoyed practical autonomy within their territory in matters of revenue and judicial administration. (iii) Murder of Sheikh Lufti, Chief of Kaab Arabs. 9. On 20th May 1878, the Political Agent at Basrah reported to Political Asrent. Turkish Arabia, that Sheikh Lufti Political A.. Peptember 18.8, No 8 . 74-86. tLe Chief of the Kaah ArabS) and his son, Gathhan, had been murdered by their cousins, Jafir and Salman, sons of the Sheikh Mahomed el Faris at Jerralu. Colonel Nixon asked the Politi cal Agent at Basrah for a detailed enquiry and report, as the affairs of Moham- merah and Kaab Arabs were generally of considerable importance. He also pointed out that the crime called for earnest reprobation. 10. Prom the reply of the Political Agent, Basrah (which forms enclosure to No. 108, dated 15th June, from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf), it appears that the particulars of the case are as follows :— It was said that the Prince-Governor, when irritated by the difficulty of extracting money from Haji Jabir, threatened to get him removed from the Governorship of Mohammerah and Sheikh Lufti appointed in his stead; but no one regarded the threat as serious, as Sheikh Lufti was an exhausted debau chee and at times suffered from delirium tremens— ' As Sheikh Lufti was the head of Al-bu-Nasir family and hereditary Sheikh of the Kaab Arabs, his reinstatement to the Sheikhihip of Felayah was not open to objection, but it was ttnwise and has ended badly.' 11. The immediate causes for the murder were:—Sheikh Lufti was collecting money from the Kaab, for which he had rendered himself responsible to the Prince-Governor on being mnde Sheikh, and was accompanied by the two lads, Jnfir and Salman, sons of his cousin, Mahomed-el-Faris. The elder of these, Jafir, was reported to have written three times to his father complaining of the way Lufti treated him, but in reply his father told him to have patience. This it seems he could not do, and as Sheikh Lufti was ' writing a letter and using abusive language to the people round him as usual,' Jafir drew a pistol and shot him, and Salman shot Gathban, the eldest son of Sheikh Lufti. Jafir and Salman then rode off together and Bashir, the other son of Lufti. 12. When the correspondence on the subject was received by the Govern ment of India, they asked Colonel Nixon by telegram to report his views as to the nature and connection of British interests with affairs of Kaab Arabs, which necessitated the order for detailed enquiries and earnest reprobation of the crime reported. 13. Colonel Nixon on reply drew attention to a telegram of the Govern ment of India, No. 1515-P., dated 27th June 1877, directing him to keep them informed of the assemblage of Persian troops and any events of importance that might occur in his jurisdiction, 14. Colonel Uoss also pointed out that Colonel Nixon's action indicated a more marked supervision of Mohammerah affairs than had hitherto been ptav cised by the Baghdad Agency. er * 15. The Government of India thereupon issued the following instructions to Colonel Nixon in their letter No. 367-P., dated 29th January 1879: ' Jn reply, I am to say that the Government of India, having regard to the general inex pediency of interfering m internal disputes along the coast of the Persian Gulf which do not affect British interests and general politics, consider that the detailed enquiry which you ordered Mr, Robertson to institute into the circumstances of the murder of Sheikh Lufti, was unnecessary There is a marked difference between making an enquiry of this nature and merely collecting information regarding any event of importance which may happen amonsr the trihe^ whi'lo fiS telegram of the Government of India, dated 24th June 1877, which you cite refers to a time when there was war between Turkey and Russia and Persian troops were beino- assembled at Mohammerah, 0 /5 I am also to observe that the country occupied by the Kaih Avals is subject to^ Persia, and for all matters occurring in Persian territory^ the Resident in the Persian (ynlf is the oflicer primarily responsible to the Government of India, though the Resident and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia should co-operate, in dealing with political affairs in which both officers may have a mixed interest.^ 16. When the Persian Government learnt of the murder of Lufti Khan, Gulf Adaanistati™ Report for 1873 79 .nd tor they appointed Sheikh liamah, a cousin of 1879 -80. his Chief of Mlahieh, the Diwan and Pishkash of the district being fixed at 10,000 tomans. The districts of Deh-ul- Mullah, Jerahi, Hindyan and Bandar Mashur, previously belonging to Fella- hieh, were now detached from it and formed into a new group, of which. Amir Abdullah of Deh-Mullah was appointed chief, on his agreeing to pay 12,000 tomans Diwan and Fishkash., in addition to the arrears of 9,000 tomans due Irom him for Deh-Mullah. 17. Sheikh Ramah was a very feeble chief, and was of little use in collect ing taxes. He was therefore after a few Gulf Administration Report for 1879*80. months ejected from his place, to make room for his relation Paris.* He appears p'ouu, Kcp °' t b '' however to have been soon re-instated. (iv) Death of Haji Jabir Khan, Governor of Mohammerah and Sheikh Mizal's succession, 1881. 18. While Sheikh Lufti of the Al-bu-nasir family, met his death by assas sination, Sheikh Jabir of the lyuhaisen tribe was, it was apprehended, rapid ly approaching the end of his earthly career. In February 1879 he paid a visit to Bombay for medical advice, but he derived little benefit from this. His death, it was feared, would be a signal for political disturbances in Arabistan, the advan tage of which would likely be taken by the Persian Government to appoint their own official as Governor of Mohammerah. He had four sons, a description of whom given by Mr. Koberston, would be Political a., January 1880, Noa. 280.285. interesting to read in view of the parts they played later on in the political drama of south-west Persia :— He has four sons living, Sheikti Mahomed Khan, Sheikh Mizal Khan, Sheikh Selmanand Sheikh Knazal. Of these the third is dull and takes no part in the Government of the district, the vouno-est is still a boy;'but the rivalry between the first and the second, which the Persian foster, is likely to result in a troublesome state of affairs in these parts at their father s death. Sheikh Mahomed is a man of little ability and unsatisfactory character; but because he is the eldest son, his father trpats him as his successor, and entrusts him with the execution of most of his affairs, although well aware that he loses heavily thereby. He is neither esteemed nor liked bv the tribes, who do not trust him, and his feeling towards his brother, Mizal, is so bitter that he lately planned his murder, and only failed because the instrument he selected was bad. Sheikh Mizal resembles his father, and promises to equal him in every respect. He is the ficrhtins- man of the family, and hs dash, generosity, and honesty have made him popular. His fat her knows his merit and devotion to himself, but he appears to regard him with a sort of senile jealousy. If the brothers were left to fight it out. Sheikh Mizal would probably soon settle the question of succession, but Persian intervention is to be reckoned on. Ihe 1 nnce-Governor s Wazeer Asadullah Khan, lately stated when drunk at Basrah, that when Haji Jabir dies, his sons should be made to ruin each other and enfeeble the Arabs, and that then a Persian should be appointed Governor of Mohammerab/' 19. The obiect of Mr. Robertson in reporting these facts was to ask for in structions as to whether, in the event of Haji Jabir's death, matters should be left to take their own course, or a struggle between the brothers prevented. Mr Robertson did not contemplate any direct interference, but merely that his advice to Sheikh Mizal, if formally given, would induce him to retrain fiom strife and he would retire temporarily to Turkish territory. Colonel Ko ,.s some difficulty in offering an advice on this delicate point and referred the matter to Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran. The Government of India So light that the question should be left to the Legation at Teheran to decide, which apparently took no action. [S363TD] B6 20. For some months, however, before the death of Haji Jabir Khan, which . „ , onn took place in 1881, affairs had been con- A« 9 Political £•» June 1883, ISos* 198—200. J x ^ V»* ^1 oi^ *1 'tjr* i ducted by his second son, Sheikh Mizal Khan, whom he had appointed his heir and successor. Haji Jabir had been very reluctant to pass over eldest son, Sheikh Mahomed, in favour of the younfrer brother ; but Sheikh Mizal's conspicuous ability and tact, and the pre dilection of the tribe for him, finally induced him to change his mind. On Haji Jabir's death, Sheikh Mizal was appointed by the Shah Governor of Mohammerah and received the robe of honor in solemn ceremony, which was to be renewed every year with the re-appointment, for which a suitable return had to be made in money presents. After many difficulties, arising from the intrigues of his brother, Persian officials and other interested persons, Sheikh Mizal appears to have established himself pretty firmly in his father's position. His eldest brother, Mahomed, was imprisoned at Ispahan ; his most powerful enemy, Hasan Kuli Khan, Chief of the Bakhtiari Lurs, was put to death by the prince Zil-es-Sultan ; another troublesome enemy, Haji Mulla Ritha, formerly Persian Consul at Basrah, was dismissed, and summoned to Teheran. A third enemy, Sheikh- Mubarak-us-Sabah of Koweit tried to stir up the revolt of the disaffected Nus^ar tribe within the Mohammerah district, and to induce the people of the Fellahieh to march to their assistance; but Sheikh Mizal haying had due warn ing of these proceedings succeeded in foiling the attempt. All the influential Sheikhs of his own and the tributary tribes were now loyal to him. His principal apprehensions were from the greed and intrigues of Persian officials, but the Prmce-Governor appears to have supported him cordially. When matters were fairly brought to His Royal Highness' notice, he was protected by the Prince's favour against the rapacity of His Royal Highness' subordinates. He thus gradually established sufficient personal authority and power to deal ™- th i a S£ l0Cal troubles . that were likeJ y ^ occur.

The trouble was brought to an end by the media tion of some of the influential Sheikhs. The Persian Governors were also exorbitant in their pecuniary demands, and every opportunity was embraced to add to these demands. 24s. Troubles were also chronic in Fellahieh.

He was released or rather allowed to escape in 1884. At the commencement of the year 1885, he was sent for by Muzzuffar-ul-mulk, Deputy of Zil-es-Sultaneh to his camp at Dizful. This step gave occasion for disquieting rumours at Mohammerah and Sheikh Mizal was much alarmed. He even made preparations to flee to Turkish territory.8 26. Another step taken by Secret e ., July 1885, Nos. 256-257. of Pellaliieh, so soon after lie had been ousted.

(viii) Disturbances in Arabistan and fears of Sheikh Mizal of Persian intrigues against his position 5 1888, 27. In 1888, Sheikh Mizal, Chief of Mohnmmerah, was alarmed by the news ^0 received from Teheran that Amm-es- Estemai a., june less, Nos. 329-333. Sultan, who was at the time directing Persian policy, was taking measures with a view to expel him (Slieikh Mizal) and appoint a Persian Governor for Mohammerab. Kizam-es-Sultaneh was tor this purpose to march towards Mohammerah, while his brother, Governor of Bushire, was to pav a visit in the Persepolis to Mohammerah. It was intended, it appears, to lure Sheikh Mizal to the ship and carry him off. 28. In his alarms Sheikh Mizal visited Mr. Robertson at Basrah to consult him Sheikh Mizal said that he had since Ms accession fulfilled every obli gation towards Persia, paid his tribute punctually, and maintained security and order in his districts. He attributed the action now being taken against rhern to the restless and ambitious policy to subdue the Bakhtia; is and Arabistan chiers of Amin-es-Sultan, which had recently proved troablesome m the Persian bult, and added that if persisted in against Chiefs with such force at their disposal as himself and Imam Kuli Khan (Bakhtiari Chief), it would result m a strug gle for independence, which tiiey dia not desire, but did not fear. 29. Mr. Eobertson reporting on this subject observed ;— a wr ere the Persians to acquire direct authority over the Atab^ of Arabi-tan, and substitute Persian Governors for the hereditary Caiefs of Mohammerah, our inHuence and practical power in these parts would be inconveniently affect'-d. Sheikh Mizal Khan, like his lather Haji Jabir Khan, has always placed I ds information and authoiity at the disposal * f this Agency, and he would at once, if called upon, hold himseif ami his tribe at the orders of the British Govern ment. While he is the ( hief, the position and resources of Mohammeiah are potentially under British cntrol for the extension of commerce or other purposes, and it is possibly a knowledge of this that has at the present juncture occasioned the desire of the Persian Government to depose him.' 30. In the spring of 18S8 the Bakhtiari country was in very disturbed state, and the disorders spread partiallv to Gulf Administration Report for 1883-8P. Arabistan. The Bakhtiari Chief, Haji Imam Kuli Khan, having been deposed from the post of Il-Khani, refused to recognize his brother, lleza Kuli Khan, who was appointed Il-Khani by the Persian authorities, and prepared to oppose the Persian forces. The Nizam-es- Sultaneh marched from Ispahan with a force, accompanied by Haji Eeza Kuli, Il-Khani, and Isfandiyar Khan, son of the late well-known il-Khani, Haji Husain Kuli (Isfandiyar Kban had been appointed Il-Begi of the Bakhtiaris) and attacked and defeated Imam Kuli Khan, who was eventually forced to surrender. Decorations were bestowed on the Nizam-es-Sultaneh and Pteza Kuli Khan, and Isfandiyar Khan was honoured with the title of ' Samsam-es- Sultaneh.' These events le i to the restoration of tranquillity in the Bakhtiari country and Arabistan. 31. Nizam-es-Sultaneh then left Ahwaz for Pellahieh in September J888, ~ o x, ^ accompanied by a force of 500 infantrv External A., October 18S8, No#. 20J-211. . r r&gt; iw • i t~, r i •' and some Bakhtiari horse. Before his arrival at Ghuraiba, twelve miles from Fellahieh, dissensions had arisen among the Kaab Sheikhs, and they had expelled Sheikh Abdullah, the Chief (some months previously elected in place of Jafar-bin-Mahomed).

A ^out this time Mullah Nasirullah appears to have got the upper hand Govemmet ^hetr hL^r^ 1 Ui the ^ oi tKan vernment. i he tribes of Hawizeh, however, were determined to resist tho Persians, if they insisted on appointing Mullah Muttalib their Governor. U, These difficulties were settled by Nizam-es-Sultaneh confirming the popular candidates as Governors in consideration of increased pishkash. 35. Sheikh Mizal of Mohammerah was too shrewd and warv a chief in Tti attv^ the tra P alle ^ e(i to have been prepared for him by Nizam-es-Sultaneh. In any case the Governor-General saw no other course than to postpone his schemes indefinitely Sheikh Mizal Khan was therefore confirmed in his post for another year, and received the title of ' Muaz-es-Sultanah, » but this and various visits of the Persian Governor cost him 20,000 tomans bevond the ordinary payments on account of revenue. 36 ;in Marcl1 Haji Gulam Hussain, titled Sahah-uUMulk, was appointed Governor of Arabistan. (ix) Narrative of events, 1891-97. 37. In May 1891 disturbances occurred amongst the Arab tribes near Ooif Admiaittration Beport Nos. 9i&gt;92. ELiwizeh, owing to the selection of an un- m */, • • , ^ , popular Governor for that place, the Beni Truf being the principal offenders. The Government sent troops to coerce the rebels, who were defeated in a sharp action outside Hawizeh, and their Sheikh soon afterwards tendered his submission. These disturbances were attributed, to the intrigues of the Mustaufi or Treasurer of Arabistan, who was recentlv made a prisoner and sent in irons to Shuster. I q October 1891 the Anafiiah Arabs under bheikh ferhan increased the feeling of insecurity bvau attack on a caravan near Shuster, in the course of which they carried off some rifles. The Sheikh eventually made his peace with the Government and matters soon quieted down. H 38. The Sahab-ul-Mulk was replaced in March of 1893 by His Koyal Golf Administration Report, 1892-93. HiglineSS Hisam-US-Sultcineh. 39. The crops between Ahwaz and Shuster and on the Lower Karun were very poor in 1892, and this, combined with the weakness of the Governor, con tributed to the lawlessness that was from time to time reported to be prevalent in the province. The Jazali section of the Beni Truf Arabs near Ahwaz and the Sagwand Lurs on the Dizful and Shuster roads were the principal offenders. ^ 40. In April 1892 the Governor arrested the two Il-Khanis of the Bakh- tiaris, Imam Kuli Khan and Reza Kuli Khan, and invested Isfandiyar Khan with the Chiefship of the Bakhtiari. The deposed Il-Khanis were summoned to Teheran in August 1892, The arrangements of the year 1893, through which the control of the Bakhtiaris had been separated from the Governorship of Arabistan and made over to His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultaneh, result ed favourably to the two Il-Khanis, who were placed by him in charge of the tribe. Isfandiyar Khan in turn journeyed to Teheran. 41. His Royal Highness the Hisam-us-Sultaneh was re-appointed Gover- Guif Administration Report, 1893.94. noi-General in i'ebruary 1894 for a further period of one year. His adminis tration was, on the whole, successful, and the country enjoyed comparative tranquillity owing to his tact and moderation in the treatment of the tribes. Timely concessions to the wishes of the tribes of the district averted hostilities in the early part of the year. The principal Kan b tribes had deposed Sheikh [S969FD] c10 AMnllah Khan GoTernor of Fellahieh, and appointed Sheikh Jafir Khan in hw rfaoe • tat the Muez-^is-Sultaneh, Governor of Mohammerah, who was BOt well disposed towards them, tried to support the deposed Governor : and the P Governor, who was unaware of the tribal feeling, ^ a PP R 0 ™^HVhness cat face however, of the hostile attitude of the tribes, His Royal Highness can oelfed the appointment ; and in January 1893. when he visited Mohammerah, confirmed Sheikh Jafir in the appointment. . . , . ,, 41 a His Eoyal Higlmess the Hisam-es-Sultaneh was re-appointed to the Governor-Generalship before the close of Gulf Adminiitration Report, 1894-95. the year 1893-94, and held it throughout the year. In March 1895, the Nizam-es-Sulfaneh was nominated for the ensuing year. . 42. In 1894 Luristan was in a very unsettled state, much disorder prevailed and the road from Dizful to Khurramahad was unsafe for caravans. Operations were carried on against the Direkwend Lurs by His Eoyal Highness Hisam-us- Sultaneh, who, in May, captured a large number of the tribe and deported them to Pusht-i-Kuh ; the Bakhtiaris assisted in these operations. The road, how ever, still remained unsafe, and caravans had to avoid it. Ihe Bakhtiaris also were at feud with each other for a time, and robberies were committed on the road between Shuster and Dizful. 43. The Kaab Arab tribes, who had in 1894 insisted on Sheikh Jafir Khan being appointed astlieir Governor, turned against him and Sheikh Abdullah, who had been rejected by them, was re-appointed Governor, as the result of a move ment in his favour. Difficulties, however, arose about the arrears of revenue, and though a compromise was apparently effected, a combination was made against Sheikh Abdullah, and before the close of the year, his rival was re appointed to the Governorship. 44. There was trouble also at Hawizeh, where the inhabitants roie in re sentment against the Military Commander. Again, in December, two sections of the Beni Truf tribe were in hostile array, the one against the other, and the Prince Governor was obliged to proceed there, the matter not being settled till the fort held by one of the parties had been destroyed, with the help of the Government troops. 45. Mutual aggressions were committed by the Arab tribes on the opposite side of the Perso -Turkish frontier near Hawizeh. The Arabs from the Persian side raided the districts over the border, in retaliation for alleged previous aggressions, and it was said that complaint having been made to the Turkish authorities by their subjects, they advised their subjects again to retaliate. At any rate a raid was afterwards made from the Turkish side on the village of Buwarim. 46. Complaints were made to Teheran by the Turks in connection with these matters and an official was deputed by the Governor-General to inquire into them. Sheikh Mizal, however, declared that the offenders on the Persian side were Turkish tribes residing over the border. 47. A want of firm control exhibited itself at Bander Nasscri (Ahwaz), and relations between the Persian soldiery and Arab inhabitants were strained. On one occasion, when the Muin-et-Tujjar's Agent endeavoured to enforce the landing fees against certain boats with the help of the soldiers, a violent de monstration against him was made by the Arabs. 48. At the opening of year 1896-97, the Nitam-es-Sultaneh was continued p 1flQ , 07 in the Governor-Generalship which he had Gulf Administration Report, 1896-97. j * /c , held, and remained m office until events compelled his recall some months later. 49. Tribal conflicts were rife, and the irregular operations which the Gov- error-General had, at the close of the previous year, directed against the Beni Truf of the Hawizeh district, led to continued hostilities. These included the Beni Saleh, who were also in arms against Syed Naamah, the instrument of the Governor-General, and the situation became more strained, till the influence of Sheikh Mizal, Muez-es-Sultaneh, was invoked to procure a temporary truce, in order that the harvest might be gathered in. In November and December Sheikh Mizal again intervened on these tribal conflicts being resumed.11 50 Complete disorder and revolt prerailed for some time in the tracts about Dizful and SImster, the Arabs tribes under various Sheiklis joining in a common resistance to Persian authority. 51. In June the Bakhtiari Il-Kbani, who had been employed by the Nizam-es-Sultaneh to coerce the insurgents, was defeated by them, and panic ensued in Shuster, where the people, seeing the Governor helpless, proposed, in concert with the rural population around, to pay their revenue to the Arabs, on the ground that the Government was powerless to afford protection. 52. The Lurs helped to swell the tide of disorder, raiding the country towards Dizful, where the Governor's representative was quite unable to check them. 53. Shuster and Dizful were themselves the scene of faction fights and collision with authority. At Ahwaz there was an affray between the people and the soldiery, who, at that place, bad notoriously been the cause of frequent disturbances, rather than the supporters of order and authority. In fact the tale of anarchy, conflict, and violence, was well nigh continuous. 54. Ala-ud-Dowleh was appointed Governor-General on succession to Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and arrived at Shuster in .February 1897. He was succeeded by the following Governor-Generals Saad-us-Sultaneh (1897-99). Prince Ain-ed-Dowleh (1899-1900). Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh (1001-19040, who was favourably disposed towards the British, (x) Murder of Sheikh ffiizal and succession of his brother Sheikh Khazal, June 1897. 55.

His brotlier Khadal (Kbazal) assumed authority. Preserving order. Sphinx starting for Mohammerah.' 56. He was assassinated, when landing from his boat opposite his own residence at Palin. The actual murderers were three negroes, who were supposed to have been instigated to commit the crime by the Sheikh's cousin, Salman bin Mansur, a Chief of the Muhaisen tribe. It was feared at first that the sudden death of Sheikh Mizal would give rise to trouble; but nothing particu lar occurred. The Governorship of Mohammerah and of the tribes was assum ed by Sheikh Mizal's brother, Sheik Kbazal, after tribe election, which was subsequently confirmed by the Persian Government; and he appears to have conducted the government in a proper manner, avoiding difficult situa tions, which at one time seemed likely to arise. In April 1898 he received the title of Muez-es-Sultaneh from the Persian Government. 57. Sheikh Khazal soon gained the good will of the British firms, whose interests were, it was reported, better looked after now than they were in the days of his brother Sheikh Mizal. 58. The Sheikh was engaged in 1898 in various expeditions against Arab tribes within his jurisdiction, the most important of which was that against the Bain tribe of N ussari, whose insurrection at one time gave rise to some uneasiness. 59. Sheikh Khazal had soon to seek the British protection. The events that led to this will be described hereafter in a separate chapter (Chapter IX).12 CHAPTER 11.* Zarun Eiver Navigation and Irrigation schemes, 1871-79. (i) History of the Schemes from 1871 to 1877. 60. The river Karun figures prominently in our records of 1857, when Major Boil's Account of British Wars with during the Anglo-Persian war, three i ' er,ia river steamers Comet, Flanet, and Assyria each towing a gun-hoat of 24 pounder howitzers, ascended up the river from Mohammerah with 300 British troops under the command of Captain Rennie. The expedition left on 2nd March 1857 and proceeded up pursuing the Persian Army numbering about 8,000. It reached Ahwaz on 1st April. The troops landed and dispersed the enemy. As peace was concluded, the expedition return ed soon after. 61. The earliest record we have got on the question of the opening of the Karun to foreign commerce begins in the year 1871 and runs up to the year 1879, when there occurs a gap, which opens up again in 1881. 62. In July 1871, the firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., addressed Sir Lewis Political a , October 1871, nob. 662-651. ^ ien ^ es ^ en t&gt; Persian Gulf, regard ing the navigation of the Karun; They suggested that the Persian Government might be induced to support a scheme by subsidizing a line of steamers which they would be prepared to run under con tract. They pointed out that by steam communication between Mohammerah and Shuster goods would reach Ispahan from the coast in ten days, while by the land routes the time occupied is from 30 to 35 days. The application was sent to Mr. C. Alison, then Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, Sir Lewis Pelly re- marking that he had long been impressed with the physical advantages of the line. Mr. Alison thought the time was then unfavorable. All the available resources of the State were being employed in keeping the people from starva tion, and he did not think the Shah's Ministers would be prepared to enter into political a, june 1872, No. 608. con tract. In forwarding the papers to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. the Government of India remarked that the practicability of the navio-ation of the Karun as far as Shuster had been established, but that, under the circum stances, they were not then prepared to give any practical support to the scheme proposed. 63. About the same time, Mr. Dawes, of the firm of Gray, Paul &amp; Co. Political A, January 1872, Nos. 109-112. proposed to the Persian Government the _ . construction of a line of railwav frnm Persian Gulf to Teheran via the Karun, Shuster, and Ispahan. He proposed that the Persian Government should give a guarantee or some other material support, and that the concession should include the privilege of workirio. steamers on the Karun The proposal came to nothing. The Government of India forwarded a copy of the papers to the Secretary of State for India with, out any remark. w11jU 64). la June 1873, Mr. Dawes addressed the Under-Secretary of State for Secret, December 1873, No. 28. India. He remarked on the annually ■p . , . , ^ . increasing proportion of Russian eoods in Persia, and a?aiu urged the openmg of the Karun for navigation, fnd the construction of a line of railway from Shuster to Ispahan. He said— ' Mohammerah is a good port. an d in this respect has a great advantage over Bushire where sbps have to anchor four miles from the shore; steamers navi(-atin» thk' I exchange traffic with the mail steamers to and from India, and the nyer boats nl^nK T Buneh and Bagdad.

The practicability of this route from Shuster to Ispahan has been condemned by some, who maintain that the Bashtain range of mountains is impa^sablp for a railway. The physical difficulties are doubtless formidable^ Persians, however, state they are sreatly over rated, and that the hitherto unsafe state of the country, and not its natural difficulties, is th« reason for its not being traversed,' Mr. Dawes considered best route to be tbat from Mobammerali Did Shuster to Ispahan, or from Shuster ma Dizful and Burudjird to Kum and Teheran, In the event of these two routes proving impracticable, he said there was still the alternative of carrying a line from Bunder Abbas by Lar to the valley of Bandamir, and thence to Ispahan; this however, is 400 miles longer than the Shuster route, and traverses a country where the scarcity of water renders any great developmient of agriculture impossible. Mr. Dawes was thanked for his Secret, December 1873, No. so. suggestions and told that the subject was under consideration. . .. . i _ . , r 65. In Captain Napier's diary for February 1875 it was said that Sheikh Secret, June 1875, Noa. 115-147. ■ Wr of Mohammerah, the Chief of the Jlaab Arabs, had for some time given offence to the Persians by acts indicating an assumption of independent authority; that a force of 1,600 men sent by the Governor of Shuster to enforce payment of arrears of revenue was driven back from Mohammerah by the Sheikh's troops; and that it was reported that the Shah had ordered a force to be collected to march to the south under his own command. Simultaneously with this appeared a letter in the Neue Freie Press, a Vienna paper, written by Dr. Pollak, formerly Physician to the Shah. He said that, with the aid of the English, Sheikh Jabir had occupied Mohammerah, and was prepared to declare himself independent; that the Sheikh would probably, in return for a good pension, cede his position to the English; and that the English would then, from the important situation of Mohammerah, command Arabia, Persia, and Turkey. He went on to say that the steps taken were in consequence of the advances made by Russia in Central Asia, and that the English were compelled to take up a firm position which would enable them readily to despatch their troops into the heart of the country at Shuster^ from which there are roads and lines to Kermanshah, Hamadan, Teheran, and Ispahan. He thought that the effect would simply be to counterbalance Russian infiunce in Persia. This article, which was duly translated to the Shah, * ( aroused his anger and suspicions.' , Mr. Taylour Thomson remarked that, though the alleged political intrigue of England, and of the report of her troops being in possession of the island, were probably not believed by the Persian Government, yet the value of the position was so evident that it was not surprising the perusal of the article should have produced on the Shah's mind the strong impression it was said to have done. The following remarks were made by Mr. Aitchison on the case :— J. ^ i. ..... 1 • r f % ^ . ' , . '''' ' ^ ' u The advantages of the Karun ^s a route for trade are well known, and three years ago we drew the late Mr. Alison^s attenion to it. The transition from a trade to a military route is very easy, and it is probably the interest we have manifested in the route, combined with the rebellious proceedings of Sheikh Jabbar, that has given rise to the mischievous article referred to/' - 1 ■ J « 66. In, May 1875, Mr. Mackenzie, of the firm of Gray, Paul &amp; Co., n i a q f v, i q ' tcc xr a iK forwarded to the Political Resident in the General, A, September 1875, Noa. 1-5. ^ ^ Persian Gult a report of a ride he had just tben imade from Ispahan to Shuster. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. had established an agency at Ispahan, and Mr. Mackenzie said they were prepared to push trade in that direction, via Shuster, and endeavour to open up the route, which the navigation of the Karun alone could do. He said that it would, however, in the, first instance, to ensure success, require, to be a line subsidized by Govern ment, and so receive their countenance and support. Mr. Mackenzie gave a very favorable account of the people and the country between Shuster and Ispahan; Were the Karun opened to Shuster, his firm, he felt sure, could deliver goods at Ispahan at 35 krans per load' of 350 lbs., as against 60 krans per 1'bad sent from Bushire to Ispahan via Shiraz; and he estimated that, [S96QFD] du under such, conditions, trade by the Suez Canal would beat that by the north completely out of the field. He added :— ' This route, once opened up to traffic, must quickly supersede tlie present one via Shiraz. In distance it is 9 to 10 days shorter j the passes are nowhere so rough as between Bushire and Shiraz ; and with no greater objection to it, it has the advantages of more water, more timber, and a cooler climate. The bazars of Shuster at present are largely supplied with chintz and goods from Russia, notwithstanding the long and expensive land-carriage they have to bear, and that, too, although Shuster might be placed within two days' communication with the Busrah river, where, having regular steam service, they might be placed weekly within reach of all the foreign markets. The opening- of the Karan to steam navigation would, I believe, not only force back the Russian trade to its natural limits, but it would drain the most fertile provinces of this country of, if they could but find an outlet for, the produce they are capable of raising, thereby enrichiug its ryots and increasing the general wealth and prosperity of the country/' Mr. Mackenzie was said by Sir Lewis Felly and by Mr. Taylour Thomson to be a clear-headed, practical man, little given to illusions, and who would regard the line simply for its adaptability for profitable trade. His statements could therefore be relied upon. 67. In a letter dated 2nd September 1875, Mr. Mackenzie was thanked by the Government of India for his valuable communication. Mr. Aitoliison looked upon the Karun route as one of vast importince, and considered it very desirable that we should pre-occupy the ground, as Russian trade was gradually pushing down towards the Persian Gulf. A copy of the report was sent by the Government of India to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, who was asked for an expression of bis views as to the value, commercially and politically, of opening up the Karun route, the prospect of any steps being taken by the Persian Government towards the development of trade in that direction, and whether the Persian Government would view with satisfaction the establish^ ment of a line of steamers, as suggested by Mr. Mackenzie. No reply to this communication appears to have been received from Mr. Thomson. 68. In November 1875, Mr, T. Lynch, the Managing Director of the GeaeraiA. July 1876. Nos. 1-3. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, addressed Lord Derby. He asked that, if a concession were obtained from the Persian Government for the navigation of the Karun, his Company might be allowed to compete in tendering for any mail service contemplated on that river. He said that hia Company had maintained mercantile establishments for over 30 years on the rivers of Mesopotamia; that their steamers had navigated the Tigris for over 14 years ; that they had run a line between Mohammerah and Basrah, connectino- the Karun audits traffic with the Persian Gulf and Baghdad; had endeavoured to develop direct traffic between the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, and Ispahan; and had a line of vessels carrying on direct trade between London and the Persian Gulf since 1841. They therefore thought they had a right to be considered, if any future development of trade via Shuster was to be supported by Govern ment subsidies. He was told, in reply, that his application would receive attention. Mr. Lynch sent a copy of the papers to His Excellency the Viceroy and asked that, in the event of a/ny action being taken in the matter, his claim might be supported, 69. On 20th May 1875 Lord Northbrook recorded a minute on the subject Secret, July 1875, No. 154. 0UP relations with Persia, and a pro- . . , . A » Posal made by Mr. Taylour Thomson for furnishing material aid to Persia for the purpose of preventing Eussia acquire graph Merv. The minute concluded with the following para- ' I should be disposed to encourage and support any substantial proposal for opening out commumcatioEs between the Persian Gulf and the interior of Persia. This would not only increase the trade between India and Persia, but also strengthen our military position, if we are ever called upon to advance into \\ iq interior of Persia.' ■15 Baron Eeuter, in a letter, dated 12th November 1875, to the Earl of Derby, submitted a proposal which he contemplated making to the Persian Govern ment for the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Ispahan. A copy Secret. June 1808, No. 42. of this letter was Awarded to the Govern ment of India, by a despatch, dated 10th December 1875, in which the Marquis of Salisbury referred to Lord North- brook's minute of 20th May, and said he had expressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs his concurrence in the view therein expressed. He, however, asked w hether the Government of India contemplated that, under any circumstances, the suggested encouragement and support should take the form of a pecuniary grant from Indian revenues, either in the shape of subsidy or otherwise. It was said— The question does not arise in connection with the particular scheme now put forward by Baron H enter, which, though not without political recommendations, scarcely provides that direct communication between the Persian Gulf and the interior which Your Excellency regards as of so much importance to Indian interests. But as it is possible that proposals more nearly affecting those interests may be submitted any day to Her Majesty's Government, either by Baron Renter in modification of his present scheme, or by other persons independently, it is important that I should be placed in possession, at an early date, of your views on the point to which I have adverted.' 70. At this time Major Euan Smith attached to Foreign Office, made some remarks on the case. He said that the question of opening up JPersiti through British agency from the shores of the Gulf was one in which there could he no doubt that British interests were directly involved, not only of an Indian but an Imperial nature, and that it was the only way in which we could expect to cope with the great strides that Russian commerce was making all over Persia to the great disadvantage of the English trade. et In the Persian Gulf,' , he said, ' we have a field that everything seems to have marked! out for us as a natural base for operations, whether o£ a hostile or commercial nature; a fielcf that is for the present under our absolute supervision, and one in which, if we are wise, shall never permit any one else to intrude. ' At any moment we might be compelled to send an armed force into Persia, and, unless we have some means of communication that will enable us to penetrate into the heart of the country, how could we hope to compete with a possible rival, who has the Caspian for a base of operations and a good highroad to Teheran ? It must be remembered that in the last Persian war our troops never succeeded in reaching even the foot of the passes that lead us to Shiraz.' 71. In reply to the Secretary of State's despatch of 10th December 1875, c l t XT ,« the Government of India forwarded copy Secret, Jime 1876, No. 46. i* xi. p i i • • ^ ^ r » t or the toilowmg minute recorded by Lord Korthbrook, in which all the members of the Government of India concurred^ with the exception of Sir W. Muir, who did not consider that the project of establishing steam navigation on the Karun promised sufficient advantages to India to justify expenditure thereon out of Indian revenues • &lt;f The proposal to which I alluded in last paragraph of my minute of the 20th of May 1875 is the establishment of steam communication between Mohammerah and Shuster, on the River Karun. Communications have been addressed to Her Majesty's Government upon this subject by Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., and by Messrs. Lynch, which seem to show that there is a probability of the line being opened out if the Persian Government would give their consent. An article was, however, lately written at Vienna by a Dr. Pollak, for the purpose of warning the Persian Government against the motives of the British Government, if they jshould advocate such a measure. In the event of either of these proposals proceeding further, I think it would' be worth while for the Government of India to encourage it by some subsidy, and Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran might be instructed to ascertain whether the Persian Government would be prepered to support such a project without asking for any subsidy, which the Persian Government can hardly be in a position to give.''' 72. In a demi-official letter from Captain Napier, dated 8th January 1876, c t i 0 ,« v ^ K r 136 referred to several schemes which were Secret, June 1876, Nos. 47-51. m -i ^ then betore the Shah s Council. One was a project for the irrigation and colonization of certain tracts about Shuster with the view of growing indigo for home consumption. Another was the scheme of Gray, Dawes &amp; Co., which, he said, was an honest and practicable one for the navigation of the Karun and the opening of a new trade route into the heart of Persia the benefit of which, to the country, woul/i be immediate and appreciable. There was so much jealousy and suspicion'in the Persian mind,16 and so much envy between rival speculators, that he thought probably all would fall through. Sir Lewis Pelly was at the time in Calcutta, and the papers were sent to him for opinion. He prepared a memorandum, dated 20th _ „ _ April 1876, on the scheme of Gray, Dawes Secret, Juue 1876, No. 47. o i? • xr &amp; Co., for opening up the Karun route. As the Government of India were prepared to grant a subsidy, he said all that remained to do was to specify the amount of subsidy, and to limit and give precision to the terms ' countenance and support.' He proposed to make the amount of the subsidy liberal, and for a short period, rather than stint the project in its origin and be called on to nourish it for an indefinite period. As regards the terms ' countenance and support ' he thought Government should not commit themselves to any special political action, and that the projectors and traders along the Karun line should only receive the protection and justice derivable from our Treaties with Persia, and from the influence of our Political Agents there. So far as Gray, Dawes &amp; Co's project was concerned, he did not consider that it devolved on Government to survey the line, yet he thought, on general considerations, a survey of the Karun route from Shuster.to Ispahan and the interior of Persia desirable. On 4)th May 1876 a memorandum was Secret, ju M 1876, Ho, is, received from Major Bateman Champain, 1 y 1 ' ' . through Sir Andrew Clarke, on the navi gation of the Karun Biver. Major Champain showed the difficulties under which trade from the south laboured, and the bad condition of Persia generally, as means of transport and roads are concerned. Wheeled vehicles, he said— ' are practically unknown. Caravan routes are but,tracks worn over steep and stony mountain ridge ' by the feet of mules and camels for century after century. Bridges are rare, and where most wanted are too often represented by the ruined piers and abutments of some clumsy passive construction of a bygone age. Caravans are delayed in winter by snowdrifts, in spring by torrents, and in summer by the great heat of the sun, necessitating short nio-ht marches/' 0 ■ ■ • i ' ■ i h i .' . vs . • i j i \ j . , To him, it was, therefore, evident that, in the interests of Persia, Great Britain, and India, steps should be taken to clear away the obstacles which impede the free movement of trade from the south. He said it required but little examination to convince the enquirer that the Karun River scheme was the one which promised the best results in return for the smallest outlay in energy and money. Mohammerah and the Karun River offer such extraordinary ad vantages that it is a wonder to him how they can have been so long neglected Until recently, the main trade route of the north of Persia lay from the shores of the Black Sea through Turkey—a line open to British as well as Russian merchandise. . The rapidly increasing railway system of the Caucasus however, will soon absolutely close this route for all practical purposes and leave the trade solely in the hands of Russia, who, by means of differential ta riffs, will be in a position to exclude British merchandise altogether—a position which she will not fail to take advantage of. From, a purely commercial point of view, therefore. Major Champain considered it most advisable that immedi ate steps should be taken to counteract the tendency to place the country commer- ctaUy at the mercy of Russia. In his opinion, one of the most effective measures would be the establishment of free navigation on the Karun. This would not onlv open the country to British enterprise as a counterpoise to that of Russia but would emancipate the whole of the Persian commerce in the north, as well as in the south, from dependence on the forbearance of the Russian Custom-Houses Major Champam said that Mr. Mackenzie had submitted a proposal to the for the navigation of the Karun River. His firm was prepared to com- mence operations at once. They demanded no subsidy, but simply asked leave °i W ^n % 8 011 tl ? e riYer - . Tlie Proposal was referred to a Coun- C1 }n 1 1 rin ^ s » ^ iniste rs, and other high officials. They approved the idea of free navigation on the Karun, in preference to granting a special concession to an individual company. This being in accordance with Mr. Mackenzie's wishes, the matter appeared to be settled. The Persian Government, however ™ en ^ ld ^^. would 1 cl 5 1 ™ rive ^navigation 5 and port dues, as was done in £^0^ Mr. Mackenzie replied that no such dues were claimed in Europe, except where expenditure had been incurred in the construction of docks, light-houses &amp;c and that as no outlay would be entailed in this case, no dues ought to be insist-17 ed upon. The Persian Minister said they would undertake to erect a light house and thus establish a claim to port dues. This offer Mr. Mackenzie de- clined. The Persian Government, however, said they were about to proclaim the opening of the Karun to steam navigation on terms which would be consider ed and published later. Major Champain thought this arrangement was simply a^ subterfuge and a pretext for the indefinite postponement of the whole ques tion, and that the idea of dues was suggested by the Eussian Legation, who were rully alive to the effect which the encouragement of southern trade would have on Russian commerce and political influence in Persia. 73. About the same time as these memoranda were received, copies of two letters, dated respectively, 4th and 5th February 1876, from Her Majesty's Min- ister at Teheran, to the Earl of Derby, on the same subject, were also received. In Mr. ihomson s opinion, the advantages of the Karun river route, as pointed out by Mr. Mackenzie, were correctly stated. The opening of the route from Shuster to Ispahan, he remarked, was dependent on the establishment of steam communication between Mohammerah and Shuster, and this again de pended upon the terms which might be conceded by the Persian Government for the river navigation. Eor some time past he said he had been urging the Persian Government to grant such terms as would induce foreign merchants to run the risk of engaging in such a speculation. If the routes from Moham merah by the Karun to Shuster and Ispahan were opened, Mr. Thomson con sidered that it would be advantageous to British commercial interests that a Consul should be appointed either at Shuster or Ispahan. At the outset, especially, he thought that the appointment should be made at Shuster, instead of Ispahan, the Mission Agency at the latter place being still maintained there. 74. The Government of India forwarded copies of Mr. Taylour Thomson's Secret, Juno 1876, No. 5i. letters and Sir Lewis Pelly's and Major „ t , Champain's memoranda to the Secretary oi State for India, with the following observations :— ' The superiority of the Karun Eiver over other lines of communication from the sea coast and the advantages which Persia, no less than ICngland, would ^ain by the development of commerce between Mohammerah, Shuster, and Ispahan, are well described by Major Champain • and we observe that Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, in his despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 4, dated 24th February 1876, has recorded a similarly favorable opinion on the Karun River route. ' We desire, however, to invite special attention to Major Champain's statement that, in recent proposals submitted to the Government of the Shah for establishing- a line of steamers on the Karun, Mr. Mackenzie, on behalf of Messrs. Gray, Dawes (Paul) &amp; Co., demanded no subsidy, but simply leave to work a line of steamers on the river. ' It will be perceived that Major Champain attributes the obstructive attitude of the Persian Government^ io the suggestions of the Russian Legation at Teheran. On this point, we commend to the notice of Her Majesty's Government a letter from a correspondent in Pe'rsia which appeared in the Journal de St. Petersburgh of the 18th (30th) March 1876, The writer enters at some length into the supposed details of the project submitted by Messrs. Gray, Paul (Dawes) &amp; Co., and dwells with scarcely concealed satisfaction on the alleged definitive rejection of the project by the Shah's Government. &lt;f It is not within our province to suggest whether any, and if so what, measures should be taken to secure for Messrs. Gray, Paul (Dawes) &amp; Co., a favorable hearing; but we desire to commend the subject to the early consideration of Her Majesty's Government, with special reference to the commercial and political importance of such a highway for British trade in Southern Persia.' 75. Lord Salisbury fully concurred in the views expressed by the Government Secret, October 1876, No. 64. He suggested, for Lord Derby's consideration, that Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran should be instructed to use every effort to procure the withdrawal of the conditions which the Persian Government had, at the last moment, decided to attach to the navigation of the Karun, and which, if maintained, mio-'ht have the effect of indefinitely postponing the realization of a project, important alike from a commercial and political point of view. It was said that Lord Salisbury would be glad that it should at the same time be clearly intimated to Mr. Taylour Thomson that Her Majesty's Government attach great importance to an early and [S969PD] E18 gatisFactory solution of this quGstion and that tlioy do not doiir© to press for concession of special privileges, either to British merchants generally or a particular British firm, but would be satisfied with a grant of facilities which would be generally available, and would involve no expenditure on the part of the Persian Government. 76. In a letter to the Earl of Derby, dated 2nd July 1S78, Mr. Thomson remarked that thePersian Government were Secret. October 18/6, No. 62. (j es j rous to negotiate with European capitalists with a view to the establishment of Railway communications in Persia. He suggested that it might be advantageous to both parties if the Persian Gov ernment and Baron Reuter could agree upon a modified concession which would free the former from embarrassing conditions which they were unable to fulfil, and afford the latter a reasonable compensation, and embrace at the same time the construction of a R ulway from Shuster to Teheran, by way of Ispahan. He pointed out the advantages of such a line. It would place the capital and central provinces of Persia in direct and independent communication with the sea instead of, as in all the other Railway proposals, in communication with Russia, who would doubtless impose such conditions of traffic as would suit its interests alone, irrespective of those of Persia. It would give us command of the Persian markets as far north as Teheran, and enable us to compete on equal terms with Russia in Khorassan. It would open up a most lucrative passenger traffic by conveying pilgrims to Koom from Ispahan and Teheran, and from Persia generally to the shrines in Turkish Arabia and to Mecca. It would also form an admirable feeder of any Indo-European line that might be established. 77. In a letter to the Government of India, dated 1st July 1876, Her e t ^ v Majesty's Minister at Teheran made some Secret, October 1876, No. 59. i ji i i o.. t . remarks on the memoranda by Sir Lewis Pelly and Major Champain. He entirely concurred in all that was said by them as to the manifest advantages which would accrue to British commerce in Persia by the establishment of steam navigation between Mohammerah and Shuster. His attention had for many years been directed to the importance of Mohammerah as an entrepot for commerce; and in 18he addressed a memorandum to Government, in which he embodied his views on the subject, as well as upon its value from a strategic point of view in the event of our acting either in alliance with Persia or being engaged in hostilities with her. He, however, said that it might be inferred from Major Champain's statements that special privileges had been conceded to Russia in the north which had been withheld from us in the south, but that this was not the case. Persia, he said, had done nothing in the way of road-making for trade purposes, either in the north or in the south. He then referred to the negotiations which had been going on for several years for concessions in Persia, especially the navigation of the Karun River. He said that the nature of the dues and charges to which the Persian Government considered themselves entitled had not yet been published, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs said would be done. He explained that it was not always possible for a Persian Minister, even if well disposed, to carry through a measure which he might consider advantageous. He therefore determined to await a favourable moment before pressing this matter further upon the Persian , Secret, October 1876, Ko. go . Government ' In a letter, dated 26th Sep- tember 1876, Mr. Taylour Thomson was thanked by the Government of India for the information he gave. He was, however, told that the Government of India regarded the scheme for opening the Karun river to navigation as one of importance to the interests of India^, and that the Governor-General in Council could not refrain from expressing regret that he could not see his way to arriving at an early understanding with the Persian Government on the subject. A copy of the papers was at the same time sent to the Secretary of State for India with the following remarks ; ' Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran appears to appreciate fully the benefits which would accrue both to the British Empire and to Persia from the establishment of steam navigation between Mohammerah and Shuster. His Excellency appears to have made some progress in his discussions with the Persian Minister for foreign affairs, when a dispute about the levv of navigation dues and charges arose: and the question has now apparently been indefinitely postponed until a favourable moment shall arrive for pressing it on the Persian Government19 'In our opioion, the energetic prosecution of negotiations for the purpose of opening up this important commercial hig-hway is very orreatly to be desired. We fear that if we wait for a favourable opportunity, such an opportunity may never arrive. We trust that the influence and ability of Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Tehran will enable His Excellency to create ' a favourable opportunity,' if he is instructed to do so; and we are of opinion that an effort should be made without delay to place the matter before the Persian Ministers, and to urge upon them the advantages which may be expected from an early settlement of the ques tion, both in their own interests and in those of British merchants. ff If Your Lordship agrees-with us, we would suggest, for your consideration, that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be moved to communicate instructions in the above sense to Mr. Taylour Thomson. ' 7%. A copy of Mr. Thomson's letter of 1st July 1876, to the Government of India, having been sent by the Foreign Office, London, to the India Office for Lord Salisbury's opinion, it was said, in reply, that on the general question Secret, Ociote isfe. No. e8. L . ord Salisbury had nothing to add to the views he had previously expressed. It seemed, however, to Lord Salisbury, from tbetoneof Mr. Thomson's letter, that he was disposed to regard the circumstance that no special privileges had been granted to Russian trade in the north of Persia as in some sense reducing the significance of the rejection by the Persian Government of the schemes which had been proposed for improving and opening out the trade routes in the south, and as rendering less urgent the necessity for further steps in the matter. It was said— &lt;c Lord Salisbury cannot at all talce this view. So long as the south of Persia is allowed to remain undeveloped^ and accessible to commerce only with difficulty, no special privileges are required to secure to Russia, who has the command of the northern trade routes^ predominant commercial advantage*. ' There are good grounds for believing that Russian diplomatic influence at Tehran has been used with success to insure the maintenance of the existing state of things so favourable to the political and commercial interests of Russia, and so opposed to those of Great Britain. Under these circumstances, Lord Salisbury trusts that, upon the arrival of the favourable moment, which Mr. Thomson is awaiting, the subject may be energetically pressed upon the attention of the Persian Government and that, should a satisfactory result not be achieved, the failure may not be owing to any want of appreciation of the importance of the question on the part of Her Majesty's Representative at Tehran. 'As regards the question discussed'in Mr. Thomson's despatch to Lord Derby, No. 87, Lord Salisbury agrees with Her Majesty's Minister as to the advantages to Persia which might be expecte 1 ! from the construction of a railway from Tehran to Shuster by any route through the mountains which may be found practicable. His Lordship is not aware whether this work is included in the proposals which, it is understoo:!, either have been, or are about to be, submitted by Baron Renter to the Shah's Government. Should such be the ease, and should the details of the scheme be free from objection, Lord Salisbury thinks that Mr. Thomson might be instructed to give it unofficially any support in his power. ' 79. A copy of this letter having been sent to Mr. Thomson, he explained c , -n v , v„ -ir to ^ ^ ar l 0 f Derby that he had neglect- Secret, Tebruary 1877, no. 16. , . .. % • ,, ed no opportunity of pressing the matter upon the consideration of the Persian Government, and that he was fully impressed with the importance of the subject and the necessity of bringing it to as speedly a conclusion as possible. He was informed that the consideration of the matter had been renewed, and was assured, by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that he himself was in favour of the measure, though he doubted whether he had power to carry it through by his individual exertion. After the Shah's return from Europe there were unmistakeable signs of his viewing with indifference those projects which he formerly entertained for hastening the development of the resources of his country. Mr. Thomson also remarked that it was only to be expected that, in all matters favourable to our political and commercial interests in Persia and opposed to their own, the influence of the Russian Mission at Tehran would be adversely exerted. He pointed to the Falkenhagen Concession to show that the schemes proposed for the benefit of Russian trade in the north of Persia had not been unsuccessfully opposed by us. He, however, said he would not fail to be guided by the wishes of the Marquis of Salisbury with regard to the Karun and the Railway Con- cession, then about to be submitted by Baron Renter to the Persian Govern ment, and to us© his best endeavours to induce the Persian Government to20 come to a satisfactory and speedy decision on both subjects. In a memorandum . ^ dated 10th November 1876, to the Persian cere, 6 &gt; o. . Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Thomson urged strongly the expediency of giving early effect to the decision c . ™ iQPjn xr -xno arrived at regarding the opening of the Secret, May 1877, No. 102. 17 . t j ^ t, ^ w i j* Karun. In a despatch to the Earl of Derby, dated 22ad February 1877, he, however, regretted that no progress had up to that time been made, though he had not failed to keep the matter constantly before the Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs, who professed to have, on several occasions, brought the question under the serious consideration of the Shah, and urged its adoption. He explained that the great object of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was to be reinstated as Prime Minister, and all questions brought before him were pressed on, deferred, or evaded, as they affected the object of his ambition. He also thought the Shah indisposed to the measure, while many of those in constant personal attendance upon him, whose influence was beyond that which was expedient for the interests of the country, were directly opposed to it. 80. On 20th August 1877 Messrs. Gray, Dawes &amp; Co. again addressed the Secret, October 1877, No. 23. of Dcrb y regarding the opening of the Karun. The time was then favour able. The War between Hussia and Turkey had closed the northern communi cations, and the foreign trade of Persia was tending southwards. If they could get the Karun opened, they believed the trade then diverted would, to a great extent, be permanently retained. As requested by Messrs. Gray, Dawes &amp; Co., Mr. Thomson was again instructed to press the matter on the Persian Govern ment. This Mr. Thomson did. He had two interviews with the Persian Secret, January 1878, Nos. 21-25. Minister, at which he again urged strongly the advantages which would follow from the adoption of the measure. At the first interview the Minister professed his willingness to support it. At the second, he said he found the Shah so averse to enter upon the subject that he thought it would be advisable to defer it. Mr. Thomson, however, addressed a letter on the subject to the Minister, dated 24jth October 1877. He received a reply on the 28th October, abruptly closing the question for the time. The letter was as follows :— ' ^ T / ply v 1 beg to state most r ?spectfully that the Persian Ministers always feel tnan! iul for^ the sincere friendship and interest shown by the British Government, and are at all times anxious to respect and carry out, as far as possible, the representations made by the Legation. Lut as regards the Karun River and its navigation by steamers, in consideration of political obstacles at present existing, to specify which is unnecessary, thpy beo- to be completely excused for the present, and regret their inability to carry out this undertakino- at the present moment. 0 81. The Marquis of Salisbury, in a letter to the Foreign Office, London, Secret, February 1878, koi . 59-60. dated 5th January 1878, much regretted that the influence of Her Majesty's Minister at lehran should have proved insufficient to secure from the Shah's Govern ment favorable consideration of a project so obviouslv advantageous to the commercial interests of both Persia and Great Britain, it was not, however anticipated by Lord Salisbury that, under existing circumstances, further pressure either upon the Shah or his Ministers was likely to be attended bv anv practicable result. Lord Derby nevertheless instructed Mr. Thomson to lose no Government I)reSSmg the ^ uestion u P on the notice of the Persian (ii ' ) P ^ P °l e i? ailw ^ s i rom Resht . t0 Teheran, and Teheran to the Kaiun Eiver; tne K.arun navigation question, 1878-79. 82. While the Shah was in Europe in 1878, two projects were submitted* to him for the construotton of railways in Persia One of the lines pro- •Letter from H.M's Minister in Teheran, No. 119, DOSed Was from j dated 18tb August 1878, to the Marquis o£ Salisbnry. fL f m , t0 -^heran, and t - j • i jt -i otner irom Teheran to Tabriz Thp Persians had also been m communication with the Austrian Government respecting the employment of ciriliansto undertake the supervision of finZt l postal customs, and police arrangements in Persia.

In a conversation with the Sepeh Salar on 12th August 1878, Mr. Thomson pointed out that the lines proposed were not those which would he most advantageous to Persia; that any railway line which led into her neigh bour's territory would make Persia entirely dependent for her commercial relations with Ii/urope upon the good-will ot that neighbour; that the restric tions and impediments placed by Russia on foreign trade were well known ; and that, therefore, if Persia decided to place her railway system at the outset in connection icith that of Russia, they must be prepared to find themselves completely at the mercy of that JPoicer ; rohereas, by following the route to the south, she would have access to the high seas, be iniependtnt of her neighbours, and be able to main tain free cnnmercial relations with the whole world. Be said that by throwing open the Karun river, which icould cost nothing, by having a line of railway from Sinister to Ispahan and thence to Teheran, Persia would place herself in a position emiblinfi her to trade with the whole world on a footing of absolute independence. On it being objected that a sea- route was much longer than a line of railway through Europe, Mr. Thomson observed that, not to mention that time was not of much consequence in Persia, a sea route was much cheaper, and consequently better suited for general trade ; and that, moreover, as it was not unlikely that a line between Europe and the Persian Gulf would, before long, be established, Persia would, by a railway to the south, be placing herse 1 f in connection w it,h the main line, in which case there could be no objection on the score of slowness of transit. In a conversa tion with the Shah on 14th August, Mr. Thomson alluded to the prospect of reforms being shortly introduced in Turkey which would make it almost impera tive for Persia, in view of her own interests, to adopt similar progressive measures ; and said that, in his opinion, they could be more safely undertaken With the advice and support of England than under the auspices of Russia. The Shah replied that it was his intent ion to c irry out a number of reforms, and that he hoped for the assistance of Her Majesty's Government in doing so; but that hitherto he had not derived that support from England which he had hoped and expected to obtain. In referring to the two lines of railway for which proposals had been submitted to the Shah in Europe, he recommended a line from Teheran to the south, and the navigation of the Karun as being most advantageous to Persia, for the reasons already stated. On his pressing the question of the Kamn navigation, the Shah said that he had prepared a J?rojet de Beformes, which included a Concession with respect to the Ahwaz irrigation scheme, and would provide for the navigation of the Karun. 83. It was proposed to grant the Concession for the Resht-Teheran line to a Erench Company represented by the firm of Allien of Constantinople. The Concession was for a period of 99 years, after which period the line will become the property of the Persian Government. The Persian Government guaranteed 6^ per cent, on the capital which may be raised by the Company as shares or bonds. This percentage is guaranteed by the receipts of the Custom House. Should the profits exceed the amount guaranteed, the Persian Government would receive 50 per cent, of the surplus. The Persian Government was to grant free all crown lands required by the Company, but the Company was to give compensation for the cultivated parts, and to arrange with the owners of land the property of private individuals, allowed gratis out of Government lands, mines and forests, all wood and material required for the construction of the railway, and coal for working it. The scheme* was opposed by the Russian Minister at Teheran, who proposed, a Julfa-Tabriz line. The General •From Aisistant Spcretary, Political and Secret Ealkenhagen S SCllCme.

Hef strongly recommended the Minister for Eoreign Affairs to abstain from committing the Persian Govern ment to their acceptance until they had ascertained the nature of the reforms and projects which would probably, before long, be carried out in the Asiatic provinces of'iurkey, w T hen they would be in a better position to judge what would be expedient for the interests of Persia. He also urged that no such arrangements should be concluded until some understanding had been come to in equitable satisfaction of Baron Ileuter's claims. The Council granted the Conces- [S969ED] Tsion, but, on Mr. Thomson's representations, the Shall withheld his approval. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr. Thomson that he bad strongly advised the Shah to decline all Railway Concessions which would place the trade of Persia under the control of Russian Custom House regulations, and had recommended the opening of the trade route to the Persian Gulf by rail to Shuster and the Karun River to Mohammerah. He said that on this re presentation the Shah ordered the Resht-Teheran Concession to be set aside. 84). On 4th November 1878/ Mr. Ronald Thomson telegraphed to His • n- . &gt;j oionp Excellency the Viceroy that the Resht- Teheran Railway Concession to the French Company had been granted, notwithstanding his opposition, and the urgent representations of the Russian Minister in favor of a direct line from Tiflis to a Russian Company, to which Mr. Thomson also strongly objected. The Con cession, though granted, was not to be sent off to Paris for some days after. Mr. Thomson said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him unofficially that he might consider the Karun navigation question as conceded, and that the Persian Government would allow the construction of a railway from the Karun to Teheran by an English Company, on the same terms as the Resht-Teheran line. In a letter to the Marquis of Salisbury, dated 20th November 1878, Mr- Thomson, however, stated that the navigation of the Karun had not yet been conceded. He says that tiie Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was alive to the advantages to be gained by adopting the views of Her Majesty's Govern ment, and had urged the matter on the Shah, verbally as well as in writing, and was so confident of having persuaded His Majesty that he assured him he might consider the matter as settled. He explained that the Foreign Minister has to contend with determined opposition on the part of the Shah, which, though it had temporarily been withdrawn, has unexpectedly again revived. The- only way he can account for this opposition was that it might arise from misgivings as to the future value of Mohammerah to England being so great that we might, having once obtained a footing there, take advantage of an opportunity to secure its possession. If this surmise was correct, he said it would throw light on the otherwise unintelligible opposition of the Persian Government during the last three years. 85. Though the Shah had, for the moment, shown indications of renewed opposition, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs lias expressed himself as per fectly confident of being able to overcome this, if not immediately, at no very distant period. The Minister had many difficulties to contend with, his tenure of office being by no means secure. Mr. Thomson believed him to be loyally endeavouring to aid Her Majesty's Government in the matter, and said he would allow no opportunity to pass of stimulating his efforts, with, he hoped, the ulti mate result of overcoming the Shah's opposition. 86. Mr. Thomson had ascertained that the Persian Government have asked From Her Charged' affaires, Teheran, that Of Russia to give them an a^SuratlfV* No. lys, dated 20th October 1878. to Lord Salisbury, that no restrictive conditions will be placed by the Russian Custom House authorities on the transit of goods by the Resht- Teheran line. This the Russian Government declined to do. They did not con sider it advisable that the line should be constructed at all. The Russian Minister has strongly recommended that Persia should make arrangements which won Id place Teheran in communication with Europe by railway through Tiflis and the Caucasus. Mr. Thomson says that the Russian Minister told the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that— lister,told 0 Rusiia was about \ 0 connect Kars with Tiflis by a line of Railwav whicli was intended for strategie fl purpo ? e8 and this line would be continued by Alexandropol to Julfa. A branch l.ne from the Tiflis-Poti Railway would be carried through to Botoum, giving- access to the Black Sea, and the Railway, which did not at present extend beyond Vladikafkaz, was forthwith to be completed to liflis through the Caucasus. This section of the line was, he said a costlv undertaking, and the Concessionaries to whom the work was being entrusted demanded; guarantee from the Russian Government which, however, they were willing to pav nrovirlJJ arrangements were made with Persia which would admit of the line being carJied through from Julfa on the Russo-Persian frontier to Teherm by Tebriz. The Wian G-ovevnment was therefore anxious that if P.rsia shou d adopt that route, and ii the ev.nt cf t e'v complying with this desire, Mr. Zinoview said, that not only would his Government comple ! the line of railway on their side up to the Pexsian frontier at Julfa, but they would do all23 ttey could to find suitable Concessionaries who would undertake the construction of the Pewian portion of the line on conditions which should be favourable to the Persian Government/' The Turkish Ambassador told Mr. Thomson that the idea conveyed to the mind of the Persian Minister by Mr. Zinoview's communication was that Kussia desired, as a counter-stake to the English scheme for establishing a through line of railway from Europe to England by Mesopotamia and the coast of the Persian Gulf, to promote the construction of a line from Tifiis to Tehran, with a view to its extension eastwards in the direction of Herat. 87. On 25th January 1879, Mr. Thomson telegraphed to His Excellency the Viceroy that the Shah had ordered a letter to be read to him which His Majesty had addressed to the Minister for Eoreign Affairs. In this communica tion the Shah absolutely refused, in very peremptory and arbitrary terms, to entertain the request of Her Majesty's Government for the opening of the Karun River. His Majesty remarked— &lt;f that the insistence of Her Majesty's Government with reference to the Karun aroused his suspicions, that Persia was not a dependent but an independent power, that if his consent was requested in the matter, he declined to give it, and that if force was contBinplated, that was another thing, &amp;c.' 88. A telegram was, however, received from the Secretary of State on 1st February, stating that the Shah had retracted this letter, which was written in a moment of irritation, but that he will not assent to the opening of the Karun River until he has had a judge on the spot as to its advisability. (iii) The Karun Irrigation Concession. 89 In December 1875 Dr. Tholozan, Physician to the Shah, proposed* to the Persian Government the grant of a • secret, June 18/6, Nos. 52-od. Concession to a Erench Company for works of irrigation in the districts adjacent to the Karun Eiver, the working of mines and forests, the improvement of land, and manufactories of all kinds. Dr. Tholozan was a man of mucli ability and great influence with the Shah. It was believed from the general terms used in the proposed Concession that it had been drawn up with the object of securing a monopoly or preferential riffht over Other Companies without exciting the suspicions or susceptibilities of tlfe Persian Government. One of the projects was to re-construct the ancient dam of the Karun Uiver at Ahwaz, so as to irrigate extensive tracts of fertile soil now waste. Ahwaz is 48 miles south ol : Sinister, to which place it was pro posed to run steamers. In Major Euan Smith's opinion, the re-construction of the old bund would mean the virtual, if not the absolute, closing of the river above Ahwaz, and would be fatal to the establishment of a paying line of steamers on the Karun. Besides, be said, the establishment of Prench interests in the south of Persia would be most prejudicial to us in every way, tending to hamper us politically and commercially in all we did. Mr. Taylour Thomson also recognised the importance of preventing, if possible, the estab lishment of a French or other foreign colony in the province of Kuzistan, to the prejudice of British interests there, as well as at Mohammerah, the latter place so valuable to us from a strategic and commercial point of view. He also considered that the grant of such a Concession would render the settle- ment bv amicable arrangement, of Baron Reuter's claims impossible. He y 0 accordingly endeavoured to impede its secret, September 1876, No. 97. acceptance. Though the Shah was at first personally well-disposed to Dr. Tholozan and his proposal, it was rejected in July 1876. 90 Whenf the Shah was in Paris in 1878, the scheme was again t rmnCharge d'Affai,.., Teheran.

AfL Dr. Tholozan's return to Teheran, he had pressed* his proposal constantly on the bhah, and was supported by several of the Chamberlains who have considerable influence with His Majesty. On one occasion the Shah, said to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it had bettar be granted at once. Mr. Thomson, how ever, endeavoured to dissuade the Minister for Foreign Affairs from giving the Concession, and told him that Her Majesty's Government were of opinion that such Concessions should not be granted until the Persian Government had come to an arrangement with Baron Eeuter. On 26th October 3 878, Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran telegraphed that the fchah had caused the Concession to be given to Dr. Tholozan, as an inducement, it was believed, to continue his attendance on His Majesty. With a view to prevent its execu tion, Mr. Thomson communicated a memorandum to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, pointing out that, in addition to its being adverse to the interests of Persia, it infringed on Baron Keuter's Concession, and clauses 4 and 6 of the proposed agreement were opposed to treaty stipulations. The clauses referred to are as follows :— '4.—Que si une ecluse on des ecluses sont necessaires, a cote du barrage, pour le passao-e das navires ou des bateaux, ]a compagnie apres avoir etabli k ses fruis ces constructions, y aura seale le droit de circulation ; qu'elle sera libre de conceder 93 droit k tel ou tel, moyennant rtdevanee, et apres information don nee par elie au Gouvernement Persan; que dans ce cas le Cjouvememeut Persan percevra le quart du revenu net de ce droit de passage.

A precis of this correspondence was complied by Mr. DeLeffoe, in 1883, and as it is full and exhaustive, no apology is needed to reproduce it here, without repeating the work in a new and briefer form, at a time when the whole question of the Karun river navigation is being reconsidered. The correspondence is treated under 4 heads (i).—History, (ii).— Navigability (iii). —Trade .Routes, and (iv).—General remarks ;— (i).— history , 1881-83. 93. After the Shah 's peremptory refusal to open the Karun river for na vigation, 1879, the question was not taken up again till March 18bl. At that time Persia was threatened by a Kurdish invasion, and the Shah was very des irous of coming to an understanding with the Stiltan, who could easily prevent the invasion by removing the leader, Sheikh Obeidullah, from the frontier- The Persian Minister for Foreign Aifairs, talking to Mr. Thomson on this sub ject, promised that if Her Majesty 's Government would use their influence at Constantinople in order to effect the desired understanding, the Persian Govern ment would open the Karun for navigation and construct a road from Shuster • c . f , 00 , „ to Teheran.* The British Ambassador • Secret, June 1881, Nos, 152-162. , ... &gt; l •' did make representations at Constantino ple as desired by the Persian Government, but it appears that the eventual re- - o ^ ,o 0 „ xt rr ttt moval of Sheikh Obeidullah from the fron- t Secret, May 1882, Nos. 821-376, K.-W. « m v • • n xj . -i ^ j tier was at Teheran principally attributed to Russian influence.f 94.

Meanwhile Mr. Thomson had been instructed to communicate the result of the steps taken at Constantinople to the Persian Government, and to re-open the Karun navigation question with reference to the promise made by the Shah's Minister for Foreign Affairs. 97. Mr, Thomson's first reference to the Persian Government, dated 6th July 18S1, remained unanswered. He then sent a reminder in September, and this was replied to in an evasive manner on the 19th October. The Shah was much opposed to the concession, and finally referred the matter to the Zil -ns Sultan who at that time has gone to Teheran, Mr. Thomson consequently en tered into correspondence with the Prince, and as the Zil-us-Sultan had inform ed Colonel Ross that ho would arrange the matter if he were promised a decora tion, Mr. Thomson was authorized to give the requested promise, on condition • ^ , T xt -o, that 'a satisfactory arrangement could be |i Secret, May 1882, Nos. 321^376. effected j| 98.

It should here be remarked that, while the Resident in his communica tions w r ith the Zil-us Sultan worked for a special concession for British vessels to navigate the Karun, the Minister at Teheran simply wished to obtain permis sion for the vessels of all nations to navigate the river. Colonel Ptoss was of opinion that, if such a general permission were given, the Government of India should immediately subsidize the British India Steam Navigation Company, so [S969FD] i G• Secret, May 1882, Nob . 321-97®. ® S t0 S'® them 811 advantage. OTOT the irenon, whose eventual success, if allowed a footing in the country, would be detrimental to British interest.* 100. At the time the Resident's report was written, some Erench mer chants had tried to establish commercial relations with Mohammerah. Their undertaking was supported by the Prench Consul at Basrah and a French En gineer, M. Dieulafoy, had been sent to the Karan to report on the navigation and on the Ahwaz dam. It was rumoured that the French had obtained a conces sion for running steamers on the Karun, but this rumour turned out to be false, t Secret, May 1882, Nos. 377-388 and M ' ^ieulafoy reported unfavorably on the Ahwaz scheme. The attempt to estab lish relations with Mohammerah equally failed.f 101. Zil-us-Sultan appears to have done his best in order to obtain the opening of the Karun river, but the Shah's opposition was not to be overcome, and after a year's negotiations Mr. Thomson forwarded in September 1882 the following report:— '&lt; I regret that I am^still unable to report that there is any immediate prospect of the ohah s assent being obtained to the opening of the Karun to steam navigation.

We know that the Ahwaz falls are the only obstacle to navigation between the Gulf and the cities of Dizful and Shuster. Ahwaz was visited and carefully surveyed by Captain H. Wells, H. E., in December 1881. He found that the falls could be turned by a canal 2,350 yards on^. ilus canal would be cut through sandstone, which would form firm walls, never requiring repairs. Two locks would be required. Supposing 8 feet of water was desired, the total excavation would in no place be more than 35 feet deep. 1 he whole work would consequently be easy of execution and far from expensive (vide Appendix II). (iii).-—TEADE ROUTES, / 105. At present only two roads lead from the Persian Gulf to the northern parts of the country. One is the Bushire-Shiraz road. The other is the Bagh- dad-Kermanshah road. .The first presents extraordinary natural difficulties, and it is estimated that at least £200,000 would be required to make it into an easy caravan road. 106. The second road is less difficult, but besides being long it has the disadvantage of passing through Turkish territory, a disadvantage which is con siderably enhanced by the strenuous efforts made by the Turkish Government to exclude foreign ships from the Tigris. 107. Under these circumstances the trade routes connected with the Karun acquire speciaHmportance, and as the country on both banks of the river, though fertile is very sparsely populated, it may be said that the whole com mercial importance of the Karun depends on the'roads leading to the really pro ductive parts of Persia. 108. The principal trade centres which it is possible to reach from the Karun are: Ispahan, Teheran, Hamadan, and Kermanshah. 109. In 1878 Mr. Mackenzie went from Sinister to Ispahan. In 1882 Mr. Baring of the Teheran Legation and Captain H. Wells, K. E., went from Is pahan to Shuster and Dizful. They followed very nearly the same route as Mr. Mackenzie, but they were far less favorably impressed by the road. In fact they both agreed that it would be out of the question to make a railway or even a carriage road direct from Shuster to Ispahan. A fairly good caravan road might be made, but Captain Wells is of opinion that it would be far easier to arrange the Bushire-Ispahan road, which is the one now ordinarily followed, and he points out that in winter there would be great difficulties as to supplies on the Shuster-Ispahan road, as the whole population of the Bakhtyari moves down to the Shuster plains between October and April. 110. It would consequently appear that the Shuster-Ispahan route may be *Note. —This doe« not imply that Ispahan thould 0 Ut ©f consideration.* A Careful SUT- he left out of consideration as an important com- vey ot this road will be found in Political meroial centre. Mr. Baring and Captam Wells have ^ December 1882, No. 117, which should shown that a comparatively easy road leads direct 3 . ' - i, oxiwuiu. from the Per&amp;ian Gulf through Behbehau to is be read in connection with Mr, Baring's paiwin * report (Secret, May 1882, No. 379). 111. The next routes requiring consideration are those which lead from Shuster and Dizful to Teheran without touching Ispahan. The road from Shuster to Dizful does not present any difficulties, and besides the Diz river is navigable as far as Dizful. Erom this place five different roads lead in the direction of Teheran, but they all join at Khoramabad. The shortest of these roads lead right through the mountains and are very difficult, but there is at least one road, which according to Mn Schindler, a well known and careful explorer, is very easy and good throughout its entire length, a fact which is further proved by the passage of Persian Artillery by this road between Kho - ramabad and Dizful. This road is 130 miles long, and a second road slightl y28 shorter could with very little expenditure be turned into a good carriage road. 112. From Khurramabad, where the five roads join, the road passes through Burujird and Hamadan to Teheran, and this part presents no difficulties whatever. The total distance from Dizful is 400 miles of as easy road against 760 miles by the present road from Bushire, which in many places is very • From Minister, Teheran, No. 43, dated 7th ipril difficult.* It is true that the Bushire 1883. r oad passes by Shiraz and Ispahan, but the real important place is Teheran and besides Hamadan is quite as impor* tant from a commercial point of view as either Shira, or Ispahan. 113. The Third route of importance in connection with the Tvarun river is the Kermanshah route. The importance of opening up the Kermanshah countrv may be gathered from the fact that Captain Napier at Kermanshah found about 80,000 tons of grain of little value to anybody on account of the difficulty of export. The grain sold at the absurdly low rate of Rs. 9 per ton.. In fact the Kermanshah district is one of the most fertile in the world and abounds in excellent horses. If the Karun were opened for navigation, the Kermanshah trade might easily go by Hamadan to Dizful, but probably shorter roads might be found. 114. A French Engineer in Persian service, M. Vauvilliers, has recently sub mitted to the Persian Government a scheme for establishing water communica tion between Kermanshah and Dizful. A river called Kerkhab joins the Shat-el-Arab below Karun. This river is supposed to be navigable till very near Kermanshah, and at one point, it is only 30 miles distant from Dizful. M. Vauvilliers proposes to make a canal at this point, and thus connect Ker- • From MiuiBter, Teheran, No. 78, dated llth June manshah with Dizful.t Even if this less. scheme should prove difficult of execu tion, there is every reason to believe that a road following the Kerkhab would give easy communication with DizfuL iv.—GENERAL REMARKS. 115. The opening of the Karun river for navigation would be equally ad vantageous from a political and from a commercial point of view. Considering the political aspect of the case, it may be remarked that it would give England, as the country which would most largely employ the new route, paramount influence in Southern Persia, while the possibility of bringing troops within a few hundred miles of the most important Persian tow r ns naturally would contribute largely to the re-establishment of British influence at Teheran. Prom a commercial point of view it would appear that the only chance of successful competition with Russian trade is the opening up of the Karun. Twenty years ago British merchants almost monopolized the trade of Persia. At this moment English goods are rarely seen beyond Isfahan, and even at this place Russian produce is sold in equal quantity with British merchan dize. 116. This change is due to the development of steam navigation on the Caspian and to the construction of good roads leading from the Caspian to Teheran and Meshed. Mr. Thomson is of opinion that a railway must shortly be made from the Caspain to Teheran, 'and that, if nothing is done towards developing communications with the Persian Gulf, British trade will be driven out of all the important and wealtUy parts of Persia. At present this trade is confined to the roads Trebizond-Teheran, Baghdad-Kermanshah-Teheran, and Bushire-Ispahan-Teheran. 111. The Trebizond road may be left out of consideration, as it cannot pos sibly compete with the Russian roads. 118. The Baghdad-Kermanshah-Teheran road is 600 miles long, a great part leads through difficult country, and the Turkish opposition to free trade on the Tigris will be an almost unsurmountable obstacle to the development of this trade route.29 119. The Bushire-Ispahan-Teheran road is 760 miles long and is between Bushire and Shiraz so difficult that only a very heavy outlay could procure a passable road. 120. The only roads left are those formerly mentioned in connection with the Karun, which all, if the river were opened to navigation, would give British trade great facilities. 121. Five important memoranda have recently been written on the trade routes connecting the Persian Gulf with the interior of Persia. The authors are Sir H. Rawlinson, Sir 0. St. John, Mr. Baring, Captain Wells and Mr. Thomson. These memoranda are given in extenso in appendix III. Besides we have a Persian memorandum by one of the Zil-us-Sultan's officers. 122. Sir H Rawlinson is of opinion that the question of opening up the Karun is a delusion and a snare.' He considers the Ahwaz band as an insurmountable obstacle, and he is convinced that if it were surmounted the roads leading from the Karun to the interior would be impracticable, partly on account of the natural difficulties, and partly owing to the lawless state of the country through which they would pass. 123. His objections are met by Captain Wells, who proves that it would be very easy and cheap to turn the Ahwaz band by a canal, and by Mr. Thomson, who calls attention to two routes from Dizful to Khurramabad, which are un known to Sir H. Rawlinson, while they have recently been explored by Mr Schindler, who found that one of them had long been used by the Persians for the transport of their artillery, a fact which entirely does away with Sir H. Rawlinson's objections on that score. Mr. Thomson also shows that the state of the country has altered since Sir H. Rawlinson's time, and that a well frequented trade route would be perfectly secure. 124. Sir O. St. John disagrees entirely with Sir H. Rawlinson. He is of opinion that it would be quite easy to render the Karun navigable throughout and he thinks that the Shuster-Ispahan road could very easily be made into a good caravan road, but he deprecates the idea of making carriage roads As no carriages exist in Persia they would have to be made or imported, and it would under these circumstances be quite as cheap to make a ^ light railway. Meanwhile a good mule-path would be all that is required. Sir O. St. John agrees with Mr. Thomson that the roads would be quite safe. 125. Mr. Baring thinks that the Karun could and should be used as atrade route, but he is of opinion that it should be divided into two sections with two seta of steamers, one above the Ahwaz falls and one below. These two sections should be connected by a tramway. He refers to Mr. Schindler's explorations of the Dizful-Khurramabad roads, and thinks that the only means of maintain ing British trade in Persia would be the use of these roads, unless a hitherto unknown road from Bushire to Ispahan via Behbehan should prove practicable as he has reason to believe it would. Mr. Baring is in fnvour of the construc tion of metalled roads, but he agrees with Sir H. Rawlinson that the Shuster- Ispahan route should be left out of consideration. 126. Captain Wells thinks that a railway could easily be made from Shuster via Hehbehan to Shiraz. He considers the direct Shunter-Ispahan road to be impracticable, but he points out that^ the Shuster-Burujird-Ispahan road which does not present any natural difficulties is at least 100 miles saorter than the difficult Bushire-Ispahan route. 127. Mr. Thomson, who has read all the memoranda above referred to, and who has collected all other information in his power, is of opinion that the opening up of the Karun river would offer distinct advantages. The Dizful- Khurramabad -Teheran route is short and easy, and affords the only means of competing with Russian trade. The minister points out that Russian trade has increased to an alarming extent within the last years and that when the railway from the Caspian to Teheran has been completed, British trade will certainly be driven out of all the great Persian markets unless easy communications are established with the Persian Gulf. Mr. Thomson entirely dismisses the idea that the Persian Government would ever incur the expense necessary for rendering [S969FD] H30 the Bushire road available for a large traffic, but he thinks that they might be induced to construct the less expensive road from Shuster. 128. Summing up the different opinions expressed on the subject of the Karun navigation, it will be seen that Sir H. Rawlinson alone does not believe in the importance of the river as a means of developing British trade in Persia. All other authorities agree that it is the only possible way of competing with Russia, and that the only real difficulty consists in inducing the Persian Gov ernment to give the necessary permission. 129. The following table will show the length of the different roads which connect Teberan with the Persian Gulf Miles. Teheran-Tspahan-Bushire ... ... 760 Teheran-Ispahan-Ahwas ... ... 600 Teheran-Ispahan-S buster ... ... ... 600 Teheran-Ispahan-Dillom ... ... ... 600 Teheran-Kermanshab-Bagdad ... ... 590 Teberan-Bumjird-Dizful ... ... ... 400 180. Considering that the last of these roads is 360 miles shorter than the only now available road, and that it even in its present state is practicable for artillery, while the Bushire road is exceedingly difficult even for mules, the ad vantages of the Shuster road are evident. 131. The Persian view of the Karun question will be found in a not unin teresting report furnished in July 1882 to the Zil-us-Sultan by one of his officers who had been specially deputed to examine the river and the surrounding country. 132. This report deprecates the admission of foreign ships on the river, as they might use it for military purposes. But the writer is of opinion that the Persian Government should have steamers on the Karun. He thinks that a ,• secret, Febpn.r, 1883, No.. 2io. datl ; '^trueted at the Ahwaz falls would render an enormous tract of land cultiv able, while it would prevent foreign ships from gettingijeyond the dam.* 16 - 8 - 83 - (Sd.)

R oss , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Fars, etc., To—C. G rant , Esq., C.S.I., Officiating Secretary to the Government of Indiaj Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the information of His Excellency tbe Viceroy and Governor General in Council, the following confidential report on the existing state of ,the quebtion of the proposed opening of the Karun river to navigation, and the prospects of oppor tunities arising for forwarding British interests in the matter. 2. The advantages of the opening of this route to British commerce have been so repeatedly and exhaustively set forth, and are so fully recognized on all hands, that it would be super* flaous to repeat or to add to the arguments bearing on that part of the subject. 8. Almost all the best authorities, also, are agreed as to the suitability of the Karun for navigation by steamers of light draught of water from Mohammerah to Shuster, and the practicable nature of the scheme as regards this particular point. There is only one part of the river at Ahwaz, where at present there is a break, and there I believe it has been contem plated to construct a canal with locks. Considering, however, that the Karun has not been surveyed for 40 years, it seems very advisable that it should be surveyed afresh by a compe tent person, and it would be best for the mercantile firm who propose to run steamers to ascertain exactly the capabilities of the river, and also the practicability and probable cost of constructing a canal at Ahwaz. 4. The proposal to place steamers on the Karun emanated from the firm of Messrs. Gray, Dawes &amp; Co., and it was originally sought to obtain an exclusive concession in their favor from the Persian Government, and also a subsidy from the British Government. At the present time Her Majesty's minister at Teheran is endeavouring to obtain from the Persian Government the opening of the Karun to trade generally with no monopoly nor special privi- lejres to British merchants, and according: to the latest information from Teheran, the Shah had referred this request of Her Majesty's Minister to his son, the Zil-us-Sultan, Whether the reference to His Royal Highness th* Zil-us-Sultan has resulted from that Prince's own sugges tion and influence with His Majesty the Shah, whether it is meant in earnest, or merely an expedient for gaining time and evading an immediate decision, may be considered uncertain at present. I am inclined, however, to thiuk that the Zil-us-Sultan has himself contrived to have this matter referred to him. 5. On arrival of the present Governor of Bushire, Aga Muhammad Mirza, a protege and confidant of the Zil-us-Sultan, I received private messages from the Prince, expressing his great desire to render himself useful to the Government of India. It occurred to me that the power placed in the Prince's hands, and his great influence with the Shah, might enable him, if so disposed, to carry out the desired opening of the Karun, and I mentioned to the Governor of Bushire that, if the Zil-us-Sultan could do so, it would be an excellent way of showing his good-will to the British Government. The Prince has since been in communi cation with Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., the Bushire branch of Messrs. Gray, Dawes &amp; Co., on the subject, and has made minute inquiries into details of the scheme. On the 4th of this month Mr. R. Paul had an interview with the Governor of Bushire to give some information on this subject, and the next day I made some inquiries of the Governor which elicited a private message on the part of the Zil-ue-Sultan, tbe purport of which I enclose. I have „ , „ . thought it best to comply with the Prince's Enclosure No. 1. -.iT request to be furnished with arguments id support of the view that it is better for Persia to give the preference to the British in the matter of the proposed coneesssion. I have, accordingly, to the best of my power, put down such argu ments as I think best calculated to serve the purpose, and have sent them privately through the Governor. I enclose the English version of what Enclosure No. 2. 1 have said. As regards the Zil-us-Sultan's ambi tion to receive a British Order, I intimated that it is not a matter on which I could say anything. 6. Government are aware that, under encouragement of the French Government, a line of steamers has been established between Marseilles and Busrah, and certain French officers have recently established themselves at iMohammerah. From the proceedings of these officers, and their being connected with the military and naval services of France, it has appeared probable that their objects go beyond ordinary commercial business at Mohammerah and that tbey aim at obtaining a footing and influence in Persian Arabistan. It may be fairly32 presumed that the presence of these French officers is not unconnected with the scheme which has been advocated and urged by Dr. Tholozan, the Shah's physician, which has for its object to construct a dam at Ahwaz, and to irrigate and cultivate the adjacent lands by a French Companr Government are aware that a concession was actually granted to Dr. Tholozan for this enterprise and signed by the Shah, but Her Majesty's Minister succeeded in obtaining its cancellation. It was, I think, understood at that time that the French Government did not favour the scheme. It appears now, if His Royal Highness the Zil-us-Sultan's statement can be relied on, that the scheme is again beinsr actively pressed, and that the French aim also at securing for themselves the right of navigation as well as irrigation. There is, at the present moment, a French Engineer in the service of the French Government (M. Dieulafoy) proceed ing from Baghdad to visit Dizful, Shuster and Karun, and I have no doubt one object of his visit to those districts is in connection with Dr. Tholozan's scheme. 7. It would appear therefore, assuming the Zil-us-Sultan's statement to be correct, that the French are, through Dr. Tholozan, actively endeavouring to obtain exclusive control of the Karun, and are supported by Russian influence at Teheran, whilst the British Government is urging the free opening of the river to all nations, and that the Shah has referred these matters to the Zil us-Sultan, who is disposed to give preference to the British. So far as I can form an of iuion, I am inclined to believe this is the real position of matters. 8. The importance to British interests of opening up the Karun by British means is enhanced by the presence and designs of the French. It appears to me that the French scheme of damming up the Karun at Ahwaz is incompatible with the English one of opening the navigation, and that if, on the other side, the navigation were conceded, it would put a stop to the French enterprise. It is at the same time quite possible that both schemes could be worked if under one control, and it may be the French aim at securing both objects. 9. It is obvi iusly of much importance to the British Government, in a political as well as a commercial point of view, to prevent French influence being established in that part of Persia. Arabistan is a country which is susceptible to external influence, and should a foreign power cbtain such a footing as the French scheme aims at, it would not be difficult to detach much of the province from Persia. It may one day be of importance to England to have access to the centre of Persia by the nmte of the Karun river, a strong reason for objecting to have a European power predominant in its valley. To France and to Russia it is easy to see the prospect is agreeable. To Prance it would, in the outset, open new fields of commercial enter prise, and, in the future, render her alliance of increased value to Russia in the East. If the French gained a footing in Arabistan, it would be almost imperative on the British Govern ment to take political action there also, and the conflict of interests would inevitably become a source of disagreement between the two powers whose interests have not as yet clashed in those parts. I think, therefore, the French irrigation scheme should be opposed, and, if pos sible, prevented, both as incompatihle with the free naviga ! ion of the Karun, and as a danger to the political interests both of England and of Persia. 10. So far it seems clear enough that it is for the interests of the British Government to oppose the French irrigation scheme and to work for the opening of the navigation of the river under British au&gt;pict*s. It does not appear, however, quite alear to me that, as matters ftand, the permission for free navigation will necessarily be followed by the appearance of English steamers on the river. French officers are on the spot, and possibly might, if delay occurred on the part of the British firm, forestall the latter and place French vessels on the river. This would certainly not be so serious a matter as the colonization, but it is a contin gency which 1 think shfuld be, as far as possible, guarded against This could best be done, assuming the concession of an English monopoly to be now (ut of the question, by au under- ptanding being arrived at between the British Government and the firm of Messrs. Gray, Dawes &amp; Co. as to the support to be accorded to them, and the steps they would be prepared to take immediately on the permission of the Persian Government being intimated. I would recommend the grant of a Government subsidy being accorded for at least a limited period. This, besides being an encouragement to the Company, would go far to frustrate any attempt at French compntition, and pla^e Government in a good position to require the project to be speedily an 1 effectually carried out, and also to insist on fair play on the part of the Persian Government and authorities. 11. Regarding His Royal Highness the Zil-us-Sultan's expressed desire to receive a decoration in recognition of his proposed service in forwarding British interests^ I may, in a c mlidential report, he permitted to say a few words. Such a favor would of course be out of the question except with the assent of the Shah. As matters now stand, His Majesty has avowedly placed the matter in the Zil-ns-Sultan's hands, and if the latter obliges the British Governmpnt, there would be an open reason for acknowledging the obligation, if it pleased the British Government in the manner suggested. If the Shah did not object, it does not appear why the feelings or interests of other members of the Royal family need be considered. The two younger sons of the Shah are known to be no friends of England, and if the British Government find one of the family cordially disposed, eome marked recognition of the fact might have a beneficial effect in Persia. 12. As a commercial enterprise the opening up to the Karun route has a double aim— (1) To divert the foreign traffic from the present long, arduous, and expensive route of Bushire Ispahan to the shorter one of Shuster-Ispahan.(2) To develop and utilize the vast resources of the fertile districts of P -rs'a to the noth of Dizful, such as Khoramabad, Hamadan, Kennanshah, jBurujird, and even Azeibaijan, and to attract the produce of those districts^ which now either he unused or follow the Baghdad route, to the new, cheapen and more direct route. 18. It appears to rne probable that the second of these objects will prove, on the whole, more immediately attainable than the first. At present there is no road between Shuster and srahan , nothing beyoud a track over the mountains, and I understand some of the kotals, * Captain Wells, R. E., has recently traversed thi s or P ^es, are quite as formidable as any on the line of country in company with Mr. Baring, Secre* Bus hire-Shi raz route.* There are no caravan- S rnfnrmaHnn' and ^ D0 doubfc, contribute valu ' ^erais or shelter of any kind for men and beasts, able information ^ and the ^ 7 ouse d by ni^ht, be liable to perisn by the M r ay. Security from plunder would readily be insured by the Kelkhani, or chief of the Bakhtyari tribe, but is it probable a road would speedily be made and rest-houses built? Ultimately, no doubt; but it is to be borue in mind that the Eelkhani and his people, whilst ready to grant protection in return for tolls or blackmail, will be by no means pleaded to have a good roid constructed through their country, as this would afford facilities for the passage of Persian troops. This they would dread, as putting an end to the independence and security fr^m molestati «n they now enjoy. Eventually, doubtless, all difficulties and obstacles will be removed, and trade will follow the cheapest and shortest route. 14, I attach to this report copy of the draft concession to Messrs Gray, Paul &amp; Co., which was on the point of being signed in 1876 by the Persian Government, and also a paper containing questions which I have now put to Mr. li. Paul, senior partner of Messrs. Vide Secret, May 1882, Nos. 321-376. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. of Bushire, and the reply he has made. Enclosure No. 1. Message delivered by the Governor of Bushire, 5'h January 18S2, Now I have obtained an opportunity and therefore openly without concealment I beg to lay before you the Zil-us-Sultan's object. His orders are as follows :— &lt;£ I am very anxious to be on especially good terms with the English, and a'so I wish to accomplish some desired object for this Government (English), in return for Avhieh I desire a decoration from them that I may be distinguished above others. Especially in the matter of the Ahwaz river (would I like to carry out their wish). My chief object in obtaining the Government of Ears was obtaining Bushire, and my object in oltaining Bu&gt;hire was to gain the friendship of the ^Resident, so that, please God, by his exertions, zeal, and advice I might obtain my object. For it I wish to open communications with the British Minister in Tehran, there tvere many things there to prevent me and it would be impossible. Now I beg to state that the French Government has, for a long time past, been in communication with His Majesty the Shah, through Dr. Tholozan and the French Minister, on the subject of the aforesaid river, both with reference to having it blocked to others, and in having it opened out for their own ships ; and tht-y have been very persistent in the matter, and the Russian Government also desire this same object, i.e., that the river be opened to the French and closed to others. At first the Sipah Salar opposed this object, but now that he is no more, the French Minister and Dr. Tholozan press the matter every day ; but thus far 1 have effected, that 1 have been honored with a rescript from His Majesty the Shah, stating that ' the Zil-us-Sultau has full powers in this matter.' Now that the matter has reached this stage, 1 wish for aid from the Hesident, as he knows the rules and customs of these sort of matters better (than I) and his insight is greater. Therefore I request he will confidentially teach me what he thinks most advisable, so that, when I arrive at Tehran, and am questioned by His Majesty the Shah, I may be able to point out to His Majesty the evils and disadvantages of opening the river to the French Government, and the benefits and advantages of opening it to the English. The more the Resident aids me in this affair the better prepared will I be on my arrival in Tehran to carry this matter to a conclusion in accordance with the wishes of the English Government, and after accomplishing it be honored with the decoration I wish for. I also wish the Resident will inform the English Government of my wish.' Telegram No. 8, dated 6th January 1883 (Confidential). F r om—Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—Foreign, Calcutta. Private message received from Prince Zil-us-Sultan that Shah has given him full power in regard to Karun proposal, and that he is disposed to meet wishes of British Government and in return hopes to receive a decoration. It is probable that if decoration could be promised point would be carried. [S?69FD] I34 Enclosure No. 2. (Opening of the Karun.) The advantages, commercially financially, are so obvious and so fully admitted, that the objections or misgivings must arise from other considerations. Possibly these are of a political character, and the Persian Government may feel distrust of the motives of the British in urging this proposal. They perhaps suspect England of ulterior designs against thosa districts. | Persia ought, however, to be perfectly free from such distrust of the British Government. Persians can see for themselves that Kcgland^s position in the East renders her interests, in many respects, identical with those of Persia, and that, therefcre, her policy is naturally to preserve and foster the power, integrity and prosperity of a friendly Persia. To weaken and assist in dismembering a friendly Persia would be totally opposed to British interests. For England has all the territor\ r , power, and wealth she can possibly desire in India. Her policy is therefore directed to maintaining that position and ensuring leisure tu develop India and improve it^ people. England has no inducement to covet the territory of any other Asiatic power, and if forced to war in defence of her hon &gt;r or interests and temporarily occupy territory beyond her Ir^ntier, her Government has always taken the earliest opportunity to withdraw. J Persia is also a power which seeks no aggression, but desires peace and independence and to preserve the integrity of her territory. . When we come to other powers different motives are at work, as is manifest by their actions. This has been so obvious of late years as regards Russia that England feels the necessity for watching her advance and considfring it as a possible danger to the peace of Asia and India in the future To Persia this steady advance eastwards is of still oreater moment, and Russia, formerly in contact on the noith-west only, now presses on her north east provmce. England and Persia have a common interest in checking the further advance of Russia m that direction. If ever Russian power preponderated over British in that part of Asia, it is obvious that Persia and Afghanistan would ceaee to exist as independent kingdoms. Therefore as England desires the maintenance of Persian integrity and power so Persia must feel the vital importance to herself of the proximity and friendliness of the power winch alone limits the growth of Russian Empire in Asia. The one power is by oolicv and inclination, peaceful and stationary, the other aggressive and advancing. It is often felt to be strange that with such community of interests, Persia and Eno-Iand have not drawn closer politically to one another, and that the former does not to a p -reater extent shape her policy m accordance with the advice of her natural ally. There are no dmibf ful causes for this and th. fault is not all on ono side. Persia has to ' manage ' her powerful and restless neighbour, and feds uncertain what support to reckon on in an hour of daneer But I is obviously Persia B interests to attract the friendship and support of England Sd folly to distrust or wantonly alienate that power. b 'ina Persia should derive a sense of security and independence from feeling that she is not wholly beyond reach of aid from a strong and friendly power in times of trouble in the north. W ould not an unfriendly refusal of the Persian Government to concede +Iip noir,' +• of the Karun which is for the benefit of both countries tend to alienate ? Whil J commercial advantage be attained England has no inducement to oovet Persian ^to y ia 6 that quarter ? ill not relusal of the desired advantages to trade have a tendpnov ^ through estrangement, a political danger which at present does not exist ? 7 ' . .

(Sd,) E - C - Ro88 -36 Appendix II. Report by Captain -H. Wells, H. E. s on the Ahwaz Canal. Notes by Captain Herit L. Wells ; R. 13., on tours in Persia in 1881. The natural obstruction to the Navigation of the Karun River at Ahwaz as seen on December 1st, 1881. It will be seen by the sketch forwarded with this paper that, as the Karnn approaches AhwaZj its course is divided into two parts by an island marked I. 1. On plan No. 4 the branch to the west carries about one-third of the stream, whilst that to the east has the other two-thirds. The latter is deep and navigable for boats or flats of from 4 feet to 4 feet C inches draught, and this is the case with the river up-stream as fas as Bend-i-Kir. 2. At Bend-i-Kir is the junction of three streams, viz., the Dizful river on the west, the Karun from Shuster in the centre, and Grargar or the stream diverted from the Karan above Shuster (and regulated by the Kaiser Bund) on the east. These three combined are about 200 yards wide. 3. The Dizful river, as seen 10 miles below the town of Dizful, is a rapid stream with a variable course over stony pebble bed and quite unnarigable. At Beud-i-Kir it is about 70 yards wide at their confluence. 4. The Karun just below Shuster is not navigable, and this is said to be the case with it the whole way upwards from Bind-i-Kir where it is 80 yards wide. 5. The ' Kaiser Bund' or Gargar stream is 50 yards wide at Bend-i-Kir where it joins the Karun and is over 6 feet, and probably as much as 10 feet in depth. It is said to be navigable for large boats close up to Shuster. It has a slow placid stream which is the case of the combined river below Bend-i-Kir, though its banks showed in December marks of floods 6 feet above the then level of the river. 6. The combined river at 'Weis' half-way between Bend-i-Kir and Ahwaz measured 283 yards in width. The banks of alluvial silt are throughout 20 feet above the water, and admirably adapted for towing gangs who would tow cratt by means of ropes attached to their masts as is done in Bengal when the rivers are low. 7. To return to Ahwaz. Below the island mentioned in paragraph 1, the river only unites in a stream to be immediately confronted by the obstruction which I will now describe in detail. 8. A ridge of sandstone which emerges from the Ram Hormut plain some 20 miles west by south of Ahwaz here approaches the river, and apparently it is greatly due to this ridge of rock that the river presents the navigable aspect, it dops for so many miles above Ahwaz. The rocks form a complete weir across the stream which, flowing as best it can over the numerous out-crops, falls at least 6 feet in three-fourths of a mile of its course. Were it not for this weir it is doubtful if the nature of the river would not be entirely different. 9. The sandstone so plainly visible in the river bed never rises above the level of the country to the east by north, 10. ^ The weir or series of weirs at Ahwaz comprise five principal out-crops of sandstone with a dip to the north of 15 degrees, the out-crop being south and the strike as already stated from west by south to east by north. 11. No. 1 group is perhaps the most formidable ; appearing 25 yards below the island it narrows the river to 300 yards width, presenting a double ridge of rock over which the water roars in times of flood; there are however two openings, each of 50 yards in width in the low wall of rock, and through these the water pours at ordinary times havin^ a fall of sav 2 feet 6 inches in a length of 30 yards. 0 ' 12. No. 2 group crosses the river 1,100 yards below No. 1, The river having turned 15 degrees to the east to avoid the numerous rocks which crop out from the left bank, but do not extend right across its bed. Considerable accumulations of silt have collected on the rocks on the left, but they do not join the bank; wat^r channels have been cut in rock between them and the bank for the purpose of turning mills {vide plan) and their direction marks the course of a considerable flow of water m flood time. It was along tlie ridge of group 2 that the ancient bund was built by the Sassanians (?). Remains of this massive structure are still visible, but only high and dry far out of the present course of the water which is in a rapid stream between depressions in the rock and impassable for boats. The ancient bund was adapted to the configuration of the rock to the ielt bank where the sandstone is hi-h above the river. a loop m the bund took in these high rocks which are pierced by tunnels and sluice channels for diverting probably the water into canals for irrigating the countrv.37 &gt; IS- Between group 1 and group 2 a small ferry-boat now plieBj but has difficulty in avoiding the shallows and rocks. 14. No. 3 group is 200 yards below group 2. It is oE low flattish rock and causes rapids* By below is meant down-stream. 16. No. 4 group is 200 yards below No. 8; it is of the same character as No. 3 ; below this group an island has been formed of silt (marked 1, 2 on plan) and it divides the river. This island extends dowu-stream over and beyond group 5. 16. No. 5 group causes rapids in the two branches, formed by the island above mentioned, throughout their whole width. 17. Below group 5 the river is narrowed by rocks to a width of 165 yards. Hero it becomes deep, and from this point to its mouth is easily navigable by large boats. 18. It would, no doubt, not be difficult to blow out passages in the above-named ridges of sandstone and leave an uninterrupted way for the river, but it is impossible to predict what effect thus letting loose the pent up water of the Upper Karun would have on the whole bed of the river. 19. I calculate, roughly, that from the narrows down-stream to the island above group No. 1 the river falls from 8 to 10 feet. It may he conceived what a torrent would flow from No. 1 were a free channel cut for the water from it to the narrows. 20. The whole of the rocks, etc., within the present limits of the river banks are liable to be swept by floods; therefore, supposing a canal were cut in the rock in the dir^ctioo fihown in dotted lines on plan which would be the least expensive way as regards excavation, yet the difficulty of protecting the lock gates from damage at the up-stream end and the difficulty and cost of protecting the canal with masonry from being silted up by the spill of the river in flood time, would, I think, make this plan inadmissible j besides more than two locks would be required, 21. The best plan, in my opinion, would be to dig a canal from the narrows at (A) to the pool above Ahwaz at (B) following the red line on plan. Two locks would be required, viz., one at A and one at B, and no doubt sandstone would be met with for the greater part of the length (2,350 yards), yet once the work executed, these same sandstone walls to the canal would be of the greatest benefit, and would never be a cause of expense like the banks of most navigable waterways. Again the sandstone would form excellent walls to the locks and greatly lessen the cost of their construction, as the locks could be placed wherever the rock was best and need not necessarily be at A or B. 22. Between A and B along the red line shown on plan, there would probably never be more than 85 feet of excavation required even if the canal were to be 8 feet deep. 23. As a temporary measure a wharf might be constructed on piles in the pool at A and in the still water below the narrows at B, where native boats are now in the habit of lying, and these two points be connected by means of a tramway which could be laid with very little labour, the ground being nearly level and goods trans-shipped thus from the lower to the upper river or vice versd. With this tramway irrigation canals would not be interfered with if led from either side of the river above No. 1 group, but even with the locks at work there would be a very small waste of water unless the traffic became very great. However there is enough good ground about Shuster to be developed without irrigating that below the bund for many a year. [S969FD] K38 Appendix III- Memoranda on the Karun Eioer by Sir H. Bawlinson, Sir O. SI, Juhn, Mr, W. Baring, Captain H. Wells, and Mr. Ronald Thomson. Memorandum hy Sir H. Rawlinson, dated 28rd June 18S2. I venture to tbiok that the importance of the so-called project of ' opening np the Karun ' has, as far as British interests are concerned, been vastly overrated. It seems that, some years ao-o, certain British merchants who were engaged in the Persian trade, and who found that the very heavy expense of the land carriage between the port of Bushire and the markets o£ Central and Northern Persia placed them at a great disadvantage in respect to their Russian competitors, looked wistfully to the Karun waterway leading into the nitenor of the country ae a means of affording them relief, not unnaturally hoping that, by starting their caravans of goods from advanced posts up the river, like Shuster and Dizful, they would sensibly reduce the cost of transport, and be thus able to meet the Russians on more, equal terms m the markets of Ispahan and Teheran, and even of Tabriz. It thus became of great importance, according to their view of the question, to obtain a right of navigating the river Karun and its tributaries from Mohammerah upwards, and the British Legation at ieheran has accordingly, under instraotions from the Foreign Office, and in supposed 8up 1 x)rt of our eoonomical and political interests, kept up a strong and sustained pressure for some years past at the capital, in order to wrino- this concession from a reluctant Government. But the whole argument, as it appears to me, rests from the outset on a fallacy, for neither is it possible to render the Karun ' navigable to steamers, except at a cost entirely disproportionate to the results and quite beyond the means of the Local Government, nor if our merchants could convey their goods by water to Shuster and Dizful, would they have at all improved their general position. 1 now go on to explain briefly these two crucial points Firstly, in regard to the Karun, it i« well known that the river is barred at Ahwaz by a succession of rocky strata which run across the river bed, and from rapids, some miles in extent, preventing any continuous navigation, except in high flood, when, for a few weeks in the year, light craft can be hauled by main force over the obstructions. Captain ells and Mr. Baring who have recently visited and reported upon the Ahwaz barrier, express themselves most unfavourably as to the prospect of overcoming this difficulty. As the river falls 7 feet in passing the el bund,' it is feared that, if the rocky barrier were removed by blasting, the upper part of the stream would be drained and rendered unnavigable. Mr. Baring accordingly sees no alternative but the trans-shipment of goods at the 'bund/' which, indeed, is the course at present pursued by the local traders, but which would, by no means, suit European steam traffic; while Captain Wells suggests a canal with locks, a very expensive undertaking, and not likely to be entered upon by a mere trading company. The second difficulty to which I have drawn attention is still more discouraging. It must be conceded that the present trade route into Persia from the sea coast is inconvenient, circuitous, and expensive. The passes between Bushire and Shiraz are notoriously bad, and in some places dangerous. The distance from the sea coast to the capital is 700 miles, and as wheeled carriages are almost unknown, the expense of transport is heavy; but in spite of all these drawbacks, I have no hesitation in saying that the present caravan route by Shiraz and Ispahan is by far the best line of access to the interior of the country. Because there is a saving in distance of about 200 miles in the direct line from Shustert o Ispahan, as compared with the route to the same place from Bushire via Shiraz, it has been assumed that the former must afford the best and cheapest mode of entering Persia; but, in truth, map distance has little or nothing to do with the argument. I assert with the utmost confidence that the direct line across the mountains from Shuster to Ispahan cannot be made a commercial route. Mr. Baring says of it—' The difficulties are enormous. One passes over ridge after ridge, as if one were going over the teeth of a saw.' In history it was considered one of the greatest achievements that the Atabegs of Luristan, in the 13th century, did construct a good made road across these mountains from their capital of Aidej, or Malanier, to Ispahan; but the Jadeh-i-Ataheg, as it was called, never became a trade route, and very soon fell into ruin owing to natural causes. Nor is there any other available route into the interior from Shuster or Dizful which is at all to be compared with the high road from Bushire to Shiraz. Mr. Baring in his report (page 16) speaks of a road from Shuster to Gulpaigun directly across the most difficult portion of the range, but I have been assured on tne spot that this track, which crosses the Dizful river at the Pul-i-Hul, is only practicable to foot travellers. An unladen mule cannot even be dragged over the slippery sheet rock which occurs in every stage. Another road conducts direct from Dizful to Khurramabad, and this I have actually followed, performing the distance in five days, but it was a clamber throughout, the line being absolutely impracticable to caravans, and being, moreover, entirely uninhabited. The only high road from Shuster to the interior of Persia, the only road indeed that would be available to British merchants, who might have conveyed their goods by steamer up the Karun to Shuster, is that noticed by Mr. Baring at the end of pafje 15 of his report, which conducts up' the valley of the Kerkha to Jaidar, and then strikes off to the north-east alongthe line of the Kashghan river to Khurramabad. Of this road along which I have also travelled I can only say that the passes are not less difficult than those on the Bushire- Shiraz line; that there is not a single village between the plains of Dizful and the open country of Khurramabad, a distance of at least 150 miles, and that the tribes, moreover, of the lesser Lnristan, which command the entire transit, are among the most lawless and savage of all the Persian mountaineers. Caravans do certainly at intervals pass by this line from the low country of Susiana to the Upper Persian plateau, hut they pay a heavy blackmail for the right of passage, and are obliged, moreover, to carry all their provisions with them. And it must be added that the distance from Shuster to Teheran via Khurramabad and Hamadan can be very little less than that to the same place from Bushire vid Shiraz and Ispahan, while, with regard to Ispahan itself, which seems to be the great centre of mercantile attraction, the direct route along the present high road through Shiraz is in every respect preferable to the circuitous tract by Shuster and Khurramabad. I am strongly, therefore, of opinion that the whole question of u opening up the Karun ' is a delusion and a snare. The Karun, in the first place, cannot be opened up j and in the second place, if it could, it would yield no advantages to British commerce in regard to placing our merchants in Persia more on an equality with those of Russia. What is required in the interests of our trade with Persia is the construction of a good metalled road over the passes, and, if possible, along the entire line to Ispahan. If the Zil-us-Sultan would undertake this work and aid us in establishing a wheeled traffic upon the line, he would have far better earned a title to the G.C.S.I., than by obtaining for us empty right of navigating the unnavigable Karun. Note by Sir O. St. John, dated London, the 26th October 1882. Two such authorities as Sir Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Walter Baring holding such differ ent views as regards the Karun route, I trust I may not be considered presumptuous in diU'er- ing from both. The first point is the use and practicability of opening the Karun river to steam naviga tion from the sea to Shuster by removing or turning the natural dam of rocks at Ahwaz. The most material evidence as to the practicability is contained in the report by Captain Wells, B. E., who visited Ahwaz with Mr. Baring. .From this report, and the carefully detailed drawing attached to it,* I am led to the conclusion, in which it would appear Captain Wells concurs, that both Sir Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Baring over-estimate the difficulty of opening a navigable channel. The total length of the rapids is no more than one mile, and the fall in the length 8 to 10 feet only. Captain Wells considers that it would be easier and cheaper to dig a canal from a point above to a point below the rapids, and he gives the length of such a canal at 2,350 yards, with a maximum depth of 35 feet below the present level of the soil. This does not seem a very formidable undertaking, if the rock, as I understand, be soft sandstone ; and locks of sufficient capacity for small river steamers, say 100 feet by 20 (two would be required), are not expensive works. Moreover, I am not at all satisfied that it would not be easier and cheaper to make a navigable channel in the river itself ; for it seems to me that the assumption, that the removal of so much of the natural weirs of rock as to make navigation possible would materially lower the level of the water above, is rather a hasty one. However, I would suggest that Captain Wells' plan and report be submitted to a competent hydraulic engineer for an opinion and rough estimate of the probable expense of making the present channel navigable for small river steamers, or of digging a new one. This would clear the way for the second point in dispute, which is the feasibility of opening a practicable commercial route between Shuster and Ispahan or Teheran, supposing the Karun opened to navigation as far as the first-named town. Both Sir Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Baring, looking to the establishment of a road for wheeled traffic, consider the direct route over the bills to Ispahan to be impracticable. Mr. Baring advocates one or other of the roads through Khurramabad to Teheran, while Sir Henry Rawlinson considers even these as bad or as long as the present highway from Bushire, through Shiraz, to the improvement of which, so as to fit it for wheeled traffic, he would devote all available energy. Now I venture to d( ubt the use of spending money in making carriage roads in a country like Persia, for which, I think, it can be shown that there is no useful vid media between a light railway and a mule -path. Parts of Spain and the whole west coast of South America are examples in point. Carts were latterly largely used in Southern Afghan istan for military transport; but as regards original outlay, time taken in transport, and proportion of forage and food consumed per ton conveyed, they were less economical than camels. In fact, it was only the absolute impossibility of obtaining camels that necessitated the use of carts. I know the roads from Bushire to Shiraz well, and I should estimate the cost of making a good cart-road by any of them at no less than 1,000^. a mile, or nearly 200,000^. for the whole distance, and even supposing the cart-road made, where are the carts, drivers, bullocks, ♦ These are not included in the file, bub I have been allowed to see them in the Indo-European Telegraph Office by Colonel Champaia.40 or horses to come from ? In India, where cart-roads have been made penetrating a few miles into the mountains, the adjacent plains furnish an inexhaugtible supply of rolling-stock, but, in Persia all would have to be created just as much as that for a railway. The longest mountain cart-road in India is, I believe, that to Simla, 57 miles in length, but even on this camels do as much work as carts. The introduction of wheeled trattic for commercial purposes into Southern Persia would be as purely artificial as that of railwavs. The only use that a metalled road of low gradients from Bushire to Shiraz would be put to would be to serve as foundation for a light railway, which might as well be made at once. Setting aside these roads for wheeled trafHc, the question of opening trade routes from Shuster to the interior takes a different aspect. It is astonishing how simply and inexpen sively the most steep an ! rugged path can be made not only practicable but easy for mules and camels. Mr. Baring compares the road between Shuster and Ispahan to the teeth of a saw. That between Bushire and Shiraz is more like a staircase, though it has a certain amount of steep descents as well as ascents. It is these abrupt declivities that are such formidable obstacles to mule and camel carriage, gentle slopes affect them not at all, or at least infinitesi- mally. Comparing Mr. Baring's and Captain Wells' reports on the Shuster-Ispahan road with my own knowledge of the Bushire-Shiraz road, I find the some of steep abrupt ascents to be 12,000 feet in the one case, and 9,000 feet in the other, as follows Shuster-Ispahan Road.

Memorandum by Me. W. Baring , dated Lisbon, 20th Sepfember 1882. r ^.L ^ en . r ^ ®' ax y^ n son, in bis memorandum of 23rd June last, gives it as bis opinion that tne difficulties which beset the opening up of the Karun river far outweigh the advantages to be gained. He further considers that it would ba infinitely better to urge the Persian Government to construct a waggon road from Bushireto Shiraz, and so on to Isfahan and Tehran; than to attempt to utilize either the Bakhtyari or Luristan routes. No one is more thoroughly qualified than Sir Henry Rawlinson to give an opinion on anything connected with Persia, and no one has more attentively studied the history, geography, and resources of that country. It is, therefore, with much diffidence that I venture even in a very slight degrea to differ from opinions issuing from so great an authority. First, as regards the Karun itself, I freely admit that the difficulties offered by the bund at Ahwaz have been vastly underrated. When I visited the locality I had read Mr. Mackenzie's report, and arrived there with the impression that the obstruction ti&gt; navigation might be removed by a few charges of dynamite. Instead of slight obstructions I found three formidable barriers of rock stretchin'* right across the stream, and which I d«scribe in my report (pige 17), and a fall of about seven feet. I quite agree with Sir Henry Rawlinson that the idea of a canal must be set aside. It would be a costiy undertaking, for which neither the Persian Government nor a private com pany would be likely to find the funds. I see, however, fewer objections to a tramway Its construction would not, I imagine, entail great expense. Starting from a point a. little below the lower island, it would pa?s to the east of the village of Ahwaz, striking the river just above the ' Kale. ;J I do not think the distance would be more than If miles. There are many objections to trans-shipment; it is troublesome, risky, and expensive, but the difficulties attending it do not appear to me to be such as would warrant the entire rejection of the whole Karun navigation scheme. Trans-shipment would, of course, require a double set of vessels, i.e., steamers to convey goods to Ahwaz, and then others to continue the voyage above the ' bund.' It is a question, however, whether for the latter part of the journey tugs and lighters would not be better and cheaper. I entirely agree with Sir Henry Rawlinson as to the impracticability of the Bakhtyari route, and J think I have said enough in my report to prove that, in my opinion, the difficul ties cannot be overcome. , One argument in its favor was that Husfein Kuli Khan, the Eelkhani, had established order in the country, and would protect caravans. I hear, however, now that be has been put to death. Moreover, from what the Eelkhani said to me himself, it was quite clear that though he would protect travellers and caravans, he has no wish to see a good road made through his mountain fastnesses. I now come to the third part of the question, viz., the road from Dizful to Khoramabad, Burujird, etc. I have never travelled over any portion of the country north of Dizful, whereas Sir Henry Rawlinson lias been to Khoramabad by two roads. Neither do I know the road from Shiraz to Bushire, except from the accounts of the numerous travellers who pass that way, so that I cannot draw any comparison between the two. The last European who bas travelled between Khoramabad and Dizful is Mr. Schindler, who wrote a description of his journey in the Journal of the Berlin Geographical Society. In April last I drew up a memorandum, condensing the information supplied by Mr. Schindler, and which was forwarded to Earl Granville by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. Mr. Schiodler gives five routes from Khoramabad to Dizful, to which two may be at once dismissed as impracticable. He says the longest road by Taidar is practicable for artillery, and this information is borne out by what I heard at Dizful. Sir Henry Hawlinson, however, states that the road is not less difficult than the one between Bushire and Shiraz. Mr. Schindler then describes two other roads, one 156 miles in length through the Chimishk Pass to Dehliz, and then by Badamek and Velmian; the other, 133 miles in length, the same as the above as far as Dehliz, and then by Moukhbarabad and Pirinjzarto Kizze. The first route, though longer, appears to bo rather the better of the two. I have spoken with Mr. Schiodler on the subject of communication between Dizful and Khovamabad, and he has assured me most positively that, without any very great expenditure, the roads he travelled over might be put into good order. I quite admit the objectien raised with regard to the Insecurity of the country. The Lur tribes are lawless to a degree, and not in the least anxious te see their country opened up. But have not other parts of Persia been at times notorious for insecurity, and has not the Persian Government been able to render them pretty secure ? It is not so very long ago that robberies were of frequent occurrence between Shiraz and Bushire, and Shiraz and Isfahan; but Ferhad Mirza, when Prince Governor of Pars, by the exercise of unsparing severity, managed to restore order. The country between Behbehan and Shiraz, inhabited by the Kohgelu and Mamasseni tribes, was at one time so unsafe that travelling was well nigh impossible. When [S969FD] L42 I passed through these districts, however, there was comparatively little danger, owing to the strong 1 measures that had bGGn takonby Perhad Mirza and his son, the Ihtishatn-ed-Dowleh, The Zil-us-Sultan, under whose authority Luristan is, is an energetic ruler, and one who is not likely to shrink from the strongest repressive measures, and I cannot but think that he both could and would render the road from Dizful to Khoramabad as safe as many other provinces of Persia. Were a metalled road made from Bushire to Shiraz, I presume it would pass by lirozabad as the gradients on that line are easier. This route has, however, always been very insecure. I am most unwilling to set up my'opinion against that of Sir H. Rawlinson, but I confess I should somewhat regret the complete abandonment of the Karun scheme, as I still cling to the idea that we should derive commercial as well as political advantages, were it thrown open to our ships. I have not unfortunately, yet received from Persia mv maps, notes and certain books of reference, which would be useful to me in treating of this subject, but, as far as I remember the distance from Shuster to Tehran, by way of Dizful, Khoramabad, Burujird, and Katun, is. about 480 miles a gain of 320 miles land carriage on the Bushire route. My theory is that we could place our goods in the Tehran market by the Karun route at a cheaper rate than it is possible for us to do now, and that we should also open up for our trade provinces in which we, at. present, cannot compete with Russia. Ispahan would, I fear&gt; suffer, and this, no doubt, is a matter for consideration, as the market is an important one. There is one objection to the scheme, of which I was not aware when I wrote my report in January last. Enclosure No. 5 in Colonel Ross* despatch to the Government of India of 12th January last, contains Messrs. Gray, Paul's views as to what terms thpy would require to make it worth their while to run steamers on the Karun. They demand exclusive rights of navigation for 50 years. Now, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, in bringing the question before the Shah's Govprnrnent, has always pointed to the fact that we were not seeking far a monopoly. We opposed Dr. Tholozan's scheme, which was a monopoly of the most complete description, on the grounds that it was an infringement of Baron Reutpr's concession. Could we now apply for the exclusive rights without which Messrs. Gray, Paul declare they could not entertain the project ? What is necessary for our interests is that, were the Karun opened to all comers, we should bo the first in the field. If British merchants in the Gulf held back ; thf-ir place would probably soon betaken by the French, w &gt;0 have shown considerable signs of wishing to gain a footing in Southern Persia, and who, once established, could not easily be dislodged. Whether the Karun scheme be dropped or nfit, there is another route from the Persian Gulf which I think is worthy of attention. I allude to the on« from Bushire to Ispahan by way to Dillom, Behbehan, and Komeshah. The country between the two latter places hag never been travelled over by a European, and it would be interesting were it properly surveyed by a competent person. ^ Native^ assert that the road is not difficult, and I fancy there can be no obstacles between Bushire and Behbehan, except perhaps streams which would have to he bridged. A bridge would have to be made over the Terahi before the route could be used for wheeled traffic. No. 18 (Commercial), dated Tehran, 26th December 1882. From—His Excellency Ronald F. Thomson , Her Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To— Earl Granville, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In my dpspaeh No. 180 of the 3rd of December 1S81, I had the honor to inform Your Lordship that the Persian Government had commissioned the Najm-ul-Mulk, an eno-Ineer of some reputation, to draw up a report upon the advantages of opening the navio-ation of the Karun and of re-constructing the dam at Ahwaz. I have now the honor to'enclose a # Report. translated summary of the report* presented to the Zil-us-Sultan by the official in question. Your Lordship's despatch No. 91 of the 13th October contains, amongst other papers, a copy of a memorandum drawn up by Sir H, Rawlinson, in which objections are raised to the project for opening the navigation on the Karun on two grounds : 1st —That goods would have to be trans-shipped at the Ahwaz dam. That the direct line across the mouutaine from Shuster to Isfaham cannot be made a commercial road. S'r H. Rrannsnn for two reiisms is meUnedt' prefer ihe Bushire-Shim route in spite of the notoriously bad and m some places dangerous ' passes ' it traverses. WUi re ? ara to the trans-shipment of goods at the Ahwaz dam, I gather from various sources that, in the present condition of trade, the disadvantage of trans-shipment is not so great as seriously to hamper commercial transactions, more especially if, as is suggested in43 Mr. Baring's report, also inclosed in Your Lordship's despatch No. 91, a tramway should be constructed between the points where the goods would be disembarked and re-sbipped. 'With regard to the 2nd objection, although I have not visited the country myself, I learn on the best authority that the road from Sbuster to Tehran via Dizful, Khoramabad, Burujird and Kaum, which is even now practicable for artillery, would enable goods to be conveyed to the capital with a considerable saving of time as compared to the present route via bushire and Shiraz. In my despatch No. 73 of the 18th April last, I transmitted to Your Lordship a summary of a report addressed to the Berlin Geographical Society by Mr. Schindler, who had recently traversed the country between Shuster ani Burujird. That gentleman is of opinion that, with a small expenditure of money, most of the difficulties connected with the road in question might be removed. His Royal Highness the Zil-us-Sultan, in whose Government the district is situated, is also of opinion that the road might be made available for wheeling traffic without any excessive expenditure and with far greater ease than the Busbire-Shiraz route. As to the insecurity of the cnuDtry on which some stress is laid by Sir H. Rawlinson, I venture to remind Your Lordship that at some time or other most of the Persian roads have been insecure, but that as soon as the Government was interested in opening them for traffic it foUnd means to control the tribes who infested therm There is no reason to suppose that the Shuster-Burujird road would constitute an exception to the rule. Besides the road to Tehran from Shuster via Burujird, there is a route from the Karun to Ispahan by Behbehan and Komesbah, which I am informed by the Zil-us-Sultan traverses a good caravan road which is secure and available for traffic in all weathers. I may add that the opening of the navigation of the Karun and the arrangement of new routes between that river and the commercial centres of Ispahan and Tehran by no means implies the closing of the present route via Bushire and Shiraz, which will still be available for those who prefer it. No. 43, dated Tehran, the 7th April 1883. ^rom—Ronald F. Thomson , Esq., Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's despatch No. 8 of the fth January last, enclosing c pies of memoranda by Sir H. Kawlinson, Mr. W. Baring and SirO. St. John on the subject of the opening of the Karun rivf-r to steam navigation, and instructing me to report on the various schemes advocated in these papers. In my despatch No. 18, Commercial, of the 26th of December last, I offered some remarks on Sir H. Rawlinson's objections to the Karun project. It appears to me that, if the road from Shuster to the interior can le made pratticabb', the 'bund' at Ahwaz is not a difficulty which should prevent us from using the Karun as a route for our trade with the central and northern provinces of Persia. It certainly renders the continuous navigation of the river impossible, and I admit also that there is no prospect at present of this difficulty being removed by the construction of a canal and locks by which the dam and rapids could be avoided. Goods would have consequently to be discharged at the bund and re-shipped above the rapids for conveyance to Shuster. But the delay and expense, and the injury to goods which would be involved in their trans-shipment and conveyance over this mile of level road whether the transport is effected by wagons or tramway, or simply with beasts of burden, would be alto gether insignificant when compared with that to which they are exposed in crossing the difficult and'dangerous passes that have to be traversed between Bushire and Shiraz. The value of the Karun as a highway for commerce depends on whether a practicable road can be found from Shuster to the interior. There are at present two routes : one through the Bakhtyari country to Ispahan, and the other by Khoramabad to Burujird. The former of these is about 160 miles shorter than the road to Ispahan from Busbire by way of Shiraz, but from all accounts it is only capable of being used as a mule-path, and could not by any effort, which the Persian Government could be induced to make, be converted into a wagon road, it is doubtful, moreover, if it could be used by caravans throughout the winter. The other route from the Karun by Dizful and Khoramabad to Burujird is described by Sir H Rawlinson as impracticable for caravans. It appears, however, that there are five roads leadino- over that portion of the route situated between Dizful and Khoramabad, and Sir H. Rawlinson 's description refers probably to the most difficult of these for Mr Schindler, who travelled several times through that part of the country m 1877 and 187H, states that one road is now practicable for artillery, and that another could with a small expenditure be put m a good practicable condition. rrvp f rom Kzful to Khoraraabad is about 130 miles, and thence to Burujird about SO From Burujird to Tehran byway of Kaum, the distance is about 2^0 miles, the road being good all the way. Mr. Schindler is a careful and eiper.euced_ observer, and assuming his statement to be correct in respect to the ease with which the passes on the DiztulKhoramabad section of the road could be made practicable, it appears to me that the whole line from Dizful to Tehran might be rendered fit for wheeled traffic at a cost which the Persian Government would, possibly, not object to incur. The distance to Tehran by this route would be about 400 miles, or a little over half the distance that it is by the present caravan road from Bushire to Tehran by Shiraz aod Ispahan. By the direct road from Shustcr to Isfahan, a saving 160 miles would be effected on the whole distance to Tehran, but 360 miles would be saved by following the Khoramabad Burujird road. The trade of Ispahan would to some extent be benefited by the adoption of the former route, as it would be 100 miles shorter than the road from Bushire, to that place by Shiraz, and 80 miles shorter than by Khoramabad and Burujird, but it seems that nothing better than a mule-track could be made by any route through the Bakhtyari mountains, and, in my opinion, no road can be considered satisfactory, even for mule traffic, unless mule litters, on which all heavy packages have to be conveyed, can, with ease, be transported over ifc. Supposing, however, that a good mule-road were established between Shuster and Ispahan, it could only serve our purpose for a few years, and would not be of any advantage in enabling us to compete successfully in trade with Russia when the construction of a wagon road or a railway from the Caspian to Tehran shall have afforded additional facilities for the prosecu tion of her trade in the north of Persia. Russia has of late years, owing to the development of steam communication on the Volo«a and Caspian, and the constiuction of a railway in the Trans-Caucasian provinces, made great progress in respect to her commercial relations with this country. We, too, in the Persian Gulf, have greatly increased our trade with the southern ports o'f Persia ; but the distance which separate us from the central and important markets of the country and the difficulties we have to encounter in traversing formidable mountain ranges in the southern provinces are against us, and m favor of Russian commerce. The distance from the nearest part on the Cisspian, Meshedi Ser, to Tehran, is only 130 miles. That from the port of Anzali bv Kasvin which is the road generally followed by caravans and travellers, is 300 miles. The latter is now practicable for wheeled traffic from Tehran to Kasvin about 100 miles, and it is in contemplation to complete the remaining portion, which is the only difficult part of the road notnmg has yet been finally settled as to commencing the work. ' Since the arrangement was made with Baron Renter in 1872, the Persian Government has granted several concessions to Europeans for the construction of a line of railwav frVm Resht to Tehran.

A heavy outlay, however, such as that which would be necessary for carrying out the works suggested in the memoranda above mentioned, would, under present circumstances, be alto gether out of the question. The road from Tehran to Kasvin, which has lately been made practical for carts, has cost the Persian Government nearly £30,000. The country is level all the way, and the work has simply consisted in bridging over water courses, smoothing inequa lities, digging trenches on either side of the road, and erecting post houses 15 miles apart from each other. It is believed that this road only cost in reality about £12,000, and that the balance was misappropriated by the officials employed in its construction. The estimated cost of continuing the road from Kasvin to Resht is £60,000. The completion of this line has been talked of for the last four years, but the question as to where the money is to come from has not yet been solved. One object is to find the easiest and cheapest route for sending our merchandise from the Persian Gulf to the Central markets of Persia, and a metalled road is, I believe, not at present obtainable. W hat we should now look for, therefore, is a road (the shortest if possible), which can be made with ease and at a small outlay, a fairly good caravan road, fit for the passage of mules, camels and mule litters, and which is capable of being hereafter gradually converted into a wagon road over which caravans and carts may both pass. The Julfa-Tehran road through Tabriz some years ago was not in better condition, or so good, as that now existing between Tehran and Shiraz; the worst parts of it have, however, from time to time, been repaired and improved, and it is now a good caravan route over which carts and fourgons frequently pass with merchandise from the Russian territory on the Aral to Tehran. The following are the principal roads from Tehran to the south which are, or might be made, available as caravan routes from the Persian Gulf Tehran. Milea.

The road from Dillom in the Persian Gulf to Tehran is shorter than the above by about 160 miles. This is said to be good and mostly level from the coast to Behbehan, and from Komeshah to the capital, there is nothing' to prevent wheeltd traffic being established at a small cost. The portion between Behbehan and Kompshah is not yet accurately known. Mr. Baring made enquiry respecting it when he was in Fars, and was informed that it offered no real difficulty. One of the Kashkai Chiefs from that part of the country lately described it to me as being extremely difficult, if not altogether impracticable, but on questioning him as to other roads with which we were both acquainted, I found that most of his statements were greatly exaggerated. The shortest route, in respect to land carriage from the Gulf to Tehran, is that by way of Dizful-Khoramabad and Kaum, the distance being only 400 miles. I would suggest that the routes from Dillom to Tehran and from Dizful to Khoramabad and Kaum should be surveyed by some competent person. Captain Wells, who is employed in the Telegraph Department here and frequently travels from Tehran to Bushire, might perhaps undertake this work, or a practical road engineer might be sent for the purpose. These routes should, I think, be examined not with a view to an expensively constructed carriage road being made, but with the object simply of discovering a line of country through which an ordinary caravan road for mules and litters might be established, which could at a small expense be hereaiter made fit for the passage of carts. The Persian Government might then be induced, as the traffic increased to improve and repair the difficult parts, and it might thus before long become, like the road from Tabriz to Tehran, practicable for wheeled traffic as well as mules. The adaptability of the routes in question for the construction of a line of railway might also at the same time be reported upon. The question of the possible insecurity of such roads is one to which I do not attach any great importance, Trade will give security to any roud in this country, and the less traffic there is, the greater will be insecurity. In the province of Azerbaijan even, as elsewhere in Persia, the high roads become dangerous whenever a weak Governor is in office. The Persian Government should be held responsible for the safety of any route which is frequented by caravans conveying merchandise, and if this were done there would be no difficulty in securing the adoptioc by them of effectual measures for the suppression of brigandage.47 Appendix IV. Heport hy Captain Wells. Comparison o£ routes from Ispahan to the Sea. The ordinary route from Ispahan to the sea now followed by kafilas is via Shiraz to Bushiije. Along this route caravanserais are built at convenient distances, and supplies are forthcoming. From Ispahan to Shiraz there is little or no engineerino* difficulty, and with a small (com paratively) expenditure of capital a good carriage road could be made. Distance from Ispahan to Shiraz 323 miles. Beyond Shiraz the road is in places execrable and scarcely passable for laden mules, but is capable of vast improvements and a carriage road could follow its general direction. The distance from Shiraz to Bushire is 196 miles. Along the Bakhtyari route via Ardall and Malimir, there are no caravanserais of any sort, no bridges over several of tha rivers, and in winter, when the nomad population moves bodily to the Shuster plains, there would be no supplies. However, supposing the Karun river were opened for navigation to Shuster, and the necessary canal dug out at Ahwaz, goods could be unshipped within 275 miles ol : Ispahan, that is, 244 miles nearer than via Bushire, for Bushire to Ispahan is 519 miles, still the difficulties to be met within these 275 miles are very great. It has been suggested that a light railway might run over them, but this is in my opinion out of the question, as the cost of the under taking would be enormous. The valley of the Karun and its tributaries having such precipi tous sides that it would often be necessary to carry the road in galleries cut in the hill sides for miles, the bridging too would be tremendous, and if the line were carried out at right angles to the series ol ridges that lie between tha plateau of Chahar Mahal and Malimir, the line would be little better than an alternation of tunnels and viaducts. I think the railway engineer would prefer to take his line from Shuster via Hehbehan to the Ardakhan valley j he would find no stupendous obstacles this way, and would have warmed himself to the roof of Central Persia, without crossing one of the dd^es that jjuard it. He would tap, too, its most fertile plains and include Shiraz. The 7,2^0 feet Kotul that lies between Ardakhan and Shiraz has no difficulties or gradients that a ' FairlieV engine, such as is used between Poti and Tiflis, would not negotiate. Or I should recommend the trial of the valley of the Shahpur river from Bushire to Nodun, where a tunnel would lead through to the river Shur of Fabalynn, which runs from Ardakhan. But to return to roads. The difficulties of the Bakhtyari route are considered so great at Dizful that all kafilas for Ispahan go via Burujird, and it might be best to take them from Shuster via Dizful and Burujird to Ispahan, though the distance this way must be at least 350 miles from Shuster, probably 380. Unfoitunately I have not seen this route, so cannot speak of its merits ; however, water is said to be plentiful and the road not bad. Certainly this is the case from Burujird to Ispahan. The difficulties of the Shiraz-Bushire road are all within a distance of 93 miles^ m., from Daliki to the Karagatch river. Those of the Bakhtyari route are within the distance o' 117 miles from the plain of Malimir to the borders oE Chahar Mahal. 1. The Shiraz road is certainly Tillainous from Daliki to the Cona Takta plain, a distance of 11 miles. 2. Again, the Kamaridge Kotul is abominable^ 6 miles. 3. To avoid the Karagatch, heavy work would be required for 4 miles. 4. To avoid the Kotul Dukhter and curve, a road out of the hill-side to the south of it, 5 miles. 5. To turn the Kotul Pirizan and make a carriage road to Dasht-i-Arjan, 12 miles. To turn the Sena Safid Kotui, 6 miles. Total 44 miles. These 4.4 miles allow for gradients and comprise all the heavy works. I think the five miles for the Kotul Dukhter might be saved by entering the Dust-i-Bar from the Shahpw valley, but of this I am not positive. The Bakhtyari route is, in my opinion, out of the question for wheel traffic.48- But suppose it were tried, caravanserais built, and tKe Karun bridged, we should have— From the Malimir plain, to the Karun river. Heavy work for 15 miles. From the river to Dehdez ... ... „ » » Dehdez to Rudbar river «•» ... » „ 12 „ Rudbar to Hellisat ••• ••• )J 11 15 „ Hillisat to Dopulan ... ... » « 19 « Dopulan to Ardall ... ... „ „ 7 „ Ardall to Chahar Mahal plateau ... &gt;, » 20 „ at least. Total ... 98i miles. It would be necessary to add at least 25 per cent, to these, the bare distances from point to point, in order to allow for descent gradients, so that we have 98 , 5 + ^-, or 103'1 miles of difficult hill road-making. t And this would add 24*6 miles to the distance from Ispahan to Shuster. That I am not allowiag too much for the length required to obtain a descent gradient, I think will be allowed when the table of comparative altitudes belpw is seen. From the river to Dehdez the present track is too steep for wheels. From Dehdez, which has an altitude of 5,221 feet, the road rises to an altitude of 6,400 feet in 4 miles— Descending to the Rudbar stream in 6 miles to altitude 8 ,080 Ascending above Hillisat to altitudes ... 6,900 And descending to Hillisat to altitude ... 4,850 in 4 miles. From Hillisat it has to rise over altitude 7,850, to descend to Dopulan, altitude 4,950. Here, at Dopulan, 1,000 feet gorge has to be managed, and the road carried thence over the ravine cut plateau of Ardall through mountain Chokahor, and thence down into Chahar Mahal, altitude 6,700. Mackenzie crossed from Ardall via Chokahor, and made the altitude pf pass 8,350 feet. To follow tne Karun would be twiee as long and just as difficult. These altitudes are relatively, though not absolutely, correct.51 CHAPTEfi IV. Opening of the Karun to the Navigation to the Commerce of all nations, 1888-89, 133. la the year 18S7 there were in the air two schemes for facilitating Secret e ., june lass. Nos. 48 to so. commercial intercourse between the (Nos. 48 to 52). Persian Gulf and Teheran. One was a Bailway from Mohammerah to Teheran. The Company, which was to undertake this project, was to have the security of half of the surplus over the then existing customs of Mohammerah, Bushire and Shuster, but the Company could not interfere in the administration of the Railway. The Persian Govern ment undertook to open Karun to navigation themselves, and to run their own steamers. The Railway concession as it stood did not meet with the views of the British Legation and Her Majesty's Government could not see their way to give any guarantee. 134). The other scheme was to give the monopoly of trade on the Karun to Secret e., june 1888, nos. 48-80. a Persian Syndicate headed by one Malik- (Nos. 53-72). et-Tuj jar, a Persian bom in British India and an adventurer, whose loyalty to the British cause could not be always trusted. The scheme was strongly backed by Amin-es-Sultan, who was at the helm of the Persian administration at this time. If ever the covetted con cession was granted to this Syndicate, it was of utmost importance that British capitalists should have a large share in it, with a view to secure the British interests on the Karun. An exclusively Persian monopoly, it was feared, would be worked prejudicially to British commercial interests. Sir A. Nicolson therefore instructed Colonel Ross to sound Malik, and it was found that the latter welcomed the proposal of an Anglo-Persian Syndicate. 135. Meanwhile Mr. G. C. Mackenzie (of Gray, Paul &amp; Co.) wrote to the Foreign Office urging the importance of ihd no. 72. supporting any inclination on the part of the Persian Government to open up the navigation of the Persian Government by any means, even that of a Persian company, if such could be established, as he was confident that anything to effect this end, however small, must produce results of the very greatest importance to England. 136. There arrived at this stage Sir H Drummond Wolff, as Her Majesty's Secret e ., January isso, Nos, 45-90. Minister at Teheran, whose diplomacy, (No. 68.) after much clever manoeuvering, secured for us the virtual monopoly of the Karun trade—though in the shape of its opening to the commerce of the world. The difficulties our Minister had to face were manifold and of a serious nature. The first important move made was a note dated 18th September 1888 addressed by him to the Persian Gov- ernment, in which he referred to the repeated promises made by the Shah to open the Karun to the trade of the world and to improve the communications between the Persian Gulf and Northern Persia, and pointed out that, as it was, Persia was closed to the commerce of the world, that the northern routes passed throuo-h other states and that the traffic passing through them was subject to other than Persian legislation. It was also made clear to the Shah s Govern ment that the British did not seek any exclusive privileges to themselves, but that as allies and friends of Persia, whose integrity and independence Her Majesty's Government had guaranteed, they were entitled to give their advice on the subject. He concluded ^ 4 Her Majesty's Government therefore, as the friends and allies of Persia, have instructed me to enquire when they may expect that the assurances and promises given may be carried into effect, and they trust that the official answer they receive may be in full accordance with those feelings of friendship and cordial understanding between the two coun tries, which it is the desire of Her Majesty's Government to consolidate and maintain.' 137 This note was delivered into the hands of Amin-es-Sultan by Mr. S. Churchill. It was found that the Hid Nos. 69—76. W as favourably disposed towards the proposal to open the navigation of the Karun River to the commerce of52 the world. But the one great obstacle was the Shah's dread of Russia's wrath to come. It appeared that the Shah had given a pledge to the Czar that he would never decide to give concessions or permissions to construct railways, roads and waterways to associations of foreign nations before consulting Uis Majesty the Emperor. It was argued by the British legation that what was sought was not a concession to any company of a foreign nation, nor an ex clusive monopoly to any particular foreign nation, but opening a water high way already in existence to the commerce of the world. 138. Another difficulty was the fear of the Persian Government that Foreign Governments would erect forts on ti e river side, or make use of the river for military purposes. As to this, it was pointed that it was in the hands of the Persian Government to make strict regulations against erection of forts, im portation of arms, or any other use of the navigation for warlike or military purposes. 139. Ultimately the Shah consented to comply with the British Govern ment's request on the following condi- J5idNo - 77 - tions (1) the present of two steamers ; (2) the assurance by Her Majesty's Government of some sort of pro tection against Russia in case the opening of the Karun should be resented by that Power. With both these requests Her Majesty's Government promised compliance. Further the Shah's Goverament was authorized to show to the Russian Govern ment the note of the British Ambassador dated 18th September 1888, in justi fication of the action taken. 140. The following notes, for an arrangement, as derived from conversa tions with Amin-es-Sultan and condensed by His Excellency in Persian for sub mission to the Shah, dated the 1st October 1888, show what were the terms of the preliminary understanding :— i Notes for an arrangement, as derived from conversations with the Amin-es-Sultan and condensed hy Hit Excellency in Persian for submission to the Shah, dated 1st October 1S88. ! • The Shah undertakes by the 1st December next to publish a proclamation opening for twenty-five years the navigation of the Karun as far as Ahwaz to all foreig-n mercantile vessels whether sailing vessels or otherwise. A toll of per ton shall be paid by each veseel on entering the river in addition to import dutins as at present exisiiug and to export duties on leaving. The Persian Government further agree to construct a tramway across th^ bar at Ahwaz and they reserve to themselves the right of navigation between that place and Shuster. The above undertakings and reservation to be included in the proclamation which shall be published and circulated to the Foreign Legations at Tehran. The Persian Government further undertake to preserve order on the road between Dizful and Khoramabad and within three years to construct a carriage road from Shuster to Kum. Her Majesty's Government will present His Majesty the Shah with two steamers suitable for the navigation above Ahwaz, and the tolls between Ahwaz and Shunter and the tariff for the conveyance of goods, after being privately settled between the two Governments, shall be published by the Persian Government in a subsequent proclamation. As soon as the first proclamation is published the following assurance given by Her Majesty's Government will come into force. A fixed period of 25 years as the term for the opening was insisted upon, in order not to give an occasion to the Persian Government to withdraw the grant no sooner than given, which they would find in case no fixed period were mentioned. 141. A draft proclamation was prepared by the British Minister at the jud Nos. 82-83. request of the Shah to the following effect:—63 Draft Proclamation. His Majesty tlie Shah, in the fulness o£ his wisdom and in bis desire to promote the welfare of his people, a 5 ; well as their trade and commerce with foreign nations, proclaims that the navigation of the Karnn as far as Ahwaz is open to all mercantile etearaers and sailing vessels belonging to nations in amity with Persia for 25 years, and longer, provided His Majesty at the end of the foregoing term does not order it otherwise. All sailing vessels above 70 tons burden and all steam vessels shall on entering the Karun pay to the Persian Custom-house a toll of ° kransper ton, exclusive of the ordinary duties of import and export, and. others heretofore paid. The Persian Government takes on itself to provide for the conveyance of goods by tramway across the bar at Ahwaz and. thpnce by river or road to Shuster. The Persian Government also will provide for the safety and reparation of the roads from Shuster towards Teheran, This proclamation shall be published throughout the country and notified to the Foreign Missions at Teheran. Draft assurances which the Amin-es-Sultan says would meet with Shah's approval. In the event of the Russian Government taking pretexts to annoy or adt in an nnfriendly manner towards Persia, or attempting to interfere with Persian rights or to take possession of Persian territory, Her Majesty's Government will take strong measures to make the Russians desist from such acts. 142. Tlie opening of the Karun river to the commerce of the world was „ , „ „ , 1onD „ conceded in October 1888, and the news Secret E., I n ovember 1888, No. 58. . , i t i tt h i * j. j h/t- • was telegraphed by Her Majesty s Minis ter to Simla on 25tli October ' I have received note from Minister for Foreign Affairs to the following effect ' Persian Government accepts request of Her Majesty's Government to open Karun to universal commerce of the world ,* reserves right latent to regulations (later to regulate ?) and levy tolls. Meanwhile an order has been issued to Governor of Arabistan to allow passage of commercial steamers and sailing vessels of friendly powers to Ahwaz. Above dam navigation reserved to Persian Governmen':. A tramway will be made across dam by Persian Government. Concur (Kunknr ?) road for wheeled carriages will be completed within three or four years from Dizful to Ispahan or Kum.' Shah does not wish anything to appear in the newspapers till publication of an article about to appear in Persian Gazette, and I have assured His Majesty that nothing shall transpire to connect this act with Her Majesty's Government or myself. I have suggested to Secretary of State that some arrangement should be made at once with Lynch to establish a service with his spare steamer so as to establish right. , ' 143. The Eegulations promised were published in the Persian Gazette Gulf Administration Report for 1838-89. soon after and are printed below ^Regulations for the Navigation of the River Karun. The Persian Government, in order to facilitate commerce, increase the wealth of the country and render her lands profitable, has opened the River Karun, subject to the following regulations, and has allowed the navigation from Mohammerah to Ahwaz by the mercantile marine of all nations. The vessels navigating the Karun will carry out the regulations of the Government, which regulations shall hold good for ten years without fail, after which they will be modified according to the exigencies of circumstances. 1. The commercial steamers of merchants of friendly Governments must not remain at the landing -places or in the river longer than necessa-y for the purpose of landing, unloading and provisioning themselves for the journey. 2. Persons whose presence is detrimental to order, and who would cause difficulties by their presence, should not be taken on board the vessels; whoever comes should be provided with a passport, from his own Government ; otherwise, if any one arrives without a passport, it is impossible to understand what his business may be. 3. Under no pretext whatsoever will any vessel have the right to protect any Persian subject in any way. 4. The transport of arms is absolutely prohibited, and if this rule is disregarded, the armg will be seized. 5. No explosive goods whatsoever shall be transported. [S969FD] 054 6. Ship -owne 's shall not erect any buildinsr whatsoever, such as coal depots, warehouses, shops, caravan-serais or manufactories; etc., on the banks of the river. 7. For the storage of merchandise and coal depots and warehouses, as well as landing* places in sufficient quantity will be constructed on the part of the Persian Government or Per* eian merchants. 8. Ordinary reasonable rates to be paid by the shipowners will be fixed for the hire of the depots and warehouse^. 9. The store-keepers of the coal stores shall be Persian subjects. 10. The ships shall not proceed higher than Ahwaz. 11. For the merchandise depots a trustworthy man shall be chosen in Persia, and another shall be chosen on the part cf the whole of the ship-owners: together, they shall look after the dep6ts. 12. The watchmen of the depots, such as guards, etc., shall all be appointed by the Per sian Government. 13. No one belonging to any vessel has any right whatsoever to buy, sell or mortgage, etc., any property from or to any Persian subject. • 14. From the vessels navigating the Karun to Ahwaz, forgoing and returning, if a steam vesstfl, a tonnage of one kranper ton, and, if u sailing vessel, ten shahis, as toll and rig^ht oJ way will be levied. Unladen vessels shall pay half toll; sailing vessels belonging to Persian subjects under 30 tons will be exempted from these dues. 15. Porters for the porterage from the landing-places to the vessels, and from the vessels to the landing-places, shall be provide! by the Persian Government, who will keep a register of them and supply them with a badge. 16. When a Persian subject who, with the permission of the Persian Government, has entered the service of the vessels renders himself liable to the law, his trial and punishment shall be conducted by the Persian representative without any interference. 17. W ith reference to the flags of the vessels, they will be regulated by the general mari time laws on the subject. IS. Employes of the vessels are prohibited from lending Persians generally any sums of money in excess of two tomans, trading being excepted. 19. No friendly Government has any right whatsoever to interfere with the depth, course or bed of the river. 20. The number, names and employment of p&gt;rsons who, with the permission of the Government, are employed on the vessels of friendly Governments shall be entered ia the Government books, and should have a Persian passport; otherwi-e they are not allowed to take service. 21. As this permission to the mercantile marines of friendly Governments to navigate the Karun is solely for the purposes of facilitating and stimulating trade and nothing else this will, by no means, be allowed to be made a pretext for political discussions of any sort. ' 22. The regulations obtaining regarding wrecks on shores generally shall govern such cases, and the salvage shall be paid to the natives of the shore. 23. Dangerons goods, such as arms etc., S h»U not be sold by employe's of vessels to Persian subjects, nomads or tribes; if sold, they will be seized and tl.eir value returned. 24. Should any one vesse: of a friendly p &gt;wer violate these regulations, if a steamer 600 tomans, and if a sailing vessel, 300 tomans aoe will be inflicted, and tho vessel shall b'e pro- hibited trom the navigation for two years. ^ Addendum.—In case of disputes the Persian text to be gone by. 144.

As it was doubtful whether, the river being at its lowest at the time, the 4rab could reach Ahwaz, the filosse Lynch belonging to Messrs. Lynch Brothers of the Eup irates and Tigris Steam -Navigation Company drawing only 3 feet of water was got ready and despatched in three days. ' 143 The chief of Mohammerah having received no orders yet to allow foreign steamers pass up the river Karun, it was arranged in order to avoid un! pleasant consequences to the Sheikh, that the steamers should pass Moham. merah at night and that their Captains should report having done so to t^e Governor-General of Arabistan, Nizam-es-Sultaneh.146.

Prom the description given in Curzon's 'Persia' it appears that it served no other purpose than taking ls T izam-es-Sultaneh up and down the river, as her draught of water was too great to allow of her being used as a cargo boat, except when the water was high. She was piloted and steered by Arabs, under the guidance of an Engineer, a Turk from Baghdad, quite new to the river. 147. The Blosse Lynch was found to be too long for abrupt bends and Curzcm 'i 'Persia' Volume IT, page 334. of the KarUtl and of too deep a draught to passover shoals m low water. She was therefore after running for some months replaced by the Shushan, a smaller stern wheel boat, with three rudders. The Shushan was subsequent ly taken up the Upper Karun, as one of the gift steamers to the Shah. The Blosse Lynch was again placed in the lower Karun, but in 1891 made room for a now paddle wheel steamer, the S. S, Malamir, of the same general design as, but slightly smaller than, the steamers on the Tigris. This steamer was better suited for the navigation of the Karun and attracted soon a larger passenger and goods traffic. 148.

T7 . . r , ^ , Karun river, was the present of two steamers for service on the upper Karun from Ahwaz to Shuster. Sir Drummond Wolff thought that they might be turned to great advantage, by building them so as to be easily armed by arms to be kept at Bushire and by using them in case of necessity. He submitted at the same time an extract from Colonel Bell's military report on the south-west of Persia:— ' The city of Shustsr, situated on the Karun River, about 25 miles above Ahwaz, occupies a site important both politically and commercially; politically on account of its natural mili tary strength, its geographical position with regard to the tribes of Arabs occupying the coast plains to the foot of the hills and the Niyal tribes of Lurs, Bakhtiaris, Kashgai, Kubgelu, &amp;c., occupying the mountainous country extending to the line Burujird-Ispahan, all more or less disaffected towards their Persian masters ; the pressure which the possibility of its occupation by troops could not fail to bring on the Teheran Court, and the paramount influence which would follow on the establishment of firm relations there. Commercially, the town is important as the natural emporium of the trade by the Karun route.' 149. In November 1888 Her Majesty's Government proposed to offer to the Shah two steam tugs for service above Seeret E, November 1888, Nos. 183-181. AhwaZj the cos t of which Was estimated at 10,000 pounds sterling each. Messrs. Lynch Brothers undertook to pay half the cost if the British Government paid the other half. The Government of India was asked if they would contribute £ 5,000. It was thought that commercially India had no interest in the Karun River navigation, but that political considerations justified the expenditure. The Government accordingly accepted the charge. Asa matter of fact only one vessel was offered ultimately, which the Shah took rather a* long time to accept (see Chapter Y, paragraphs 167, 168). 150. In behalf of the Persian Foreign Office, a Persian Agent (Karguzar) was appointed to reside at Mohammerah for the purpose of enforcing the regulations. An official was also posted at Ahwaz to perform similar functions under the Amin-es-Sultan's Department. How the Karguzar at Mohammerah used or rather abused his functions we shall see in the next chapter. 151. In connection with the opening of the Karun, it was considered use ful to examine the Balimishir river, which formed the old channel of the Karun, and in December the Residency Steamer Lawrence ascended the Bahmishir for about 20 miles. Subsequently, Captain Butterworth descended from Mohammerah to the sea by the Bahmishir in a launch and took soundings. This river was then navigable for some 30 miles from its mouth by ocean steamers of light draught; but the channel leading to the mouth was found tortuous, and there was a shallow sand-bank to be crossed to reach it#m fv y J 56 152. The years 1891 and 1893 were fruitful in the opening of several lines of communications, which were calculated to help the traffic on the Karun. 153. A line of telegraph was completed in August 1891 from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, Dizful and Sbuster. A Persian Post Office was opened at Mohammerah in Pebruary 1892, and a British Post Office was also opened in the consulate there in July 1892. A fortnightly postal service was soon after organized between Mohammerah, Shuster and Dizful. And further an inter change of mails was arranged between the Persian Post Office at Mohammerah and the Turkish Post Office at Basrah. It was, however, reported in 1894, that the postal arrangement between Mohammerah and Shuster collapsed owing to want of funds for payment of the service, and that the Post Office at Moham merah was closed.67 CHAPTER V. The obstacles in the way of British enterprise on Karun Uiver. 154. The main difficulties the Lynch Company had to contend with arose from the working of the Karun River Navigation Regulations quoted above (paragraph 143). They had been conceived in no generous spirit, and were enforced by the local officers with a rigour, that gives colour to the suspicion that the Persians wished that the British navigators should gain as little as possible out of the grant. The Persian authorities had therefore recourse to a series of obstructive tactics and evasions, which frequently drove the only British Company that undertook the enterprise almost to despair and which only their untiring energy and patience have enabled them to bear. 154-A. This obstructive policy must be attributed to the suspicion the Persians have always been labouring under against foreigners (especially the British and Bussians), of their having in view making political capital out of their commercial enterprises. There was also at this time a great boom for commercial enterprises among the Persians, and the air was full of schemes of Persian Companies for working steamship, roid, tramway and railway projects. The Persians were anxious to allow no foreigners a share in these projects and were extremely jealous of foreign enterprises within their country. This anti-foreign feeling probably accounts for the following proclamation that ^_ .« • • i, i* u . -.oooon was issued in the Persian Gazette about the Gulf Ad ministration iiGporfcSj 1888'o9« .« .. j i i tt ' nr^ • t same time that the Karun Biver Begula- tions were promulgated:— ' Forasmuch as Almighty God has endowed our blessed nature with the attributes of justice and benignity and ordained us the manifestor of his ordinances and power, and has especially c^mmitt^d to our all-surticient guardianship the lives and property of the subjects of the devinely-guarded Empire of Iran ; ingratitude for this great gift, we consider it incumbent on us, discharge of the duties it imposes on us, to relax nothing in ensuring to the people of this kingdom, the enjoyment of their right and the preservation of their lives and property from molestation of oppressors, and to spare no efforts to the end that the people, secure their persons and property shall, in perfect ease and tranquillity, employ themselves in affairs conducive to the spread of civilization and stability.' Therefore, for the information and re-assurance of all the subjects and people of this kingdom generally, we do proclaim that all our subjects are free and independent as regards their persons and property; it is our will and pleasure that they should, without fear or doubt employ their capital in whatever manner they please, and engage in any enterprises, such as combination of funds, formation of companies for the construction of factories and roads, or in any measure for the promotion of civilization and security. The care of this is taken on ourselves ; and no one has the right or power to intefere with, or lay hands on the property of Persian subjects, nor to molest their persons or property, nor to punish Persian subjects except in giving effect to decrees of the civil or religious law. u Month of Ramazan 1305 A. H. 155. We shall now detail the various obstacles the British enterprise had to contend with on the Karun river. (i) Erection of warehouses and business premises on the banks of the river. 156. The Regulations provide— (6) Shipowners shall not erect any buildings whatsoever, such as coal depots, warehouses, shops, caravanserais, or manufactories, etc., on the banks of the river. u (7) For the storage of merchandise and coal, depots and warehouses as well as landing places in sufficient quantity will be constructed on the part of the Persian Government or Persian merchants. tt (13) No one belonging to any vessel has any right whatsoever to buy, sell or mortgage, etc., any property from or to any Persian subject.' 156-A. Now under the Treaty of Turkoman Chai, British merchants would be clearly entitled to purchase property sufficient for a dwelling house with ware houses and business premises, which right is nullified by the above quoted Regu lations. As entitled by the treaty, the Lynch Company requested permission to acquire two acres of land at Mohammerah and Ahwaz, by sale or lease, which [8969rD] p58 were imperatively necessary to build wharf, warehouses and offices. But Sir H. Drummond Wolff telegraphed on 23rd November 1888— ' Considering the storm stirred up hy the Russian Legation about Karun and their assertion that we mean to establish British settlements, as well as the dread of the Shah of the acquisition of land hy foreigners, I do not think it judicious at present to put forward Lynch's application. Could they not purchase it privately from or through Persians? ' 156'B. The regulations, however, provide for erection of the necessary See Curzon's Persia, Vol. ii, pages 352—359, buildings by Persian subjects, and this pri- QhhoVsihe Middle Eastern Question vagwi&amp;z-iQb vileofe was granted to one Movun-i-Tuiiar sua Gulf Admimstratiou Beports from ism to 1896. of Bushire, a friend of the Governor- General. His terms proved so exorbitant, that it was found impossible to accept them. Pending the negotiations the Company's agent had to be con tent with an old mat-shed for which a rent from 500 to 600 tomans (about £ 150 to £ 170) was charged annually. This was the hut in which Mr. (now Lord Curzon) found the Company's agent risidiog when he visited Ahwaz in 1889. This hut, and the local Governor's residence, a similar structure, with a few others of the same kind, were the humble beginnings of the now rising iowcL oi Bunder'i-Nasiri, above the landing place of the Lynch Company's steamer and below the Ahwaz rapids and about a mile below the Ahwaz village. It was only in 1894, that the Persian Government were able to erect the buildings, which the Lynch Company's agent have since been occupying on a lease the terms of which are supposed to afford opportunities to the Persian authorities for obnoxious interference. (ii) Misunderstanding as to the tonnage dues, 157. A difficulty also arose as to the interpretation of Regulation No. 14, Secret e , October 1889, N08.25i-.263. which provides for a payment of one kran for every ton as toll for a steamer going up the river and returning, and half tolls for unladen vessels. The Karguzar at Mohammerah insisted on the payment of a kran for a ton as a separate charge for every passage ascending and descending, while the Lvnch Company contended that the toll of one kran covered both. It was decided to refer the matter for determination to the Shah's Government in consultation with ICer Majesty's Legation. Meanwhile a bond was offered by Messrs. Lynch promising to pay the tonnage claimed, if the Shah on his return from Europe decided in favour of the Karguzar. This the Karguzar refused to accept. 158. A compromise was then proposed in behalf of Messrs. Lynch and Secret e,, Julj 1890, Nos. 327—35i. Co., to the eflect that 1 kran per ton , should be charged for the upward passage on the vessels tonnage if the ship is laden, half if empty, and that one kran per ton should be charged on actual cargo for the downward journey, Amin-es^ Sultan pioposed another compromise, that is that steamers entering the Karun Ahwl,''! 17 ivi f nVn t' l£ , eIn i ,t y one-half and that vessels leaving Ahwaz should pay full toll, if laden and nothing if empty. This latter con cession was of no benefit to the Company, since on the return journey, their vessel was seldom empty and had to carry some cargo, however little it was Ultimately the lebcran Government proposed the following arrangement which kmn Vr tonTl n LTf C 1? ted the if ladea to pav one Kran per ton, one-half if empty, and vessels coming downward if emnfv nothing, if laden one kran for each ton of actual cargo. ' (Hi) Difficulty as to certificate of Blosse Lynch. 159. The Karguzar of Mohammerah wished the Lynch Company to pro- Secret B., October 1889, Nos. 251-268. ^ Uce the original of the certificate of the its builders This they at first stated wasTft 1* tLif ^oUn^ Subsequently, tbey asserted that the original was missin- and produced a certi' ficatc signed by the British Consul, which the Earguzar would not accent as authoritative enough. The matter was referred to the Cental Government! sairet e., july isao, Nos. 327— 351, (No, 328). who decided that the Consul's certificate should be accepted for measurement.59 (lo). Charges against Mr. John GasJcin of irregular conduct and opposition to his employing his own private servants. 160. The Karguzar brought also a complaint against Mr. John Gaskin, e rwv i 0 QQxr oci the Agent of Messrs. Lynch and Co. at Secret E., October 1889, Nos. 251—263. .. 0 , . . . . J i-. Anwaz, abont certain irregularities m nis conduct. The main allegations against him were that he wore a native garb for objectionable purposes and that he led a loose life. That he at times wore a native dress, there was no doubt, but this was a well known fact, the simple reason for which was that his European costumes too much soiled could not be washed for use for want of washermen. There was absolutely no foundation for the charge that he made use of this clothing for irregular purposes. Colonel Eoss had no doubt that the charges were fabricated by interested parties in order to make things as unpleasant as possible for the Lynch Company. 161. Mr. Gaskin employed a Christian cook and wanted another servant to fetch water, look after the horse, etc. This man the Persian officials insisted on appointing themselves, but they employed him also on their own duties and mulcted him of a share of his wages. Nobody would consent to stay with Mr. Gaskin, though he tried to keep them by paying a higher salary. These were some of the petty vexations to which Mr. Gaskin was subjected. 162. ' The Persian officials' wrote Colonel Koss in his letter, dated 10th September 1889 ' high and low in Ara- ihid No. 259. bistan, seem to assume that the district is quite exceptional as regards English subjects, that they are admitted on suffer- ence as a great favour, but are not entitled to the full privileges and freedom from interference, which foreigners enjoy in other parts of Persia. Unless a radical change is made and less narrow-minded officials employed, it will take a long time to overcome these difficulties and a good deal of firm pressure.' 163. The only authority the Persian officials had for their interference in the servants' question was Regulation No. 15, which requires that the Company should employ porters for carrying cargo only such as are appointed by the Persian officials. But this surely did not authorize their interference in the case of domestic servants. 164. Nizam-es-Sultaneh does not appear to have taken any notice of the charges against Mr. Gaskin. It would have been of course quite undignified for a Governor to take any action on such charges. But there is reason to suspect that secretly he was in full accord with the obstructive tactics of his subordinates. 165. It is interesting to note that the Karguzar went so far as to object to Mr. Gaskin, on the ground, that he was an European and that the Lynch Com pany had no right to appoint an European to Ahwaz. This impudence on the part of the Persian official is hardly credible, but the Persian Government had found in him an ideal Persian obstructionist to work successfully in Peisian interests the regulations so generously conceived for their benefit and to the detriment of the foreigners' interests. 166. The Karguzar then fenced himself behind Regulation No. 2, which provides against taking on board vessels Secret e., December 1889, Nos. 1-4. persons whose presence is detrimental to order, etc. But there was absolutely no truth whatever in his charges against Mr, Gaskin, which were evidently concocted, in order to secure the removal of a person, who would work in earnest in the interests of the Company and the appointment of a native agent who would be likely to play into Persian hands. The Lynch Company was determined to stand their ground firmly and not to comply with the demand for Mr. Gaskin's removal, inasmuch as the step would be calculated to lower the British prestige and encourge the Persians m their obstructive tactics. (??) Navigation on the Vpper Karun. 167. Eor the purposes of navigation on the Upper Karun, we have noticed, the Persian boat Susa was utilized by the Persian officials. But it could be60 of little use for traffic purposes, both because it drew too much water and because there was little attempt made by the Persians to draw any traffic down the river from Shuster, which could be towed in barges. In December 1889 the Lynch Company despatched the steamer Shushan as a gift to the Shah for navigation from Ahwaz to Shuster, but the Company in consultation with Her o .« - tonn xt no Majesty's Government decided not to Secret E., January 1890, No#. 98—99. i t -j. • i. i j r -r» • deliver it into the hands of Persian officials except on the following conditions:— a) collection of customs at Ahwaz and Shuster according to the desti nation of goods; (2) regular communication between Ahwaz, Shuster and Dizful, in connection with their steamer on the Lower Karun; (3) profits of the steamer to go to the Government of Persia, but the management to be in the hands of the Company; (4) permission to lay down a tramway between the two steamers at Ahwaz; (5) permission to tow barges and exemption from tonnage dues until traffic was properly established. 168. The steamer was accepted only in 1890, on conditions which were e .crrt e ., June isso. No., 221-225. in a memorandum prepared by oir H. Drummond Wolff— Sir H.

' I now have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship a translation of the note given me by the Amin-es-Sultan, by which the Shah accepts the steamer offered him by Messrs. Lynch.

The Company attached the greatest importance to the l891 ' f Ahwaz and Shmter for cargo . . -.r . , , . , shipped to those places, instead of being opened at Mohammerah : this latter process damaged the goods considerahly and gave occasion for extra charges in various shapes. The concession asked for by the Company was opposed for a long time, and when ultimately granted by the Central Government, it took several months before the local autho- rities could be induced to enforce it.61 170. The Slmli's Gcvermrent had full permission to the Shvshcn's Secret E., August 1891, Nos. 132-137, and Nos. Sailing to Dtzful OS Well OS Shusfer, btlt 1(52 - 165 - the local authorities found means to evade the orders in various ways. The Lynch Company desired in June 1891 to send the steamer up the Ah-i-Diz, as far as slie could in order to estah- lish her rii^ht of passage, since she was accepted by the Shah for the purpose of navigating the three tributaries of the Upper Karun, the Shateit, the Gargar and Ab-i-Diz. The move proposed up the last river was, however, objected to by the Governor, though the $usa had already proceeded up the river. 171. As regards the management of the steamer's navigation, the Company secret e., July 1890, Nos. 325-351 (No. 347), proposed to appoint an European Captain and October isyo, Noa. i-28 (Nos. 11-12). and Engineer, whose salaries amounting to about 500 krans a month should be paid by the Persian Government. The navigation of the Upper Karun is a very difficult process, and a steamer like the Shushon could not be entrusted on this river to natives. The Persian Gov ernment considered the estimate of the cost of management framed by the Com» pany was too high and proposed reduction. The Company could not see their way to any reduction without exposing the steamer to frequent risks of being wrecked. ' It was then decided by the Persian Government to let the Lynch Company manage the affair for three months on trial. This arrangement, however' still continues ; the Company worked for many years at a loss, which has not yet been reimbursed and may possibly never. 172. The construction of a tramway at the Ahwaz rapids was very import ant for facilitating a rapid transport of Secret E., March 1891, Nos. 35-66 (No. 36). goods from OUO ship to the Other. But the Persian authorities were in no mood to allow the Lynch Company the con cession for constructing it, which they would have done in a short period. The Persians preferred to grant it to a native company, the Nasseri, who took nearly two years to complete the work. Then the fares fixed by the Nasseri Company were by no means small, and were, as told us by Mr. Chirol, prevented from being made prohibitive only by the competition of the old mule carriage, which the Persians have tried', hitherto unsuccessfully, to defeat by intimidating the muleteers. 173. As regards barges, permission was given by Amin-es-Sultan to the Company to tow two barges, but the Kar- Secret e., january 1S90,Nos. 69 -/1. guzar interpreted the permission to cover only native wooden boats, and objected to the Company mooring off Mohammerah an iron barge, which they had built for use on the Upper Karun. The obstruc tive Kar^uzar also argued that the word External A., February 1890, Nos. 278-282. {{ ' was usec [ i n f telegram COU- veyim? the permission, which meant a sailing vessel, not a barge. The matter was settled in the Company's favour only after reference to Teheran. Rival enterprises and intrigues of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 174. The Karun Eegulations were so framed as to allow much scope, for not onlv vexatious interference with foreign enterprises, but for the benefit of native enterprises. It was only the Persians that were allowed by them to build wharves, warehouses and other buildings required for carrying on trade on the river and the native shipping companies were not placed under any restric tions Amin-es-Sultan and Nizam-es-Sultaneh accordingly began to interest themselves in a movement set on foot by secret e., August 1891, Nos. 138-141. oiie ^[ 0 y U n-i-Tujjar, a Persian merchant of Bushire, to form a company, as a rival of the British Company, which was (1) to run a steamer of their own from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, (2) run the Susa from Ahwaz to Shushter, (3) to construct the tramway at the Ahwaz rapids, (4) to erect wharves, warehouses, etc., at Ahwaz (Bunder-i-Nasen) and other places. In this movetrent they succeeded in drawing the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and his influence was fully—tliougli secretly—wielded to draw the traffic from the hands of tLe Lynch Co., to their own steamers of which they had three. The Sheikh went further in pursuing a policy of boycotting the hntish Com- p-dnv hv preventing coolies to work for them and hy making provisions scarce : his influence over the Arab tribes along the Karun was so great, that those who rendered any assistance to the British Company were sure to come into trouble, [Sf)60rD] , Q62 175. There was also an attempt to compete with the Shushan on the Upper Kamn by attracting traffic to the Susa, which towed barges for carrying cargo. 176. As another instance of the niggardly spirit displayed by the Persians towards the British in respect of the traffic on the Upper Karun, the benefit of which was after all to revert to the Persian Government, the following may be mentioned. 0 176, In May 1892 the Shushan was taken down to Basrah for repairs, G«II Admiuistratioo Eeport. 1892-93. and 0,1 ^ return she wa S Unable to re-CTOSS the rapids owing to lowness of the river until December 1892. The Persian Government was asked to permit the use of a launch and^ barge on the Upper Karun so as to keep up communication with Shuster until the Shushan could be taken over the Ahwaz rapids, but, it was leared by the Persian Government, this would be a violation of 'the regulations for the navigation of the Karun, and the request was refused Trade on the Upper Karun was therefore monopolized by the Nasseri Company' which took advantage of the opportunity to raise its rates of freight. ^ ' (vii,)—Bmhargo on grain. . i? 7 - 0Ee 0{lier means the Persians found for starving the British enter prise, or at any rate an obstacle which stood in the way of its success, though not always purposely thrown in its way, was the embargo frequentiv laid by the Persian authorities on the export of cereals, the principal product o*f Arabistan. 178. Soon after the Earun river was opened, an order was passed prohi- biliag the export of wheat from the country lying about the Lower Karun This was.soon extended to the Upper Karun: the pretext was that there fl-i* scarcity xn the country Even if this was a fact, the people at large benefitted | frora storing of the gram in the country.

'orage were prohibited, the Governor-General permitting the export nf , • lrre ? ular relaxation, moment that the Central Government propose to admiUt, oTcondition Tat63 no fresh purchases should be made till tlie next crop should be assured. The facts that the Karguzar, Agent of the Foreign Office, repudiated the authority of the Governor-General, while the Sheikh Governor of Mohammerah elaimed to levy again on his own account the duty which had already been paid to the Governor-General, shows the utter confusion and conflict of authority in all the irregular proceedings in this connection. The Central Government over ruled both these obstructors. In March the Governor-General again capri ciously stopped export, though by that time there could hardly be a doubt of the abundance of the approaching harvest, and finally soon after native and foreign merchants were freely shipped and the embargo was tacitly at an end, though, as far as official notification was concered, it remained in full force as originally promulgated. 182. Thus the embargo on the export of wheat, though not officially sus- AdministT&amp;tion Report, 1S97-98. peiuled, remained -virtually in abeyance. Its enforcement was again notified in June 1890 by the Governor-General, only to be followed immediately by an intimation from the Government, through Her Majesty's Legation, of its removal. The harvest gathered in the spring of 1896 was abundant, but prices nevertheless rose afrer a few months, the average for the year being more than double those for the preceding year, owing mainly to the short crop in Meso potamia. Prospects for the coming harvest were doubtful, and in January of 1896 a general prohibition of the export of food-grains was notified, to take effect in March ; it was, however, unnoticed by the local authorities on the Karun till April. 183. As the harvest was bad in 1807, the export of grain was again pro- md 1897-98 hibited. This seriously affected the Bri tish firms, who had made advances to cultivators, and after some pressure, an exception was made in favour of the export of sesame seed. The embargo was continued long after the prospects of a good new season had been ensured. In the Gulf Administration Report, 1899-00, Colonel Meade wrote At present the prospects in Arabistan are exceedingly flourishing and if the embargo on export of wheat is removed, the prosperity of the district should rapidly increase.' {viii).—Fanatical outhreahs of local tribes and Persian soldiers against the British. 184. The last, but not the least, in the series of obstacles the British enterprise had to face on the Karun, was the fanatical opposition of some local tribes, especially those in and around Shuster (the head-quarter of Mujtahids), to the presence of the British, and also the fanatical outbreaks of the Persian soldiery against the employes of the Lynch Company. We shall mention a few notable occurrences of this kind. 185. In July 1893 there was a fanatical demonstration against Messrs. Lynch's house at IShuster, The day of Gulf Administration Reoort, 1893-94. • ji mu, c tms occurrence was the lOtn day of Mohurrum, and the consequence might have been serious, as about 3,000 people surrounded the house, threatening the lives of the inmates. The Prince- Governor being informed took prompt measures by the despatch of an armed force which quickly dispersed the mob, and a catastrophe was thus averted. Some sort of complaint appears to have been made by those responsible* for this riot, but it could only be regarded as an attempt to avert blame by anticipat ing it with an accusation. An enquiry, conducted by the \ice-Consul of Mohammerah, ascertained the true facts, and a written disclaimer of any cause of complaint against Messrs. Lynch's Agent was given by the Deputy Gover nor of Shuster. 186. 4 brutal attack, which might have had the gravest and even a fatal result, was committed on British subjects /iti, 1885-96. i n November 1898, by the soldiers sta tioned at Ahwaz. These men maintained ostensibly for the preservation of peace and order, had in fact on this and other occasions lent themselves to violence and excess. On this occasion the representatives of Messrs. Lynch Brothers were proceeding in a perfectly orderly manner to lodge a complaint with the local Governor against the soldiery, whose high-handed and lawless64 proceedings in prosecuting an utterly unjustisfiable search bad caused a serious fracas onboard the Company 's steamer. The aoldiers^some of whom were actually on guard at the Governor 's House, resenting this lawful and most temperately conducted action, rushed to their arms and most savagely assaulted the gentlemen, causing serious injuries. For this gross outrage no other redress was given than a show of it made by the arrest of some of those concerned in the fracas on the steamer, a matter of comparatively quite insignificant moment : the actual perpetrators of the subsequent brutal violence were allowed to escape. 187. In J une 1896 a midnight attack, of a most brutal and murderous character, was committed upon Mr. Tanfield, an employe of Messrs. Lynch Brothers at Shuster, by a Persian in his service, the final escape of the victim with life, though fearfully mutilated, being almost miraculous. Such an incident might no doubt have occurred, even under the condition of a reason ably good Government, and would in sucb case have demanded no exceptional treatment. A public and fanatical character was, however, given to the out rage by the savagely inhuman popular demonstration of the following day, when a mob assailed the party conveying the wounded man to the steamer, with yells and the pelting of stones. Beyond taking the would-be murderer into custody, no sort of reparation was made by the local authority. Indeed it was only a month later, that under the stress of the notice attracted by this last savage outrage, the tardy payment of compensation, afforded the only reparation for equally murderous but entirely public assault, by the State soldiery at Ahvvaz, on a party of English gentlemen, eight months before. In this case the miscreants most actively guilty, though actually soldiers of a Persian regiment, entirely escaped punishment. It can hardly be doubted, that the impunity previously permitted, contributed to the present outrage, at least in its public and popular aspect. 188. After considerable delay the assailant was carried to Teheran, and there imprisoned, and the removal of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and the Saad- ul-Mulk, his brother and Deputy from Arabistan, was ordered : the former was shortly afterwards invested with high office at the capital. Nor was the tale of the rancorous and unchecked animosity of Shuster against the foreigner yet complete. In January of 1896 a strong mob after pillaging a caravan*of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, in transit between the town and river, a few miles distant, attacked and completely sacked the office of Messrs. Ilotz in the town. No redress for these outrages was given. Ala-ed-Dowleh, who was appointed Governor-General in place of the Nizam-cs-Sultaneh, after a very deliberate progress, arrived in Shuster in Pebruary 1897, that is to say, eight months after the violence of which his appointment was the ostensible consequence. With the help of Bakhtiari levies and some troops he had brought with him, he entered upon the coercion of the refractory town. The Shusteris, however, true to their traditions, vigorously resented the attempt to call the guilty to account, and despite the considerable armed support the Governor had, there was open defiance and revolt. Brisk firing was carried on for some days, the Government having the advantage with the help of a few cannon and a fort, and some of the truculent towns people were killed. Some sort of terms were then patched up, but, needless to say, these did not include the punishment even of the rioters guilty of the robbery of Messrs. Lynch's goods and the sack of Messrs. Hotz's ^office. Since then, the fanatics of Shuster notoriously plumed themselves upon their successful repulse of the feebly attempted coercion by their Government, and were encouraged furthermore to set up a claim to negotiate, on their own part, the terms of settlement with the British firms. 189. It was an open secret that even such very moderate vigour as was exhibited by the Ala-ed-Dowleh did not commend itself to the Persian Govern ment, and to this is probably in a measure due the indecisive result of his proceedings. At any rate, abandoning active measures, he resigned his office, and apparently, without awaiting the acceptance of his resignation by Govern ment, left the country. His retirement was the signal for that also of his Deputy, the Shahab-os-Sultaneh with his Bakhtiari following, from Shuster, which was thus It ft without any representative of the Government authority,65 and with its bigoted populace triumphant, no European was able to return to the town for a long time. The events of the year were undoubtedly adverse to British trade and influence, in a region in which high hopes of their development have been entertained and for this result, broadly speaking, the Persian Government by its absolute neglect of the most ordinary obligations of a ruling power, and its apathy in the face of gross and unprovoked popular outrages, must be held to be entirely responsible.

Lynch Brothers represented that they were working their steamer service on the Karun river at a loss, and therefore solicited a postal subsidy of £ 3,000 a year for five years to enable the Companv to carry on the service. They showed that the expenses attending the navigation large'y exceeded the revenue, in 1888 £651.4-1 Laving been written off fnd in ^ t a i U n tller + Tf ? fie3lf ! 74 - 17 ' 3 - represented that they carried Government Parcels in each steamer without assistance from 191. As regards their services to the Postal Department, the arrangement at the time appears to have been this. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company s steamers carried mails between Basrah and Baghdad for which they were paid Es. 36,000 a year by the Indian Government. At the request of the Bntish Consul at Basrah, an arrangement was made in June 1889, by which letters addressed to Mohammerah, which had previouslv remained at Basrah until called for or until the period for retention in deposit ad expired, were made over to Messrs. Lynch and Co., for conveyance to and delivery at, their office at Mohammerah. When the Karun was opened \heir steamers carried letters and postal articles up and down that river which thev said numbered 300 to 400 in each steamer. y ''' 0 ''» G '~ l »'«« s ' I&gt; ' H ' I think we stould be very careful how we voluntarily accept anv eharo-po ao^'ncf T a- revenues on account of alleged political or commercMal advanta^erin P^I ^ , criticisiif which w^tl^prJb^ablyToUow'their^i^i^in'the estimates^ ^ ^ ^ the In the present instance, we are asked to pay a postal subsidv for ^erviVp^ nn 4k v But Messrs.

The views of the Home Treasury were expressed in a letter, dated 15tb October 1890, from Mr. Welby to the Foreign Office,: ' My Lords have learned from the Postmaster-General that the Imperial Post Office is in Secret E., March 1891, Nos. 35-66 (No. 46). DO j Wa T mt ® reste( i in the navigation in question, an d that therefore there is no ground on which Parliament could be asked to grant a postal subsidy to the Company. The Secretary o£ State is, moreover, aware that a pubsidy to enable a Company to carry on a particular branch o£ trade, which cannot support itself would be contrary to the com mercial policy which has for many years guided this country. There appear, however, to he special circumstances in the present case which remove it, in a great degree, from the sphere of commercial economy to that of politics. The Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company have to contend with political obstacles, with the obstruc tion of Government officials, not with the competition of rivals or the indisposition of customer», and it they are driven from the river the loss vnll not be theirs only, but the new field which ha* just been opened to British trade in Southern Persia, with so much labour, may be again entirely closed. The purpose of a subsidy in such a case is not to encourage a monopoly or foster a failing industry, but to prevent the frustration by competing powers of the efforts that have been made by Her Majesty's Government on behalf of British traders generally, 196. As the Company was about to send at this time a new steamer . c , Q specially adapted for the river service, and iiidZSi os. 48-53. .f ^ i j. ii i v.j. it was proposed to attach conditions to the subsidy, Her Majesty's Government decided that the company should be paid for the first two years up to a maximum of £ 3,000 per annum, to be reduced to £ 2,000 per annum for the remaining three years. The Secretary of State for India agreed to pay a moiety of this amount in from the Indian revenues. 197. In 1894 the Lyncli Company asked for a renewal of the subsidy for - . m another five years. The accounts for the External A., April 1895, kog. 1-10. ono i i z i i r year 1893 showed an adverse balance of nearly £ 4,000, against which the company received ©nly £ 2,000 from Govern ment. The accounts for 1894 were expected to be better, but there would be still a heavy deficit. The causes of this unsatisfactory state of things were shown to be more political than otherwise. The following extract from the Company's letter, dated 26th October, throws some light on the matter :— tl The enterprise has certainly cost us much more than we had originally anticipated. This result has been caused by the great difficulty we experienced in persuading the Persian Govern ment to take certain subsidiary measures essential to the introduction of commerce, and by the immense delays which were interposed between the formal adoption of these measures at Teheran and their execution in practice on the Karun. The minds of Persian Ministers were filled by immense schemes for banks and roads and large monopolies, and it was almost impossible to induce them to consider the laborious details of ordinary commercial enterprise. It was nearly a year before the steamer, which in concert with Her Majesty's Government we sent out for presentation to the Shah, in order that she should establish the communica tion with Shuster, was taken over by the Persian Government and allowed to cross the rapids at Ahwaz. The settlement of the customs, a most important measure, was embodied in a written agreement with the Persian Government in February 1H89, and was not put into practice until the latter part of 1891. It is only during the past summer that it has been possible to conclude an arrangement under which a house is being built for our Agent at Ahwaz. During all this time the enterprise has been conducted in the face of all obstacles, and has slowly but surely made its way. Thus while in 1890 we carried 1,327 tons of cargo and 1,872 passengers, and earned 1,01H/., in 1893 the figures were 1,851 tons of cargo, passengers, with earnings of 1,5 m. and in the first half of the present year, 1,142 tons of cargo and 2,09(3 passengers with earnings of 99U^' , 198. The Company, however, expected an improvement in the trade shortly. On the track from Shuster to Ispahan their own caravan worked at their own expense, had made during the past two years a number of complete journeys in perfect safety. Exports from the side of Sultanabad especially in carpets were increasing. 199. In 1894 the contract for carriage of mails between Baghdad and Basrah worked by the Lynch Brothers also terminated. The contract was renewed, but the subsidy'was reduced from Rs. 36,000 to Rs. 24,000, an arrangement, which the Company apparently accepted without a protest. This reduction, however, was adduced by them as another ground, why the I^arun subsidy should be continued.68 200. The Secretary of State thought that looking to the marked, though slow, progress made in the increase of ■ Rui No * l ' traffic on the Karun and in the develop ment of trade with south-west Persia by this channel, it would be expedient in the interests of the public, to continue the subsidy to the Company for a further limited term : the then state of the enterprise afforded a prospect of an extension of commerce by this route, which would render the Company independent of Government aid. 201. The views of the Governor-General in Council were expressed in ...... , rt their despatch No. 36-Ext., dated 20th ZJid No. 10. A -looF- February 1885:— ' The representation of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company that they will be compelled to abandon their Steam Service on the Karan in consequence of the reduc tion in the subsidy paid from Indian funds towards their postal service on the Tigris, points to the inference that this payment has^ in reality, operated as a contribution to the Karun service, which is subsidised in the interests of the preservation of British influence in southern Persia. In fact, the Company naturally regards its total subsidies, whether from the Indian or from Her Majesty s Government, as a contribution from State funds towards its operations ; and the question how far the contributing Governments regard them as payment in respect of postal services or as payment in respect of promotion of British influence in Persia^ does not concern it. And the payment made to the Company out of Indian revenues is as a matter of fact as much spent on the promotion of British influence, as upon the actual postal service. 'VVe are therefore of opinion that, so long as the subsidy on account of the mail service on the Tigris falls exclusively on the Indian finances, we should not be called upon to contri bute a moiety towards the Karun service. But we should be willing to do so if Her Majesty's Government would contribute the same proportion of the payment which we make on account of the postal service on the Tigris. ' 202. Her Majesty's Government, however, declined to contribute anything External A., October 1895, Noi. 73-91. to the Tigris Service, and the Govern- . ment of India declined to continue the Karun contribution, on the ground that the interests involved were purelv Imperial. ^ J 203. The Lynch Co. then began to press the Home Government for the Secret e ., March 1896, No«. 79.95. grant of the subsidy, or else threatened to rru • ^ j .1 T'i . /~\ /vi give up their enterprise on the Karun. They informed the Foreign Office that the Sheikh of Mohammerah was neo-otiat- mg for the purchase of their steamer Malamir, plying on the Lower Karun and that though he would have only to run it at a loss, the Sheikh was willing to spend a considerable sum m order to get rid of the Persian officials, whose presence was needed on account of the foreign enterprise. The giving un of the Malamir would involve the abandonment of the Shushan plvinS on the yP'! e , r , K t a ™ n - Ihe Company represented that the Persian Government were indebted to them to the extent of £2,000, the out-of-pocket expenses they had incurred for running the Shushan, that it had just begun to cover the working expenses, and they hoped sooner or later to recoup the debt: while if thev up the ente th ld be ob , iged to press ^ Persia t Q the debt, which would be undesirable in the interests of the British. Thev also pointed out that the commercial interests of India on the Karun were not in. considerable, out of the total upward cargo for a year from Julv 1891 of S 401 packages, 4,804 packages having been declared L through carV frl Ma There was no doubt that the Indian trade on the Karun had gone on increas- njg since at least 1892 ; the volume of the Indian articles transMpped from ^ll Zrsned hv tZ V™ *^ &gt;k ^ the obstructive tactic. • j pur f? e . by .

Lord Salisbury thought that both Indian and Imperial interests would be seriously affected by the loss of influence, which would ensue ifThe steam navigation on the river were abandoned69 205. When the point was discussed by the Governor General in Council, Sir J. W. Westland urged that as the Tigris and Karun Navigation went hand in hand together, the subsidies paid for the enterprises on them should be taken into joint account, in which the Imperial and Indian Governments should each take half a share. 206. After considerable discussion it was decided to reply as follows to the Secretary of State (telegram dated ord February 1896) ' We agree to meet the views of the Foreign Office on the understanding that the whole qupstion of the distribution of the cost on account of the Tigris and Karun be referred to the Royal Commission now sitting.' 207. Her Majesty's Government decided to lay the question of the division » . i * tt i 0 q « - kt on- on charge between the Home and Indian Bxtemal A, May 1896, Nos. 20o-211. ^ 0 ,10 ,1 i ^ • . Governments betore the Royal Commission and pending the submission of their report and the issue of further orders thereon, the Secretary of State for India sanctioned the resumption of the payment of a contribution of £1,000 a year from Indian revenues towards the Karun navigation with effect from the 1st January 1895. 208. We come then to the famous despatch of Lord Curzon's Government « / t . v addressed to the Secretary of State, in Secret E.. November 1899, No«. 10-11. i-i .i iit -&gt; • it w r hich the whole Persian problem was discussed both in its political and financial aspects, and in which, with regard to Karun subsidy (paras. 69 and 75), the Government of India expressed in strong terms their agreement with the views of the previous Governments in respect of the Imperial and non-Indian character of the charge. 209. In September 1899, the Lynch Company applied again for a further „ ^ L v-r continuance of the subsidy for five more Secret E., February 1900, Nos. 45-47. mu j; n • i.u „ ' 3 years. The following were the argu ments adduced this time:— (1) The enterprise had shown continued, though slow, improvement the deficit having fallen from £ 5,000 in 1890 to a little over £ 2,000 in 1898. (2) Of the cargo carried during 1898 up the Karun, about half were imports from Bombay. (3) Unforeseen difficulties among which the principal was the embargo laid on export of cereals had come in the way of a prosperous business. (4) The heavy expenses for maintaining the read from Ahwaz to Is pahan. (5) The reduction of the Tigris subsidy. 210 The application was referred for observations to the Government of India and Lord Curzon's Government ^ N0, ^ addressed the following reply (despatch, Ko. 228, dated 21st December 1899) :— &lt;f We have already noticed this question in paragraphs 69 and 76 of our Secret despatch No. (External), df 4 ted 21st September 1899, to which reference is made in Sir Horace Walpole's letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 31st October 1899. The Indian contribution to the Karun subsidy is not in our opinion necessary in the interests of Indian trade, and we are reluctant to continue it. We are, however, willing, if It our Lordship considers this desirable, to bear a naoiety of ihe Karun subsidy for one year more, namely, for the calendar year 1900. We agree to this, in the first place, because we assume that the report and recommendations of the Royal Commission will be issued during the coming year, and, in the second place, because we are awaiting a reply to our despatch of the 21st September 1899, which deals with the whole question of the maintenance of British influence in Persia. We desire, however, to state tAat we cannot agree to prolong the contribution beyond the year 1900, and we would once more call Tour Lordship's attention to the inequity of an arrangement whereby Indian revenues not only meethalf the Karun subsidy, in which Indian interests, if they can he said to exist at all, are insignificant, hut also hear'Ihe whole charge for the Euphrates-Tigris subsid y&gt; in whose the Imperial Government is at least equally and indeed in our opinion more vitally concerned, [S969FD] • s71 213. The representation of the Company was referred to the Government .« v mnn xr „ of India, who, however, saw no reason to Secret October 1900, No. 60. , ' . \ j • i.u • -r» alter the opinion expressed m their Des patch No. 228 (Ext.) dated 21st December 1899. Meanwhile the final report of the Royal Commission on the administration of Indian expenditure had been published, in which the view was expressed that &lt;4 if the Government of India maintained the Baghdad-Basrah service, the charge for the Karun service should be borne by Great Britain*' In this view the Government of India expressed their entire concurrence.72 CHAPTER VII- Appointment of Consular Officers in Arabistan- (i) Appointment of Mr. McDouall as Vice-Consul for Mohammerah, 1890. 214 In March 1889, Colonel Ross received from the Consul at Basrab Secret e., july 1889, nos. 147-152 intimation that there was urgent neces- . sity for the appointment of a British rolitical or Consular Officer in Arabistan to see justice done to the represen tatives of British firms engaged in opening trade by the Karun. On puttino- himself in communication with the Legation at Teheran, Colonel Ross was asked by Sir Drummond Wolff whether he could not, as a temporary measure send one of his assistants to Mohammerah. This Colonel Ross agreed to do with the sanction of Her Majesty's Government; which was given (fndia Office ^oonf ^ orei S 11 department, Government of India, No. 72, dated 29th March loo9J. 215. Colonel Ross then suggested that our Consul at Basrah might also Secret e., Joiy less, Nos. 147-152. ^pp o inted Vice-Consul at Moham- „ , , , , . merah, provided he was furnished with a steam launch and given an extra allowance of say Rs. 200 a month.

He was otherwise considered as in every way fitted for the duties required of a Vice -Consul in Arabistan. He was accordingly appointed to act for Mr.McDouall, and Colonel Kemball was informed by the Government of India that he had been specially selected for the post with a view to his entering into relations with the Lur and Bakhtiari chiefs and that they desired to be kept fully acquainted with his movements and the local informa tion he might collect by means of weekly diaries (Letter No. 1769-E., dated 5th August 1903, Confidential.) 221. The financial effect of the proposal was understood to be approximate ly as follows : mz.^ that, for the purpose of calculating the extra cost of the arrangement, there should be deducted from the proposed salary, which for eight months at the rate of £800 a year, would amount to £533-6-8— (1) Mr. McDouall's office allowance at the rate of £140 a year for eight months, or £93-6-8. (2) Any deduction that may be made under Consular rules from Mr. McDouall's salary while on leave, which would apparently amount to approximately £36-1-0. The result would be a sum of £403-10-0, which would remain for equal division between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers (India Office to Foreign Office, dated 5th May 1903). (iii) Appointment of Lieutenant Lorimer Vice-Consul for Arabistan, December 1903. 222 The duties of the Yice-Consul at Mohammerah were mainly of a commercial nature. But there were now gftcretE., August: 1901, N ob. 400-449 (No. 420), f ac tors developing in Arabistan, which required the presence at Ahwaz of a Consular Officer, who would have to deal with delicate semi -military and political questions and who, for th^ purpose, would have to combine military and political ex P erienc ®' . ^ decided bv His Maiesty's Government, on the recommendation ot the Goyer ment of India, to create a separate Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz, which was to e filled by a military officer from India (f 0 \correspondence betu-een the India Office and the Toreign Office, dated 6th, 12th and 18th June 1903). 2 9 3 On Maior Burton's appointment to act as Vice-Consul at Mohammerah Won Such an officer the Government of India fonnd m Lieutenant D.

As regards accommodation at Ahwaz, M^e lost the best house available the one belonging to the Hotz Company, as we hesitated too long and it has been let the Belgian Customs authorities by the Agent, Haji Rais. .1 l 33 ; , Ue ?i e ™ nt Lorimer has now llis on a site suggested to him hv the Sheikh ot Mohammerah. It is a piece of ground belonging to the Persian Government situated on the north side of Nasiri on the Karun, between the Government buildings and the boundary wall of a garden belongin-to the Muin-ut-Tujjar. Its surroundings, therefore, are satisfactory and secure In extent it is more than what would be required, perhaps 400'by 200 / , but it contains only a limited amount of ground which is fairly secure from flooding. 234. On this site it appears the Sheikh of Mohammerah has decided ti build a hot weather palace, leaving sufficient room for the Vice-Consulate building (Lieutenant Lorimer's letter to Major Cox, !vo. 48, dated Slst July 1904). 235. Major Cox communicated Lieutenant Lorimer's proposals for con&lt; sideration, having regard to the difficultv of obtaining suitable temporary quaiters at Abwaz (No 275, dated 20th August 1904). 236. In his letter No. 312, dated 10th September 1904, Major Cox reported that Lieutenant Lorimer had succeeded in securing a house on an annual rental of 252 tomans from Haji Mahomed Riza. 237. As to the location of the Consular Surgeon, Lieutenant Lorimer is in favour of Ahwaz being made his head-quarters, especially on account of the presence of a small European communir.y there. He, however, admits that the Surgeon's attention being privately to be divided between the Bakhtiari and Lur tribes, the situation of his head-quarters will not be of great signifieance nor greatly affect his work. 238. As Lieutenant Williams was still at Kermanshah, and no opinion had been expressed by either Major Cox or Sir A. Hardinge on the question, it was decided only to tell Major Cox by telegram on 12th November 1904 :— ' We presume thet the site proposed for the Vice-Consulate will be large enough to allow, if, and when required, of construction of the Surgeon's quarters.' (vi) Attack on Lieutenant Lorimer and Colonel Douglas. 239. In closing this chapter, we might mention the unfortunate attack made on 25th October by some members of the Dirrakwand tribe on Lieutenant Lorimer and the Military Attache, Colonel Douglas, while on their way from Khurraraabad to Dizful. They were both wounded and their baggage plunder ed by the men. The two officers found their way with some difficulty to Burujird, where they were placed under the treatment of Lieutenant Williams, Indian Medical Service, then Acting Consul at Kermanshah, and Doctor Funk of the American Mission. -40. The questions as to the punishment to be dealt to the offending tribe and of compensation to the officers have been under discussion, the details of which need not be mentioned in this Precis. On default of the Persian Government to do their duty, the British Government might be compelled to undertake the necessary punitive expedition themselves 0l ' take the requisite measures themselves for the security of the routes in Luristan. 241. As it would take some time before Lieutenant Lorimer could recover completely to re-enter on his duties, it was apprehended that there would occur an unfortunate interruption in the measures he had undertaken to establish friendly relations with the Lur'tribes and in opening up the Dizful •Khurrama- bad route (as to which see the next chapter).76 CHAPTER VIII. Construction of Koads in aid of the Karun Eiver Trade. 242 One of the main objects of the Karun riyer enterprise was to open an easy and short route from the Persian Gulf to Northern Persia, especially the cities oj Ispahan and Teheran and tap the trade of the north. To meet these purposes it was essential that good roads should be constructed between Ahwaz and Shuster and the northern towns. A few routes have recently been opened by British Companies by right of concessions obtained with groat diiiicuity, and worked amidst almost insurmountable diificulties. (i) The Ahwaz-Ispahan or Bakhtiari Road. 213. In 1897 a concession was granted by the Persian Government to the Bakhtiari chiefs for the construction and maintenance of a road, with its caravanserais from Ahwaz to Ispahan via Malamir, Godar-i-13alutak and Khavorukk, as also from Shuster to Ispahan. The work of construction was en- Secret e ., September isuh.nos. 213-239, trusted by the Bakhtiari Chiefs to Messrs. (No. 235.b .). Lynch Bros, on these conditions :— The latter were to be allowed full liberty of adapting existing ways or tracks for cara vans and of the formation of diversions and of construction, whether of bridges or caravanserais, or in any way in connection with the roads. Messrs. Lynch Bros, agreed on their part as soon as practicable, to place an iron bridge over the Karun at Godar-i-Balutak, to build a bridge at Pul-i-Amarat, to clear the existing track of boulders wherever they deemed this necessary or expedient, and to build caravanserais and temporary or other residences for engineers or workpeople at such points as they considered necessary for exigencies at the time. Messrs. Lynch Brothers contracted to carry out these works for a sum not exceeding £ 5,500. The Bakhtiari Khans were to pay Messrs. Lynch Bros. 6 % per annum on their outlay and to repay the capital by annual instalments of 1,100 tomans : the first instalment and first year's interest to fall due on the 3rd March 1901, subsequent interest and instalments to be paid at the end of each succeeding year—interest to be calculated on balance of capital after deducting instalments paid on account of capital. 244 Three bridges were constructed on the road ;— (1) over the Karun at Godar-i-Balutak ; (2) over the Euzuft river at Pul-i-Amarat ; and (3) over the Karun at Dopulan. 2i5. The first, a suspension bridge, the largest of the three, was completed Secret K., March 1900, No. 188. in December 1899, and the road was soon after opened for traffic. 246. Some serious diiferences have arisen between the Bakhtiari Khans See note8&lt; and the Lynch Bros, over the payment of the latters debt the details of which need not be given here, as the subject is outside the province of this Precis. (ii) The Shuster-Ispahan Road. 247. This road was covered by the concession granted to the Bakhtiari sec^t e., september 1898, nob. 213-2j9 Khans by the Shah in 1898. It was to (No. jss-bo . ^ ie Ahwaz-Ispahan road at Malamir. page 3u ' * ar y on SontA'jrest Firtia, 'ihe road was included in the agreement T , ^ between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and the Lynch Bros. 248. It «as proposed in 1902 that this road (including presumably the secret e., march 1902, No. 538. Shuster-Ahwaz-Malamir Branch) should n T taken over by the ' Persian Transport ho/de^ 11 ^ of winch the Lynch Bros, are managing agents as well as share- It does not appear whether this proposal has been carried out.11 (iii) Shuster-Teheran Road. 249. A concession for the construction of a road from Teheran to Shuster or Ahwaz wa Kum, Sultanabad, Burujird and Khnrramahad was granted by the Shah in 1889 to the Yahya Khan Mushir-ed-Dowleh for 60 years, and was acquired from him in 1890 by the Imperial Bank of Persia. Nothing was done by the Bank except the construction of a carriage road between Teheran and Kum, at a cost of £ 80,000. The concession was renewed for another 10 years in 1896, ^ n d was In 1902 acquired by the ' Persian Trading and Transport Company ' with the other road-making concessions originally granted to thelm- SecretE., July 1902, No.236. P® 1 ™ 1 Bailk ' Tlie Company has been granted a subsidy for 10 years at £ 2,000 per annum for the making of this road. 250. Recently Lieutenant D. L. Lorimer, travelled from Ahwaz to Khur- Major Cox'a letters, Nos. 205, dated 2nd July J arna ^ a d and back (17th April to 5th June 1904, and 233, dated 26th July 1904, with 1904), and has cultivated the friendship of accompaniments. several Lur tribes, with a view to secure their assistance in re-opening the route from Dizful to Khurramabad. He has submitted a scheme for this purpose, which is yet in an embryo stage, and as it is foreign to the purpose of this Precis to go into the details of affairs above the plains of Arabistan, we may only mention that the success of the scheme, it was thought, depended a good deal— (1) upon the reinstatement of Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh, dismissed from the Governorship of Arabistan and Luristan, who has been always favourably disposed towards the British and the Sagwand tribe and their partizans, whose aid is mainly required for ensuring the security of the route; and (2) upon an annual expenditure of about Es. 93,000 for maintaining guards on the road. 251. This scheme is intimately connected with the proposed formation of corps of road guards among the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes, on which Major Burton and Lieutenant Lorimer have reported. [S969rD] / u78 CHAPTEE IX. (1) Desire of Sheikh Khazal to place himself under British protec- tion. (2) Interference of Belgian customs administration in Mohammerah. customs and British intervention, 1898—-1904. (») Sheikh Khazal seeks British protection. 252. In November 1898 Sheikh Khazal expressed his desire to Mr. McDouall to be placed under the British secret e., March 1899, N ob . 257-260. protection. Colonel Meade visited the Sheikh soon after and gathered from him that he was apprehensive of the early downfall of the Persian monarchy to be followed by a general scramble for the division of the Kingdom, in which event he was anxious to throw in his lot with the British. In case the British did not receive him under their wings, the Turks were likely to capture Mohammerah. The late Sheikh Mizal, who was assassinated in 1897, was favourably inclined towards the Turks, and was moreover secretly opposed to the British enterprise on the Karun, whereas the pro-British proclivities of Sheikh Khazal were well known and he had done much to advance British interests. Colonel Meade was therefore thought that we ought to have a secret understand ing with the Sheikh. The Sheikh's confidential Agent Bais-ul-Tujar wished also to negotiate for a loan from the Imperial Bank. Colonel Meade sounded the Banks' Agent at Bushire, without, however, getting anything definite from him. 253. Lord Curzon's Government thought that ' although the interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf and the south of Persia are such as to render it unlikely that we shall admit there of the intrusion of any foreign in* fluence or intrigue^ it is impossible to give any assurance of the kind asked for, seeing that Mohammerah is a part of the Persian dominions.' The question, moreover was not one for the Government of India to deal with. Colonel Meade was told therefore to wait for the advice of Sir Mortimer Durand, to whom he had already written, 254 After consulting Sir Mortimer Durand, Colonel Meade told the Chief A „ that as he is a Persian subiect, the British Secret E,, February 1900. ^ , i j i. • , Ctovemment could not promise to support him against his own Government, nor in the event of tlie break up of the Persian Government, could we guarantee his independence not in fact say what would happen, as the Government of India had not decided upon any course in such a contingency ; but that as the Sheikh is the most influential Chief in that part of Persia, we wish to see him strong and the Arabs united under his authority ; and that he could rest assured of the support and advice of the British Minister at Teheran so far as this could be done without bad faith towards the Persian Government ; while the British Government trusted that in return the Sheikh would do all in his power to advance our trade interests. ? i li ( h ) (1) Proposed establishment of Persian Customs at Mohammerah. (2) Sheikh Khazal's appeal for British protection, 1900-1904. 255. We have noted above* how the Arab Chiefs in Arabistan enjoyed con siderable autonomy in the internal administration of their districts, provid ed they paid their revenue (the diwan and pishkash) fixed by the Shah's Gov ernment. This was especially the case with the chief of Mohammerah, though attempts had been made more than once to introduce the Persian rule in his districts. There was now made a move with a view to introduce the Persian Customs administration at Mohammerah under the control of Belgian officials, which threatened considerably to interfere with the independent revenue rights, which the Arabs of the district had enjoyed from time immemorial. * See para, 8 above. A79 256. On the 6tli March 1900 a telegram was received at the Teheran Lega- Secret e, June 1900, nos. 38—69. tion from Colon el Meade, reporting that tne bneikh of Mohammerah had heard that the Belgian Administrator of Customs was about to take over the Moham- merah Custom-house, and that if he consented to this step he would be in danger from the tribesmen. Colonel Meade was of opinion that the Sheikh could, if he wished, offer an effective resistance to the Persian Government, and that the alternative would be his departure to his Turkish estates. In either case troubles would result which would be detrimental to British interests. Colonel Meade also drew attention to the possibility of Russian interference and the presence of a Eussian warship in the Gulf. 257. This telegram arrived just as Sir H. M. Durand was leaving Teheran, but he directed Mr. Spring-Bice to reply to the effect that ' we can neither ad' vise the Sheikh to rebel, nor can we advise the Persian Government to give up the idea of taking over the Mohammerah Customs, which is a necessary part of the Customs organisation scheme on which the financial stability of Persia depends. We can, however, advise both parties to accept a compromise, by which the proposed Customs reforms could be carried out without impairing the Sheikh's outward authority. The Sheikh is no worse off than the Persian Government itself, which has surrendered its Customs all over Persia to foreign employes J* 258. On receiving Lord Salisbury's approval of this telegram, Mr. Spring- Rice informed both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the ^ Sadr-i-Azam, in the course of conversation, of the news w r hich had reached him from Moham merah, and asked if the British officials in the Gulf could be of any assistance in the matter. It was pointed out that there was no intention of interfering with the internal affairs of Persia, but that the Sheikh had been of great ser vice to the British merchants in keeping order on the river, and that any dis turbance in his district would close the country to our ti ade» The Sadi-i-Azam said, in reply, that he was sending an official with presents to explain the matter to the Sheikh, and that the Sheikh should receive compensation for any loss he might incur. 259 Mr. Spring-Bice subsequently called on M. Naus, the Belgian Direc tor of the Customs Administration, and, Secret E, June 1900, Nob. 35-69 (52). com pli ai j c e with his request. Sent to Colonel Meade a message to be delivered to the Sheikh, explaining the nature of the intended steps, and informing him that the Shah would send a manager to confer with him. Colonel Meade, who had gone to Mohammerah, had two interviews with the Sheikh, which he reported by telegram to the Foreign Office. The Sheikh expressed great anxiety lest a Belgian official should be sent to take over the customs before the arrival of the Shah s messenger, and Colonel Meade hoped that steps would be taken to draw the attention of the Persian Government to the danger of taking precipitate action. 260. Mr. Spring-Bice called again on M. Naus, who requested him to send a telegram in reply, stating that no Belgian ibid (No. 53). official would be sent till the Shah's messenger had arrived. Before, however, he had despatched this telegram, he received a note from M. Naus requesting him to postponef 'rtheracUQii m the matter till he had seen him. The whole of the next day M. Nauseas enwed with the Sadr-i-Azam and the Imperial Bank, hut early on the ensu ^TornTng he'called, and in the course of a long interview explained to Mr. Spring-Rice that, to his regret, the Sadr-i-Azam had decided that no steps whatever should be taken till the Shah s return.

The loss to the customs by tms [S969PD]80 delay would be about 20,000?., wliich the Government could ill-spare. They were, however, decided on this course of action. He mentioned this in strict confidence, and expressed his personal regret as well as his thanks for the assist ance offered. 262. He, himself, was anxious for at pacific arrangement, and was per fectly willing to make every allowance for the Chiefs susceptibilities and prestige. 263. In consequent conversations with the Sadr-i-Azam and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Spring-Rice pointed out that Her Majesty's Govern ment had been anxious to offer their good offices as they had every reason to wish success to any measure for the reform of Persian finance or administration. He gathered, however, that the offer was not a very welcome one, nor the sub ject one of which they were inclined to be communicative. 264. Having received a warning from a source well-disposed towards us that the Customs of Moliammerah was regarded as pledged to the Russians, occasion was taken to ask the Mushir-ed-Dowleh what were the facts of the case. He admitted after some hesitation that Mohammerah was not excluded from the pledged districts, 265. The opinion of General Schindler was, however, to the contrary effect, and when the Bakhtiari Chief, resident in Tehran, was told that the Customs of Mohammerah would fall under Russian control if the interest of the debt was not paid, he vehemently asserted that this could not, and would not, be allowed. 266. In his letter, dated 20th March 1900, Mr. Spring-Rice wrote to Lord Salisbury:— ' As to the Sheikh's power of resistance, and the communications which have passed be- Ilid No. 66. tween him and Her Majesty's Minister, I have the honour to enclose a inemorandum drawn up by- Mr. Rennie, who has just returned from the south. The Persian authorities are quite confid ent of their power to expel the Sheikh if they wish, and the Bakhtiari Chief is of the same opinion. But General Schindler asserts that the Sheikh disposes of a very formidable force and doubts whether the Persians (whom the Arabs detest) will be able to reduce him to sub mission. There can be no doubt that it is in the interest of the general Customs administration that Mohammerah should not be excepted from the direct control which is to be extended over the entire Empire, and it would seem in consonance with the general policy of Her Majesty's Government to assist the Persian Government in any measure of reform, especially in one on which their independence from Russian control immediately depends. On the other hand, the Sheikh has deserved well of Her Majesty's Government and is on friendly terms with our officials ; but his independence is regarded here as a dang-er to Persia, and assistance to him Avould be viewed as little less than encouragement to a rebel. It will, therefore, be a matter of great delicacy to intercede for him. Yet, if serious measures are resorted to,' British trade will evidently suffer, and the existence of trouble in a district claimed as eventually pledged to Russia may be a pretext for sending Cossacks to the spot, or calling for the help of a Russian ship. I would, therefore, submit to Your Lordship that it would be undesirable, for the present, for me to allude to the subject again to the Persian Government, or for our officials to take any further steps in the matter, until the question has been carefully considered. I am assured that a deep-rooted conviction exists in this country that Her Majesty's Gov ernment desire to annex the south of Persia, and are preparing the way by intrio-uiDO- 'with the tribes. It has been suggested to me that the policy of Her Majesty's Government in regard to the Gulf should be explained to the Shah on the occasion of his visit to England, and that an opportunity should be taken of impressing on His Majesty the very serious nature of the Mohammerah question.' 267. In January 1901, M. Simais, Director General of Persian Customs Secret e., April 1901, Nos. 109—ill. Department at Bushire, proceeded to Mohammerah for the purpose of inter viewing the Sheikh in the matter of the assumption by the Persian Governments d the management of Mohammerah customs. As regards the proposed arrangements. Colonel Kemball reported on 9th March 1901 .n '' Estimatin g tribute paid by the Sheikh to the Persian Government to be 60,000 tomans yearly (it is not known what portion of this is derived from the customs as81 distinct from Ihe land tax), it is proposed to pay to the Sheikh in return for the surrender by him _ of the nnn L nAa™ 0f tomans y earl y» ^ in addition to bestow upon him a pension of 12,000 or 15,000 tomaus m lieu of the exemption from duty of his own produce. qi ^ ^ion which is confirmed by Mr. McDouall, who had recently interviewed the •ui * T l! 6 • )e( i ' 18 hatthe bheikll ' s P ositioilat M( &gt; h ammerah is such that it is impos sible for him to consent to the assumption by the Persians of the manaaement of the Customs at Mofaammerah and on the Karun. He does not attach any importance to his own pecu niary interest m the matter, as he is aware that the Persian Government will be willing to recoup him for any loss which he may sustain, but he says that the Arab tribes who acknow- ledge his control will not tamely submit to the surrender of their time-honoured rights and privileges, and that trouble will undoubtedly ensue if the Persians take the management of the Customs into their own hands. M. Simais, with whom I have discussed the matter does not share this view. He believes that he can effect the change without any trouble; and I believe that the Persian Government is fully determined to introduce the reforms without much further delay.' 268. In December 1901, it was reported that Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh, Secret e,, April 1902, Nos. 137—138. Governor General of Arabistan intended , j' 0 a VI ' S ^ Arabistan. Sheikh Khazal felt great alarm on this projected visit. He feared that it forebaded no good to him, and he gave out that the Arabs were by no means inclined to welcome him at that juncture, since they had beard of the schemes of the Persian Government to tamper with their time-honoured rights as to customs, and that there would surely be a rising among them, which would lead to serious consequences. The Sbeikh was determined therefore to prevent the Prince's visit. The Sheikh requested that the British would move in the matter since disturbance in Arabistan would effect their commercial interests, or that they should act as intermediary between the Arabs and the Persian Government. 269. Sir A. Hardinge thought the danger of an Arab rising was merely pretext put forward by the Sheikh for his personal purposes, and as the Prince bad already received hints from the Sheikh, as the latter reported, there was no necessity for the British Legation to take any aotion. As a matter of fact the Prince did not move beyond Shuster. 270. In March 1902, the Russian Legation addressed a protest to the Persian Government against the irregularities at the time existing in the collection of customs at Mohammerah and demanded, in the interests of uniformity and with a view to fair and equal treatment of importers of all nations, that a proper Secret E., May 1902, [Nos. 53-55, Proceeding Customs administration should be CStab' No- 54 lished without further delay at that port. The Sheikh sent an envoy to Tehran to effect a settlement, and oonsuUed the British Minister about the objection he entertained to accepting a Belgian customs official at Mohammerah, in whom he very naturally saw a tool of .Russia and the thin end of the wedge for the destruction of Arab autonomy.

The Agent continued to urge that His Majesty's Government should give the Sheikh an assurance of protection similar to that accord to the Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, explaining that he was not afraid of the Persian Govern ment, but that he wished, in view of the possible break-up of Persia at no distant date, to feel that the position of the Mohammerah Arabs was secured. 271. On the 17th September 1902, Mr. des Graz, acting on instructions from Enclosure 1 in Secret E., December 1902, Nos. Lord Lansdowne, attalGSSed the Mlisllir- 120 -130, Proceeding No. 121. ed-Dowlch, saying that His Majesty's Government had heard of an agreement having been concluded between f he Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mobammerah respecting the establish ment of customs, and after reminding him of the various promises made by the82 Persian Government about the exclusion of the customs of Southern Persia from foreign control, and of the Shah's pledge not to take any steps of importance, where British interests were concerned, before consulting the British Govern ment, he ended by asking to be officially informed of the exact conditions of the agreement in question. 272.

On 23rd November 1902, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to Lord T ... _ XT 1fl , Lansdowne, saving that unless we could Ibid, Proceeding No. 125. . 0.1 - i t i f i give the Sheikh real confidence m our strength and resolution, Russian influence would very shortly be supreme and active at Mohammerah. The recent appointment of a Russian Consul there, he added, there being absolutely no pretence of Russian trade, had an unmis- takeable significance. 274 Sir A. Hardinge's general position was strongly supported by the Viceroy, who in telegraphing to the Secretary of State on 26th November 1902, said : ' Our weakness in Persia arises largely from failure to support those Chiefs and officials who incline to our side. If there is a Chief entitled to such support, it is the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and if there is a part of Southern Persia where British interests specially demand protection against foreign competition or intrigue, it is the mouth of the Karun.'' 275. On 26th November 1902, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed to Sir A. Secret E., June 1903, Nos. 337-356, Enclosure Hardinge that there Wd'C obvioUS Objec- No.^ProceedingNo, 341. tions to a personal guarantee that the British Government would prevent the Persian Government from diminishing the^ Sheikh's authority or otherwise causing him trouble, and that it was not desirable to place him in the position of being able to call upon us to support him both by land and sea in the event of a threat from Persia with Russia behind her. 276. On 26th November 1902, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to the Marquis Enclosure No. 9, Proceeding No. 345, ^ Lansdowne that the Sheikh s Agent had again pressed hard that we should give a secret written assurance that so long as the Sheikh and his Arabs fol lowed our advice, we should prohibit a further curtailment of their rights. Sir A. Hardinge was in favour of giving some such intimation both to the Persians and the Arabs, at the start of the Russo-Belgian Customs regime at Mohammerah, as the best security against any attempts to cajole or bully the Sheikh into accepting a veiled Russian Protectorate. Finally an assurance was given to the Sheikh, which is summarized in the following telegram — Sir A. Haedinge, Tehran, to His Excellency the Vicerot, Calcutta. Telegram, December 4, 1902. ' To-day the following telegram has been sent to Foreign Office Your telegram No. 8.

Hardinge to the Marq,uis op Lansdowne. Tehran, December 5, 1902. {Extract). (No. 167.) ' I epoke to the Grand Vizier on the first instant about Moharamerah and referred to the two notes which Mr. d«s Graz had addressed on E ' J ° ne 1 - 903 ' lIos - 38M6e ' the subject to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, and the last of which had not yet been answered. His Highness then endeavoured to argue that our interests were not affected by any changes in the position of the Sheikh, who was a local Governor like any other. 1 said I hoped he would allow me to be frank with him on the subject. I had no wish to call in question the Shah's sovereignty over the Chief or people of Mohammerah, which His Majes ty's Government had always recognised. Our experience in Seistan had however been a ipssou in the effects on our interests which a 'Russian Consul and Belgian customs officials, who were.not always judicious, could produce at the residence of a remote and ill-informed Persian Governor. On the Karun, as in Seistan, the Russians had no bond, fide commercial interests and their recent appointment of a Consul could have only political objects. We were determined not to have, if we could help it, another Seistan in Mohammerah, and to let Sheikh Khazal therefore understand that if Russian agents attempted to intimidate him, or insinuate that they could bring pressure to bear on him owing to the influence which they exercised at Tehran, we on our side were ready to support him. It was because threats of this kind had been used by Prince Dabija, Russian Consul at Ispahan, when he visited Mohammerah, that I had felt obliged to intimate to the Sheikh that our naval forces in the Gulf were more powerful than those of Russian and that they might be employed in certain eventualities for the purpose of maintaining the Hiatus quo in which he and we were alike interested. Sir A. Hardinge to the Mushir-ed-Dowlkh. December 5,1902. {&lt; No answer having been received by this Legation from Your Excellency to the note dated October 11, which Mr. des Graz had the Enclosure l, Proceeding No. 840, Secret E., June jjonour to address to you respecting customs 1903, Nos. 337-366. changes at Mohammerah, and Your Excellency having in vour reply to a previous communication on the subject said that the matter might have to be referred to His Majesty the Shah and the Atabeg-i-Azam, I had some conversation respecting it with His Highness on the 1st instant. The Atabeg -i-Azam observed that he had shared Your Excellency's surprise at the em- nlovm nt bv Mr. des Graz of the word 4 Karardad/ to describe the progress by which the Persian GoJernment had effected certain administrative changes in a district whose ruler was its subiect His Highness however recognised that these changes as affecting Butish com merce wer^ a mattei of legitimate interest to His Majesty^ Government and whilst dec mmg to admit that the instruction given by him some years ago that Lynch Brothers should be all wed to pay customs duties at Ahwaz and Shuster was a pledge perpetually binding e Persian (Government, had directed M. Nans to discuss this question with me with a view to the conclusion of a modus vivendi, I observed on my side that, while deprecating in the strongest manner any suggestion that the us' o£ the word ' agreement' conld be construed as implying on our part a doubt as to the sovereignty of Persia over the Sheikh and people of Mohammerah, which His Majesty s Government had always recognised, we yet felt that the adoption of certain measures towards the Arabs, such as the transfer to Europeans of functions hitherto enjoyed by thc S lui h, Xht bv causing dissatisfaction and local disturbances, very seriously affect our interests. It was for this reason that we considered that the friendly relations existing between the Persian and British Governments and the assurances which the former had repeatedly given us, iunified ns in askin' for the fullest information as to the exact nature of the changes proposed His Hia -hness assured me of bio readiness to meet our views in this respect, and when a day m so later 1 asked him through Abbas Kuli Khan for the text of the arrangements with the Sheikh of'Mohammerab which I nnderstocd had ^ renlwd that no written arrangements had been made with the Sheikh, but t&amp;at lie was to nave the titular^ralik ol 1 lead of the Customs and to receive an increase of salary amounting to [s969pd] y84 12,000 tomans &amp; year for the maintenance of his Arab kinsmen. Some of his relations tad more- orer been already taken into the public service. The Persian Government, His Highness added had every confidence in that of His Majesty the King of Great Britain and hoped that this feeling was reciprocated. I communicated the account of what had passed between His Highness and myself to Lord Lansdowne, who has now instructpd me to make the following declaration to Your Excellency for the information of the Persian Government and with a view of making our position in this matter perfectly clear : (1) The British Government has never doubted the absolute character of the Shah'® sovereignty over the territory, ruler and people of Mohammerah. Any suspicion which the Persian 0 Government may have been led to entertain that we sought to establish any analogy between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammer^h and that of the Sheikha of Bahrein or Koweit or to distinguish between it and that o£ other Persian Governors, such for instance, to cite Your Excellency's own illustration in conversation with Mr. des Graz, as the Chief of Kuchan. can only have been suggested by persons desirous of sowing distrust between the two friendly States. We recognise in the fullest manner that His Excellency the Sirdar Arfa is a Persian subject and a servant of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. (2) At the same time the important interests which Great Britain possesses in the south of Persia preclude us t from viewing with indifference any changes in the system of Government in the province of Arabistan, which by causing trouble among the Arab tribes may endanger our trade and the security of foreign subjects, or afford occasion for interference by other powers and thus oblige us, on our side, to take active steps for the protection of British rights. It is notorious that when it was first announced that the customs of Arabistan were to be placed under Belgian control, there was a certain ferment among the Arabs, and that some of them went so far as to forcibly oppose the landing of the Karguzar of Bushire at Mohammerah. The misconceptions which had occasioned this ferment were happily dispelled, but had the Persian Government not pursued so wise and tactful a policy it might easily have assumed a dangerous character and produced grave and far-reaching effects. The British Government takes note with satisfaction of the announce ment which His Highness the Atabeg-i-Azam has enabled me to make to it, that although no written arrangements modifying the customs system on the Karun have been made between the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, as its principal local representative, yet the Sheikh will be retained as the titular Head of the Customs, with an increased salary and employment for his relations, and it has every hope that the new Customs Administration, whose establishment it has always regarded with sympathy, will prove of benefit to all parties concerned. It also learns with pleasure that the Persian Government is willing to maintain the existing Custom-house at Ahwaz, the retention of which is deemed important to the commer cial interests of the British merchants engaged in the trade and navigation of the Karun. But it must again reserve its right, in the event of further changes which it could not view with equal approbation, to make friendly representations with regard to them to the Persian Govern ment, and if need be, take such other ulterior steps as it may deem requisite for the protection of British interests, both political and commercial, should these in its opinion be threatened. It is glad however to take the opportunity of expressing its confidence in the friendly assur ances which His Highness the Atabeg has renewed to it and which on its side it is happy to reciprocate. I trust that this frank and explicit statement of the views entertained on the subject by His Majesty's Government may remove all possibility of doubt or misunderstanding on the part of the Persian Government.'

(Translation.) « I have had the pleasure of receiving Your Excellency's letter of the 9th* January last, • F 6th January. and have with satisfaction made myself acquainted' ship between th. two Governments and I woTld oowTpre^ Jy otnheartfel'r sSisMon 11 ^ the friendly sssurMces exchanged between the two powers, and I trust that the harmony ° n i85 sincerity wbicli has for «o long existed between the two powers may be still further strengthen ed, and that the friendly feelings between the authorities of both powers may as always tend to an increased amity.' 278. On the lOth December 1903, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to the Secret E., February 1904, Noa, 24 -32, Proceeding Foreign Office and to the Viceroy that the No ' 24 - Mohammerah question was again likely to become acute. The Sheikh complained that the Persian Government was en deavouring to evade the agreement made in 1902, and, in contravention of it, was attempting to impose duties on him and to introduce additional Belgian Customs officials and generally to undermine his authority. He wanted to know definitely if we would support him in resisting these encroachments, if necessary, by forbidding the Persian Government to employ force against him should he on his part repudiate the arrangement unless the Persians kept to it. Sir A. Hardinge was personally in favour of our doing so, and thought that the un satisfactory answer given by the Persian Government to the question as to the inclusion of Mohammerah in the Russian loan security would justify our being rather stiff in any matter relating to that port. We ought not to lose the opportunity of recovering our complete influence over the Sheikh, The Rus sian Government were bidding for him and were sending him a high Russian decoration. Sir A. Hardinge advised telling him that we would support him in insisting on the execution of his agreement with the Persian Government regarding customs and in forcibly resisting, if necessary, any attempt which the Persians might make (though they were not likely to try it) to coerce him. 279. The Viceroy was quite in accord with the British Minister's proposal about the Sheikh of Mohammerah, provided it could be shown that the Persians were proposing to depart from their recent agreement with him ; and after discussing the matter with Sir A, Hardinge during the Persian Gulf tour, His Excellency on 21st December 1903 tele- ibid, Proceeding No. 27. graphed to the Secretary of State that in his opinion it would be wise to support the Sheikh, if the Persians proposed to depart from their agreement with him. It seemed to the Viceroy unfortunate that the Belgians were ever let into Mohammerah, and it would certainly be desirable to recover lost ground. 280. On 23rd December 1903, the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy the following summary of a telegram sent to Sir A. Hardiuge on 11th December ' His Maiestv's Government assume that the Persian Government are really attempting to evade engagenieiits. In that case you are Secret E., February 1904, Nos. 24-82, Proceeding au thorised to inform the Sheikh that His Majes- *io. 29. t,y' s Government consider him justified in resisting attempt of the Persian Government to deprive him of rights under the agreement of 1902, the necessity o£ respecting which you shonld strongly impe® on fte Pers.an Government. The Sheikh should be reminded of the assurances given by His Majesty s Government in December 1902 These contemplated possibilities or a naval attack by a Foreign Power, ment.' 281. In accordance with these instructions Sir A. Hardinge addressed the following letter to the Sheikh Baghdad; 24th December 1903. (ConBdential.) Your Excellency, I have received a telegram in reply to Ibid, Sub-eDclosuie, Enclosure, Proceeding No. 32. ^ g rg ^ ^erview with Your Excellency.86 LorJ Lansdowne says that if, as lie presumes is the case from my account of Your Ex cellency's statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, 1 am authorised to say that you are in his opinion justi fied in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side, but I do not propose to do so until I hear further from you, as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other mfans of adjusting matters between them and you have been exhausted Meanwhile, 1 should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty's Resident at Bnshire, a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports and any further inform ation on this question.' (iii) Presence of Persian Customs Boats under the Belgian Customs administration of Bushire on the Shat-el-Arab, 1904. 282. In September 1904, the Persian Eevenue Steamer Muzafferi (in Major Cox'i telegram,dated 13th and i8th Sep- charge of the Belgian Customs AdminiS- tember 1904. tration at Bushire) and the gunboat Per- sepolis were found busy in the Shat-el-Arab looking out for contraband without apparently consulting the Sheikh of Mohammerah. They seized two Koweit dhows between Gusbah and Fao. One of them, which had 14 rifles on board, was released on payment of a fine of 800 tomans under protest, and the other which had 28 rifles on board was detained at Bushire pendinc the nav- ment of a fine of 1,200 tomans. 0 2feo. Ihe Sheikh of Ivoweit complained of further acts of interference with Koweit vessels on the part of the Customs administration of Persia. Two of the vessels, it was alleged, were carrying dates and wood between Fao and Koweit. Another Koweit boat bound for Basrah was seized, searched and de prived of 12 small arms, which were carried in the proportion of one gun for every member of the crew, for protection against piracies. 284. Captain Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, in his letter No 24 dated 14th September 1904, referring to these cases, observed tha^ these constant complaints, prove a deliberate policy on the part of the Persian Government of which the object is to destroy the British influence in the Persian Gulf He reported that the feeling in Koweit itself was very strong and mio-bt at anv time lead to acts of retaliation on the Persians and thus the situation would become acute and dangerous. 286. The Persians, it appears from Colonel Knox's report, proceeded on the extraordinary assumption that Arab Nakhodas are bound to prove that thev have not committed an offence against the Customs Department which in his opinion, can have only one result, where on the one side we have a well-re^ulat- ed department, armed with clerks, regulations, and engines of onnression of every description, and on the other ignorant Nakhodas seldom able even to read and write. If the Customs Administration persisted in this course of conduct the only remedy that appeared to him at all likely to meet the situation was that one ot our gun-boats should attend the Muzafferi and wherever they went especially in the open sea, and whenever thev overhauled a I mt h dli™ from the western shores of the Gulf, the Commander of trgl\oat should insist on having a clear pnma facie case against the boat being made cut to his satisfaction or the immediate release of the vessel. b ^ uuu f « 2S fi' f S0 far aS 'I' 6 S c 1 Vi !kll T 1 of Moham merah was concerned, when the news of the first movements of the Persian ships was telegraphed bv Maior Cot To 0£ tl,ey telegraphed t0 Sir 1 Harding on J 21 8 ?Se^ 'Under the Agreement of 1902, the Sheikh wa&lt;? fn ^ .

This telegram was repeated to Captain Cox, and it was ascertained from the Consul at Mohammerah that Sheikh had never refused to lend his steam boats to the local Customs official (Captain Trevor's telegram, dated 30th September 1904.) 288^ Mr. E. Grant Dulf (Charge d'Affaires at Tehran) telegraphed in reply to our telegram of 21st September:— / o i r j ' ? ir i 0etO !r 0f Clls . t01 ? s states tlla t th e steamer Muzafferi has been sent to ccnfiscate arms at r.usbah. I am pointing out to him that Mohammerah Customs are not under the orders of the Buslnre or the Arabistan Customs and that the despatch of the steamer without apparently consulting the Sheikh of Mohammerah was unjustifiable and likely to lead to mis understanding. cn ^ ^ e J s j an Gr over nment do not know that we are aware of their written agreement with the oheikh (please see Sir A. Haidinge's despatch No. 167, dated the 5th December 19U2).'A 289. In regard to the way-laying of boats bound for Basrah, Captain Trevor telegraphed on 3rd October from Bushire:— His Majesty s Consul at Basrah reports that the acting Vali Las protested through the Persian Coiisul-General at Basrah to the Persian Government against the gun-boat stoppincr and searching vessels bound for Basrah and that he has telegraphed to the Minister of the In terior on the subject.' 290. At present apparently the Belgian authorities have withdrawn the boats from the Shat-el-Arab, though it is not improbable they will repeat their feats on the river before long. [S969FD] z88 CHAPTER X. Attempted change in the system of collection of customs on the Karun river, 1902-03. 290-A. We have seen above* that as regards the customs on the Karun river, _ _ , ^ the arransrement, under orders of the Secret Juno 1D03^ ISos# 82/*856 (328)« ■■ ^ / j i j x v } Shah's Government, was that the taxes Bhould be collected at Moharamerah, Ahwaz and Shuster according to the place of the destination of the goods. In 1902, the Belgian Customs authorities pro ceeded to put a stop to these arrangements and demanded the landing, examina tion, and payment of duty on upward and downward through cargo at Moham- merah. Messrs. Lynch and Co. objected, appealing to the agreement of the Shah's Government in regard to the conditions on which the gift of the steamer Shvshan was accepted (see paragraphs 168—169 ante). 291. The arguments on which the alteration of the system was based and n-j/vT i the arguments cow/ra are stated briefly in (No. 245,enclosure 7). jv .c 11 • i. n c xi n/r • u the following telegram of the Marquis or Lansdowne to Mr. Erskine, dated November 8th, 1902 :— ' Two telegrams from the Mushir-ed-Dowleli and the Grand Vizier have been communi cated by the Persian Minister, stating that at Mohammerah, as at all other ports, a ClIstom8 , register has been instituted as a result of the new Customs arrangements while at Ahwaz, Shustei, Dizful, and other inland stations, Custom Houses will be done away with. The previous arrangement was that the tax on goods belonging to Persian subjects, imported or exported by the Karun, was levied at the destination. The same treatment as that of Persian subjects was accorded to Messrs. Lynch, and at the request of His Majesty's Legation, instructions were sent accordingly some years ago. But Messrs. Lynch have no longer any right to le excepted now that foreigners and Persians are taxed equally at Mohammerah, where Customs' registers alone exist. For if such exception were made, other merchants might be led to claim the right of paying duty at Tehran on goods destined for that place. It was therefore impossible to entertain Messrs. Lynch's request, and the Persian Minister was directed to discuss the question with me. He has been informed in reply that I consider the position at Mohammerah to differ from that of any other port, in that it is situated at the mouth of a river open to steam navi gation. It was only on the assurance that cargoes would not have to be unloaded at Moham merah, but that duties might be paid at destination, that Messrs. Lynch had agreed to under take the navigation. Were this arrangement to be worked without notice or any compensatory advantages, it would be unfair and inconsistent with good faith, and commerce, by which Persian revenues are benefited, would be seriously affected. A provisional arrangement had, I was glad to hear, been made, and I trusted that His Majesty's Minister might be able to come to an agreement with the Grand Vizier either that the present system should be con tinued or that other arrangements equally convenient might be substituted for it, and that pending such an agreement the provisional arrangement should continue in force.' 292. After much pressure Mr. Naus agreed to re-open the- customs house at Ahwaz in November 1902. It was only in Pebruary 1903 that the proposal to re-open a custom house ibid, No. 356. at Shuster was accepted as a provisional arrangement. The arrangement was made permanent m April 1903. * See paragraphs 168 and 169 above.89 CHAPTER XI. Disturbed state of Arabistan (2). Attack on the Shushan. (3) Measures for its protection, 1902-04. 293. Recently there have been repeated disturbances in Arabistan, especi- secret e ., July 1903, Nos. 279-285. 0rl ^ ie banks of the upper Karun, . arising from the raids of the Khasraj tribe. Ihe Khasraj are noted marauders and originally belong to Turkish territory beyond the Kerkah.^ They are divided into nine independent sections and are purely nomadic, having no regular ground for cultivation and are consequently difficult to get at. During tbe wheat season members of the tribe temporarily join other tribes. (Letter from Vice-Consul at Mohammerah to the Consul-General, Bus hire, No. 40, dated 27th May 1903.) 294. On 11th September 1902, Mr. King, master of the Shushan, reported that, on the night of 5th September, the was attacked by a band of forty armed Arabs, who fired about seventy shots into the vessel killing a boy and wounding a deckman, who was left in a dangerous condition ; and also a soldier. The woodwork of the cabins was riddled with shot holes, and one sbot pierced the funnel. They then came on board and pillaged the cargo, stole nearly all the cooking utensils and the crew's personal effects. After remaining on board about an hour, during which time they made free of the vessel, they decamped taking with them their booty. At the time of the attack the steamer had a Persian guard of three soldiers, who were there for the purpose of guarding the vessel, but these men fled on the approach of the marauders. 296. The robbers who attacked the Shush an on 5th September 1902 were said to belong to Sheikh Taki's section of the Khasraj tribe. 296. The Azam-es-Sultan eh, who was at the time Deputy Governor of Arabistan, arranged for ten soldiers to accompany the steamer, and the Prince Governor Salar-ed-Dowlah was reported to have arranged to send Bakhtiari levies to put a stop to the robberies. No steps were taken by the Persian authorities to punish the marauders. The Lieutenant Governor's excuse was that the Khasraj were Turkish subjects, and that it was useless his taking action on a small scale, as the Prince Governor was going to send troops to restore order. These troops never came. 297. The country round about upper Karun still continued to be disturbed by the raids of the Khasraj and other tribes. The Azam-es-Sultaneh, who had been Lieutenant-Governor of Arabistan under His Eojal Highness Salar-ed- Dowleh, resigned and left Arabistan in June 1903. The Sardar Arfa was asked by the Prince Governor to restore order : in reply he stated that he would do so if he were given a free hand and an undertaking that he would not be called to account hereafter for any measures it might be necessary to take, and asking for expenses. Nothing further was done : the local executive was left in the hands of the Commandant of the forces, Yamin-en-Nizam. At the time of the outrage on tbe Shushan this officer with the few troops under bis command was supporting the Sardar Arfa in connection with the Beni Truf rebellion. This man soon left the province with his troops. (Mr. McDouall's No. 74, dated 26th August 1904, to Major Cox.) 297-A. The Shushan was again attacked by robbers on the evening of tbe 15th April 1904, while moored to the bank at Bender Sheleilieh the anchorage for Shuster. According to information given by Mr. Maclure, master of the vessel, about 8-30 p.m . fifty or sixty shots were fired at the vessel from the high ground. No reply could be made from the ship as there were intending passen gers with mules and donkeys on shore alongside the vessel. The Arabs rushed down on the passengers carrying off one mule and four donkeys ; the passengers escaped to the other side of the liver in cargo boats which were lying there.90 297-B^ The Arabs had all descended from the high ground and while some were occupied with the passengers on shore, the rest fired into the body of the ship, killing two women passengers and wounding another and damaging the wood-work and funnel to the value of about fifty pounds. Ten men withdrawn daggers came close to the gangway and the soldiers began parleying with their leader to allow time for the passengers to get out of the way. The master and two deckmen with rifles were posted in the engine-room and the guard of nine soldiers were also ready. The leader of the Arabs was calling to his men to rush the ship and about twenty more Arabs were coming up when the crew and soldiers fired, killing the leader and apparently two others. The robbers then fled, carrying off their wounded except the body of the leader. The Arabs fired again from a distance and shots were exchanged up till 10-30 p.m . The soldiers kept watch all night, firing if anything moved ; no further attack was made, and in the morning the Shushan proceeded to Ahwaz taking the corpse of the leader of the Arabs, which was handed to the representative of the Sardar Arfa for identificatioo. Mr. Maclure considered that the soldiers under Mahomed Hassan Wakilbashi acted admirably and sa\e the vessel from being taken. There were ten thousand krans in specie on board. It is believed that there were six Arabs killed and three wounded and there is little doubt that they belonged to the Bannat section of the' Jlhasraj tribe. Some nights later Arabs were seen at Ahwaz watching the Shushan and as Mr. Maclure had previously resigned, Messrs. Lynch allowed him to leave at once, thinking his Hfe might be in danger (Mr. McDouall's -Wo, 1, dated 2/th April). . 298. At this time there was praotioally no Persian Governor in Arabistan. Prmee Salar-ed-Dowlah had been dismissed and his successor, Azam-es- Sultaneh, did not arrive tiUJuly 1904. 298-A. Consequent on the outrage on the Shushan, the Persian Govern- ment, on the representation of .Sir A. Hardinge, requested the Sardar Arfa to restore order and undertake the preservation of order throughout Arabistan unti the arrival of the newly appointed Governor, for which purpose a troop of four hundred Arab horse was despatched to Sbuster and Dizful some sixtv of whom were stationed at Sheleilieh, and an escort given to the steamer. Order was restored throughout the province : but the Sardar Arfa received no return for these services from the Persian Government, except the thanks of the Shah contained m a letter from the principal Minister. His Excellenov was put to considerable expense for the river patrols and other police measures witMn his own jurisdiction which had never been imposed on his predecessors and he stated there was no return!

On the arrival of Azam-es-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Arahis ten at the beginning of July 1904 the Arab horsemen were withdrawn from Dizful and Shuster hut at the request of the Governor, the Sardar Arfl a^ed to continue the protection of the Ahwaz-Sheleilieh route until the Azam-es- Sultaneh had time to communicate with Tehran on the subiect • and Tt L understood that he recommended that the Sardar's guards should be continued and some payment made for their services. The Imperial Government had it appears ordered the Azam-es-Sultaneh to do all that is necessarv to securethe saiety of the Ahwaz aheleilieh route ; but sanctioned no exnenditnre fnp t-i,,, purpose. The Azam-es-Sultaueh had only eighty horsemen of the Shah^vend Turks as a personal guard and about fifty ' Karasurm ' n- i ' f , , seve 1 nd if he used the latter for Sheleilieh there will be none available for othe^routes' use rZ puT^e 1621,116111 0f ln£antry: bUt ^ to be of litS continuaUy o^teid^own jufdS^uTdte p™^^^ ^ ^ tee the safety of the Ahwaz-Sheleilieh route if aU expenses were 'uarantSTrnd these are estimated by the Sheikh at at least one thousand 10™^^™° mensTm f •, ?oL rUP ®, e T t - W0 thousand hundred and sixty. (Mr. McDouall's NoT April 1904 and Lieutenant Lorimer's letter No. 43, 22nd dulv 1901)91 299. The questions tlien that arise are these (i) Should we not insist on the Persian Government takino* the neces sary measures for the protection of the Shushan on the Upper Karun ? 11 (ii) If the Persian Government be found helpless to do so, can the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Sardar Arfa) be induced to take the necessary measures permanently ? (hi) How far does his jurisdiction extend, within which he would be bound to afford protection to the British trade ? (iv) Tor what consideration and on what conditions could he be induced to take the protective measures in territory beyond his jurisdic tion. Who is to pay for his services, Persia or England ? (v) Can we enlist the services of the Bakhtiaris for the purpose ? 800. We shall take these questions one by one, not in the order mentioned above, but as they come easiest for solution. {a) Can ice enlist the services of the Bakhtiaris for the purpose of pro tecting the Upper Karun ? 301. From a report Lieutenant Douglas (Military Attache, Teheran), dated 14th November 1903, it appears that the Bakhtiari Chiefs have of late years been gradually extending their territory into the plain country at the foot of the hills. It is now about eight years since they bought Ram Hormuz, and they have since then acquired many Arab villages farther to the north. They have also been buying up more land on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz, between Shuster and Dizful, and now own the whole of that tract of country with the exception of the villages in the immediate vicinity of, and belonging to, those towns. Some land on the opposite bank, in the neighbourhood of Susa, also belongs to them. A force of about fifty of their sowars is maintained at Dizful and Shuster for the protection of the roads, under a local Chief, named Amir Kuli Khan. The strip of country on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz for about 12 miles to the south of Dizful is well irrigated and very fertile, with many gardens and villages, and has none of the appearance of a district where life and property are insecure. 802. Lieutenant Douglas suggested that the Bakhtiaris could be formed into a corps for protecting the road between Dizful and fehuster. 303. But their influence does not apparently extend considerably on the Ab-i-Garger on which the Shushan plies. Lieutenant Lorimer states ^ that though the Bakhtiari have acquired some land at Maindab, still the affairs of the Garger do not naturally fall within their sphere and that he sees no^ reasons for favouring its extension in that direction, even were the Bakhtiari K-hans themselves favourably disposed to it (Lieutenant Lorimer s No. 17, dated 21st June 1904, to Resident in the Gulf). (&amp;) Can Persia be expected to do the needful ? S04. In the letter above quoted Lieutenant Lorimer states that the only way in which the Persian Government could attend to the safety or A b-i- Garger would be by establishing a number of military posts along the banks ot the river. He does not believe, however, that the Persian Government would ever consent to give satisfactory guarantees for the scheme descn e y im, 305. In Lieutenant Lorimer's opinion, therefore, it is to the Sheikh of Mohammerah we should turn. The tribe politics involved are enh J^V Arab. Ee is the only man who has any the Khasraj and to throw obstacles Maiudah (see Lieutenant Lorimer's letter cited in paragraph 303 ahore.) (c) To what extent then can we expect influence for the protection of the river (i) within his jurisdiction ; (ii) in consideration wise outside his jurisdiction ? What is then the extent of his jurisdiction ? [S909FD]92 806. On the question of the Sheikh's jurisdiction Lieutenant Lorimer's report (letter No. 61, dated 20th August 1904) might be read and is quoted at length below:— 'The Sheikh of MohammeraVs sphere of practical jurisdiction ; 2 of his predominant influence ; so far as I have been able to ascertain them. It is necessary to preface the following notes by stating that the actual facts are very obscure and difficult to ascertain with any degree of precision. Such a thing as an exact boundary is unknown unless occasionally the course of a river serves the purposes. Saving these there are scarcely any definite fixed points to serve as landmarks, and in any case political boundaries or rather those of influence are liable to constant alteration. I shall confine my remarks for the present to the north and west borders of Arabistan. Starting at Ram Hormuz on the north-east we find ourselves within the Bakhtiaris' juris diction. Proceeding westwards towards Ahwaz through the village of Mir Bacha, the Sheikh of Mohammerah's border is struck, somewhere on the Qupal (or [Cupal) stream. It is here prob ably running north-north-west and south-south-east. Following this line which marks the northern limit of his jurisdiction, we reach a point Hussania, which is either on or near the Gerger. It then appears to follow down the left bank of the Gerger, which it strikes across to include Rand-i-Kir, The Shuteit or Karun is then crossed immediately below the point where the Diz joins the Kama (this is exactly opposite the embouchure of the Gerger and not a mile up as shown in the map). From this point it appears to proceed southwards parallel to the west bank of the Karun and at no great distance from it, but exactly how far I am unable to learn. This line terminatas, I should think, in Failia on the Shat-el-Arab. So much for the line of jurisdiction, defining jurisdiction as the right of collecting revenue for oneself and of administering the country, with the responsibilities attaching thereto, without reference to any other authority. This leaves us with the nominal jurisdiction of the Persian Governor of Arabistan. This includes aimost the whole of the Miandab ; Shushter; Dizful and the country south between the Ab-i-Diz and the Karun and Shuteit; the country between the Ab-i-Diz and Kerkha. from Dizful or Shush (I am not sure of the boundary between the Arabistan and Luristan Governorships) down to the Sheikh's limit, a little to the west of the Karun. The Jerria (Saidali), Beni Truf, and Hawizeh districts, in fact all the land, west from the Sheikh's boundary described, to the Turko-Persian frontier. The effective jurisdiction of the Persian Governor does not however extend beyond the immediate environs of Shuster and Dizful, I question whether there is any direct communication between the Governor and any of the Arab tribes from Sheikh Ferhan Asad's westwards and southwards. The Sheikh of Mohammerah appears to be always called in as a medium or perhaps rather as an Agent. It appears to be quite certain that the Sheikh collects the revenue of Hawizeh on behalf of the Persian Government and with its nominal aid or support. As regards the tribes to the east of the Ab-i-Diz and between the Diz and the Kerkha of which the most prominent are those of Ferhan Asad, Haidar and Ali Ghafil there is not the same degree of certainty. ^ It is said that they pay their revenue direct to the Governor and again on the other side it is said that the Sheikh has been entrusted with the collection nf tViP revenue from the second tract mentioned. To examine more precisely the question of influence— It is safe, I think, to say that except that of the Sardar Arfa no external influence is felt over the tract from the Diz and Karun to the Turkish border south of a line drawn east and west through Susa. Perhaps in the north-west corner an exception should be made in favour of the Wali of Pust-i-Kuh. In this sense the Sardar Arfa's influence may be said to be predominant, throughout but there is no question that it vanes very much in effectiveness in different districts. To the east of the Diz, Ferhan has cast in his lot with the Sheikh's ambitions and in return for support has apparently submitted to become his obedient servant. He is used bv th« Sardar Arfa as an instrument through whom he may weaken Sheikh Haider who will not admit his authority, '93 There is no question I think but that the Sardar Arfa's influence will be completely con solidated over this tract—eventually slow methods are surest and are preferred as long as there is no particular reason for precipitation. How the Sheikh's influence stands in Hawiza I have not very precise information. The fact that the people of Hawiza gave apparently no trouble when the Beni Truf were being dealt with, seems to show that the Sheikh's authority is recognised. The Beni Truf for the time being may be regarded as to some extent under the Sheikh's influence. The wandering tribes of Khasarij, Chunane, etc., who have always a safe refuge and having nothing to lose can hardly be subject to any one's authority. But the Sheikh claims to have some influence over them. He told me he had seat messages to them after the attack on the Skushua that they were to understand that they could not injure British interests without incurring his displeasure. It was implied that this would be an effective threat. 'With a diplomatist like the Sheikh, however, one has to look very deep for possible motives. Still it would be very surprising to find him coming so near an admission of responsibility for the Khasarij actions unless he had some real power or influence over them. I feel little doubt that for any definite object the Sheikh could at once make his authority absolute in any part of the country east of the Kerkha and Hawiza. I find I have omitted to state that the Bakhtiarl road crosses the Sheikh's limit of juris diction about 1 mile on the Ahwaz side of Alwani, which is the hulf-way stage between Wais and Joru. Also the Sheikh's border is said to approach Jerria which is not shown in the maps and I tave marked the approximate position of Jerria in the accompanying tracing of north-west of Ahwaz. The map is not to be considered as more authoritative than my written statements. The boundaries are conjectural, and the geographical features are traced from a map (No. 72) which 1 have found very inaccurate/' 307. In Mr. McDouairs opinion the Sardar Arfa's jurisdiction on the Karun extends on both banks from the Shat-el-Arab up to Bandi-i-Kir, on the west of the Karun roughly up to the Turkish border, on tlie esst the Bakhtiaris come to within a few miles of the river and hold Earn Hormuz. South of Ham Horrnuz his jurisdiction extends to the border of the province which on the sea extends to Shahbulshah. With regard to the views of the Governor of Arabistan, Mr. McDouall is of opinion that he would approve ot the Sardar Arfa safeguarding the Ahvvaz- Sheleilieh route. The Azam-es-Sultaneh is on very friendly terms with the Sardar Arfa, and it has nearly always been the policy of the Governors to keep on good terms with him (Mr. McDouali s letter T^o. Ij dated ^7th Apiil 1J01). 308 Lieutenant Douglas reports that the Sheikh's authority extends on the left bank of the river to about 12 miles north of Band-i-Kir, the country immediately beyond this, as well as that between the Ab-i-Garger and the Ab-i- Shuteit, being under the Deputy Governor of Shuster and that the Sheikh also exercises a shadowy authority over the tribes on the right bank of the Karun, and he has lately been trying, by transferring some of his own men to that side of the rirer, to check their raiding propensities, hut his power over them seems to be very small (Lieutenant Douglas to Sir A. Hardinge, dated 14th November 1903.) 309. From these reports it would appear that the Sheikh's jurisdiction on the Upper Karun does not extend much beyond Ban 4' 1 '? :i '^ th ® ^ i-Kir 6 to the Ab -i-Garger and Ah -i-Shuteit, and it is precisely from Band i Sheleilieh that'the river is most exposed to attacks from marauding tn es. 810 The Sheikh's aid on this portion of the river could then be secured only IX'ril TS. Sheikh ooold reasonably -e .«, (S„ A. Hardinge to Lord Lansdowne, dated 1st u y - )• qil s!r a Hardince in a note, dated 24th June 1904, to Mushir-ed-DowIah urged on the^ Shah's Government that it should allow no slackening of the94 efforts made on the part of the local authorities to ^uard the river. But this could he done only by subsidising the Sheikh of Mohammerah, which Persia could hardly be expected to do. 312. The question then is whether the British Government should not undertake the charge. Sir A. Hardinge is in favour of our incurring the charge, since the effect of such a step would be to render the Sheikh to some extent our aulsidized dependent and to strengthen the hold which our assurances have already given us over him (Sir A. Hardinge to Lord Lansdowne, dated Ist July 1904). 313. But it appears, from what Lieutenant Lorimer has to say on the Lieutenant Lorimer to Major Cor, No. 17, dated P 0int ' . that ' n0t merel y Pecuniary COm- 2ist June im. pensation which the Sheikh expects from us. Possibily he does not care for pecuniary compensation, as long as we can give him something more tangible, that is our protection against the constant encroachments of Persia on his ancient privileges as a feudal chieftain. We may quote Lieutenant Lorimer to explain what appear to him the Sheikh's feelings on this matter *' So l 0 n&lt;? as the Sheikh is eatisfied, there is no argument in favour of the British Govern ment s increasing the measure of its favours or of actual or moral obligations which may at any moment become inconvenient. ^ But it is precisely as to the Sheikh's attitude of mind towards this matter that I feel anxiety. Personally I believe that he is not satisfied that all the services which he has rendered and is rendering are to be attributed to a desire to compel, by deserving it, the more assured and intimate support of the British Government. He is dis- pesed now to count up his services and to ask himself what they have gained him. What equivalent has he gained for the trouble and expense incurred in practically extin guishing piracy on the Shat el-Arab; what for discontinuing some eight years ago his own trade steam-boats on the Karun in deference to Messrs. Lynch Brothers ? What he is now to obtain for his personal inconvenience and the expenditure of 100 tomans a day for the protection of our trade in Persian Arabistan ? I state the questions as I conceive he puts them to himself. The list might be lengthened by numerous small items. For his present services he will not receive a penny from the Persian Government, and it was only alter some hesitation that he undertook the work determined, I believe ' by the counse ls f f Haji Rais, and the consideration that it would form a real claim on our crratitude and offered hopes of a development of our friendship which was worth a lar^-e price He obscure ly hinted to me however that he would not be averse to the British Government ioducim? the Persian Government to refund his present expenses. The answer which his mind makes to its own questions are not, I think, favourable Re peated disappointment may lead him to find that he can stand on his own legs, or induce him to throw himself into the arms of any new comer who will make more specious promises than ourselves. r Evidenecs of Riissian interest in South Persia and AraUstan have not been wanting this year ; and the Sheikh has received their special attention. The latest indication is that tbe Agency for the Buss,an line of steamers has been transferred from M. terMenlen, Kussian SheM wufus poliCT 3 ' S ^ t0 Haii RaiS ' and ' iS Ha:ii Eais Wh0 furQisheB the Tt is unfortunate that on the only occasion, I believe, on which the Sheikh has annealed for our aid in the case of the Mobammerah Customs-it was impossible for us to accord it. need 116 make3 00 6e0tet 0t hiS conTietion that we deserted him on this single occasion of However much he protests his reliance on, and love for us, he does not omit to hint that he hopes for more from us The posit,on becomes serious the moment that any doubt i admitted as to the impossibility of his separating himself from us. 10 While on general grounds I am satisfied that the protection of the Ahwaz-Shuster route, the object at present m view can only be satisfactorily accomplished through him I will not conceal that I regard the fact with tavour in view of its bringing u s into closer ass'cia tion with the Shcikb, creating a relation in which he will be obliged to take our counsel and we shall be obliged to appeal openly in his support. , f iT are t ?. t ? ke his Pf 1 « any 'gM cause is, I trust, not open to doubt • but hat this readiness should be more clear y ascertained even in one small matter cannot, I think but have a beneficial effect on onr relations with him and his with the Persian Govern-95 CHAPTEE XIL Restoration of Ancient Elam: Projected Irrigation Works in Arabi- stan, 1903-04. nf w^f* 0 ^^ oEtll , e . d /' e J ms 1 ? f m ode rn times has been to restore the Garden of Western Asia, which Arahistan was in ancient times. We have read* about Mr Theu a o/s and Dr. Tholozan's schemes, which were in the afr in the eariy eighties of the last century They died the death, which is the fate of most schemes started for the good of Persia. Recently Monsieur Roggen. a Dutch Engineer, has been surveying Arabistan and preparing schemes of irrigation which seem to have fired the imagination of the Shah and caught his enthusiasm m no small degree. _ What is the exact nature and extent of the irrigation schemes cannot be judged from our records. But roughly thev comprise (1) the reconstruction of the dam at Ahwaz, (2) the restoration of some of the old canals. 315. As regards the feasibility of the schemes, there is little doubt, and from Lieutenant Lorimer'a report (No. 25,f dated 2nd July 1904) and Maior Barton s Memorandum on the rivers of Arabistan, it appears that the whole of Arabistan is irrigable from Karun and other rivers, under a proper system of irrigation. We shall quote the following passage from Major Burton's Memo randum :— a To instance the faoility with which these rivers will lend thetrselves to a scheme of irrigation, embracing the whole country from the Karkhah to the Hindian, it may be noted that by an inundation the Karkhah has been known to unite with the Shaour Eiver, and flo .v into the Ab-i-Diz ^ and that the water of the Karun can be forced by a spring tide into the marsh which receives the surplus of the Jerrahi, west of Fellahieh. The whole of the level plains from Hawizoh to the Hindian stream may be allowed to bave been formed within historical times. Assuming that the land advances at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab three miles in one hundred years, and allowing a lesser rate of growth for the deltas of the smaller rivers to the «ast of the Karun at the period of the voyage of Nearchus, the northern shore of the marshes and tidal flats into which the six rivers from the Euphrates to the Hindian then flowed would have stretched from the vicinity of Basrah to 40 miles south of Ahwaz, and thence south-east to the south ot Behbahan. The whole of that region is of equal elevation, and the water of the various rivers could be carried in canals to all the intermediate lands.' 316. Then comes the question as to the cost of the schemes and the means of meeting the cost- It appears from a Despatch of Sir A. Hardinge to Lord Lansdowne, dated 20th June i 904, that Mon. Roggen estimates the cost of reconstructing the Ahwaz Dam and of the necessary preliminary irriga tion works at £400,000 and proposes three alternative schemes—(1) that the work should be undertaken by the Persian Government, or (2) by a Persian, or (8)— and this is the plan which he himself naturally favours—by a foreign interna tional Company to be floated in Holland. The Companies holding the conces sion, or the Government if it undertook the task, would recoup themselves by renting to the Arab cultivators the lands which would be fertilised by the irri gation works, and which he is convinced would in a few years yield so splendid a crop as to become the granary for the whole of the Persian Gulf, and perhaps also for other and more distant regions. 318. The Shah, so M. Naus informed Sir A. Hardinge, was greatly attracted by the idea, but was strongly opposed to giving any concession in connection with it to foreigners of whatever nationality. He expressed himself, however, as willing to order the work to be completed in a period extending over ten years by the Persian Government (which would assign a yearly sum of £40,000 for the purpose), and even to devote to it his own personal revenues as distinct from those of the State. 319. As to how the Shah proposed to find the money, it was hoped that, now that the deficit had been filled up under the more economic regime of the Ain-ed-Dowleh, it might not be beyond that Minister's ability to find a * See Chapter Il(iii). f See paragraphs 329—-329-D. beloif. [S969PD1 bb96 sum of £40,000 a year for public works. Tbe Shah's private treasure, which was believed to have been, at his accession, over a million sterling (30 millions of francs), did not now probably amount in cash, excluding a mass of pearls and iewels, to £60,000, which would thus be absorbed, if devoted to the scheme in about a vear M. Naus's ownidea seemed tobe tbat„if the Government would really put some money into tbe work and show itself in earnest about it there were many moneyed Persian merchants who would be ready to 30m m it, but Sir A Hardim'e did not feel much confidence in the readiness of such merchants to embark capital on a large scale in any enterprise in Persia, the profits of which are not in some way guaranteed by a foreign Power, or at least by the participation of shareholders under foreign protection. 320. The financial position, however, of Persia has been recently again very weak. Monsieur Naus spoke to Sir A. Hardinge confidentially on the 4th July about the effect of the Japanese war and the cholera epidemic on the Customs receipts of Persia, and said he thought the moment had come to apply for the completion of the advance of 300,000^. offered last year by His Majesty's Government, but of which only 200,000/. had been drawn by the Persian Gov ernment. His Excellency explained that he was not yet authorised by the Aln-ed-Dowleh to negotiate with Sir A. Hardinge and was merely preparing the ground for the discussion which he believed could not long be delayed. 321. He then showed Sir a. Hardinge the draft agreement. It satisfied, he contended, the two conditions on which we had insisted in the spring of 1903, namely, security against early repayment and the assignation of the Customs of the Persian Gulf. Sir A. Hardinge, however, insisted that the third instalment of 100,000^. should be secured on the Gulf Customs alone without reference to the Caspian Fisheries or Posts and Telegraphs, and that although the point might not seem of much practical importance, since the exhaustion of the two former securities made the ultimate one, that is the Gulf Customs, the de facto guarantee, still His Majesty's Government, as the lenders, wished that this should be explicitly stated. It was not clear why the Persian Government should hesitate to re-emphasize in words the assignation of security which they were ready to grant in fact. M. Naus replied that he would be able to get the consent of the Persian Minister and of the Shah more easily if the point on which stress was laid was not emphasized. ' Le Schah,' he observed, ' se paie demots,' and as His Majesty has an idea that any further hypothecation of the Customs will affect his Civil List, which is paid out of them, it was as well to disguise the fact from him or at least not draw his attention to it. The men tion of the Caspian Fisheries as the nominal first security, albeit a purely meaningless and decorative phrase, would moreover be helpful to the Persian Government as enabling them to wrap up what is really a foreign loan, incon sistent with their pledges to Russia, in the cloak of a mere discount operation by the Imperial Bank. 322. Monsieur Naus further informed Sir A. Hardinge that what the Ain-ed-Dowleh really wanted was an advance, not of 100,000^., but of 300,000/. His Highness proposed to apply the 100,000/. to meeting the deficit which he anticipated might ftccrue this year from a fall in the Customs receipts. He was prepared to give us an engagement that the remaining 200,000/. should be affected to the irrigation works in Arabistan, which the Persian Government desired to undertake. Monsieur Naus suggested that the revenues accruing from these works, as well as the domains fertilised by them, might be pledged as a subsidiary security for the additional advance, and that this pledge might be coupled with an undertaking that restrictions on the export of grain from the Karun valley should be henceforth abolished. He thought the acquisition of such a guarantee might be one not altogether to be despised by His Majesty's Government. He admitted that he might have a good deal of difficulty in bringing the Shah to accept an agreement on these lines, but he did not altogether despair of doing so. 323. Sir A. Hardinge in reporting to the Poreign Office the above facts made certain suggestions, and concluded as follows (No: 133, dated 19th July 1904) ' To eum up, what I would respectfully ask Your Lordship to do is this : (1) to permit me to drop the new condition entailed in an insistence on the definition of f ars and the Persian97 woiless t II iTL S h' ^ dlscuss T 0 ' lh ® latter wtich ha, already made definite tionf tWs r e ? e br y J 0 ? , ^P'odei.tly ot any finaneial negotia- mv W 11 Srea i . ln ?P ortance and I beg Your Lordship to do ma the honour of ^ ° loca !^ n ?7 le 4= e a n T d Sidgment on the point.

Other ways have occurred 0 i i n' r , ou ? J 1 . 6 dlfficult y' ^ ^ premature to discuss them at the present sta»e. (d) 1 should like to be able to encourage the Ain-ed-Dowleh with the idea that His Maiesty's oyemmerrt is prepard to assist financially and thus acquire a finger in his Karun irrio-ation projects. I have given Herr von Roggen. in compliance with a request to that effect from him, a letter of introduction to His Majesty 's Minister at The Hague whither he has iust proceeded on leave. I feel sure that if we play the game judiciously and with patience we may still be able to utilise the financial needs of Persia as advantageously to our interests as our rivals have done from their own point of view in the past/' ^24). On these points the following views were expressed by the Icdia India Office to the Foreign Office, dated 25th Au- ^^Ce On the 25th August 1901 J gust 1904. As regards the advance of 100,000/. to complete the sum of 300,000/ offered last year to the Persian Government, the Secretary of State in Council is prepared to pay the sum to the v ^Jf^^g/hat the draft agreement endosed in Sir A. Hardinge's Despatch IMo. 166, ot the i9th July last, which was summarised in his telegram of the 5th July, has been concluded. Ihe money, I am to add, will be available after one day's clear notice. As regards a further loan on the security of the Karun Irrigation Scheme, Mr. Brodriek is consulting the Government of India on the question of furnishing a sum of 200,000/. for the purpose from Indian revenues, on the understanding that His Majesty's Government will guarantee India against the half of any loss in respect of interest or capital. 326. The Government of India was asked to express their views, in the Secretary of State's Despatch No. 38, dated 26th August 1904. 327. There are further certain difficulties arising from vested interests of several parties that are likely to he afleoted by the projected irrigation works. 328.^ There were, fyizctTn'SS-Sultcmph cLud/ Soji, Hfnyu -?/./- TtiJJctv, his co-adjutor, who has invested a large capital into landed property on the Karun, which would be overflowed by carrying out the works. It would be necessary therefore to acquire their lands and compensate them. 329. Secondly, the Sheikh of Mohammerah would be interested that the territory round about Mohammerah would not be dried up by the re-building of the Ahwaz Dam. He would be moreover personally anxious to have a share in the works, and from Lieutenant Lorimer's letter to Major Cox, No. 25, dated 2nd July 1901, it appears that the Sheikh has three big schemes in view in which he would invest his money so far as he can, and for the rest of the cost would be glad to have aid from us. The schemes are— (1) the irrigation of part of Arabistan by 5 or 6 steam pump barges placed on the Karun below Ahwaz ; (2) the construction of irrigation works on the rapids at Ahwaz on the site of the old &lt;e Band '; (3) the purchase of certain land from the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. 329-A. The 1st scheme is the same which Mr. Blunsum of the Basrah Trading Company had conceived and in carrying out which he would be glad to give his assistance, in consideration of being given a preference in the purchase of the produce of the land irrigated. It is estimated to cost about £15,000 or £20,000, which the Sheikh is prepared to spend, but if it should cost more, he would seek British aid. 329-B. The 2nd scheme would, it is estimated, cost about £500,000, for which the Sheikh would have wholly to depend upon us. The scheme, writes Lieutenant Lorimer, is a very big and difficult one, but it would turn a large part of Arabistan into a permanent garden, and, granted [S969FD] co98 security, there is scarcely room for doubt that it Would prove an excellent investment. It would of course be necessary to devise some means of securing the advantage to our own traders. 329-C. The third scheme refers to a large tract of land on the West bank of the Karun. Lieutenant Lorimer gathered from Haji Rais the following particulars:— The land is the property of the Nizam-us-Sultaneh and is leased from him by the Sheikh for £1,600 per annum. In Sheikh Mizal's time, owing to the unruly state of the Arab inhabitants, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh was very anxious to sell it. Sheikh Mizal however, did not then want to purchase, and instead reduced the Arabs to order; and the present arrangement was come to. Under the present improved circumstances the Nizam would ask an impossible or exorbitant price for it. Haji Rais hinted however that a time might come when the Nizam-us-Sultaneh would be willing to sell. The price might then be brought down to perhaps £30,000. 329-D. Beyond the advantage of increased hold on the Sheikh's ' affection/' Lieutenant Lorimer does not see clearly that we would stand to gain anything in helping hjm in this project. It would of course help towards the consolida tion of his power in Arabistan. In seeking financial aid, the Sheikh's ultimate object would not be merely money but rather an actual or practical guarantee by the 13ritish Go\ernment. 330. Mr. McDouall reported in his letter to Sir A. Hardinge, dated 25th August 1904 :~ ' I have the honour to report that there bein^ an idea, consequent on the late visit of a Dutch Engineer to* the Karun. that the Persian Government may grant a concession for building a dam at Ahwaz, the Sardar Arfa points out that unless be held such concession or had some control over such dam, it would be likely to do immense damage to his country. A diminution in the body of water coming down would, in his opinion, effect the date groves on the Bahmashir river, as the sea water would extend further up and destroy th3 date trees in the same way that the plantations of Gubbaa were destroyed by the failure of water in the Mared or old channel of the Karun. It would also damage tha' part of Fellahieb which is irrigated by the two canals from the Karun, known as the Salmanieh and Fellahieh canals. He would therefore oppose such concession or demand heavy compensation. « There appears to be some gr-mnd for his fear, but at the same time it would probably only accelerate what is likely to happen in the course of nature, judging from the drying up of other channels m the delta and the increase of shoals in the Bahmashir. ' The whole question is one for expert opinion, as is that whether the cu f ting of a canal from the Karun from a few miles above, and into, the Bahmashir would not divert more water into the latter.' 331. On the last two schemes Sir A. Hardinge expressed the following Sir A. Hardinge to Major Cox, No. 38, dated Slst opinion • August 1904. ' With regard to the first of these schemes, viz., the irrigation of part of Arabistan by five or sis steam pumps, I think it unlikely that His Majesty^s Government would give the Sheikh any direct financial assistance with a view to the execution of this project. i( He could probably, however, obtain such assistance from the Imperial Bank of Persia, and it might be possible that an advance to him by that institution might, under certain conditions, be guaranteed by His Majesty's Government.-' ******** ' The question of the acquisition of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh's lands on the west bank of the Karun by the Sheikh does not seem to me to be one in which His Majesty's Legation could usefully interfere. The Nizam, whom I know well, is an extremely suspicious and close-fisted man, very keen about money, and the mere notion that we were interested in the transfer of his property to the Sheikh would probably make him stand out for a higher price under the impression that he was dealing with a rich foreign party to the transaction.' 832, There are, thirdly, to he considered the British vested interests in Arabistan, which would be affected by the irrigation works. On this point we shall quote Lord Curzon's miniate dated 1st August 1904;:— Minute bt Lord Curzon. Karun Irrigation. As regards the Karun Irrigation scheme, I desire to bring to the notice of the India Office a very important point.99 Any such scheme, if successfully carried out, will practically destroy the Karun as a navigable river, and will put an effectual stopper upon the enterprise of Messrs. Lynch. Even now the depth of water is only 8 feet in many places, and the steamers run aground constantly on their way up to Ahwax. A reduction of even 6 inches in the depth would block navigation for the four months from August to December. Our Indian experience in the Punjab has shown that large navigable rivers, such as the Jumni. Ravi, Chenab^ Sutlej and Jbelum, are drained quite dry for most of the year by big irrigation schemes, and I entertain little doubt that this also would be the fate of the Karun. His Majesty's Government must; therefore, balance the advantages to be dfrived from irrigation against the damage that will be inflicted upon British commerce. It is obvious that, if Messrs. Lynch are pushed out, and if their place is taken by Belgian officials and Dutch engineers or concessionnaires working a big irrigation project in purely selfish or in anti- British interests, we should be very greatly the losers by the change. On the other hand, if we had a substantial or preponderating voice in the control, we might be able to replace one form of commercial activity by another; and might open up another route for navigation to the plains of Arabistan by utilising the Khor Musa, or one of the adjoining inlets which we have recently explored, and by making new roads from thence into the interior. What I have said emphasises the supreme importance of British participation and joint control in any Karun irrigation scheme, if it is to be started, but conversely also the striking danger to British interests that would result if we were left out of sight in any such enterprise. Perhaps the Foreign Office might see a copy of this note, since the point of view must on no account be lost, and I know the Karun well from personal observation. 333. Such being the large British interests involved, the Poreign Office telegraphed to Sir A. Hardinge on 27th August with reference to his Despatch No. C 'l33, dated 19th July 1904:— ' If such a scheme is to be put into execution it is obviously important that control and management should remain in our hands. We consider that immediate steps should be taken to ascertain how far irrigation works could be carried out on Karun with reasonable prospect of success and without impeding navigation, and that, if enquiry proves satisfactory^ Shah should be encouraged to pursue project under British auspices. It is therefore proposed that engineer of Indian Irrigation service should be sent to Arabistan to investigate, without attract ing undue attention, and report upon project. We could then form more accurate opinion as to its political and financial possibilities. f&lt; Government of India are being consulted on question of furnishing additional £200,000 ; they are also being asked whether they can spare services of competent engineer, if required. ' What are your views and do you see any objection to proposed despatch of engineer? ' 334. Sir A. Hardinge saw no objection to the proposed despatch of an engineer to Arabistan. 335. 'We may then note the following telegraphic correspondence between the Government of India and the Secretary of State :— Telegram, No. 2878-E. A., dated the 4th September 1904. From —His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, ij 0 Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. With reference to Sir A.

He might, should Lorimer be absent, address Wilson, Lynches Agent, who would render assistance, but in that case he should not mention the proposed loan to Persia, but should merely say that as he happened to be coming to Persia he was requested by the Government of India to study the question of the Ahwaz dam and to ascertain the feasibility of Van Roggen's scheme. On his arrival in Persia it is proposed to inform the Persian Government confidentially of the mission of engineers.

If Sir A. Hardinge sees no objection, we think it far preferable to make such a rough survey, but this would not fit in with Lord Lansdowne's idea of a fortuitous visit.

In our telegram of the 4th September, we suggested the deputation.of an expert from India to examine the potentialities of irrigation in this region. We have not yet received a final expression ot your views on this proposal, which we trust will meet with your approval. J Pend- mg such an examination as we contemplate, we feel that any opinion which we may express on the subject must necessarily be of a tentative character. So far, however, as we can at present; judge we incline to believe that the scheme is one which is deserving 6f the support both of His Majesty's Government and of the Government of India, and in which we should be prepared to lend financial assistance. 4. A\ e are equally unable to discnss in dstail the terms on which our support should be lent, until we are in a position to appreciate more clearly the probable scope of the undertak ing. There are certain points, however, which may be noticed at the present stao-e. In his -despatch ISo. 133, dated the l &amp;th July 1904, Sir Arthur Hardinge reported Mods . Naus's suggestion that the intended loan shouldfbe secured both on the revenues accruing from the projected works and on the domains fertilised thereby, and that the transaction should also include an undertaking by the Persian Government that all restrictions on the export of grain •Forwarded by the Minirtor with hi, d Mp .tch fJT, the T Karun valley shoald henceforth be abo- Ko. 44, dated the 20th August 1904 (copy enclosed), usnetu in ins note* ot the 19th August, how ever, we observe that Mons. Naus makes mention of the hypothecation of the crops only, and not of the lands, and, further, that no reference is made to the removal of embargos on the exportation of corn. We consider these points to be important, and would lay stress on the adoption of the terms as stated in Sir Arthur Hardin -despatch of the 1.9th July. 5. We are in full agreement with the view stated by Lord Curzon in his Minute of the 1st August 1904 that, in considering any scheme of irrigation, we must not lose sight of the possibility that the diminution of water caused thereby may render further navigation of the Ivarun impossible. Major Burton in his memorandum has expressed the opinion that this ■result must follow if the barrage at Ahwaz be reconstructed. Though we should not neces sarily regard the prospect of this contingency as precluding us from encouraging projects of the kind contemplated, we hold that it fully justifies our claiming that the irrigation schemes .should be worked on lines approved by us, and that simultaneously with the c.'nchmon of arrangements for their execution we should receive a formal concession of the right to jBobstitute for the thoroughfare which the Karon now provides, such roads, or railways, with suitable maritime termini, as may be requisite for the purposes of our commercial interests in Arabistan. A further concession which might well be demanded is that we should be entitled to full voice in any further schemes for the development of Arabistan by irrigation from the other rivers of the province besides the Karun, such as the Kerkha, Shaur, Diz, or Jerrahi Eivers; and that, should it be necessary to obtain financial assistance from non-Persian sources, the British Government or British firms should have the preference. For the grant of such undertakings there is obviously full justification. The opening of the Karun to navigation was obtained through British influence. The trade which now passes by its waters is practically entirely British. The bulk of the traffic is in the bands of the British firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. We have also taken the principal part in the development of the land routes by which the merchandise thus imported is subsequently distributed. The road from Ahwaz to Ispahan was built by a British firm, and a British company is now arranging to open up another line of communication to the north by virtue of a concession which they hold from the Shah^s Government. 6. Apart from the considerations to which we have just referreji, there are other factors which give us a special position. The proposals which have been referred to us purport, we ■understand, to emanate from the Central Government at Tehran. Similar projects, how- 1 Enclosure No. 1. ' everj as wil1 1)6 s ^ eD fr . om L i eute nant Lorimer's lettersf have been considered by the Sheikh of Mohammerah. This Chieftain is entitled to full consideration in connection with the scheme, which could not be executed without his consent—a consent which there would doubtless be no difficulty in persuading him to withhold, should there be any doubt as to the advantage to himself .or to us. The question of occupancy and proprietary rights in the soil of Arabistan formed the subject of discussion between the Sheikh and the Shah m 1902, and the reconcilia tion of the interests of the local tribes and of the Government at Tehran is a matter which may cause some difficulty in connection with the proposed undertaking. 7. A further point which requires consideration is that of the irjanner i i which the loan should be disbursed. W e should have little confidence in the alloiment of the loan to the purpose for which it is intended if the money actually passed through the hands of any Persian official, and we consider that the only practical way of securing our object is that a [896911)] DD102 suitable agreement be made with some reliable firm of contractors, and that the money stiould be paid direct to the firm in adjustment of their accounts. This^ we infer from Mons. Nausea note of the 19th August, would be acceptable to the Persian Government. 8. We assume that His Majesty's Government will be prepared to share equally with th© Indian Government the liability on account of the capital and interest on the loan, and our agreement to provide a portion of the funds is subject to thaft Condition. Whether or not it should form a part of the loan of £500,000 which has formed the subject of negotiation between the British and Persian Governments during the past eighteen months, and of which a sum of £300,000 has already been advanced, does not appear to us to be a matter of great importance. We think, however, that, as the purpose for which the loan is to be made is different, and as the security on which it wall be granted is distinct, it will be preferable that the present advance should be regarded as a separate transaction from that relating to the loan required for general purposes/'103 APPENDIX.

Dependency of the Chaab Tribe. There appear to be two separate questions involved in the dispute at present pending between the Governments of Persia and Turkey on the subject ot Moharnmerah. The one is the dependency of the tribe of Chaab. The other the right of territory to certain lands, upon which portions of the tribe have settled. In discussing the question of the dependency of the Chaab, it will not be Dependency of the tribe ef chaab. necessary to _ follow throuohout with any sustained minuteness the history and movements of the tribe. The events which afford arguments to support the claims of either Government to their allegiance alone require to be particu larized. A skeleton outline connecting these events together will suffice for the remainder of their history. It is not questioned then by Persia, but that at the period of the conclu- t, , sion of the treaty between Sultan Moorad h,s,oty ot tta tt,be - and Shah Tahmasp, the Chaab were bona fide subjects of the Turkish Government, for they are known at that time, and , even lon^ subsequently, to liave dwelt in Originally Turkish subjects. p , .i/ 1 ,, « ^ w &gt; the marshes at the contiuence of the Tigris and Euphrates, and like all the neighbouring Arab tribes, to have paid to the Government of Bussorah a tribute named the Meeri Kalameyah for the right of pasturing tbeir buffaloes upon Turkish lands. The question of dependency becomes first open to dispute, when, about the year A. D. 1683, the Chaab, owing to a season of unusual drought, deserted the marshes of Wasit, and migrated to the southward, fixing cheir abodes in . the tract of countrv, which at that time Migration to Guban. ^ formed the delta of the KaroOQ. It is contended by Persia that as the lands which the Ohaab now occupied were situated within the territorial limits of Khuzistan, the tribe must be held,, in virtue of their immigration, to have transferred their allegiance to the Persian crown. Turkey, on the contrary, alfirms that neither were the lands, upon which the tribe settled within the Persian territory nor supposing this point to be conceded, could the Chaab have suddenly denationalised themselves by „ . J , merely crossing the frontier. She further Continued dependence upon Turkey. , i. n i « shows, that practically the dependency of the tribe upon Bussorah remained after the immigration precisely the same as before that event; for the same amount of Meen Kalam.eyah was paid by the Chaab to the Turkish Government for pasturage on the banks of the Guban, as had been exacted for their old lands in the Wasit marshes, and the annual dress of investiture from Bussorah was continued to the Sheikh with out any reference to his change of residence. Putting aside for the present the question of territorial right to the lands upon which the Chaab settled, it is clear to me, that on their first immigration to the district of Guban, and for 50 or 60 years afterwards the tribe were regarded as Turkish subjeets. Their numbers were too small and their country too poor to attract much attention, but in those essential points which are considered by the Arabs to prove dependency, the payment of the Meeri Kalameyah and the annual receipt of a robe of office, it is certain that the Sheikh of the Chaab, as late as the year A D. 1740, continued, as was to be expected, a dependent of the Government of Bussorah. The only connection, indeed, of the tribe with Persia up to this time was that they made certain annual presents of horses, butter, etc., etc., to the Afshar Chief of Doorak on account of fees for pasturage on the immediate bank of the Guban branch of the Karoon, the lands in that quarter having been previous to their immigration in possession of effects of the^ Afshar tribe, who as the Chaab advanced fell back and rejoined their brethren on the Jerrahi. [S9o9FD] ee106 Between the years A. D. 1740 and 1750 further changes took place in the location of the Chaab involving to a certain extent their political dependency. Hitherto the Sheikh had resided in the town of Guban situated on the left bank of the eastern branch of the Karoon, and the chief strength of the tribe was concentrated in that vicinity, but about the year 1745 the course of the Gnban river became obstructed. The ■Cross into the Persian Temtoiy. Karoon poured its waters through the Bamisheer and HafFar channels, and the lands along the old or eastern bed of the river were thrown almost entirely out of cultivation. It thus became necessary for the tribe to seek new habitations and while detached parties, accordingly, settled along the Haffar and on the borders of the Shat-el-Arab employed as Fellahs by the Turkish proprietors of the lands, the main body of the Chaab, under their famous leader Sheikh Salman, crossed over from the Guban to the Jerrahi river dispossessed the Afshars of the town of Doorak and its dependent territory, and obtained a permanent footing in a country to which the right of Persia was unquestioned. The political condition of the Cuaab now underwent a rapid and remark- „ + -v , ... c , able change. They had always enjoyed Condition of the tribe under Sheikh Salman. \ ^ Y c i • an element or strength m their common attachment to the person of their hereditary chief, and as they had also during their residence in Guban increased greatly in numbers, it only required that the individual at their head should be possessed of skill and vigor, sufficient to profit by the direction of t^eir combined energies, to ensure their elevation from the condition of unknown buffalo feeders, into some thing like a real substantive power. Sheikh Salman was admirably fitted to the purpose; endowed with every quality becoming his high station he availed himself to the utmost of the attachment of his followers, both to aggrandize himself and to promote their prosperity, and after a long life and an exposure to many vicissitudes, he may be said to have ultimately succeeded in procuring virtually indent. f 0 ' his , tribe virtual enjoyment ot independence. It was one of his earliest cares, after consolidating the power of the Chaab upon the Jerrahi, tore-establish bis ancestral capital of Guban, and for this purpose he threw a dam across the Karoon at the point of its bifurcation, and thus forcing a part of the waters into the old channel, restored fertility to the deserted lands at the same time he pursued on all sides a systematic course of territorial encroachment. His acquisitions from Persia, extended to the Hindian river and northward along the Karoon to the vicinity of Bandlikir, while from the Governments of Baghdad and Bussorah, partly by intimidation and partly by bribery, he obtained for his tribe possession of the island of Abadan of the territory of Dowasir on the right bank of the Shat-el-Arab, and also of a tract of country of north of the Haffar canal and along the course of the Shat-el-Arab, compri sing the districts of Mohammerah, Haffar and Tamar. It is not to be supposed that this creation of a formidable and almost Persia and Turkey fail in altempls to rednce them, independent POWer On the shores of the Persian Gulf was viewed with indiffer ence by either Persia or Turkey. Various attempts were made by either Government to reduce Sheikh Salman to obedience; but as their mutual jealousies prevented them from acting in concert, their success was of a very partial nature. Kerim Khan in A. D. 1757 failed entirely in an attempt to penetrate to Guban, and in 1765 he only so far succeeded as temporarily to overrun the country. He never received homage from Sheikh Salman and after his withdrawal, the Chaab resumed possession of their lands entirelv regardless of his authority. Turkey on the other hand, during the plenitude of Sheikh Salman's power, would have been glad without a contest to have waived her claim to supremacy over the Chaab ; but she was obliged in order to preserve the indep( i ndence of Bussorah, to attempt the recovery from her rebellious subjects, of the districts which they had seized on the right bank of the Shat-el-Arab. An action took place, accordingly, in the latter end of the year 1765 between the Chaab and Turkish fleets off the mouth of the Haffar canal. Fortune again favored Sheikh Salman and although the hostilities on this occasion had in their origin an exclusive reference to the attemptedexpulsion of the Cliaab from Dowasir, the eiuctnoipation of the tvihe frovn, any further political dependency npdn Bussorah may he regarded as the actual and legitimate issue of the contest. Another circumstance, which at this time tended to complete the with- Founding of FellaMah in the Persian territory. drawal of the Chaab from tile Control of Turkey was the removal of the residence of the Sheikh from the Guhan to the Jerrahi. It occurred in the following manner Kerim Khan, to weaken and distress his adversary, had destroyed the famous dam which divided the waters of the Karoon, and the channel of the Guban had thus a second time become almost dry. When Sheikh Salman accordingly returned after the withdrawal of the Persians and found his capital in ruins and the lands around it deprived of the means of irrigation, he had to make his election between again undergoing the labor and expense of constructing a dam, subject at any moment to destruction by any enemy possessed of superior forces in the field, and permanantly fixing his residence in a more favorable situation, when the water should be his protection rather than his ruin. He adopted the latter course and founded Fellahiah. The founding of Pellahiah being one of the great epochs in Chaab history it may be interesting to observe the general political appearance which the tribe exhibited at that period. About four-fifths of the extent of country occupied by the Chaab was unquestionably Persian territory and the liability of the tribe to pay to the Persian Crown the revenues of these lands, if that power were in a condition to assert its rights, does not appear ever to have been questioned. When the Chaab indeed first came in contact with the Persian Afshars •. . vt . , . t, . and dispossessed them of their lands on Opening of political connexion with rersia ,, the Jerrahi, Sheik Salman for a short time continued to pay to the Walee of Howeizah the same amount of revenue, which had been realized from the former occupants. Kerim Khan's first invasion also was undertaken in consequence of the stoppage of this payment of revenue and the Sheikh actually disbursed a considerable sum to him on his withdrawal. The second Persian invasion it is true was rather a campaign undertaken for the reduction of a rebellious province, than a mere expedition to levy tribute, hut the negotiations which were carried on between Sheikh Salman and the Persian monarch during the progress of hostilities had a general reference to the amount of assessment (or mahyat) to be imposed upon the tribe. It was never contended, in fact, but that the Chaab were liable to the Persian Crown for the rent of the lands which they cultivated on the Jerrahi, the Bindian and the upper part of the course of the Karoon, and I infer from the increased connection which is observable between the Persian Government and the Chaab, subsequently to the foundation of Eellahiah, that the distinction between this liability for the payment of rent as tenants of the soil and of a fixed tribute as subjects, was gradually lost sight of; and that the Chaab residing for the most part in the Persian territory governed by a Chief whose capital of Pellahiah was within the well established frontier of the province of Fars, and subjected almost yearly to demands for revenue from the Persian Crown, came to be regarded as Turkish colonists who had emigrated to the Persian territory and by a continued residence of many years had naturalized themselves as Persian subjects. The arguments of the Turkish Government in favor of its uninterrupted claim to the allegiance of the Chaab are Turkey maintains her claim. simply these, that it had never made any formal renunciation of its rights; that the Chaab, notwithstanding the removal of the seat of Government to Fellahiah, continued to hold lands upon the Haffar and Shatel-Arab, subject to Bussorah, and even to pay the revenues of these lands to the Governor of that city: that the Meer-i-Kalamiyah for merly payable by the tribe was merely withheld because the district of Guban, to which it particularly referred, had become desert, and that a robe of office was frequently also furnished to the Sheikh of Chaab, long after his settlement on the Jerrahi, in accordance with the old fashion of annual investiture.108 To me, I confess, it appears that at the time of Sheikh Salman deceas'se and ever since, the Chaabhave been virtually independent of Bussor.ih and that the notion of the indefeasibility of their allegiance to Turkey is an invention of late years, brought forward as a counterpoise to the claims of Persia upon Mohammerah. A rapid sketch of the relations between Chaab and Bussorah during the last century will be necessary at the same time to show the grounds upon which this view is adopted. There has never been, then, any question in the country, but that the lands watered by the Shat-el-Arab, th e R ,^':» t b u fr nTatley '' d chMb ^ through its entire course, are dependent upon Bussorah. An unbroken claim of evidence may be brought to prove this, from the time of the building of Bussorah to the present day. When the Chaab, accordingly, interfered with these lands, they either acted as conquerors in open defiance of all rights, or they obtained patents from the Government, granting them a farm of the property, subject to the public liabilities ; or when the lands were exempt from taxation in virtue of free grants to individuals from the Sublime'Porte, they dealt directly with the proprietors, sometimes acting as tenants and receiving the regulated share of produce (one-fourth) for the labor of cultivation, sometimes buying the free hold right to the property : but more usually taking forcible possession without any respect to the previous tenures. None of the various relations however which the Chaab thus bore to the Bussorah Government, as occupants of the banks of the Shat-el-Arab, appear to me to indicate their national dependency. On the contrary, as they have continued almost uninterruptedly to pay to the Government of Bussorah the rent of the lands of Hnffar and Tamar above Mohamrnerah, which they obtained by a grant from Sooleman Pasha of Baghdad, while they have long ceased all other payments, the presumption is that they have considered themselves liable on that account only, and that they must have thus regarded themselves in the light of foreigners holding 'lurkish lands either in farm or by riffht of occupancy. The political connexion moreover which has subsisted between Chaab and Indicative of anything but dependence. BuSSOiall, since the d^atll of feheikh Salman, to times comparatively modern, so far from being one of protection and dependency has been marked by open and almost constant hostilitv.

Sheikh Ghais,* the son of Ghadhban, who succeeded to the chiefship on the death of his uncle. Sheikh Mahomed, the brother of that chief, restored it is true, the ancient limits of the Chaab territory, as established by Sheikh Salman retaining possession of nothing higher up the Shat-el-Arab than the district of lamar; but he was influenced in this withdrawal rather bv a disinclination to come m collision with the growing power of the Muntefik tribe, and b y the necessity of preparation against Persia, than by any respect for the rights or deference to the wishes of the Turkish Government; at the same time or shortlv afterwards he built a fort upon either side of the Haffar canal, with the view, as it is stated, of protecting his frontier against the Muntefik, and he • See genealogical table on page 1, from which it appears that Ghais (or Gl.eyth) was a descendant of Sheikh Salman, not a son of lihadhban.109 entrusted the defence of the post to hrs confidential servant, Meerdow. It was a place of no consequence at first, but under the rule of Hajee Jaaber, the son of Meerdow, its favourable situation attracted commerce, and it rapidly rose into eminence as the mercantile town of Mohammerab. Sheikh Thamir, the jounger brother and successor of Sheikh Gbais, has cultivated during the last 30 years a more protSu Thamir al0ne 8ll0W8 a di9p08ition t0 court friendly connexion with the Turkish Gov ernment than any of his predecessors, for he appears to have been fully sensible of the advantage of an uncertain depen dency in deterring Persia from attempting to increase the extent, or to sys tematize the character of her interference in the affairs of the Chaab tribe, without accordingly in any essential point admitting the authority of Bussorah, he has frequently made presents of money and horses to the Turkish Governor, independently of the rent of the lands on the Shat-el-Arab, and he has been gratified to receive occasionally, from the Moosselim a khelaat or dress of honour. The first direct exercise of the power of Turkey in the affairs of the Chaab, however, in modern times, v\as the attack on Mohammerah by Ali Pasha in A. D. 1837, and his subsequent appointment of Sheikh Abdool Razaq to the Government of the tribe in the place of Sheikh Thamir. To justify this measure, the old assertion of the right of Turkey to the allegiance of the Chaab has been revived, and it remains a ' qucestio vexata ' to the present day. But if the Chaab have thus become virtually independent of Turkey, it may be inferred that they must, to the same extent, have become virtually dependent upon Persia, and it is necessary therefore for the verification of this point, that „ . the preceding sketch of their relations Comparison with the above of the connexion -.li m i • c 01 m t during the same period of the Chaab with Persia. Wltll J-lirkey, SinCC tile deatll 01 DneiKll Salman, should be compared with the nature and progress of the connexion of the tribe during the same period with Persia. Kerim Khan then withdrew his forces without coming to any definite arrangement with the Chaab Sheikh, regarding the liabilities of the tribe and during the wars between the Zend and Kajar dynasties which broke out shortly a pecuniary liability attaches to the tribe, but after the establishment of iellahiah as nndefinai in its nature and extent. capital of the Chaab, the matter of course escaped discussion. Prom the commencement of the reign of Agha Mahomed Khan the Peeshkush of the Chaab seems indeed to have been reckoned by the Government of Pars, as a part of the annual income of the province, and to have been demanded accordingly; but still there was great irregularity in the payment, and a still greater uncertainty as to the amount of the liability. As far as I can discover, the annual tribute was calculated by the Persian Government at about 4,000 tomans, such being the aggregate amount at which the former Afshar occupants of the banks of the Jerrahi had been assessed, but the sum realized did not, it is said, on an average, exceed one-fourth of this true or assumed liability. In the time of Eatteh Ali Shah the first attempt was made to exact a regular and as far as it went a defined payment, the annual salary of Hassan Khan, one of the chief officers of the Shiraz Court, amounting to 1 ,000 tomans, being drawn by berrat upon the Chief of Eellahiah. But it does not by any means appear that this was considered by Persia as a full acquit tance of the liabilities of the Chaab, or that it was ever settled upon what par ticular account the sum was levied. On the contrary independently of Hassan Khan's salary, a year rarely passed without presents of horses and money to a considerable amount being made by the Chaab Sheikh to the Governor of Shiraz and when Mahomed Ali Mirza in 1818 marched against Pellahiah,he demanded and received 13,000 tomans from Sheikh Thamir on account, as it was alleged, of accumulated arrears of revenue. Persia, nevertheless, can hardly, I think, substantiate a legal claim to the dependency of the Chaab bv the precedents h.°Xm^^ afOr '' 1O ° SPCriOd ' h0W ° t ' &gt; of tbis period. She certainly in practice was more closely connected than Turkey rS969PD] TF110 with the country; but her relation to the Chaab at tbe same time bore the character of intimidation on the one hand and of concsssion on the other, rather than of the assertion and fulfilment of the acknowledged rights of a superior Government: no attempt was ever made by Persia to assess the lands, to appoint a Governor of the tribe, to levy troops for the defence of the state, or in fact to exercise any of the legitimate functions of sovereignty. She was content on ordinary occasions to accept of a Feeshkush, which the Chaab now assert to have been in lieu of the rent of the Persian lands in their possession, and when she had adequate means at her disposal she violently extorted as much as the Chaab had the means of paying. Since the reign of the present Shah it must be admitted that the proceedings T ., , . _ - r&gt; • v v. ,. Persia in regard to Chaab have been Latterly control of Persia has been complete. i x i * i -i , conducted m a manner more clearly to establish and to realize a right of sovereignty. She has displaced and appointed Governors, exacted hostages, garrisoned Cbaab towns with Persian troops, levied an annual revenue, and latterly she has undertaken to assess the lands according to the value of the produce in the same manner as is customary in other parts „ . , , ' of the empire. 13ut whether these acts Pressnt state of the question of dependency. , ,, , , may be considered to have legalized the former partial and undefined dependency, or whether they are to be regarded as mere aggravations of trespass upon Turkish rights can only be decided by determining to what extent a claim to allegiance may exist ' de jure ' after it has ceased ' de facto.' I have heard the claim of Turkey to the lands of Guban frequently insisted on as a strong ground in favour of her right to the dependency of the Chaab; but it appears to me that an undue consequence has been attached to this point. 'J hat the Cliaab were Turkish subjects at the period of Sultan MuracTs treaty with Shah Tahmasp, which in its definition of the territorial ri^ht of either Government is supposed to be still in force is unquestioned. That the tribe has bsen virtually independent of Bussorah for the last century is equally a matter of notoriety. How then does it affect the present question of depen dency whether intermediately between these periods the tribe resided in Persian or Turkish territory. Eight of territory. I now proceed to examine the right of territory respectively possessed by Eight Of territory. Tu r ke y 1 and Per * ia ' to tl,e countries at the embouchures of the Euphrates and at Karoon. The treaties of 1822 and 1746 refer back to the convention between Sultan Murad and Shah Tahmasp for the definition of the territorial limits of the two Empires, and unfortunately I have never been able to obtain a copy of that document. I have understood, however, that a broad geographical distinction is alone contained in it, between the possessions of Persia and Turkey in their Boundaries of the two Empire8 irak-i-Arab and c oj 1 terminous southern territory by the Khuzistan. attribution of Khuzistan to the former power and of Irak-i-Arab to the latter ; and in an age when maps and surveys were unknown it appears to me, I confess, that this is the only territorial division that could have been conveni- ently adopted. I shall assume therefore that the question of right is thus correct]v stated Basis of geographioai duttactioo between the and endeavour m consequenoe to fix the provinces. ti ii6 geographical limits of tliG two pro vinces. The rule of appropriation from the time of authentic history appears, then to have been simply this; that the lands deriving water from the Tigris and Euphrates belonged to Irak-i-Arab, while the country along the banks' of the Karoon, or deriving water from the Karoon, was within the limits of Khuzistan, nothing perhaps could be more simple in principle than this distribution : but nothing could be more fluctuating and perplexed than it has proved in practice, owing to the numerous changes in the courses of the rivers. /Ill Thus in the earliest ages the Bamishir was, I believe, one of the true channels of the Karoon, but when the science of geography revived under the enJighlened rule of the Caliphs of Baghdad and an attempt was made to fix the demarkation of the various provinces of the Empire, it is quite certain from the united authorities of all authors, that the Karoon joining with the Jerrahi in a large marsh near the site of the modern city of Guban, disembogued into the sea in a delta about the Khur-i-Moosa. There is no trace in the early Arab geograph- Practical application of it in marking the old erS of any Connection between the KarOOll line of frontier. and Bamishir. On the contrary, in the maps of Jeghani, which date from the 4th century of Islam, the line dividing Khuzistan and Irak-i-Arab is drawn from the sea coast, midway between the mou'h of the Bamishir and the Khur-i-Moosa and is prolonged in a north western direction, parallel to the course of the Shat and Tigris, and at a sufficient distance from these rivers to shut out from Khuzistan all the lands upon their banks deriving water from them, as high as the 32 degree of latitude. At this period, as is expressly stated by numerouft authors, the Bamishir river w r as the left branch of the Euphrates, and the lands receiving water from it were consequently included in Irak-i-Arab. About the 6th century of the Hejra we find the first notiee of the dis- Rendered fluctuating and perplexed from the emboguement of a branch of the K arOOU change in the courses of the rivers. ^ n | 0 t j )e Bamishir, but it is Worthy of remark that the latter river was not the less considered the eastern exit of the Euphrates, from which I infer that the water must have run from the Shat through the Haffar into the Bamishir instead of as at present from the Ivaroon through the Haffar into the Thai. Of course, under sueh circumstances, the country along the Karoon to the point of its junction with the Bamishir would alone be gained by Khuzistan that along the Haffar and the Bamishir, ' drinking ' the water of the Euphrates, would continue to belong to Bussorah. But by degree the waters of the Karo m appear to have altosretber deserted the eastern branch, and then it must have been, that the whole body o^ the river, flowing into the Bamishir, not merely filled that bed exclusively with its own stream, but forced its way also into the Shat, through the Haffar canal, and thus effected an important change in the limits of the Persian Empire; for, according to the old distribution, the lands along the Haffar and the Bamishir, would, under such circumstances, become subordinate to Khuzistan. If, in deed, we follow the original principle of allotment, we must admit that wdien Sheikh Salman threw his dam across the Karoon to replenish the Guban river, he restored the lands of the Haffar and Bamishir to Turkey, for the pressure of the water of the Karoon being diminished, the Euphrates doubtless resumed its former course, and again, when Kerim Khan destroyed the dam, he must have recovered these lands for Persia, as the force of the Karoon concentrated in one stream would now prevail over the Euphrates, and appropriate to itself, the channels of the Bamishir and Hatlar. We have, I confess, in modern times, very little proof of the practical Difficulty of verifying the principle in modern Working of this distribution, toi the times. science of geography has been almost extinct in the east, since the age of the Ohenghizian Kings. Up to that period, certainly the towns near the Persian Gulf, vxhich are mentioned in oriental authors as dependent on Bussorah and on Khuzistan, are those respectively watered b^ the Euphrates and the Karoon, but shortly before the rise of the Instance 0/departure from it in reference to SuffaVean dynasty, the tOWU of Guban IS lands of Guban. reported in the country, to nave been founded hv emigrants from Bussoran, near the site of the ancient Hasn Mehdi, and to have been placed under the protection of the Government of the former city, which must have thereby extended its political frontier, far beyond its proper geographical limits. A line of Princes reigned in this province it is said for 150 years, dignified hv the name of Pashas, and the authority of the J eh an vamn a Turkish work of thi« period, is brought forward to show, that these Pashas of Guban were subordinate to the Government of Bussorah. As far as 1 can ascertain, thePashas of Guban were actually in power at the period of Sultan Morad's treaty with Shah Tahmasp in A. 1). 1639, but whether tbeir dependence upon Bussorah was really of such a nature, as to entitle the territory, over which they ruled, to be considered an integral part of Irak i-Arab, in opposition to all geographical precjdent, or whether their connexion with the^parent Gov ernment, was ot the same loose and undefined character as that of the Chaab, who succeeded them, is i point which I have not been able to resolve, and, indeed, as the district of Guban has now become a desert, and has thus lost Etiams ava lable for proving the territorial r e hl a11 territorial value, jt 18 06 HO great Con- of Turkey, to lands upon the Snat-^1-Arab, iudepead- S(3tJllPIlC6 to dGt6rniilV6 its Qri^iDSll clopOIl- ently of uiere geographical precedent. dency. Of far more importance is it to the question of frontier at present pending, to find, that from the earliest establish ment of Turkish rule m Mesopotamia, that is from the commencement of the 16th century, the dependence upon Bussorah, and consequently upon Turkey of the lands on the left bank of the Shat-el-Arab, from the sea as far as Girdelan, has been acknowledged and recorded; the famous SuHan Salim, in about A. D. 1512 having conferred tho lands in question in free grant upon four holy men of Bussorah, Sheikh Abdool Salam, Sheikh Ahmed-el- liefahee, Sheikh Habeeb-Ullah, and Sheikh Ibrahim Eodhein, and a great part of the original patents passed under the Sultan's seal, being as it is affirmed still in existence. That three years elapsed from the date of Sultan Murad's treaty with Shah Tahmasp before the Turkish authority was fairly and permanently established in Bussorah is not I think of any material consequence. The present right of Turkey to the town, according to that treaty, as a depend ency of Baghdad and a part of Irak-i-Arab has never been subject of dispute, and if the claim to Bussorah be conceded, the right to all the lands dependent upon it will follow as a matter of course. Now the land upon which the town of Mohammerah was subsequently built was unquestionably one of these Mobammerah included in these lands and in pos- /lorAQrwIrki-irti'oo Tf j ; j j S e SS ioa of Turkey until within the last few vea.e. dependencies. It was specified, indeed, as 1 understand in one of Sultan Salim's grants. It continued in the hands of the descendants of the original grantees for above two centuries, it was then resumed by the Buss &gt;rah Government on some trivial pretext with many other lands in the vicinity ; and it was subsequently farmed together with the lands of HafRrand Tamar by Suleiman Pasha of Baghdad, as I have previously stated, to the Chaab Chief, Sheikh Salman. Turkey is thus able to show her practical exercise of supremacy over the lands of Mohammerah for a consecutiye series of above 250 years. But this is not all, so incontestable were her rights considered to be, that the Chaab, long after they had become virtually independent of Bussorah, continued to pay the rent or land tax instituted by Suleiman Pasha for the distric ts of Tamar, Hatfar and Mohammerah. Three hundred tons of dates are indeed still yearly handed over to the officers of the Bussorah Government as the share of produce of the two former farms, and it is only since the forcible occupation of the town of Mohammerah by the Persian troops,, that the payment of the annual land tax of 500. Karoosh (about £ 40) for the ground upon which the town is built, has been discontinued. That Turkey is unable in the same conclusive way to prove the acknowledg ment of her claim to the remainder of the territory stretching down along the Shat from Mohammerah to the sea, is owing merely to the lands in this quarter having been exempt from taxation, agreeably to Sultan Salim's patent, when the Chaab violently wrested them from the possession of the descendants of Sheikh Abdool Salim, the original grantee. But although the question of the political dependency of Mohammerah and the adjoining territory may be thus considered as a mere matter of argument, to be proved almost to demonstration in favour of Turkey the geographical appropriation of the lands, is by no means so easily disposed 'of. 0 0 When Sultan Salim bestowed the grounds of Haffar and Mohammerah upon u ^ ^ .

But since the last destruction of the dam of the Karoon and At present owing to Clianeres in the course of the accordingly from a period loU 0, anterior river, it belongs geographically to Khuzistan to the foundation of the present town of Mohamraerah, it must be evident that according to the old basis of distribu tion, the lands being watered by the Karoon, which has a second time appropriated to its own stream the bed of the Haflar, must belong geographically to Persia. I know not upon what grounds Persia claims the left bank of the Shat-el- Arab, unless, indeed, it be that the lands were at one time occupied by the Chaab, whom she regards as her subjects. The right of Turkey politically and geographically to all the country which is dependent for its cultivation on the water of the Shat-el-Arab, is, 1 think, unquestionable. The frontier between the two Empires ought to he defined, according to • sketch of the frontier as it should be drawn in 'con- geographical precedent, by a line drawn fornaity with the basis of the old distinction between lengthways tlirOUgh the island of Abadan Irak-i-Arab and Khuzistan. ji •, , . . trom the sea on its southern side to its north-western point and then from the angle on the right bank of the Haffar canal formed by the junction of that stream with the Shat-el-Arab midway between the two rivers to the desert from whence it would run up, along the old boundary parallel to the river, and at a distance of some six or seven miles from its banks passing between two ruined land marks called the Kooshk-i-Ujum and These land marks are in the desert about 7 miles Kooshk-i-Bussorah and proceeding on to the nortn by east of Bussorah. village of the Sowaib upon the Kerkha. Above this point the determination of the line if contested, would be attended with great difficulty, for the whole of the country, inhabited at present by the Beni Lam is within the geographical limits of Khuzistan, while on the other hand, at the time of Sultan Murad's treaty, Howeizah is said to have paid tribute to Bussorah, but fortunately these questions are not subject of dispute. The line which I have thus marked in accordance with what ap- Gives to Turkey all the lands oa the Shat-el-Arab pears to be strict geographical prO- ani to Persia-iiuhamiacrah. pr^etv, has a due regard, I think, to the claims both of Turkey and Persia. Turkey, indeed, on the grounds of the alleged dependency upon Bussorah of the Pashas of Guban, claims the dry bed of the eastern branch of the Karoon, as her boundary in that direc tion, and she desires to draw a line from the point of division of that channel from the Karoon, where the ruins are still to be seen of the Sheikh Salman's dam, directly across to the land marks of Koishk-i-Ujum and Kooshk-i-Busso- rah. The entire tract, however, between the old Guban river and the immediate vicinity of the banks of the Sliat-el-Arab is a desert and hardly worth disputing. The only valuable professions which she would lose in confining herself to the frontier which 1 have traced, would be the lands alons: both banks of the Haffar canal where the double town of Mohamraerah is now situated, but to these lands she cannot advance anv valid geographical claim, and for many years they have been practically lost to her. Modern History of Moliammerah. I propose to conclude my memorandum with a few observations on the modern history of Mohammerah. Modern history of Mohammerab. The town as I have stated, was built in about A. D. 1812, by Meerdow , and his son Hajee Yoossoof, according to Ko!SSeik1. ,1,e t ' O ' 0rtS the orders. o£ Sheikh Ghais, at the time when the Chaab, withdrew before the Montefik from the left bank of the Shat. The original construction was a mere petty fort in either side of the Haffar canal, which at this point is about 150 yards across. [S969rD] gg1 114 Hajee Yoossoof from the oommencement resided in the fort on the north ern bank of Haffar, and as he very early evinced a disposition (relying on the strength of his situation) to disregard the authority of the Sheikh of Fellahiah, Heir to the Chiefslrp of the Chaab stationed at the next heir to the Ghiefsllip of the Koot-ei-sheikh. tribe, was usually stationed in the fort on the southern bank of the canal to bold him in check, and to administer the Chaab affairs upon this, their western frontier. During the life-time of Sheikh Ghais, his brother Mobashir thus acted as his deputy on the Haffar, and when Mobashir subsequently ruled at Fellahiah, the third brother Thamir succeeded to the command of Mohammerah. Tbamir in the same w ay on his elevation to the Chiefship of the tribe, placed his nephew Faris at Mohammerah, and since Faris has been transferred to Fellahiah, his brothers Hashim and Mahomed have suc cessively been stationed on the Haffar. The fort on the southern bank of the river, although a part of the original Mohamrnerah, has thus received the name ' par excellence ' of Koot-el-Sheikh, or ' the Sheikh castle,'* while that on the northern This place of hand fide dependency .f FeikhUh. ^ank has alone to the present day retained its old designation. The Koot-el-Sheikh being directly subordinate to Fellahiah has followed in all its changes or modi fications the political dependency of the tribe of Chaab, but the Chiefs residing in the fort of Mohammerah have sometimes acted without reference to the su preme Sheikh, and as it is this northern fort that has been the great object of (• contention between Turkey and Persia, it is necessary to trace its fortunes with some care. Hajee Jaabir succeeded his brother Hajee Yoossoof in the government of Chief of Mohammerah endeavours to be independent the fort of Mohammerah about 25 years agO. of Cliaab - As the son of a slave of the Chaab Sheikh and at the head of a small, Chaab colony, he could not of course pretend openly to assert his independence of the authority of Fellahiah. On several occasions, indeed, he furnished his share of the Chaab levy to enable the Sheikh of the tribe to meet the demands of Persia, and he also sent men to Sheikh Thamir's assistance when Fellahiah was threatened by a hostile force, but still these proofs of allegiance appear to have been but partially and reluctantly given. He set tled directly with the Government of Bussorah for the land rent of the town of Mohammerah, and he made occjasional presents to the Persian Governors of Dez- fool and Howeizah, unknown to the Chief of Fellahiah showing as I think that his jealously of the Chaab Sheikh was only equalled by his fears of Persia and Turkey His real object no doubt was independence, and he was quite content to be permitted its enjoyment without any effective declaration of his views. Mohammerah, however, swelling from a petty fort into a considerable town had between the years 1830 and 1837, risen into so much consequence, as an em porium of trade, that it attracted general attention, and Sheikh Jaabir's anoma lous position began of course to be submitted to enquiry. Ali Pasha of Baghdad desirous of protecting Bussorah from any further injury to its revenue, consider ing Sheikh Jabir in no other light than as a servant of 'the Chaab, and believing that the land on which Hohammerah was built was unequivocally Turkish pro^ x Mchammerah ruined by Ali Pasha. perty, marched accordingly against the place in A. D. 1837, took it by assault and plundered all the merchandise that had been stored in its warehouses. Having levelled the walls of Mohammerah, carried off the guns and left the' place de^ fenceless, he followed up his success as I have before mentioned by a demons tration against Fellahiah, which compelled Sheikh Thamir to fly to Koweit and placed the dependency of the Chaab tribe altogether in his hands. Jaabir in the Hajee Jaabir, the chief throws himself on the pro- meantime had fled to Bushire and had •ef..., endeavoured to interest the Government of Shiraz in his behalf, urging with some plausibility (though as it appears now for the first time) that as Mohammerah was watered by theKaroon it must be regarded as Persian property, but his solicitations were inopportune and accordingly were fruitless, and he was thus obliged to return to his dis mantled town and rely on his own resources for further protection About the same time tbe Turkish troops being withdrawn to Baghdad, Sheikh115 Thamir also returned from Koweit, and having displaced Sheikh Abdul Sheikh Thamir of Fellahiah declares his dependen- Hazaq, who had beGn left in the GrO' cy on Turkey. _ verument of Eellahiah by the Turks, he signed for his own personal ends a convention with the Pasha of Baghdad, securing himself in occupation of the Sheikh-Ship, and pledging the allegiance of his tribe to Bussorah. But Sheikh Jaabir, who could not so easily forgive the destruction of his flourishing town by the Turks,, refused to be bound by this convention. He now asserted and maintained his independence of Thamir and threatened if interfered with to call in the protection of the Persians. I believe that the direct political connexion between Mohammerah and Persia dates no further back that Hajee Jaablr's visit to Bushire in 1837, and how much of cordiality or even of practical dependency there was in the connex ion which was thus formed, may be comprehended from the fact that when four years afterwards the Moetimed-ed-Dowlah for the first time visited Mohamme rah at the head of a Persian army with a view of marching on Pellahiah from the southward (its only vulnerable point of attack) Hajee Jaabir was afraid to Persia establishes her authority over both Moham- trust llimsslf in the hands of his acknoW- merah^and chaab. ledged Chief, but again fled to Koweit leaving his nephew Hajee Mahomed to act as his deputy with the so-called friendly Persian army. Mohammerah in the meantime had been rebuilt and had recovered much of its former consequence, so that the Moetimed-ed-Dowlah seeing at once the advisability of retaining his hold upon this place, determined to leave an officer to reside on the part of the Persian Government with Sheikh Jaabir, whose absence he affected to consider a matter of no moment, and subsequent events have tended most singularly to promote the accomplishment of the ends he had in view in making this arrangement. Hajee Jaabir, having returned to Mohammerah after the withdrawal of the Moetimed-el-Dowlah, sent his nephew Hajee Mahomed to Eellahiah to concert measures, as it is said, with Sheikh Earis who had been placed in the Chaab Gov ernment by the Persians to the exclusion of his uncle Thamir, for their mutual Blood feud between the Chiefs of Fellahiah and Support and protection in the CVCnt of a Mohammerah. second Persian invasion. This young man shortly after his arrival was shot by the Chaab Sheikh, as a rebel to hi» Chief, and a traitor to his tribe. The flames of the strife broke out again of course, more fiercely than ever between the two Chaab families. Hashim, the brother of Earis, and Governor of Koot-el-Sheikh, made an attempt to cross the Haffar and drive Jaabir out of Mohammerah, and the latter Chief was thus obliged for his own protection, to put in execution his long threatened requisi tion for the presence of a Persian garrison. A detachment of troops from Dezfool Temporary occupation of Mohammerah by Persian accordingly OCCUpied the town Of Moliam- troops at sheikh jaabii requisiiion. merah in the spring of 1843, and remained there until a few months back, when Jaabir relieved from his fear of attack from Koot-el-Sheikh contrived, by showing the difficulty of their subsistance to dispense with their further services. But the Persian officer with a small escort officer continues to reside there on the part of continues to reside in Mohammerah as the Persian Government. the representative of his Government, and Sheikh Jaabir, whose fears are now thoroughly aroused as well by the experience the Persians have had of the accessibility of Mohammerah as by the invitation of his enemy Sheikh Thamir to Eerzeroom acts towards him not certainly with any real good will but still in a manner calculated to avoid the possible for feiture of his claim to the protection of Persia on occasion of necessity, and at the same time to deprecate the displeasure or hostility of that Government. The present fort of Mohammerah which has been rebuilt since Ali Pasha's _ , ,, r , , visit in 1837 is a ' quadrangular' enclo- Fresent appearance of Mohammerah. » , j i i r™ sure of about 350 yards by 300. The mud wall which surrounds it, is of the most ordinary description, and it is entirely destitute of artillery. It possesses only one caravanserai for the accom modation of the merchants, the other buildings contained in the enclosure are the rude huts, composed of mud and reeds, which form the ordinary habitations of the Arabs.116 There were 12 boats anchored in the creek when I visited the place, which had lately disembarked their cargoes. A a e 0 ra e ' Turkish brig of war lies off the Haffar's canal, with the avowed object of preventing the boats which enter the Shat-el-. A^-ab laden with Indian goods, from turning into that channel, but the obstruction is easily evaded. Ihe boats bound for Mohammerah now either sail i|p the Bamishir river, instead of the Shat or if they draw too much water to admit of their passing the bar at the mouth of the former river, they land their cargoes on the island of Abadan, a few miles below the mouth of the Haffar &lt;knal, and then passing the Turkish guardship empty, they anchor off Moham- jHerah and bring their goods across by land. Mohammerah has thriven being a free port, and it has owed this advantage r Hitherto a free port. to the uncertainty of its dependency. If Probability of losing this advantage on the settle- Turkish authority were acknowledged, the ment of the dispute at present pending. • i. j „ i i c i s import duties would ot course be put at once on a par with those of Bussorah, If, on the other hand, the power of Persia were'sufficiently established to disregard conciliation, I imagine that an attempt would be made to institute a tariff similar to that in operation at Bushire and Bunder Abbas. Mohammerah would in either event assuredly de cline, for in Arab estimation it has no natural advantages that I am aware of superior^ to those of Bussorah. Sheikh Jaabir no doubt is sensible of this, and his anxiety for the prosperity of his town is thus equally interested with his own personal ambition in protracting a settlement of the question. His pre- dominent feeling, however, at present is hostility to Sheikh Thamir, and his family, and as blood has now been shed between them, it will be in vain, I think, to look for permanency in any arrangement that shall make Mohammerah sub ordinate to Chaab, or even shall include the two divisions of the tribe under the same Government. I have only to observe in conclusion that there are present independent of the island^ of Abadan 12 places inhabited by the Chaab north of the Haffar canal, which are in dispute between Persia and Turkey, of these, Mohammerah and Hoozan belong to Sheikh Jaabir and are at present dependent upon Persia that power however deriving no pecuniary benefit from them at all commen surate with the value of her protection Boojidee and Kootal Nawasir pay their revenues to the Bawa Arabs, who consider themselves subjects of the Persian crown, either as dependents upon Dezful upon Howeizah or upon Eellahiah. And Tamar El Jadeed, Khomeisah, Shakhoora, Nahr Toossoof, Darband, El Khagin and El Haffar are under the immediate surveillance of the Chief of Koot-el-Sheikh, acting as the deputy of the Sheikh of Eellahiah, and are subject to the payment of 300 tons of dates yearly for land rent to the Govern ment of Bussorah. With the exception of occasional [presents from Sheikh Jaabir, the Persian crown derives no revenue whatever either in money in kind, or in military attendance from any of these disputed lands, and it can therefore be of little consequence to her, that the line of frontier which I have traced in a previous paragraph, while it secures to her, Koot-el-Sheikh on the southern, and Mo hammerah and Haffar on the northern side of the canal, restores to Turkey all the other lands both in the island of Abadan and on the banks of the Shat-el- Arab above Haffar, which are cultivated by the Chaab k (Sd.)
