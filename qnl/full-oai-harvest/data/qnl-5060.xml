Each of the cases has its own title page. The cases themselves are arranged chronologically, with the earliest case at the front of the file, and the latest at the rear. There is a index page showing the cases (with the slaves' names) on folio 2. There are office notes included within each case; most of the time they appear at the rear of the case correspondence, but sometimes they are at the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence begins on the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and can be found in the top right of the recto side of each folio. A short local foliation sequence can be found at ff 34-37; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. They can be found in the same position as the main sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and other papers (including slaves' statements) related to manumission applications heard at the Political Agency in Bahrain. Most of the cases involve slaves who have absconded or travelled from Muscat or Saudi Arabian territory. In those cases where a slave had escaped from Muscat, the Bahrain Agency exchanged correspondence with the Muscat Agency to verify the slave's story, with the Muscat Agent writing back in each case to approve manumission. Correspondence and office notes show that those slaves from Saudi Arabia were automatically given manumission certificates and permitted to stay in Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00023c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00023c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
