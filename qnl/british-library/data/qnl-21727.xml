From enquiries from the Aircraft's crew it was learnt that two passengers named Guisan a Frenchman and Makki either an Egyptian or Syrian boarded the plane at Cairo and whether they were in transit at Cairo or boarding only from Cairo is not known. Both men spoke french and remained together and were booked from Cairo to Bahrein. When the plane arrived at Bahrein and on examination of their passports, iV was found that they had no visas to land in Bahrein. They tried to explain that they were in transit to Persia and had come by air-plane with a view to crossing from Bahrein to the Mainland! (i.e. Persian Coast) by steamer. The authorities for some reason were however not satisfied with this explanation and refused to allow them to land and Imperial Airways having no other alternative, were compelled to take them on board and taring them to Chargeh, where they were landed with a view to being returned to Cairo by the first return plane, unless they could in the meantime get permission to enter Bahrein. Imperial Airways saw no advantage in bringing them to Karachi and then having to take them back all the way to Cairo, though they were in possession of ample funds. From the ... I IFrom tbe conversation these two foreigners on 'bowd the plane, it is tfelieved that they are interested in Oil concessions or perhaps in securing Oil concessions in Bahrein.

Bear Eastern Department, It may Be of interest to you to learn that a Captain H. Guisan, a member of a well known Swiss military family, called at the Consulate here on May 29 and asked for a visa for Bagdad, Mecca and Bahrein, stating that he was visiting the latter spot rT en transit. tT When asked what was the aim of his journey, he said that he was being sent 'pour faire un rapport, but did not state what kind of a report it was to be. He was leaving Paris this morning by air and flying to Basra. Mr. Harston thought it rather queer that he should wish for a transit visa for Bahrein, as this spot does not lie on the direct route of the journey, but necessitates a branching off from the main line. Captain Quisan was told to obtain his visa from the Consul-General in Paris. Mr• Harston added that Captain Guisan spoke of having to see King Ibn Saud. He gathered that the Federal Political Department are aware of the proposed journey. As you are aware, the Persians keep a Commission here which buys military equipment for them (see our despatch Ho.79 of March 24 and various reports from the Military Attache to the D.M.O. and I).
