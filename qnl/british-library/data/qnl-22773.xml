I have been unable to obtain any very reliable infomiation; and I cannot ascertain that any such recoras are iept in Bahrein. In future, if it is thought desirable, I would willingly Keep a register of the pilgrims who notify here. (1) The number of pilgrims from Bahrein who travelled via India for the Haj in I926 is estimated at sixty. The exact number can be ascertained at Jeddah, where a register is Kept of the place of origin of every pilgrim arriving by steamer. (2) The number who trav elled by land is not Known. (3) The number who returned is estimated at between fifty and sixty. (4) The number of pilgrims of previous years who returned this year is not Known. I recall that in 1924 , s.s.'Jehangir', brought here over two hundred returning pilgrims, including SheiKh Muhhuiamad bin Easa A1 Khalifa, and other notabilities. (5) The diseases which attacked pilgrims are not Known, but I have heard that many suffer from influenxa and rheumatism. A register is not Kept in MeKKa of the pilgrims wno arrive there by overland routes.

H. 1364) , 1 ilgnmage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz. I am indebted to Mr. Vice-Consul (Jusman, to Mr Shah Jehan Kebir, Indian Vice-Consul and to Doctor Ghulam ^ Mustafa, Indian Medical Officer, for the compilation of the report. :v „ 21 am sending copies of this despatch to the British Middle East Office, the secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, the (,0 ' 7 T enior ^ e ne r al of the Sudan, the High Commissioner for Palestine, the Governor 01 Nigeria and the Governor of Aden. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, GUY H. CLARKE. The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, .M.P., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office. *(1) INTRODUCTORY AND GENERAL Before Saudi Arabia had digested the news of the defeat of Nazi Germany, came the unexpected news of the surrender of Japan. People of the Hejaz, already hard- hit economically under the Saudi regime, had suffered much during the years of war ; and eagerly expected a resumption of the pilgrimage traffic on pre-war scale. Indian, Javanese and .Malay pilgrims, especially were awaited in numbers adequate to com- nensate for trie loss sustained during the war period. Malayan and Javanese pilgrims /%Ld not, however, perform the pilgrimage ; and the number of Indians was also restricted by inevitable shipping difficulties. 2. A total of 41,915 pilgrims landed at Jedda from overseas, as compared with ^7,857 in 1944. Shortage of steamships, and the high rate of dues and charges pres cribed by the Saudi Arabian Government, kept the total low. 3. Again in 1944 the system of pre-collection of pilgrimage dues in the pilgrims’ countries of origin was applied by the responsible Governments, but the Government of India refused to adopt this procedure for Indians. Indian pilgrims unfortunately disregarded the instructions' to bring Indian rupees for payment of pilgrimage dues, etc., and gold for non-tariff items only. They brought sovereigns in order to profit on the exchange, but were disappointed, because the rate swung against them. Even tually, the Saudi Arabian Government agreed to accept from Indian pilgrims Egyp tian and Sterling currency besides Indian rupees. This reduced complaints, but gave rise to other difficulties. Pre-collection of dues in India would have prevented any loss ol this kind. 4. The Middle East Supply Centre made special provision for the needs of pil grims, but the Saudi Arabian Government did not open controlled-pric j retail estab lishments, and pilgrims had to purchase their foodstuffs from the market at the very high prices normal in this country. 5. No company or private individual'organised the overland transport of pil grims from Iraq, Koweit, etc.,-but according to Saudi returns 16 pilgrims came over land by motor vehicles. 6. The Arab Car Company and the Saudi authorities concerned made fairly satis factory arrangements for the despatch of pilgrims from Jedda on disembarkation to their destination, and congestion in Jedda was largely avoided. The position as regar; s the transport of pilgrims to Arafat v, as not so satisfactory, owing to abuses by the drivers, who, instead of keeping to a proper schedule, picked up pedestrians along the road for n oney, own, to the prejudice of pi lgrims who had paid in advance for their transport. Those Indian pilgrims who had paid for their transport to Arafat by camel, but prefered to journey on foot for religious reasons, were refunded a sum of twenty rupees per he.i l by private arran ements. 7. Some impr vement was marie in the new roid 1 uilt betti een Mecca and Arafat, by half metalling it. This helped traffic considerably, but complete satisfaction cannot be achieved in the absence of any regulations a out speed. Driving is very furious, a d acci lents took place on the return journey from Arf fat, when all have to leave the plain at the same time. ^ 8. On the pilgrims’ leaving the country, their persons and luggage were searched to prevent the smuggling of gold, but unlice 1944, the search was carried out in the Customs', both by the Customs officials and the Coastguard authorities jointly. No complaint was heard in this respect. 9. The presence of King Abdul Aziz in Mecca with his family and retinue, for ^ 1 ng periods before and'after the Haj, inconvenienced the pilgrims somewhat in their p rforman e of the “ Tawwaf ”, owing to sscurity measures taken by the local police.10. Some ndian pilgrims were grieved to find tHat large crowds of jiilgrims of both sexes circumambulated the i aaba together within a very limited space. ^As a result, of their representations, instructions were issued to the Police to segregate the sexes. 11. The usual pilgrimage banquet took place on Sunday, November 11th, 1945&gt; and was attended by selected pilgrims of all rationalities. The King presided. Speeches were curtailed by the Amir Mansour, who wa acting in the absence of his brother the Amir Faisal, as Viceroy, and only the King’s poet read out the usual lengthy eulogy of the King. A Palestinian pilgrim made an attempt to speak, but was stopped by Amir Mansour. King Abdul Aziz delivered a speech, addressing the guests, in which he dwelt on the Unity of God, the blessings of Islam, the Moslems!^ duty towards their religion, and Palestine. 12. The “ Kiswa ”, the cover of the Holy Kaaba, was sent as usual from Egypt in charge of an Amir-al-Haj, who, this year, was Ibrahim Abdul Haii Pasha. The^ latter did not show the enthusiasm and energy of his predecessor, Abdur Rahman^ Azzam Pasha. 13. The system of dealing with the estates of deceased Pritish pilgrims by the Saudi rabian Government remained unsatisfactory, as mentioned in paragraph 15 of the 1944 report. After long correspondence and delay, the Saudi Arabian Govern ment handed over the estates of deceased British pilgrims of the Moslem years 1361, 1362 and 1363 (1942-44) to the British Legation. As a result of their inaction, the return tickets of some pilgrims btcame invalid, and the heirs of the deceased pilgrims thertbsuffered. The question of the disposal of pilgrims’ effects has become a ge mine nuisance. 14. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th of Dhu’l Hijja, fell on Wednesday, November 14th&gt; 1945._ 15. Climatic conditions on Arafat day were excellent. The general health of the pilgrims w^as unusually good. 16. Some 17 pilgrims from the U. S. S. R. came by air. 17. Among the notables w r ho made the pilgrimage were the following :— Ibrahim Abdul Hadi Pasha and Abdul Hamid Badawi Pasha from Egypt ; Mahmud el Hawati from Yemen; Shaikh A1 Glawi from Morocco ; el Habib el Jaloodi from Tunis ; Doctor Bomali from Algiers ; Sir Mohammed Noor, Nawanzadi Pari Banoo and Mr. Saidullah Khan from India, and Sir Mohammed Meccan Mericer from Ceylon. 18. Some Indian pilgrims brought money and clothing for free distribution amongst the poor in the Hejaz, besides the wheat sent by Sind before the pilgrimage season. 19. Pilgrims of South and East Africa who travelled direct from Mombasa and Zanzibar suffered very much after the Haj, as they waited for months at Jedda for shipping. They held single tickets only of the Line which transported them to Jedda ; a very undesirable circumstance. Some left for India, some for Egvpt and Sudan, and the remaining few sailed on January 15th 1946 for Mombasa. 20. Some difficulty arose owing to the absence of any one responsible office or officer in the Saudi Administration exclusively for pilgrimage affairs. With the appointment of Shaikh Ibrahim Shoura as Mudir el Haj, matters improved. (2) STATISTICS * The following tables have been compiled from information unofficially obtained from the Saudi authorities concerned, and some discrepancies occur between these figures and those supplied from other sources. The Mogul Line, the Haj Line, the Khedivial Mail Line and the Misr Line were engaged in pilgrimage traffic in 1945. Some of the ships' of* the British India Line were also chartered (?)

The Saudi Arabian Government did not maintain a quarantine station at Al-Arid for Iraqi pilgrims coming overland this year. Kamaran. —All the Indian pilgrims ships called at Kamaran. Suakin. —Arrangements were similar to last year. Jedda. —The Saudi Arabian quarantine staff were the same as last year. No cases of smallpox or other infectious disease were notified. (4) HEALTH The Saudi Arabian Public Health Department declared the pilgrimage clean, and this was confirmed by the Indian Medical Officer as no case of any infectious disease came to his notice during the pilgrimage days at Mecca or Muna. Diarrhoea, dysen tery, bronchitis and catarrh of the air passages were the general complaints, especially among old and infirm Indian pilgrims. Besides the above, malaria and pneumonia were the most common diseases. There was no noticeable change in the staff and working of the Saudi Medical Services except that a new surgeon, Doctor Maleeh Sinnoo arrived to work in Mecca hospital during the Haj Season. He is reported to be a good surgeon. Jedda. —There is no separate hospital for infectious diseases. Infectious cases are isolated in one wing of the local hospital. The Genej^l Hospital is short of medi cines and surgical supplies and only emergency operations are undertaken. Mecca, Medina and Tar/hospitals.—Arrangements were the same as usual. . Government of India Dispensaries — Jedda. —As usual the dispensary was open to the public throughout the year, except for a fortnight when Doctor Ghulam Mustafa, the Indian Medical Officer assisted by Doctor Abdur Rahman Khan and the permanent and temporary staff of Jedda and Mecca dispensaries respectively, formed the Indian Medical Mission and lead the Mission to Mecca, Muna and Arafat for the service of pilgrims during the Haj days. During the season pilgrims of all nationalities attended the dispensary in large numbers. The daily attendance of the dispensary remained high 'throughout the year. During the season the attendance was unusually high as notices were posted for the information of pilgrims, and medical assistance w'as Tendered to them at ^ times of the day and night, irrespective of dispensary hours. The Government of India furnished medicines and medical and surgical supplies as far as war conditions permitted. ' * ‘ | Mecex i. —The dispensary functioned from September 28th, 1945, to December 29th, 1945. The head dispenser was put in charge to conduct the work, and anothep^ dispenser flent later to assist him as the attendance increased. This was done as «h\.The following is the list of surgical operations performed in the Indian Dispen* saries during the year 1945:— Serial No. Name of Operation Total No. 1 Extraction of Teeth .. 1,828 2 Excision of sinuses 324 3 Circumcision 23 4 Injection I.

The Nether lands Dispensary at Mecca functioned throughout the year with Anglo-Duteh co operation. The Palestine Medical Mission encamped outside the cities where the public and pilgrims could not take full advantage of their services. Doctor Atahar i assiste d by Doctor Bukhari and other staff formed the Sudan Medical Mission. Although encamped outside Jedda, they set up a temporary hospital and rendered very good service to the public and pilgrims. % Legation Medical Staff Doctor Ghulam Mustafa acted throughout the year and was confirmed on 2nd October 1945 as the Indian Medical Officer attached to His Majesty’s Legation, Jedda, when Doctor Ghulam Hussain reverted to his original post in India. No substitute arrived in place of Qazi Mohammed Younis, 3rd Dispenser, who returned by S.S. “ Khosrou ” to India on 16th January 1945, and so Mr. Abdullah Malabari, the dresser, continued to act in his place*as Dispenser throughout the year. Mr. Moham med Shaflfi Choudhri, head Dispenser, sailed for India on completion of his three 3'ears’ service by S.S.“ Akbar ” on 11th January 1946, leaving the staff short by two Dispensers. Replacements are expected to arrive soon from India. (5) INTERNAL TRANSPORT ^ As there was no remarkable increase in the number of overseas pilgrims over t at of the previous year, no particular difficulty was experienced in respect of the t in ;port of pilgrims from Jedda to Mecca and Medina. There were cases of break down of lorries, shortage of petrol, etc., but relief reached in time in all the cases. I| may be interesting to note that one batch of pilgrims took 3 days to reach Mecca fro m | Jedda—a distance of 45 miles bn an asphalt road.The usual difficulty arose about the arrangements for the journey from Meoca t® Arafat. Many improvements in this respect would be possible if there were more ' goodwill and co-operation on the part of the Saudi Arabian Government officials, one of whom was heard to remark that the best course was to pretend to be deaf during the season. There was some resentment among pilgrims who had paid money in advance, but could not get transport. The journey to Medina after the Haj by motor vehicles was made difficult by heavy rain and flood ; and rash driving led to numerous accidents on the Medina road. In many cases pilgrims had to remain on the way for several days, without food, water and help. Sir Mohammed Noor and Moulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqi were eloquent about their experiences. Pilgrims complained of very high fares and mini* • mum comfort. (6) CUSTOMS ^ Customs arrangements were the same as in 1944. There was no very strict examination of pilgrims’ baggage, and a few silver coins in the hands of the unpaid officials helped in taking out otherwise dutiable articles. (7) RELIGIOUS POLICY The Committee of Virtue functioned as usual. Pilgrims did not experience any hardship due to the presence of the Committee. Some pilgrims reported that the Nejdi guards posted round the railings of the Prophet’s Tomb at Medina, in order to prevent the pilgrims from touchi g the railings seized the pilgrims by their hands and encouraged them to touch the railings in hope of getting a few piastres. Indian pilgrims paid these guards heavily. The epithets of the Holy Prophet written in gold on the walls of the Haram in Medina, which were demolished by the fanatic Wahhabi Qadhi in Medina, were re written on the same places as a result of wide agitation and protest from all quarters, especially by the Egyptians. Same epithets were however not written, but epithets of general type were re-written on the walls. (8) MUTAWWIFS Mutawwifs who cater for Javanese and Malayan pilgrims were again disappoin' - ed as no pilgrims from those countries came on Haj, though the war was over. Mutawwifs for other nationals were hap] y to get clients. The failure of the Saudi Arabian Government to pay a proper share of the dues to the Mutawwifs compelled them to make money by such means as they could. Mutawwifs’ Agents in Jedda and Mutawwifs in Mecca, made money from Indian pilgrims by manipulating cur rencies. For Government dues and transport charges, they charged Indians the cur rency which was profitable to their interests, but eventually paid these sums in to the Treasury in the currency which was cheaper at the moment. Pilgrims complained and in some cases recoveries were made. Mutawwifs and wakils of Indian pilgrims also made money by attempts to obtain passages for their clients out of turn by re*. tuming vessels. The system of “ first come, first served ” facilitated these illegalities. (9) PILGRIMAGE TARIFF As a result of protests made by Indian^and Egyptian pilgrims in the previous year against the arbitrary rate of exchange fixed for tariff items, pilgrims were asked ^ to pay in their national currencies and no mention of Riyals appeared in the schedule. ^ Indian pilgrims who did not pay in advance were warned to bring Indian rupees w ith them to pay for the tariff items, and sovereigns for non-tariff items. They f id not heed these instructions and brought only sovereigns with them, purchrsedi i India at Rupees 53 to a sovereign. When they wished to buy rupees on the J Ida market the rate was Rupee 48 to a sovereign, a sharp decline from the pre-pil linage seasoy rate of Rupees 76 to a sovereign. Temporary arrangements were made with a money- ^ ohfcnger to accept sovereigns from Indian pilgrims at the rate of Rupees 76 only forthe amount of tariff items, but when the Indians began to rush with all their sovereigns to make a profit, the money-changer closed down his shop and ran away. His Majes ty’s Minister took up the matter with the Saudi Arabian Government, and obtained permission for Indian pilgrims to pay the tariff items in other currencies also, Egyptian and Sterling, if they wished and as a result Indian pilgrims began to pay their dues, •tc., in Egyptian pounds, which enabled them to make considerable saving in exchange. On the arrival of the mass of Indian pilgrims, and of the Rupees they brought with them, the sovereign improved to 78 Rupees. In the schedule of tariffs, the Saudi Arabian Government divided the payment under four heads : (1) Pilgrimage to Mecca etc., by camel, (2) Pilgrimage by lorry ; (3) JPilgrimage and Medina visit by camel and (4) Pilgrimage and Medina visit by^ lorry. The minimum amount payable was Rupees 323-6 or £ E. 23-63£ piastres.^ Indian pilgrims greatly resented compulsory payment for transport as some of them wanted to walk on foot to Mecca and Arafat. ' (10) INDIAN PILGRIMAGE The Indian pilgrimage began in 1945 with the arrival of S.S. “ Alavi ” on October 4th ; the last arrivals were by S.S. “ Khosrou ” on November 0th. Besides these direct sailings, some Indians came from the Sudan, East Africa, South Africa, Iraq, Egypt, the Persian Gulf and England. The Mogul Line and the Haj Line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. The following table gives the number of ships run, voyages effect d, and pilgrims carried to and from India by the Mogul Line and the Haj Line respectively : Mogul Line Outward from India Number of Number of Number of •hips voyages pilgrims Homeward to India Number of Number of Number of sliips voy iges Pilgrims 6 ' 6 7,540 5 7 (a) 7,338 Haj Line Number of ships Outward from India Number of voyages Number of Pilgrims Number of ships Homew’ard to India Number of voyagej Number of Pilgrims 1,676 (a) 1,707 (a) This £gure includes persons who purchased fresh tickets for return t &gt; India.

A large number of pilgrims tried to take und Jo ad vantage in booking their passages, but both the pilgrims and their associates were very severely dealt with. No concession was shown to any pilgrim in any cir mm- stances, but it cannot be definitely said that all attempts were checked. There may have occurred some cases of pilgrims who booked their passages by illegal mean i and escaped detection. Pilgrims who travelled by the Mogul Line boats were much inconvenienced by ne constant change of programme of homeward-bound sailings. The Legation were able to secure the concession for Indian pilgrims to stay in Medina till they were want ed by the Legation before the sailings of ships, without payment of extra charges, ^*)ut this arrangement also did not give complete satisfaction. Enraged pilgrims o sieged the Indian Vice-Consulate on January 1st, 1946, and showed some violence. Those changes of programme involved the Mogul Lino in the payment of compmsa- tion allowance under Section 2C9 A of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act to 1,038 Indian pilgrims, amounting to Rupees 2,186. The Haj Line had to pay under similar circumstances to six Indian pilgrims a sum of Rupeeis 6. A certain number of pilgrims holding Mogul Line return tickets travelled back to India by purchasing fresh tickets on the Haj Line, to save two days’ wait. The last Indian pilgrim boat S.S. “ Alavi ” sailed frertn Jedda on February 15th, 1946, transporting destitute Indian pilgrims and Muhaji/rs. Food, Accommodation, etc., on soar'd the phlgrIm ships Pilgrims travelling by the Mogul Line w r ere very severe in criticism of the arrange ments made for supplying food during the voyage. The quality of food stuffs was reported to be inferior. On the contrary, pilgrims travelling by the Haj Line expressed their satisfaction in respect of food supply, both as to quality and quantity. Reports by the Amirs ul Haj dealt with these subjects. The question ofaccommo- dat ; on on board requires solution. All efforts at the ports of embarkation in India to mark blocks, etc., are futile when the coolies begin to load baggage and pilgrims begin to embapk. The system of storing heavy luggage in the holds also proved troublesome in the absence of any arrangements for delivery of luggage to pilgrims on their landing in Jedda. Suitable persons were appointed as “Amirs ul Haj ” by the Legation on the return journeys on the same lines as were followed in the past. Again this year, the proposed standard system of reports by the Amirs ul Haj was not adopted’ by the Government of India. Pilgrim Passes It is essential, in the interests of the pilgrims themselves that photographs should be affixed to the pilgrim passes. The question of religious sentiment no more arises, since these pilgrims, if they want to visit Iraq, have to have photos on the pilgrim passes. Registration The usual arrangements for registration of pilgrims worked satisfactorily. Ot ^he Indian pilgrims shown as arriving by sea 8,566 were registered at this Legation. Reports of loss of pilgrim passes and steamer return tickets were properly dealt with and pilgrims w^-e not inconvenienced in any way on this score. Destitutes ^ 88 destitute Indians were repatriated to India at the expense of the Government of India. The following routes of access were adopted by them :Route* oj access (a) Overland :— Via Gwadar-Mascat-MokaUa-Yemen Via Gwadur-Dobai-Riyadh . Via Bombay-Bahrain-Nejd .

Pilgrims who brought drafts on the Netherlands Trading Society complained that they were offered Egyptian pounds at an unfat cun.ble rate.

The amount so deposited wa^ Ki pees S8,9£2, all of which was wnhdidwn by the depositors during their stay in the Hejaz. (11) PALESTINIAN AND TRANS JORDAN PILGRIMAGE According to Saudi quarantine returns 1,221 Palestinian and Transjordan nationals entered the port of Jtdda on pilgrimage, a decrease of 4,150 on the previous year’s total of 5,371. No figures are available regard’ng pilgrims who travelled overland. With the exception of the members of the Medical Mission and a few indepen dent travellers, all Palestinian and Transjordan pilgrims were carried to and from this country in the S.S. “ Shiralla ”. No complaints were, received regarding shipping facilities, and the ships sailed to schedule on both outward and homeward journeys. The Medical Mission, in the charge of Doctor Hassan Shukri el Khalidi, arrived at Jedda in the S.S. “ Talodi ” on October 5th, 1945, and sailed for Suez on the return journey to Palestine on December 2nd, 1945. Vehicles and equipment were unloaded and loaded with the helf) of Izzedine Bey Shawa, through the ^courtesy 9 the manager of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, at the Syndicate's pier. The camp waa located conveniently for pilgrims on high ground some two hundred yards from the town gates. The Mission visited Medina between October 16th and 28th and proceeded to Mecca for the pilgrimage on November ITth. Doctor Khalidi and his staff performed their duties with enthusiasm and efficiency, and their Servioea were highly appreciated in both medical and clerical capacities.11 m I The Mission was joined by Abdulhadi Effendi Irfan, special representat ive of the Palestine Broadcasting Station, on October 6th. Emergency travel documents were issued to pilgrims who reported the loss of their pilgrim book lets. (12) SUDANESE PILGRIMAGE According to Saudi quaranti le returns 926 Sudanese and Shanqitis entered the port of Jedda from Saukin for pilgrimage, as comparud with 1,769 for the previous year. As usual, the Shanqitis included in the total were few. Pilgrims wore carri d to and from this country in ships of the Khedivial Mail ^■Line. During the return season the usual complaints wore received from pilgrims aIio had to wait from six to eight days in Jedda for a ship. The Medical Mission in the charge of Doctor Atabani, Medical Inspector, arrived Jedda on October 18th, and was foliowi d by the Medical Officer, Doctor Bukhari on November 6th. The Field Hospital was located on the site occupied by the Mission of the previous year, approximately two miles along the Jedda-Mecca road, and was ready to receive patients cn October 21st. The Field Hospital at Jedda was closed on November 9th, and the mobile dis pensary and all members of the Mission proceeded to Mocca. After the return from Muna on Ncv mb&lt; r 17th, the Mission divided. The Medical Inspector, the Medical Assi ta- t a .d tw r o M' mu rid en remained at Mecca and opened the dispensary, fae Medical Officer and the remainder of the staff returned to Jedda to reopen the Field Hcs} ital. On N v mher 29 h, the M dical Inspector, accompanivd by two Momarideen left Jed la to op n the dispe isary at Medi ,a. The dispensary was closed on December 24 h, and the Me dical Inspector returned to assume charge of the Field Hospital at Jedda, in time to permit the Medical Officer and other members of the g aff to pay a short visit to Med n c. The M dical Offi er, Sani ary Overseer, Bash Momarid, Staff Midwife, three % Me maii leen and the Cock returned to the Sudan on January 16th, 1946. The Medi- c 1 Insp ctor, the Medical Assistant and the remainder of the staff, with vehicles, r tunned in the last ship cn February 4th. The work of ^he Mi ;sion, efficiently and courteously performed by Doctor Atabani and his staff, was greatly appreciated not o .ly by the pilgrims, but by the local Saudis and others, more than 7,000 of whom availed themselves of the facilities offered. (13) WEST AFRICAN PILGRIMAGE Saudi quarantine returns show that 5,480 W T est Africans entered the port of Jedda from Suakin for pilgrimage, as compared with 5,269 the previous year. Al though the Saudi returns do not differentiate between British and French nationals, it is estimated that approximately 70—75 per cent, of the total were British. They were carried to and from the Sudan in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. Although the ships failed to sail to scheduled dates during the return season, and the waiting periods between ships ranged from four to nine days, no serious cofriplainta were received from West African pilgrims. Again this year, a large number of West Africans benefited from the medical facilities so generously offered by the Sudan Medical Mission. The illicit dhow traffic from the Eritrean ccast continues to increase. Although official figures are available, the West African Sheikhs report a steady flow of pilgrims from the southern parts of Ji zan, Qvulfida and Lath. Only 470 pilgrims travelled under the auspices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme, and during the return season 325 pilgrims were refunded a total sum of £ E. 322.695 m/ms. ^ Emergency Certificates were issued to pilgrims who satisfactorily prorod ths toss of their pilgrim passes.(14) SOMALI PILGRIMAGE Under the heading “ Scrcalis and Eritrean ”, Savdi quarantine rotufhB show that 71 pilprhrs intend the port of Jidda on pilgrimage, as compared with 35 the previous ye ar. As usual, no figures are available of pilgrhrs vho travelled overland fxom Adm. During the return season 11 pilgrims were refer did 1 he total sum of £61-17-6. Emergency Certificates were issued to pilgrims vho satisfactorily proved the loss c f their pilgrim passes. (16) PILGRIMAGE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE COLONY AN%k PROTECTORATE OF ADEN Under the heading “ Adenese and Radhramis ” Saudi quarantine returns show that 1,338 pilgrims dist mbaiked at Jidda for pilgrimage, as compared with thi previous year. No figures are available regarding pilgrims who travelled overland. As usual, there were numerous complaints during the return season regarding the lack of shipping facilities. A number of pilgrims who travelled from Aden in the Khedivial Mail Line steamer, S.S. ” Talcdi ”, were subjected to great inconvenience and expense when they were obliged to wait in Jcdda for nearly a month for a return passage. During the return season Emergency Certificates were issued to pilgrims who satisfactorily proved the loss of their travel documents. (16) ZANZIBARI AND EAST AFRICAN PILGRIMAGE Saudi quarantine returns show that 22 Zanzibaris and 2 pilgrims from Uganda entered the port of Jidda for pilgrimage. • (17) SOUTH AFRICAN PILGRIMAGE According to Saudi quarantine returns only two South Africans entered the port of Jedda for pilgrimage. (18) CYRENSAICAN AND TRIPOL1TANIAN PILGRIMAGE. Saudi quarantine returns .do not, as usual, differentiate between the countries of North Africa, and show a total of 217 pilgrims from these territories disembarked at Jedda, 160 of w hom were, according to official figures published by the Civil Affairs Branch, General Headquarters, Middle East Forces, natives of Cyrenaica and Tripolitanian. During the return season 126 pilgrims were refunded a total sum of E. 1,260.000 m/mfl. y - x ?&gt;* ' • , ^ ' . , ■ r 1 ' .• iii Li ;* .. &gt;'• j ■ ■* GIFD—82 -6,27 D of EA&amp;CWR—26-MH—2dNc.1983-2/5 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 28th June 1948.

Mr. Vioe-Consul Ousman, Mr. Shah Jehan Kabir, dian Vioe-Consul, and Doctor Ghulam Mustafa, Indian Medical Officer, have collaborated in the compilation of the report. 2.

I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, GUY H. CLARKE. The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, M. P. etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office. .(1) INTRODUCTORY AND GENERAL 1. Early reports indicating the prospect of large numbers of pilgrims from Egypt, India, Malaya and the Dutch East Indies were very welcome to the residents of the Holy Cities, and produced a general feeling of alertness amongst money changers, house owners, water carriers, and other profiteers. Houses near the Holy Haram of Mecca and Medina and in Muna, were rented to brokers at an excessive rate, which some timesjreached a figure more than five times last season’s prices. Dis appointment followed when it became known that shipping difficulties had compel led the Egyptian authorities to restrict the number of their pilgrims, and that the ^ne applied to pilgrims from India. It was a further blow when they learned mat owing to the troubles in Indonesia, there was no hope of pilgrims from that source. They were, however, compensated to a certain extent by the arrival of a good number of pilgrims from South and East Africa. Ultimately, a total of 63,971 pilgrims landed at Jedda from overseas, as compared with 41,915 in 1945. 2. Unlike other Governments, the Government of India again refused to accept the system of pre-collection of pilgrimage dues in India. This system has both merits and de-merits, but it is to be strongly recommended in the interests of the pilgrims themselves, and of the good name of the country to which they belong. Quite a large number of Indian pilgrims who landed in Jedda during the month of Ramzhan declared themselves without funds, as a result of which they were detained at Jedda in their “Ihram” for a considerable period. They were eventually allowed to proceed to Mecca only two or three days before the end of encouraging the shipment of destitutes, the system of paying the Saudi dues in Jedda causes unnecessary delay to the pilgrims on arrival. No advantage accrues to Indian pilgrims in respect of exchange, as the dues are fixed and paid in Indian currency. Strict watch was kept over the wakils who collect these amounts and none of them ventured to collect the tariff items in any other currency than rupees. 3. The Saudi Arabian Government did not open any controlled-price retail establishment, in spite of their having received from the British Supply Mission extra food-stuffs to cover the additional needs of the Pilgrimage Season, and pil grims in general had to purchase their foodstuffs from the markets at excessive prices. Indian pilgrims were allowed to bring with them from India a fixed quan tity of important items of foodstuffs, but a large number of them were found to be selling their stores on landing in Jedda, and in the Mecca market as well. On several occasions there were disputes between pilgrims and brokers, and com plaints were made by pilgrims to the Legation. The poorer classes of pilgrims who had thus disposed of their stores ultimately ran short and suffered privations as a result. ^ — 4. No company or private individual organised the overland transport of , pilgrims from Iraq, Koweit, etc., but, according to Saudi returns, 619 pilgrims came overland by motor vehicles. S 5. The Arab Motor Transport Company and the Saudi authorities concern ed made fairly satisfactory arrangements for the despatch of pilgrims from Jedda, on disembarkation, to their destination, and congestion in Jedda was largely avoid ed. The situation, however, became strained just before Pilgrimage Day, when six to seven ships arrived with pilgrims on the same day. Pilgrims of other nation- ijpr payment of dues and other formalities, and the Indian Vice Consulate was Surrounded by enraged and impatient pilgrims. Arrangements were finally made to provide them with conveyances of any type available at the moment, without consideration of payment made, as the Pilgi image Day was very near. A sudden advance in the date of the Pilgrimage also c .used difficulties for pilgrims tt i ci i 4 i rr r» /■ 1 1 r'* r» o *-» /'l i /-kl z** n 1 » 4 *t !-»»-» *-! 4- V»y» t/O Vtod 111H- f'O nd for small cars the month of fasting. Other Indian destitutes arrived by later ships. Besides alities were more successful in finding transport than the Indians who were detained* ^ 2 Wftfl pressing, but the Company had not an adequate number of vehicles of this type. The bus service which was advertised in the published tariff, was also not available at all, as the vehicles failed to reach Jedda in time. The position as regards the transport of pilgrims to Arafat was most unsatisfactory. Although the Company had not adequate vehicles at their disposal to meet all needs, the Saudi Arabian Government issued an order prohibiting the lorries and oars of private owners, which in the past wore hired by the mutawwifs, for pilgrimage traffic to Arafat, from transporting any pilgrims or local residents to Arafat. The day preceding the Haj saw scones of chaos in Mecca ; and loud protests by the mutawwifs, pilgrims and others failed to improve the situation. Difficulties in ^his respect, both at the time of going to Arafat and returning to Muna, were very great, and the pilgrims’ resentment was not unjustified. 0. More improvements were made in the new road built between Mecca an&lt;^ Arafat, and arrangements were also made, for the first time, to control traffic by a one-way system between Arafat and Muna after the Haj. The new Direotor- General of Pilgrimage Affairs, in the company of the Director-General of Public m .Security, personally supervised the control of traffic throughout the day of the Haj. The result was no doubt of great benefit to all concerned, but whenever the drivers and slaves found opportunity, they upset the arrangements. Owing to irresponsible and rash driving several accidents took place, some of which proved fatal. 7. Arrangements made in 1945 to segregate the sexes during the circumam- bulation of the Holy Kaaba were apparent during the season under review. 8. The usual pilgrimage banquet took place on Wednesday, October 30th, 1946, and wa; attended by selected pilgrims of all nationalities. Egyptians were in the groat majority. Pilgrims from the Sudan wore not represented in propor tion to their numbers which they greatly resented. As usual, King Abdul Aziz ]bn Saud presided. After the banquet, the King’s poet recited complimentary verses, and he was followed by several speakers. His Majesty did not deliver any speech on this occasion. 9. The “Kiswa”, or “Holy Carpet” covering the Kaaba, was sent as usual from Egypt in charge of the Amir ul Haj, Shaikh Mustafa Abdur Razeq, Rector of A1 Azhar University, since deceased. 10. The System of dealing with the estates of deseased British pilgrims by the Saudi Arabian Government re nained unsatisfactory ; and a new form of trouble arose from the fact that authorities of the Beit ul Mai in Medina failed on many occasions to take custody of the pilgrim passess of Indian pilgrims who died in Medina. As a result, they fell into the hands of other pilgrims, who presented th mi for refund of the return passage money. These frauds wore in all cases delet ed. The effects of those British pilgrims who died in the Hejaz during the 1305 pdgrimage season have not been delivered to the Legation at the moment of writ ing this report. 11. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th of Dhu’l Hijja, fell on Saturday, November 2nd, 1946. At one time it was declared that the Haj would fall on Monday, Novem- , ber 4th. subsequently it was announced officially that it would fall on Sunday, November 3rd. Finally, on October 29th, the date was changed to Saturday, November 2nd, 1946. This sudden change caused immense difficulties to all con cerned, especially in respect of motor transport. 12. Climatic conditions on Arafat Day were excellent. The general health of the pilgrims was good. 13. Among notable pilgrims wore the following :— ^ His Highness Nawab Sarwar Ali Khan of Kurwai, from India ; His Royal Highness Sirdar Mohammed Hashem Khan, from Afghanistan ; Their Royal Highness.'8 Saif ul Islam Motahrr, Saif ul Islam Abbas, and Saif ul Islam Abdul Mohsin, from Yt men ; Sayyid Mohammed Hawati; from Yemen ; Sayyid Rashid Bey Abi Shanab, from Al giers ; Sayyid Salah Uddin cl Baa Koosh, fromTunis ; Mohammed3 Munibol Nafoor, from Lebmon ; Abdullah Fadhl el Mehdi and Ahmed Taber, from the Sudan ; Lewa Ahmed Sadiq Pasha and Doctor Mohammed Abdus Salam el Abadi, from Egypt. Pilgrims from South and East Africa who arrived either direct or the Sudan and Egypt, wore muc i inconvenienced after the Haj, as they had to wait for a long period at Jodda for shipping. Some of them ultimately left for India, some for Egypt and the Sudan, and some for Aden. Pilgrims from these countries undergo similar hardships every year, and some arrangement is desirable to faci litate their return journey. ^• 5 ' ^ ith the a PP° intment of Shaikh Mohammed Saroor al Sabban as the ^Mudir el Haj of the Saudi Arabian Government, the organisation of the Haj very greatly improved. Pilgrimage offices wore opened at Jedda, Mecca and Medina, iho landing quay at Jodda was reconstructed ; electric light was installed there, and better arrangements for the supply of drinking water were made. Many othei improvements ■wore made, the most useful of which was the establishment ot an office in Jedda wh- re representations could be made for the immediate redress ot pilgrims difficulties. 16. The All-India Moslem League sent a deputation to King Abdul Aziz, under the leadership of Maulvi Abdul Aleem Siddiqi, in an attempt obtain a considerable reduction in the Saudi pilgrimage tariff. The Deputation represent- ed die toolings of Indian Moslems to King Abdul Aziz, and had several conferences with the King and other high officials of the state. A successful issue is not to be expected. ah Vlv S ° mc of tho ships from India and Egypt brought a number of stowaways. All ot them were returned to their countries of origin. 18. The new Pilgrimage Department of the Saudi Arabian Government introduced a system of Cards to be held by every pilgrim before they could leave tor Mecca or Medina. The cards contained the name, father’s name, address, pngnm-pass number and other details of the holder and were meant to serve as a pass to facilitate the movements of the pilgrim in the Hejaz. The necessity of obtaining a separate 'Koshan” for each journey in tho Hejaz was thus removed. during the y ear under review, full pilgrimage dues were demanded from the -Algerian and other Takruni pilgrims who had hitherto enjoyed the privilege of partial exemption. Pilgrims of this class wer detained in Jedda for a long peril d unto the Legation obtained exemption for them on tlw? understanding that in future - ears Takruni pilgrims would be taxed equally with pilgrims of other nationalities. • J he Hojaz m °ney-changers, who make vast profits on exchange rates during the season, introduced a further method of extortion during the season under review. Large quantities of Saudi nickel coin were hoarded in advance, and owing to their shortag t the number of guisli obtained in exchange for a rival, pi 01 * S normall y twenty-two, was reduced to as little as eleven, involving a loss' ?i tvi Cen * °^ t ^ e va l ue °f the riyal. When the situation was becoming grave, the Pilgrimage Department sought to remedy it by declaring that within a fixed period every nickel coin should be produced to the Ministry of Finance for stamp ing, and those who failed to produce coins within the prescribed time would be punished and the coins in their possession confiscated. As a result, all the nickel coins came into circulation and the situation became normal. u A certa11 } number of anti-British pamphlets were circulated at Mecca and Muna. This is not a new feature of the pilgrimage, and experience suggests that such broadsheets do not have a very enduring effect. The chief instigators ot anti-British propaganda were the Egyptian Ikhwan el Muslim in. On February 21st, 1947, the official newspaper “Umm ul Qura” published an announcement prohibiting the use of the Holy Places for the spreading of any foreign propaganda or doctrines, and stating that am pilgrims who came for pur poses other than worship would be sent home.' 4 (2) STATISTICS L The following tables give the usual statistical information. They have been compiled from information unofficially obtained from the Saudi authorities concerned, and some discrepancies occur between these figures and those supplied from other sources. 2. The principal shipping lines engaged in pilgrimage traffic in 1946 were the Mogul Line, the Haj Line, the Khedivial Mail Line and the Misr Line. 3 The following figures do not cover the whole Arabic year, but only the period from July 19th, 1946 to November 1st, 1946, corresponding to the Arabic 20th Shaaban 1365 to the 8th Dhu’l Hijja 1365.

No case of small pox or other infectious disease was notified. (4) HEALTH The Saudi Arabian Public Health Department declare d the pilgrin age chan and this was confirmed by the Indian Medical Officer as no case of any infectious diasease was heard of or seen during the pilgrimage either at Mecca or Muna.m' Diarrhoea, dysentery, bronchitis, and catarrh of the air passages wore the general complaints, especially amongst the old and infirm. Besides the above, Malaria and pneumonia wore the most common diseases. Saudi Medical Service There was no noticeable change in the Staff and operation of the Saudi Medi cal Services, except that the new Surgeon, Mr. M. Sinnoo, returned after the Haj to Syria, as he did not wish to work for a further period in Mecca. Jedda .—There is no separate hospital for infectious diseases. The general hospital is short of medicines and surgical supplies, and only emergency operat ions are undertaken. Mecca, Muna and Taif .—Hospital arrangements wore the same as usual. Saudi Arabian weekly reports of cases of infectious diseases and deaths resulting therefrom are no longer published regularly in the “Umm-al-Qura”. No epidemic of any infectious disease was reported during 1946. Government of India Dispensaries Jedda .—As usual the dispensary was open to the public throughout the year except for a fortnight when Doctor Ghulam Mustafa, the Indian Medical Officer, assisted by Doctor Abdul Rehman Khan and Doctor Abdul Ghani and the per manent and temporary staff of Jedda, Mecca and Medina dispensaries formed the Indian Medical Mission to Mecca, Muna and Arafat for the service of pilgrims during the Haj. Pilgrims of all nationalities attended the dispensary daily in large numbers. During the season, the attendance was unusually high as notices were posted for the information of pilgrims, and medical assistance was rendered to them at all times irrespective of dispensary hours. The Government of India supplied adequate medicines, and medical and surgical supplies. Mecca .—The dispensary functioned from July 23rd, 1946 to February 3rd, 1947. Mr. Mohammed Abdullah, dispenser, who reverted from the Netherlands Dispensary, Mecca, was put in charge to start the work. The. Indian Medical Officer visited the dispensary weekly to advice on serious and complicated cases. This was necessary because the Government of India could not send the medical staff for Mecca before the opening of the pilgrimage season. The dispensary was open to the public and pilgrims of all countries. Medina .—This w r as the first year that the Government of India had sanction ed the opening of a dispensary in Medina. The pilgrims and the public took full advantage of it, and appreciated its services very much, as is evident from the figures given below. As there wtis no news of medical staff for the dispensary leaving India by the first steamer, Mr. Faiz Mohammed Qureshi was sent to Medina to start the work. The dispensary became very popular, and a trained dresser had to be sent to Medina to cope with the increased work. Doctor Abdul Ghani and Syed Allah Ditta Shah, dispenser, arrived on September 17th, 1946, and were sent to Medina to relieve Mr. Faiz Mohemmed and Ghulam Mohemmed dresser.The following is the list of surgical operations the year performed in the Indian dispensaries during the year 1946 :— Serial No. Name of Operation Total No. 1 Extraction of Teoth 1,133 2 Incision for Gum-Boil 27 3 Excision of sinuses . . . 215 4 Circumcision ..... 12 6 Eye operations .... 273 6 Incision for Aboesses 1,531 7 Removal of Impacted Stone Urethra 3 8 New Growth A Cyst 11 9 On Nose ..... 7 10 Piles ...... 15 11 Removal of T.

Other Foreign Medical Services American Clinic .—The American Clinic opened this year in June but later had to be closed for staff-changes. Doctor White then came and re-opened it. He is a good natured doctor and a helpful colleague. The Egyptian Medical Mission arrived on October 5tb, 1946, with Doctor Mohammed Osman Bouk as its head, assisted by 12 doctors, 49 other trained assis tants, besides messengers, etc., their Medical Service arrangements were the same as last year. Doctor Abdul Rebman Zahawi, along with one dispenser and three other persons forihed the Iraqi Medical Mission. The Netherlands Dispensary at Mecca functioned throughout the year. It was operated jointly by the British and Netherlands Legations, until June Isj; 1946, after which the Netherlands Legation took sole charge. Doctor Suleiman Kleibo headed the Palestine Medical Mission. His camp was outside the city. « • Doctor Hassan el Hakim, assisted by Doctor Abdul Aziz and fifteen other staff members, formed the Sudan Medical Mission. Although they also camped outside Jedda, they offered hospital treatment and rendered veiy good service to the public and pilgrims.9 LEGATION MEDICAL STAFF if Mr. Faiz Mohammod Qureshi, 3rd Dispenser, arrived on March 23rd, 1946, by “S. S. Jehangir”, and Mr. Rahim Dad Khan, Head Dispenser, arrived on August 2nd, 1946, by S. S. “Khosrou” and so filled the two vacancies in the Jedda dispensary. Mr. Abdullah Malabari, acting Dispenser, reverted to his original post as dresser on August 3rd, 1946. Doctor Abdul Rehman Khan and S. Allah Ditta, dispenser, ha 1 to be sent back to India early for urgent domestic reasons in one case and on account of illness in the other. The other temporary staff left by S. 8 . “Alavi” on February 14tb, 1947. (5) INTERNAL TRANSPOEX 4. Motor vehicles ordered from the United States of America for the Saudi Arabian Motor Transport Company faikd to arrive in large enough quantities and as a result great difficulty was experienced both by the pilgrims and the Com pany. Buses, which were advertised in the Saudi schedule of tariffs, were not available and the small cars were also so inadequate that the Company could not comply with the demands of the pilgrims. Egyptian pilgrims, who paid in advance for small cars for their transport had in many cases to travel by new lorries. Only a few Indians pilgrims could get small cars. When three or four ships arrived with pilgrims on the same day, the transport difficulty was keenly felt. On several occasions, pilgrims had to travel in open trucks in order to be in Mecca in time for the rites coimected with pilgrimage. Pre-payment of Saudi Government dues in their countries of origin assisted pilgrims of other nationalities to obtain trans port for Mecca or Me ’ina. The Indians, who alone had not paid their dues in ad vance and l ad to make the payments in Jedda on landing, were greatly delayed. 2. Indian pilgrims also suffered more than other nationalities, because of the heavy baggage they brought with them, which they insisted on carrying with them to Mecca or Medina. There were often troubles in this respect between the pil grims, the chauffeurs and the Motor Transport Company. Through the help of the Saudi Mudir-el-Haj, the disputes were amicably settled, but it is desirable that Indian pilgrims should be di couraged from travelling with unnecessary heavy baggage. 3. The number both of motor vehicles and camels was far below require ments for the journey from Mecca to Arafat and return to Muna. The situation deteriorated when the Saudi Arabian Government announced on the 7th Dhu’l Hijja that the owners of private motor vehicles were prohibited from hiring out their vehicles either for the transport of pilgrims or for the use of local residents. These private motor vehicles had always proved a great blessing on this occasion inasmuch as the Motor Transport Company could never cope with the total demand. As a result of this prohibition, the distress of pilgrims and also of local residents was immense, but nothing was done to remedy the matter. On the return jour ney from Arafat to Muna, some respectable pilgrims—both male and female— had to proceed on foot with their baggage on their heads, in spite of their having paid in advance for motor hire. Pilgrims of all nationalities suffered greatly ou this score. 4. The one-way traffic system from Arafat to Muna proved very helpful^ ^vnd effected a decrease in the number of accidents* 5. The journey to Medina after the Haj by motor vehicle was subject to as # much control as possible, the pilgrims being despatched in accordance with the date of their ships’ arrival in Jedda. Indian pilgrims became very impatient and demanded early transport for Medina, in spite of the fact that their ships were not due for some time ahead. Owing to the shortage of motor vehicles, two si ips for the transport of Egyptian pilgrims were delated in Jedda beyond the schedul ed time as the pilgrims could not reach Jedda in time. Heavy rain and floods also caused motor traffic difficulties on certain occasions.- IQ 6. Unlike previous years, the Saudi authorities collected from pilgrims only the single journey fare for their journey from Jedda to Meooa, instead of the return fare. This new arrangement undoubtedly proved a great blessing as difficulties were always experienced in the past in claiming refunds of the return fare from the Saudi Arabian Govermnent in respect of pilgrims who died in Mecca after having paid for the return journey. 7. In view of the insignificant difference between rates for camel hire and third class lorry hire, a very small number of pilgrims chose camels as their means of transport. Even the pilgrims’ heavy luggage is now normally transported by motor vehicles : Some managed to take their luggage with them by private ar- rangements with the chauffeurs, while others hired a third class lorry for the pur- ^ pose. Camelmen, seeing thoir livelihood disappearing, represented their difficulties to the King. As a result, the King issued strict instructions to the effect that pilgrims’ baggage weighing more than the prescribed 30 Kilos (which was free) must- be transported by camels, and the Motor Transport Company were strictly forbidden to carry heavy baggage. This order was issued at the time whe i the S. S. “Islami” reached Jedda on September 24th, 1946. The pilgrims insisted on taking their luggage with them, and the Motor Transport Company refused to accede to thoir request. Representations had no effect, until Sheikh Mohammed Saroor, the Director of Pilgrimage Affairs, intervened in the matter and allowed the pilgrims to carry their baggage with them in the motor vehicles. 8. Pilgrims who visited Medina before the Haj had to pay the charges fixed for overstay beyond the prescribed period of eight days. Through the good offices of Sheikh Mohammed Saroor, however, Indian pilgrims who visited Medina after the Haj were allowed to stay in Medina without payment of any extra charge as long as they were under the Legation’s instructions to await in Medina the arrival of their ships for their return journey. (6) CUSTOMS 1. With the special permission of the Saudi Mudir-el-Haj, arrangements were made this year to depute some temporary staff from the Indian Vice-Consu- 1 ’te to sssist at the customs shed. Some police constables and representatives of th? port Ha; Committee at Jedda and of the Saudi Pilgrimage Department were also depi ted for the first time to assist Indian pilgrims in the Customs. All the coolies in the customs were given numbers and badges to wear on their arms. A special shed in the customs was kept exclusively for the Indian pilgrims. 2. A large number of pilgrims brought with them articles which were duti able, but were often able to secure the officials’ goodwill in passing many of these articles. Heavily dutiable articles were kept in the Customs shed against receipts granted to the owners. It is only Indian pilgrims who are in the habit of bringing heavy goods with them, in some oases apparently for commercial purposes. This practice creates difficulties for other, less commercially minded, pilgrims and causes delay to all. 3. Arrangements were made for the first time to keep iced drinking water at the Customs shed where the pilgrims had to wait for hours in completing for malities. .« :*&amp; y; r fn o- afli.M ot tab * &lt;• '- - ? $ (7) RELIGIOUS POLICY 1. The Committee of Virtue functioned as usual. Pilgrims did not experience any hardship due to the presence of the Committee. 2. As usual, pilgrims visited the Holy Shrines and were allowed to touch the tailings ol the Prophet’s tomb at Medina on payment of a few piastres to the guards.Aiiitiuiil 11 3. “Dar el Khaizaran”, which was the place where owing to the persecution ®f the Quraish, the Prophet secretly taught the first converts, and where there existed a monument, has been given to a Nejdi Arab. The lattr has demolished the monument and constructed a house for his own occupation. 1. Mutawwifs for Javanese and Malayan pilgrims were expecting a large pilgrimage, but they were once again disappointed; a very insignificant number of pilgrims came from those countries. ^ 2 Mutawwifs for other nationals were more fortunate. Those who failed to recieve regularly their proper share of the Government dues resorted to such means as they could to get money, but no serious complaints were heard in this respect. Some of the Mutawwifs for Indian pilgrims, on receipt of a gratuity from t their pilgrims or to win their goodwill, sent their pilgrims to Jedda from Mecca, without consideration of the “batch” to which they belonged. These pilgrims , bad to remain in Jedda till the turn of their batch came for repatriation. The introduction of the Batch System in the Indian pilgrimage handicapped the Mutaw wifs who, in the past, could secure passages for their favourites by sending their pilgrim passes in advance to the Wakils in Jedda. Tne Batch System, therefore, became veiy unpopular with them and they made much propaganda amongst their pilgrims against it. 3. The Mutawwifs incurred the displeasure of their pilgrims for their failure to provide means of conveyance to Arafat. Though they had no responsibility in the matter, they were made the scapegoats and they bore the brunt of the pilgrims’ wrath. Some of the Mutawwifs were even beaten by thoir pilgrims. 4. Pilgrims of the Memon community, who are subject to the “Taqrir” sys tem, approached King Abdul Aziz for the removal of this restriction and for per mission to choose their own Mutawwifs, freely and independently. The matter was pressed hard, and the King promised to look into it. There seemed to be a chance of the abolition of the system, but the Vested interests of the Mutawwifs concerned may succeed in preventing it. 5. The list of Mutawwifs forwarded by the Legation to the Government of India to enable pilgrims to make their choice has not so far availed to serve the pur pose intended, and the pilgrim rarely seems to consult the list in making his selec tion. On the other hand, this list has indirectly served a purpose inasmuch as the rival brokers of the Mutawwifs, who make propaganda in India in favour of their principals, sometimes take advantage of this list to influ. moe undecided pilgrims against a certian Mutawwif by suggesting that as his name is not inolud- '■ V ed lie must be dead and they will have no representative in the Hejaz. 6. Since Government of India regulations do not permit a non -Indian to enter India without the permission of the Government, the Mutawwifs and their deputies have been deprived of the free access they had in the past to reach Indian Moslems in their villages. This was a great advantage, but they now reach their clients through former pilgrims, who act as their brokers. The touting activities those former pilgrims are proving very injurious to the pilgrims’ best interests. 1. In the light of experience gained during the 1364 pilgrimage season, the Saudi Arabian Govermnent decided that in 1365 the pilgrims must pay the tariff dues in their own currencies, instead of choosing one of three prescribed curren cies. Difficulties wore experienced only in respect of Indian pilgrims, who pav the dues on landing in Jedda. The Saudi Arabian Government had request-, d (8) MUTAWWIFS , — wun tms ns have now begun to uo their best to get their names included.

PILGRIMAGE TARIFFia that Indian pilgrims should pay the dues in India, but the Government of Indi® refused. Subs equently the Saudi Arabian Government proposed that the Legatio 11 should collect the dues from the pilgrims on board ship before disembarkation, but this was considered impracticable. Finally it was arranged that the Indian pilgrims would pay the dues on landing in Jedda, and in Indian rupees only. T-hey brought sufficient money in Indian rupees to cover the dues, and ncr complaint arose about loss in exchange. 2. Full Saudi dues were demanded from the Takruni pilgrims this year. After representations by His Majesty’s Minister, they were exempted, but for the last time. g 3. Unlike last year, pilgrims were required to pay in Jedda only the Saud' dues and the single fare for the journey from Jedda to Mecca, Return fare from Mecca to Jedda and the transport charges for Arafat were not collected in ad vance ; pilgrims were required to pay for these items when the occasion for such journeys occurred. The minimum amount payable by a pilgrim was rupees 496£ or £E.36-322m/ms. In fact, the amount paid by the great majority ot pilgrims was rupees 499 £14 annas or E. 36-565m/ms per head, inasmuch as a very small number of pilgrims used the third class lorry for their transport. (10) INDIAN PILGRIMAGE 1 . The Indian pilgrimage began in 1946 with the arrival of S. S. ^ Rizwani ^ on July 29th ; the last arrivals were by the steamships “Shirala” and “Khosrou” on October 29th. Besides these direct sailings, some Indians came from the Sudan, East Africa, South Africa, Iraq, Egypt, the Persian Gulf and Europe. 2. The Mogul Line and the Haj Line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. The S. S. “Shirala” was chartered by the Government of India for pilgrims who had failed to secure accommodation on the regular services. Steamer tickets were issued by the Mogul Line Limited, and this ship Was added to the Mogul fleet for purposes of the “Batch” system. 3. The Government of India also chartered two aircraft of the Indian National Airways for the transport of Indian pilgrims to the Hejaz. Alter the Haj, the two groups who came by these planes returned to India by the same route. The departure of the second batch was delayed a few days by bad weather ; the pil grims much resented this delay. An aircraft of the Deccan Airways also was char tered by some wealthy pilgrims who visited Iraq and Egypt en route. Saudi Ara bian aeroplanes also engaged in the transport of pilgrims to India and Beyrouth after the pilgrimage. These planes had the advantage of flying across the Saudi desert which reduced the journey and brought the pilgrims to Karachi in eleven hours. Some pilgrims who did not wish to wait for the ships for which they held steamer return tickets and could afford to purchase air passages took advantage of the Saudi pianos for th dr return to India . In most of the cases, the steamer return fare was refunded to them in Jedda, under protests by the local shipping agents which seemed not unjustified. 4 .

In view of the many difficulties caused by allowing pilgrims to leave in , the order of their return to Jedda, the Legation attempted to enforce the ‘‘Batch” System, and return passages of Indian pilgrims on homeward-bound vessels were * accordingly allotted in the order of the pilgrims’ departure from Indian ports It cannot be denied that the Batch System does not eliminate all difficulties in ^ arranging the return passage of pilgrims, but inasmuch as this system is practised by the Consular authorities of all other nationalities and no better system has yet been devised, there was every reason for trying it in respect of Indian pilgrim* as well. As expected, the introduction of this system created ill-feeling and discon tentment amongst a certain section of pilgrims who did not wish to wait their turn and especially amongst the Mutawwifs, because these latter had previously *&gt;e en in a position to secure passages for their favourites by any ships they liked, ihe operation of the Batch system was frustrated by the irresponsible action of the Mogul Line who failed to provide ships at regular dates. Nevertheless, in spite of many objections, this system worked far better than the previous system and eliminated a good deal of bribery. It was unfortunate that the Batch number was not in all cases stamped on the return tickets and the pilgrims passes before the pilgrims’ departure from India. 6. A certain number of pilgrims holding Mogul Line return tickets travelled back to India by purchasing fresh tickets on the Haj Line, to save a few days*waiting. Refund of return passage money was refused in such cases. The last Indian pilgrim boat, S. S. “Akbar”, sailed from Jedda on January 25th, 1947, trans porting the last batch of Indian pilgrims (Batch No. 15) and 36 pilgrims from ear lier batches who, for reasons of their own, had not claimed their right to travel by previous sailings. Food Accommodation etc. on Board the Pilgrim Ship 7. Vehement protests and criticisms were made by a very large number of pilgrims regarding the arrangements made by the Mogul Line for supplying food during the voyage. Pilgrims on some ships did not touch the food supplied and lived on fruit during the voyage, and on landing in Jedda they presented biils^ the Indian Vice-Consulate claiming a refund of the money paid to the shipping company for food. They were asked to present their claims for the refund in India, if they cared to do so. Pilgrims travelling by some ships of the Mogul Line threatened to declare a hunger strike if conditions were not improved. It is very regrettable that such protests and criticisms should be made by pilgrims every year, and yet nothing is done to remedy matters. The Mogul Line seem t7 have no excuse, as the pilgrims travelling by the Haj Lino were loud in their pra so of the food supplied to them. The congestion on board the pilgrim ships cannot be eased until Indian pilgrims are discouraged from carrying unnecessarily bulky baggage with them, and a satisfactory system is introduced to encourage them to st)re their heavy baggage in the holds. The present system is so defec tive that pilgrims seem to be justified in keeping all their baggage with them. In the absence of any presoribod regulations in this respect, the agents of the Haj Line made very satisfactory arrangements for the unlo -ding of heavy and bulky baggage. 8. Suitable persons were appointed as “Amir ul Haj’’ by the Legation on the return journeys on the same lines as were followed in the past. The proposed standard system of reports by the Amirs ul Haj was not uniformly followed by them. The Government of India failed to supply the forms to the Legation in time for them to be used by the Amirs ul Haj on homeward-bound pilgrim boats. Pilgrim Passes • • 9. The paramount necessity of affixing photographs to the pilgrim passes is again emphasised in the interest of pilgrims themselves and of all those who are engaged in pilgrimage work. Pilgrims of all other nationalities—who are no less devout Moslems—have their photographs affixed to their passes, and it is hoped that the authorities in India may see fit to impose similar procedure. In 1943, the desirability of having the pilgrims name and father’s name written in Urdu in the pass, and on the steamer tickets, was brought to the notice of the Govern ment of India , and they agreed to take the necessary measures in this respect. Nothing seems to have been done so far. This is essential, as the Mutawwifs and Wakils here cannot road English characters, and on many occasions tickets and passes are delivered to the wrong persons. The Legation are also considering the possibility of suggesting to the Government of India the introduction of a new type of pilgrim pass. Registration 10. The usual arrangements for registration of pilgrims worked on the whole satisfactorily. The initial failure of the Port Haj Committee at Bombay to s^-1 lists with the ships handicapped the work. Further difficulties arose from errors in the lists prepared by the Port Haj Committee at Karachi. Of the Indian pil grims shown as arriving by sea, 19,458 were registered at this Legation. Reports of loss of pilgrim passess and steamer return tickets were properly dealt with, and pilgrims were not inoonvenienoed in any way on this score. 450 pilgrims reported the loss of their pilgrim passes during the season, and they were granted Emer gency Certificates.15 Destitutes 11. 220 destitute Indian pilgrims and Muhajirs were repatriated to India at the expense of the Government of India. The following routes of access were adopted by them. Route of Access Overland — Via Gwaiar-Muscat-Mokulla-Yemen . Fio Gwadar-Dobai-Riyadh Fta Kirachi-Mokulla-Yemen Via Bombay-Mokulla-Yemen .

The principal banking concerns in Jedda are, as in previous years, the Netherlands Trading Society, which has branches in India, and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, whose Indian oorrespondents are the National Bank of India. Pilgrims who brought drafts on the Netherlands Trading Society com plained of the unfavourable rate at which their drafts were exchanged. 13. The Government of India deputed Mr. A. D. Azhar, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Finance Department, to study the problem of exchange in the Hejaz and devise means to minimise the difficulties of pilgrims in this respect. Mr. Azhar’s report has now been submitted to the Government of India. 14. Those who wished to leave surplus cash in safe custody were allowed to deposit it at the Indian Vice-Consulate. Arrangements were made to pay them out of their deposits, in accordance with their needs, at Mecca and Muna. The total amount so deposited was rupees 39,854, all of which was withdrawn by the depositors during their stay in the Hejaz, with one exception. In that case the deposit, amounting to 500 rupees, was sent to the Government of India in the Commonwealth Relations Department for transmission to the depositor. (11) PALESTINIAN AND TRANSJORDAN PILGRIMAGE 1. According to figures published by the Palestine Department of Health 2,142 Palestinian and Transjordan nationals registered as intending pilgrims as compared with 1,221 in 1945. The Saudi quarantine returns (see Chapter 2) show the number of Palestinian and Transjordanians who entered the country through the port of Jedda as 2,199. 2. No. figures are available of pilgrims who travelled overland from these territories.16 3. All Palestinian and Transjordan pilgrims were carried to and from this country in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. The pilgrims outward and home ward journeys were again this year regulated by the batch system, which worked well. The steamers adhered to schedule, and few complaints were reoeived from pilgrims regarding shipping facilities. 4. The Medical Unit, consisting of the Medical Officer in Charge, Doctor Suleiman Kleibo, two clerks, two medical orderlies, two drivers, one male attend ant and one cook, with vehicles, stores and equipment arrived in the S. S. “Taif” on September 19th, 1946. 5. The vehicles, stores and equipment were unloaded at the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s pire, by courtesy of the manager. 6. The camp was located on high ground in the vicinity of the barracks, some two hundred yards to the north of the Medina gate, and in close proximity to the site occupied by the Mission in 1945. It was severely damaged on two occasions by strong winds and rain, and a large quantity of equipment was lost in the hurricane of November 9th. The services of the Mission were greatly ap preciated both by the pilgrims and staff of the Legation. 7. The Mission left Jedda in the S. S. “Zamalek” on December 2nd 1946. 8. During the return season the total sum of P. 3,949.000 m/ms. was refund ed to 564 pilgrims. 9. Emergency travel documents were issued to pilgrims who reported the loss of their pilgrim booklets. 9 t ^ r (12) SUDANESE PILGRIMAGE 1. Under the heading “Sudanese and Shanqitis” Saudi quarantine returns show that 2,012 pilgrims entered the port of Jedda from Suakin on pilgrimage, as compared with 926 in 1945. 2. They were, as usual, carried to and from Jedda in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. All pilgrims arrived in good time for the pilgrimage. During the return season numerous complaints were reoeived regarding the lack of shipping facilities. Ships were frequently behind schedule owing to their diversion to the Egyptian pilgrimage. The position was severely aggravated when the Saudi qua rantine authorities refused to authorise the ships to carry more than 650 souls in the case of the S. S. “Talodi” and the S.S. “Taif”, although according to the Sudan Government regulations, they were authorised to carry 800 and 426 in the case of the S. S. “Zamalek”. The consequent delays occasioned great hardship to pil grims awaiting embarkation at Jedda. 3. The Medical Mission, under the charge of Doctor Hassan El Hakeem, Medical Inspector, arrived at Jedda on October 8th, 1947. The Mission’s vehicles were unloaded at the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s pier. 4. The Field Hospital was again located on the old site some two kilometres along the Jedda-Mecca road until November 9th, when a hurricane caused so much damage to tentage and equipment that the entire hospital and staff were moved to the ground floor rooms of the building occupied by His Majesty’s Consul. 5. As usual, the Mission’s work was highly appreciated by pilgrims and local Saudis alike, and the numerous expressions of praise were thoroughly deserved by Doctor Hassan and his staff who worked under the most trying conditions. 6. The Mission left Jedda in the S. S. “Zamalek” on January 12th, 1946. 7. This year the Sudan Government appointed an Administrative Officer, Abdel Mahmud Effendi Ahmed Nasir, Mamur, El Dueim, to accompany the pil grimage. Owing to his late arrival there was, unfortunately, little opportunity for him to make the contacts and acquire the necessary knowledge of local adminis tration, to be of practical us«. / A ir &lt; » '17 8. Mr. Haig, the Assistant Commissioner at Port Sudan paid a brief but wel come visit to Jedda in October, when various aspects of the pilgrimage were dis cussed with mutual advantage. 9. During the return season 142 Sudanese pilgrims were refunded a total sum of two hundred and thirteen Egyptian pounds. (13) WEST AFRICAN PILGRIMAGE I \ 4 r l. Saudi quarantine returns show that 6,843 West Africans entered the port of Jedda from Suakin for pilgrimage as compared with 5,480 in 1945. They were as usual carried to and from Jedda in ships of the Khedivaial Mail Line. 2. Although no accurate figures are available regarding pilgrims who travel ed by dhow via Massawa and the Eritrean coast^ reliable reports from the local Sheikhs indicate that the traffic continues unabated. 3. For the first time for many years several hundred indigent and semi- indigent West African pilgrims crossed the Red Sea illegally in dhows from the Sudan coast. One party of seventy odd souls was reported to have been landed at a bay some forty to fifty miles south of Jedda. They wore put ashore without food or water and informed that Mecca was “just behind the hills”. The remains of some of them were later found on the roadside within twenty miles of Jedda and within a few miles of the nearest well and the water which might have saved their lives. 4. Large numbers of those who arrived at Jedda were taken into custody by the Saudi authorities but were eventually released and permitted to perform the pilgrimage when the dhows “Nakodas” paid quarantine dues and undertook to repatriate the pilgrims after pilgrimage. 5. The introduction in 1946 of full scale pilgrimage dues for these “Takrunis” will, unfortunately, tend to encourge this highly dangerous means of illicit travel By arrangement with the Government of the Sudan, 650 illegally entered West Africans were repatriated to Suakin by dhow early in May, 1947. Following a visit to Jedda by Mr. Thomas, Commissioner, Port Sudan, in February, 1947, the Sudan Government also agreed to permit the return to the Sudan, in small groups, of West Africans holding return tickets, after the pilgrimage season had formally closed. Hitherto, West Africans who missed the last pilgrim ship to Suakin have been obliged to lemain in the Hejaz until the next pilgrimage season. 6. During the return season 218 pilgrims who travelled under the auspices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme were refunded the total sum of L. E.220.180/mms. 9 (14) SOMALI PILGRIMAGE 1. Under the heading “Somalis and Eritreans” Saudi quarantine returns •bow that 120 pilgrims entered the port of Jedda, as compared with 71 in 1945. No figures are available regarding pilgrims who travelled overland from During the return season 11 pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £67-10-0. 4. Emergency travel documents were issued to pilgrims who satisfactorily proved the loss of their pilgrim passes. 2 . Aden. 3.18 (15) PILGRIMAGE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE COLONY AND PROTECTORATE OF ADEN 1. Under the heading “Adenese and Hadhramis” Saudi quarantine returns show tnat 1,051 pilgrims disembarked at Jedda for pilgrimage as compared with 1,338 in 1945. 2. No figures are available regarding pilgrims who travelled overland. 3. The usual complaints were received during the return season regarding the lack of shipping facilities from pilgrims who had to wait for nearly a montfc^ in Jedda for return passages. ! J 4. During the return season Emergency Certificates were issued to pilgrims who satisfactorily proved the loss of their travel documents. (16) ZANZIBARI AND EAST AFRICAN PILGRIMAGE © £ According to Saudi quarantine returns 40 pilgrims from Zanzibar and Mombasa entered the port of Jedda for pilgrimage, as compared with 22 in 1945. (17) SOUTH AFRICAN PILGRIMAGE Saudi quarantine returns show that 65 South African pilgrims entered the port of Jedda on pilgrimage, as compared with 2 in 1945. The figure does not apparently include 21 pilgrims of means who landed at Jedda from a “Dakota” aircraft on August 5th, 1945. (18) CYRENAICAN AND TRIPOLITANIAN PILGRIMAGE No pilgrims are reported as having arrived from these territories for the 1946 pilgrimage. GIPD—S2-S132 EA&amp;CWR—2-6-48—25 ycopy No.lOOE British Embassy, (604/14/49) Jedda. 28th May 1949. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have received from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs a note, a translation of which I enclose, tb the effect that the Saudi Customs and Agricultural Regulations in force require that fruit, plants and vegetables imported into Saudi Arabia should be free of blight and disease, and that they should be 'fumigated” at the port of export. A telephonic enquiry addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has elicited the explanation that the intention of this clause is not to impose a general requirement for the fumigation (or spraying or dusting - all appropriate processes are apparently inten ded to be included under the term 'fumigate”) of fruits vegetables and plants, but only to ensure that whatever pre cautions and processes are usually applied at the port of shipment should be applied to consignments destined for Saudi Arabia. I am not aware of any Saudi Arabian regula tions or restrictions of the nature referred to, and am asking for copies. 2. The Saudi Arabian authorities ask that they in their turn should be informed of the nature of any blights or plant diseases which exist in the United Kingdom or in territories under British control. 3. I should be grateful if this information could be appro priately publicised. I am not however aware of any imports of fresh fruits, vegetables, plants or seeds into Saudi Arabia from the United Kingdom. I should also be grateful for instructions as to any reply or comment which you would wish me to address to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Head of the British Middle East Office, Cairo, to the Governor General, Khartoum, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain and to the Acting Governor, Aden. I have the honout to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, (D.

The Saudi Arabian Ministry of foreign Affairs present their compliments to the British EmSassy, Jedda, and request that they will be good enough to communicate to the com petent authorities in the British Government the fact that they should not permit the shipment of any kind of vegetables fruits and plants to this country unless they are free of any blight and also fumigated at the port of export, so that it will be possible to apply the agricultural precaution against infection by blight. They request that they may be informed of the agricultural blight (diseases) existing in Britain and British countries. The Ministry take this opportunity to express their highest respect.

Pilgrimage to Meccas Health Requirements. I have received a note from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs setting out following requirements for the vacci nation and inoculation (to be certified on internationally recognised forms) of all persons landing in Saudi Arabia. (a) Small-pox - vaccination not less than fourteen days, not more than three years before arrival. (b) Cholera - inoculation not less than six days nor more than six months before arrival. (c) Yellow Fever - inoculation not less than ten days nor more than four years before arrival. Required in the case of persons coming from suspected or Infected areas only. 2. Corkill, the British Health expert now advising the Saudi Arabian Government has told a member of my staff that the note does not correspond with his recommendations. He wished to require immunisation against cholera for a period from two months before to two months after the pilgrimage only and to exclude typhus and include typhoid inoculations. 3* I realise that these additional requirements will invoke considerable extra work for the Governments and Administrations concerned. On the other hand it seems undesirable to discourage the Saudi Arabian Government in their attempts to make their Quarantine organisations more effective and any representations should preferably be confined to attempting to secure the elimination of any provisions in the new regulations which will serve no useful purpose or are not in accordance with the latest international practice. 4. I should be grateful therefore for early instructions whether I should make representations on the lines of Doctor CorkiH's comments above. The first pilgrim sailings from the Far East will leave on 28th May so time is short.

You will observe that the competent department now admits that the regulations referred to in the original note have not yet been drafted, but that they now specifically require a certificate to accompany each consignment stating that it is free from 'agricultural pests', and that the consignment has been 'fumigated'. Neither the 'pests', nor the required process of fumigation are defined. 3. In the absence of any published customs statistics it is impossible to make definite statements, out I believe that imports of fruit and vegetables into Saudi Arabia from Bri tish territories are very small. Small quantities of vege tables may be flown in from time to time by the Arabian American Oil Company and others from Asmara, and citrus fruits have latterly arrived from Cyprus. Shipments of fruit from South Africa are of course possible, though I am not aware^ that any have been made up to date• I should be grateful if you would inform those likely to be concerned of the regula tions . 4.
