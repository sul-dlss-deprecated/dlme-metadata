The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to clause (S) of rule 5 of the Defence Savings Provident Fund rules which prescribe that no subscription shall be payable after the expiry of twelve months from the date on which the war is declared to have terminated. For purpose of the above rules, it has been decided that 1-4-46 should be treated as the date of the termination of war. Under clauses (1) and (3) of rule 5 of the fund rules, a sub scriber has the option to discontinue subscription only at the beginn ing of a year and the subscriptions will continue to be paid twelve months from the date of termination of war. Also, under clause (b) of Rule 13 and the first proviso thereunder, the amount standing to the credit of a subscriber shall become payable to him on the expiry of twelve months from the said date provided that within six months following that date he gives notice of his intention to claim payment. The Governor General in Council has, however, decided to allow subscribers the option to discontinue subscriptions at any time after 31st March 46 and to withdraw their entire balances in the fund, at any time thereafter. The undersigned is to request that the subscribers to the fund, who are still i^ service should be informed of this decision. Necessary amendments to the Rules will be issued in due course.,2.
