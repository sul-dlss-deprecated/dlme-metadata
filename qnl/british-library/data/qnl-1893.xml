The Political Agency, BAHRAIN.Notes on Women's Medical Services in Bahrain I visited the Government Maternity Home at Muharraq on March 15th ©nd was very much impressed by the way in which it was run and the number of patients who use it* The building is an Arab house fomerly belonging to ShaikJi Ayesha and has adapted it self to its new purpose without any structual alterations. There are two entirely separate courtyards, the first of which is used for the outpatients, and contains a waiting-room, doctor’s consulting room, dispensary and surgery for treatments and minor operations. The clinics are held here twice a week and on these occasions Dr. Doeg and a full staff from the Government Women’s Hospital come over to Muharraq. The Maternity Home is in charge of Mrs. Baud who is fully trained, and she is assisted by Arab women of the ayah type. The number of cases during the month runs from 26 to 30, but is never less than the former figure ©nd four babies had been born the morning I was there. Patients who take private rooms pay Bs.40/- for their confinement and this includes doctor’s fee, nursing and everything except food which they provide themselves, and which their relations cook in the kitchen of the house which has about twelve separate cooking places. The other patients pay nothing. The house was spotlessly clean and the patients all seemed very happy and contented. I also visited the State Women’s Hospital, the maternity patients being the most numerous. Here Good is provided and the charge for a room shared by two separate patients in the maternity block is Rs.50/- for the confinement. Other private rooms are available at Rs.10/- a day and a private single room for a maternity case costs Ks.100/-. The Matron, Miss Maguire, is also in charge of the nursing in the Men’s hospital, and 4s assisted by three European sisters and a number of Indian and Bahraini nurses, the latter having been trained in Baghdad at the expense of the State. One ward is kept for patients suffering from Venereal Disease, of which there is a good deal in Bahrain, though an energetic attempt is now being made to stamp it out. Here again I was much struck by the cleanliness of the hospital and the cheerfulness of the patients. I next visited the Lunitic Asylum which consists of a building containing rooms opening from one long corridor surrounded by a well kept garden. Each patient has a room to himself or herself with a bed in it, the door and window are barred and the door is always kept locked when the patients are in the room. Great improvements have been effected in the condition of the Asylum lately and the patients are now given sheets and proper bed linen, and the bad old system by which the KX3tXH±*xdxxlHHdxtii±isxXMXHXKH o&amp;fcste only sanitary arrangement was a hole in the wall through which the excreta drained into an open ditch which was flushed outside the rooms has been abolished. The patients are now taken regularly to the latrines, and the rooms are very clean. They all appeared to be well fed and comfortable and the doctor In charge is genuinely interested in his work. Since his arrival 16 patients have been discharged cured, and he is hoping shortly to start using modern methods of mental therapy, such as shock treatment. The tuberculosis sanitorium for men which is near though separate from the lunitic asylum is not yet quite finished. It consists of 6 rooms, which are big enough to take two beds, each opening on to a wide verandah, closed in by fly and mosquito proof netting. The pantry, store room and office are at one end of this verandah. The food for the tuberculosis patients is cooked in the same kitchen as that of the mental patients, but eventually Miss Maguire hopes to have a separate kitchen. I do not think that it is satisfactory that the same dhobi ghat should be used for both hospitals, nor the same kitchen, nor that the dhobi ghat should be in the compund of the tuberculosis sanitorium but I understand that These arrangements are only temporary.British Agency, Sharjah.
