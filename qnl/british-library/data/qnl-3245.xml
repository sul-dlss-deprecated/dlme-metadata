The Dalai intimated that this could be arranged. This suggestion was however evaded and about eight'days ixaias later tie Dalai ?/ith the son of the Private Secretary informed us xl that the Sultan and his staff had left Bombay on the 16th instant and that the articles were packed and locked K before their departure and the keys of the packages, jtoisi which comprised of two leather trunks, ten steel trunks and one roll carpet had been taken away by them. A suggestion was then made to obtain duplicate keys in order that two packages might be selected and examined. This was also evaded by representing the matter to Government ax and obtaining facility orders. The packages of H.H. fhe Sultan of Muscat have always been suspected to include packages containing restricted goods and gold which have been despatched through his ' private Secretary by other individuals. This has been confirmed by reports from Bombay and Karachi.Confidential D.O. No. 108--i British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire. 5th February, 1943, Please refer to your letter No. 8867-N/42, dated the 28th December, 1942,. regarding the ~»ultan of Muscat's luggage. 2, I do not like to leave the matter without any notice being taken of it; on the other hand the moment is not an opportune one to rub the Sultan u? the wrong way. It is quite probable that Shubaily did take the opportunity to ex port restricted articles or gold, but it is difficult to be certain that the oultan was Implicated in it, and it will be preferable for the moment to assume that he was not . I think therefore, unless Pelly knows of any strong reason to the con trary, that our best line Is to mention the evasive action of his staff, and to say that in view of wartime restrictions it will be difficult to give facilities in future unless they are prepared to cooperate. 3. I hesitate to suggest more forcible methods as one cannot be certain of the tact with which they will be applied, and there is no object in exacerbating the Sultan over a few restricted articles when hundreds of thousands of sovereigns leave India annually without detection.

We specifically asked that these two looked leather cases and ten locked trunks and one bundle should be exported as a special case, and the Government of India eventually sanctioned this in their telegram Ko.97211 dated the 19th December 1942.

The Arabic shows that both in the heading of the article and in the body His Highness is referred to as 'Aafflat' which is the more exalted form of 'Highness* and the one utiich we use in addressing him, the lesser for® being • SI boo ' which we use for Bahrain and Kuwait. Within his own territories the Sultan likes to be called ■•jalalat* #ilch means »MaJeBty*, in fact Dykstra, the American missionary in Muscat found he made no headway until his petitions contained this superscription, but apparently he . found the air of Cairo unsuited to this title I 2* The portion regarding his status is accurately translated where it says 'This Sultanate is independent but is bound to Britain with a treaty of Alliance and friendship', and since His Highness must hare supplied the information himself, it is a good sign that he should hare mentioned his treaty relations to an Arab Journalist, knowing that he would almost certainly be quoted. I am sending*a copy of this letter to Oaroe and also to Metfalfe and Hiokinbotham. Yours sincerely, Sd. Geoffrey Prior R * T.

This Sultanate is independent but is bound to Britain with a Treaty of Alliance and friendship. We asked His Highness the Sultan as to why he visits Egypt. He told ue 'I visit Egypt for the first time. I have passed by it once ^efore when I returned to my country from Europe in the year 1936. I had no time then to land and spend a few days here. And as I have decided to tour the Arab Countries I came to Egypt first where I will stay for a week and then I will leave for Syria and the Lebanon and I may go to lra &lt;i.

No discussions between us have taken place until now. As to my opinion on Arab Federation it is a great idea which we welcome. We hope that it will be realised soon between Arab Oovernments as between sister nations which are tied, since time immemorial, hy ties of language, history, religion and traditions which cannot be severed.
