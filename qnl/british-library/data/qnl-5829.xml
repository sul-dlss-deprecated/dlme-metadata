A &gt;‘0, (4343). TKK 1KB c-vino. May 1920. V MY Lo rd f I have tile honour to sub dt the follow ing remarks on the question of the rant of subsidies to Arab Hu3.ers f with reference to your Lordship 1 s Bespat h Ho*,532 of May 4ti, (^3915/2B54/44 ) $ transmitting the minutes of ? meet- ing held at the foreign Office on Anril 17th,in which 1 observe that the Treasury are not yet convinced of the necessity for the continuance of the subsidies. It appears to me that to arrive at a juot decision on this subject, it is necescary in the first place to compare th e no si t ion o f the differcnt wckm rulers now and before the war, to weigh tlie services of each during that period, to examine whether any responsiblity recto on is ilaj as by ’ s Go vemmout for the changes which have occurred, and, finally, to consider whether, on grounds of morality or expediency, it is justifiable to iimpose on the British taxpayer the burden of providing some or all of them with nonetary assistance in the future. The beginning of the war sa • an effective, if not entirely efficient, Ot toman ad inistrati n in th© Rojas i an Yemen; Ibn Han id a mediatised Turkish V&amp;esal; thr ^dris in revolt against the ruling power but already discussing terms of pease; and lbs Baud, who had not long before n ejected the Turks from i , ehswlng a dispooitio to resume his allegiance, provided that he Was allowed a free hand as Vhli of Hej d., and given an adequate stipend it ill bo seer that the feeling of racial consciousness w ich is now so marke , was already a rowing itself even i n th e . so r e ret no t e pa r t o f '• o 1' en iruml i, bu t a s fcu - : y o 1 ’ the records of the time will also show that the Ottoman The Sight Honourable Karl CuSttor of h.«dlcaton, K,G, t G,C, : , I, ,0. \ l.G®ve.tw:ent # li©w#ver unwillingly, wi« beginning to realise Its incapacity to retain by force the \rafc Conn trier. imd was preparing to grant a measure of self-gevermaent which might satisfy the aspirations of its inhabitants, fhs consideration o: the subject was, however, abruptly broken off bfr the commencement of the war, and after the Ottoman Gove 'nment had declared against the Allied Powers, Great Britain, taking advantage of the discontent w ici already existed, made proraise to the Sherif of Mecca, Ibm 5aud and the Xdrini which induced them definitely to cast off their allegiance and throw in tlieir lot with the Allies, 1 do not prepeee to exaroine and compare in detail the services performed by these three rulers, but I think it may fairly be said that each, according to his capacity, rendered real and effective aesist'uioe at a time w en the result of the war still hung in the balance and, by so doing, brought to nought the plans for a Jeha , diverted or rendered innocuous large Turkish forces and greatly facilitated xm our task in keeping open to traffic the Red Bea, it may be said with some show of justice that they have had their reward in gaining their independence and freeing therm elves f rem the Turkish yoke, V&gt;u t the fact ust not be lost sight of that, with the remov .1 ef the deminan, influence, the Arabian Peninsula was left without administrative and financial me;uis or experience for the preservation of order and for the substitution of effective loc 1 GovemaKit in place of what had existed previously, iuotwaoiw This applies in particular to the ejaa and I cannot refrain from thinking that the promises made by His Majesty’s Government iimpose a certain mere! obligation to ensure that the future of then# coantries is at least as orespareus as their east* 1 do not however wish to press unduly this mint since sentimental considerations must give way to those«*2m» of economy at the ^resent time an&lt;* I will m.89 on to the more practical aspects of the case. As Your ^erdmhivj io aware, t&gt;i.e Arab revolt was not regarded with sympathy either in India or in our other ehamnedim Countrier. This feeling still exlstr? today. The revolt can only be justified by its success and v/e shall undoubtedly lay ourselves open to severe critieiam if the Peninsula passes into a state of anarchy* Further t ^an this* the Allied policy with regard to &gt;yria and Palestine is not in accord with the wishes ©f * i the local populations and has already exposed His a e H©verninent to a charge of breach of promise and opened the field to Turkish Bolshevist propaganda from the North* The situation in the Middle Hast today gives rise to grave misgivings nd seems unlikely t© improve in the near future. On this account, 1 eon si Hr it is of great importance that, if we gain a special position in the Arabian Peninsula, his Aajest. •« Govern)tent sheull , I so e aploy it as to earn the gratitude of the people ami silence the criticism of these detractors who accuse us ©f synieism and self-interest in our treatment of the Arabs. At the present moment we ?ixe in a favourable position t© achieve t is since the factors which have rond&lt; red so restless the Arabs in Syria and Mesopotamia have not operated with any great force in the Peninsula itself, :md its Hulers, with the exception of the Iman fahya md the neu Amir of Hail, who has in mint of fact some under the influence of Ibn Baud, have given satisfactory proofs that they are prepared to look t© us for help and guidance and protection. The questions then arise whether we can gain our objeet wi thou t 'jhayment, imr&lt;, it not, whether the results achieved will justify tie expenditure. As regards the former point, I consider that the ; jiex'oeriisnee o v the 1 -.st ' our it* &amp; the --inswer to ^ ♦ be e aphatieally in the negative* I do not advocate any undue interference in the internal raid local affairn ©f i the fenineula, but I presume that we shall atterapt to ad, ust the relations between the different rulers an | el aim to influence all foreign relations, n it is only I reasonable to supoose that the rulers will re uire some quid pro quo* Furthermore, uoral influence has its v effect in the haul, but it will not always prove such a strong deterrent as the threat to cut off supplies, * more- especially in countries which are far removed from civilisation an where it is iraneesible to achieve a purpose by armed fore-:., W I d© not think it is too swell t® say that if we at- ; x tempt to gain a predeminant influence in Arabia without \ being prepared to pay for it, our efforts will result in . fa lure* | As regards the advant?^es .to be gained, I place first and foremost the chance ;f recovering and maintain* ing our prestige in the Middle Bast* have destroyed the lower which, howpver boldly* ruled .Arabic.).* ,*e ?aest put something in its place, -w&lt; , in no doing, endeavour to re-establish our good name for | disinterestedness end sympathy with Meelem rages* v/e are 1 an shall continue to be hampered in yria and bales tine, It is thereto re the too re necessar to seize? our oppor tunity in the Peninsula where the conditions are favour- | able an where we shall not be exposed to foreign rivalry ©nee our special position is recognised. Becondl , there is considerable evidence to show ; that a deter lined effort is being made to unite Islam j a ; vinot all Kuro wan Powers. A friendly Arabia will be an important check to thiu. ■ Thirdly, it is necessary to have a friendly population in the countries bordering our vital sea 'routes*Equal to these in import an e* # is the necessity of keeping open the pilgrimage routes to the Holy Places and ef ensuring that the pilgrimage itself is undertaken under h e t ter ■ ■ o i ■,i c. • • n l '-\-m ?: or merl. - * V.e are under judgment of the Moslems in rail n&amp;rts of the world in t is matter, and failure will do us incalcul able harm. Fifthly, I would place the advantages to British trade / : w ■ icli the opening up of the in t rior o the Peninsula will ^ afford, and, sixthly, the desirability of presenting other powers from gaining a predominant position, more especially in South We - t Arabia. t 1 trust that the ibo e oonsiderations will be sufiioierri f to Bhow that the advantage® to be won are not small and p that, in the event of His. Majesty’s Gevemraent being grant- * ed a S' eoiai position there, the necessity of affording j iaon€t vr / assistrjnce, until such time as tlie eifferent j ( eountries ean make their own way, will be recognised. l I undcrstiuid that it may be difficult for His Majesty’^ j bovemvent to rovide all the money and that joint &amp;u sid- | i@s or loans may be necessary. This would be unfortunate from a British point of view but it would not alter the principle which I mm endeavouring to lay dewn. It would merely mean that the responsibility and therefore the I credit to be gained would be collective. I am unaware of th- reasons which sail for a joint lean and should have 1 I thought thit the Subsidies granted to trie Eulers of daireir: l-uaqat, imd Kowelt by the Government of India before the war, would have furnished a useful precedent in claiming ' the sole right to give monetary assist,mce now. i I do not advocate the permanent conti^u&amp;ace of subsidies on the present scale, and I would gradually | replace them with stipends and loans. j I ijj, /111 the Rulers, v^ifch perhaps the exception of Ibn || ha shied, r-o scest- sea ports or tracts of land or ot ter I resources w ic are c cable of development, and I consider ir ' 8Q 6 that loans nho\aia be granted ere there s#e?a3 a rood prospective of a productive return .r t wltere asotir ty can toe offered* Stipends should, X t'idnk, he g-anted to ^ieg Husain, Ion S a ud *.md the Idrisi.

I r 7 dear 1'ore, With reference to previous correspondence regarding your complaint that Inward Hails have been delayed in delivering to the Pest Office at your port, I have received a long letter from our Koweit Agent today in reference to this. He is doing his very best in the matter and I trust that everything will go smoothly from now on. It would appear that where delays are likely to occur are in cases when the steamer arriving has only a few packages for discharge and it is necessary to take the downward mails ofi to the steamer immediately on her arrival so that they would he despatched from the Post Office before the inward mails were received. In cases where the steamer has a considerable number of packages to discharge and will be some hours in Koweic, Agents are arranging to land the inv/ard mails before they t tuv e ofr tne outward mails. In the former case, however, I shall be graceful if you will assist us by granting delivery of outward mails ro our clerk as soon as steamers are sighted. With kind regards,Ho. 7&lt; -C.

The High Commissioner^ simile of a lighter sinking during coaling is not a parallel, as in this case the loss took place prior to arrival alongside the ship. 3* I consider the Navy or the Bushire Coal Depot can in no way be held liable for the loss of this coal, as the loss occurred during the period between the arrival at the sh&amp;p and the departure from the coal Depot. 4, The Person primarily responsible is undoubtedly the nakhuda of the dhow for allowing his vessel to be overloaded as she certainly was, considering the possible conditions of weather &amp; the fact that she was an open boat, not even half decked as in the case of the second dhow. 5. As Sheikh Salim engaged the dhows A is being called upon to pay for the freightage, I consider that he should likewise be charged with the loss, he recovering from owners when settling with them.

The best course will be for you to advise the Shaikh to take security from the owner for kind treatment of the woman and call upon him to produce her before him periodically. If that cannot be arranged then he should be pressed to take her away from her present master and hand her to some respectable person on whom he can rely to treat her well.

Please see correspondence ending with your memo- -randum No. 81.C of 19th May 1921. The opinion of my Legal Adviser, whose comment I invited on the papers, is that the Navy should pay the hill and recover the value of 5 tons from the Shaikh of Koweit. That is clearly not a practicable solution from the point of view of the Navy and. the Senior Naval Officer does not see his way to write off the amount, the alternative is for the Shaikh to pay the amount or if you. still consider *f c/ that he cannot be invited to pay,£ the charge to be met from Political Funds. I really see little reason why the Shaikh should object to finding the money if the position is explained to him, and the circumstance under which the coal was sent for at his predecessor’s urgent request. I suggest you should discuss your difficulty with him in a friendly way. If he proves intractable, then'you must pay it yourself and if you cannot make re-appropriation to meet the charge let me know what the precise sum, which you cannot find, amounts to. jd 2 JLr HIGH COILII3 SIGNER.

It is in any case hopelessly out of date now; for example, the bija is described as a comparatively small boat, as I believe it always was twenty years ago, whereas now the biggest boats afloat are nearly all Wigs. Although I guarantee that I know every class of Kuwait boat now, there are some mentioned as belonging to this port which I have never heard of, and others which I know sihich are not given. I do not know if Col. Trevor has thought of tnis, but if not, it would be worth suggesting to him that he put someone on to do it, as a knowledge of the types of boats used is useful in connection with the arms traffic. To my mind the best way of describing them would be to give a photo, or diagram of each.D#0* Ho. 1 € K tr W A I T. -5th June 1o2i* Thanks for your D*0# or tlio 3f3x*d Juno, cvbout the slave woman.

The Shaikh is certainly ready to accept that argument as sufficient grounds for her manumission if it can be proved, and although I am not at all squeamish about slavery as such, I am sorry if the case is going to be dropped for that reason. In any case, it certainly comes under the heading of a case of “real cruelty w . I presume that, as he answered my original memo, the High Commissioner will decide the case now.

I have written and wired to Strick Scott several times to try and get one a propos of a motor cruiser for Bahrain but never succeeded in getting one - the last thing being a recommendation of a 50 by 10 feet launch 4* 6 W draught price about £.5300/- v/ithout a cabin(J) which they say can be rigged up locally. Apparently they have the launch on hand and want to get rid of it. I wonder launcn what d&amp;BH class it is a cargoperhaps. We haven’t any record of the cost of the ’’Lewis Felly” either, but I fancy it was the same as the Bahrain and cost 75 or 80,000 rupees. Any how the Military paid Hs.80,000/- for her in 1917 and presented her to Shaikh Mubarak. When we bought her back McOollum rather let Uhe down as I meant him to make an offer to the Shaikh with Rs .60,000/- as maximum, but he want and offereed Rs. 60,000/- straight off^ and threw in a mr+or bout r ff his own bat.
