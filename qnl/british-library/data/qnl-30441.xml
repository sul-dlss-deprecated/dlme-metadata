LOCAL GOV-ERin 'NTT. (a) Persian Navy . On the 26th November two Persian Officials, Captain Ibrahim, and Nr. Salim pio, left for Port Said by the overland route to fetch the Persian boot 'CHAICHELEH' which the Persian Government has recently purchased from Germanyfor Ts. 20,000. It is doubtful whether the boat is capable of reaching Bushire on its own. x '-Z x X■HMm Telegram. P. From, Political Muscat. To, Political Resident Bushire No. 71. D. 16th March 1931. A letter sent from Bushlre has arrived here for the Cattain of the vessel mentioned^ Do you knov/ what her movements are? The above refers to your Persian'Diary, para 146.D.0.NO.91-C Political Agency &amp; H.B.l/L’s Consulate Muscat,the 26th March 1931. ly dear Colonel, . My telegram No. 71 of 16th March ashing if you had any information about the movements of the Persian gunboat 'Chalcheleh”• 2. It seems to me that the arrival of Persian gunboats in the Gulf - if they ever actually materialize - will raise some awkward questions. As far as the Muscat State is concerned it will be most undesirable for such craft to have free entry into Oman harbours. The Arabs dislike the Persians and sooner or later some unpleasant, and perhaps violent, incident will occur. 3. The Persian Government - as I understand it - have not yet abandoned their c^aim lo Muscat: at all events they still xssue travel papers to intending travellers for Muscat such as are issued to those going from one part of Persia to another, and when I left Bushire in June last for here in order to avoid taking out one of these papers I had to say I was going to Indial The Persian authorities knew very well where I was going, but there it was. 4. I suggest for consideration that the Muscat State might take up the attitude that, until the Persian Government give up ail claim to Muscat, no Persian gunboat shall enter Oman waters. Also that when tneir claim has been given up no Persian gunboat shall enter Oman waters without giving a week’s notice, or whatever is the notice that the Persian Government now require from British sloops. That the Muscat State does not require this notice from British sloops is The Hon f ble Lieut.Colonel H.V.Biscoe, #1 * Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,2 . their own affair• &gt;1 (T 5. I have not f of course, said anything to the Council here about the above, and if the 'Chalcheleh' calls in here on her way from Europe it can be regarded as a f^st visit before the position was regularised* 6* The suggestions in para 4 are, of course, drastic, I quite realise that, and I merely put them forward tentatively • I certainly think some sort of control should be established over the visits of the gunboats to Oman ports. You may like to discuss the matter with Mr* Howell* Yours sincerely.wc . £2 of 1931. British Residency &amp; Ccnsulate-G-eneral, Bushire, the March 1931.

The Customs Department, Bushire, have no information as t c the whereabouts of the 'Chalchela*? The only information they have got is that she left Port Said twenty-two days ago. As she may touch at Muscat on her way to Bushire would you please retain the letter and hand it over when she arrives. By order, Captain, Under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Pers ian Gulf. L.P.Confidential D.O.No. oit■ 1 frV Karachi, the 3rd April 1931. # s Please refer to your D.O.No.91-C dated the 26th March 1931, about the ”Chalcheleh”. The ’’Chalcheleh' is not a Persian gun boat at all-. It is a launch about 50 foot long, which the Persian Govern ment originally bought from the Germans for use^ on the 0~/6rur t/f* • Caspian, but as the Russians refused to ofdown the Volga they had to send it round to Bushire. It is not, however, in any way a unit of the projected Persian l^avy, and what they will use it for I cannot imagine, but probably it will be handed over to the customs and made into a patrol boat for patrolling down the coast. In view of its size, however, it is very improbable that it will visit the Arab coast. As regards the general question however of Persian gun boats, I agree that the matter is important, and I propose to take it up when I go home. There are many issues involved and it will require very careful considera tion. You are not quite correct however in saying that the Persian Government have not yet abandoned their claim to Muscat; they do not claim Muscat, all they state is that they have no diplomatic relations with the Muscat Government and do not recognise them, and it is for this reason that they cannot accept documents issued by the Muscat authorities, or issue documents for Muscat. It is of course a ridiculous attitude, but then you know the Persians. Major T.C.W.Fowle,C.3.E., Political Agent, Muscat.C0NFIL2NTIAL. No. C-16 of 1932.

It is possible that in order to avoid incidents the question of visits by Persian warships to Arab ports may be discussed with the Persian Government before the arrival in the Gulf of the Persian Navy, ana His Majesty's Government have asked me to obtain from the Arab Rulers in the Gulf authorisation to inform the Persian Govern- -ment that these Rulers expect to receive prior notif le gation if Persian warships wish to visit their ports. 2 , Please obtain from His Highness the Sultan ol Muscat a formal letter requesting His Majesty's Govern- -ment to inform the Persian Government on His Highness' behalf that he expects formal notification to him through His Majesty's Government before any visit oi a Persian warship to his ports. It may be explained to His Highness the Sultan that similar authorisation is being obtained from all Arab Rulers in the Persian Gulf. .

Now that the Persian Navy have arrived in the Persian Gulf they may visit Arab ports any day without notifi cation and in this eventuality particularly if they visit Bahrain 1 should be glad of instructions as to what line I should take. 2 . Minister, Tehran, informs me that i ersian Govern ment have not been warned that Arab Shaikhs require notifi cation. Biscoe's views r.re contained in his telegram of 14th February last. My views are set forth in my letter of 7th September 1931. 3 . If Persian warships visit Bahrain there are four possibilities. (e) No party will be landed ( b) Party will be landed to purchase provisions etc. {c) Ceremonial visit on Shaikh and Political Agent will be sought. (d) Armed party will be landed not with the idea of actual aggression but to assert Persian claim to island 4. If (a) then policy advocated by Biscoe is suitable. lb) This will have to be permitted. (c) I suggest that I advise Shaikh and Political■hhhhhmh - 2 - Political A&amp;ent not to receive it on grounds that as Bahrain is an independent state notification should have been given. Since Shaikh has at our request informed us formally that he expects notification of visit, if none has been given he and his Gcv eminent will not unnaturally be much offended. (d) Legally such party could be resisted by force but for various reasons 1 do not suggest this. The landing of such a party however would of course be a most serious step on the part of the Persian Government. In all the circumstances I am still of opinion that sort of warning be conveyed to the Persian Government.Telegram From XX Government of India,Foreign and Political Department, ew Delhi. Wo.2448.

At the same time, if visit of Persian warship is made to Shaikh's territory without notification, which is contingency I have in mind, then Persian Government have ipso facto disregarded independence of Shaikh concerned and I do not think that a ceremonail call on Ruler, such as might be paid by Persian representatives on a Persian Governor or notable in a Persian port, would make up for non-notification, while the acceptance of such a call by the nuler would surely toondone the non-notification and weaken any subsequent protest. Moreover the effect on local opinion in the State of the Ruler of such acceptance would be undesirable and would not of course be corrected by a protest nteide at Tehran. - RasixMT3* 0 COx'Y .

Secret Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22 nd November, &amp;o. M.02989/32, on the subject of the action to be taken in the event of Persian warships visiting the States on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Sulf without notification, and to refer to the latest telegrams ^noted in the margin) on this subject from the Government of India ana the Prom Government of India ; iolitical resident in the Persian Gulf. 21 st November, 2621. ) Prom Political Kesident, ) 2. Sir Samuel Hoare has carefully 24th Kovenber,T/l03. } ) consida*ed the situation as a whole in the light of the views expressed by the various ruthorities interested. No difficulty appears to arise as regards contingencies (a) and lb) discussed in paragraph 3 of Colonel Powle's telegram No.705 of 31st October. As regards dontingency { c) referred to in that telegram, the point is perhaps not of very substantial importance save in the case of Bahrain. In the case of the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, if the Commander of a Persian warship expresses his desire to pay a ceremonial call, despite the fact that prior notification has not been given of the arrival of his ship, the Secretary or State, in the light of the views expressed in paragraph 2 of the Admiralty letter of 22nd November, agrees that such a call might be accepted on the first occasion, though it should in his view, be followed up • • •.up by formal representations at Tehran regarding the visit of &amp; Persian warship* ithout notification. The position is different in the case of Bahrain. Sir Sanuel hoare appreciates the force of the arguments adduced by His Majesty’s Minister, and supported by t e Government of India, as of the counter arguments suggested in Colonel Powle’s telegram of 24th November. It is,perhaps,as the Minister suggests, very improbable that the Persians will risk compromising their claim to Bahrain by instructing or permitting an officer of their Navy to pay a ceremonial call on the ihaikh. But on the other hand the danger cannot be overlooked that the opportunity of such a ceremonial visit, were the Shaikh to accept it, might be taken by the Persians to intimate in a public manner, e.g. in the event of His Excellency wceiving the party in Durbar, that he was regarded as a Persian subject, while any action on their part which could be construed as a formal recognition of the Shaikh's independence would inevitably be disavowed by Persia. On the whole, however, having regard to the considerations advanced by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State considers that the best course would be to leave to the discretion of the Political Agent, Bahrain, in the light of all the c ircumst 4 nces including those in which the Persian ship has arrived at Bahrain, the question whether or not a ceremonial call, if offered, should be accepted. In the event of any such call being accepted and passing without incident he would, however, propose first that the Shaikh should be advised not to receive a further ceremonadl call from &amp; ship visiting without notice, and secondly that a formal notification sho Id at once be made to the Persian Government in the name of the Shaikh that in future formal notice of such visits must be c iven. The Shaikh might in this connection take the opportunity to refer tf 0 )ais £991 re• 3- / 2 - © for not!float!on in any remarka he might address to the representatives of the Persian ship. 4# As regards contingency (d), . ir b. Hoare is in general agreement with the views of the lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. 5. The draft telegram now enclosed embodies the instructions which, subject to the concurrence of the lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir 3.

Government recognise that Persia might contend that acceptance of call during un-notified visit constituted recognition of Persian suzerainty and would certainly repudiate any counter-assertion that call constituted recognition of Shaikh’s independence: since, however Shaikh would only be following normal internation -al practice in receiving such call in spite of omission to notify, H.M* s. Government considers it desirable that Shaikh should afford usual courtesies unless the attendantattendant circumstances are quite exceptional, e.g. dis- -courtesies to harbour officials or acute tension in Anglo-Persian relations They are prepared to leave to the Political Agent 1 ii discretion to act in the light of his estimate of the circumstances. In the event of call following hrxxk an un-notified visit being accepted end passing without incident immediate formal protest would be made at Tehran. 4 As regards contingency Id) H.M’e. Government s^ggsst that in the event of Persians sending armed party to land at Bahrain the party should be met at pier by (preferably) European representative of Shaikh ( e.g. Belgrrve) by whom they should be informed on behalf of Bhaikh that His Excellency could not agree to party land- -ing with arms but that no objection would kMM be seen to their landing without arms for purpose of purchasing provisions, etc. If in light of communication of this nature Persians were nevertheless to land with arms question of employment of force would depend on their attitude and , actual proceedings. Clearly they could not be allowed to behave in such a manner as to undermine the authority of the Shaikh or our prestige in the eyes of the populat ion. But question whether xX and at what point Politic -al Agent should advise intervention of Bahrain police force must be left to his discretion if and when such a situation should arise. If intervention did become necessary, our position would have been strengthened by communication made to landing party at the commencement and onus of aggression would rest on the Persians. Kisk of attempted armed landing is probably serious only at Bahrain, but similar action to that suggested above might «Iso be taken in the event of anding at Kuwait or Muscat. As regards Trucial Coastwe shall probably have to take our chance and protest immediately on behalf of the Shaikhs affected. 7. Possibility of armed landing on Tamb, Abu Musa or other Arab islands caionot be overlooked but we obviously cannot immobilise sloops with object of j&amp;xjtxsKgxn consider preventing this. b.M’s. Government fchxxjc that risk must be faced. But immediate report should be sent in event of any action of this nature by Persian Navy with a view to necessary steps being taken. 8 * H.M f s. Government understand that Trucial flags are constantly flown at Tamb and Abu Musa. It might be as well, if this can be done without attracting undue attention, to ensure so far as possible that on other inhabited islands belonging to or claimed by Arab rulers Trucial or other appropriate Arab flag is also kept flying.

I agree with the view that it should be made clear to the Persian Government at the earliest suitable opportunity that notification will be required by the rulers of the Arab principalities before the visits of Persian warships to their ports. I appreciate, however, that, ns stated in paragraph 3 of your despatch No.463 of the 4th November it is desirable, if possible, to avoid making a communication on the subject in a form which the Persian Government might consider gratuitously offensive. I am prepared therefore to leave you discretion as to the precise manner in which the necessary intimation may be most suitably conveyed. 3. It is possible that the object which you have in view might be met by an explanation to the effect thtt, after so much inconclusive discussion on the question whether permission should be sought for the visits of warships or whether anly notification is required, it has seemed desirable to His Maj esty 1 s/ R.

Sir I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Printed Letter No:61-S dated the 20th January 1933 and to our conversation on the 10th February 1933 regarding unnotified visits of Persian Warships to Bahrain. 2# I enclose a copy of a memorandum entitled T, Procedure to be observed in the event of Persian Warships visiting Bahrain without previous notice'*,which 1 have drawn up for the guidance of the Bahrain Government,should the Political Agent be absent from Bahrain at the time. The memorandum will be kept in my Confidential Office and instructions have been given that,if the Political Agent is away,it should be handed at once to the Adviser in the event of an unnotified visit of a Persian Warship to Bahrain. In the meantime,in order that the Adviser may be aware of the procedure which it is proposed to follow in the event of a Persian Warship appearing,without previous notice, at Bahrain,the memorandum has,as arranged with you,been shown to Mr.Belgrave in confidence. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- G.Loch., Lieut Colonel Political Agent., Bahrain.Procedure to be observed in tne event of Persian Warships visiting Bahrain without previous notice. 1. In the event of a Persian Warship visiting Bahrain without notice,the following four eventualities have to be considered:- (a) No party will be landed. (b) A Party will be landed to.purchase provisions etcetera. (c) An attempt may be made to pay a ceremonial visit on His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah. (d) An armed Party may be landed.not perhaps with the idea of actual aggression,but to assert Persia’s claim to the Bahrain Islands. 2. If any of the above events should take place,the following course of action should be adopted,unless there are special considerations necessitating a modification:- (aj Y«hen no Party is landed,no action on the part of the State is necessary,except a formal protest by His Excellency the Shaikh to the Political Agent against the unnotified visit. (b) A Party may be allowed to land to purchase provisions etcetera ; but a formal protest should immediately be made by His Excellency the Shaikh to the Political Agent,against the unnotified visit of the Aarship. (c) Should the Officer Commanding a Persian Aarship express a desire to pay a ceremonial visit on His Excellency the Shaikh,it would seem best that His Excellency the Shaikh should (after consultation with the -t'olitical Agent) follow the normal inter national practice on the occasion of an unnotified visit of a foreign Warship to a Portj that is to say,that he should receive the call m spite of the omission of the Persian Government to give him previous notification. It will be well for His Excellency the Shaikh to take an opportunity during the call of mentioning that he wished to have previous notification of such visits. In the event,however,of there being attendant circumstances of an exceptional nature,such as acute tension in Anglo-Persian relations or discourtesies to Harbour Officials by Officers or men of the Ship, it would be necessary to consider in the light of the actual circumstances,whether or not the call should be accepted. In the event of the call being accepted and passing without incident,an immediate formal protest should be made by His Excellency the Shaikh to the Political Agent.Page 2. (d) In the event of an Armed Party being landed.tne Party should be met at the Pier by a State Official (preferably an European;the Financial Adviser,if possible; and informed on behalf of the Fiuler that His Excellency could not agree to a Party landing with arms,but there would De no objection to their landing without arms for the purpose of purchasing provisions etcetera* Should no attention be paid to tkxxx this warning of the State Official the Political Agent has been authorized to consider whether,and at what stage,he should advise the intervention of the Bahrain Police Force.
