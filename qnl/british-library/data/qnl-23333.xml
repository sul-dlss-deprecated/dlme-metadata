Memorandum With reference to the petition from four sons of Abdurrehman bin Abdul Wahsb bin Salman a 1 Khalifah. These uersons have never received salaries from the Civil List. They are very distant relatives of the Ruler, as the table below shows, and their father is one of the wealthiest mem bers of the Ruling Family. In my opinion there is no reason why they should be supported by the State. Their father is now in his dotage and cannot be expected to live much longer; when he dies they will inherit his estates. I personally see no reason why they should not • work, though in their letter they seem to refer to such a suggestion as being altogether impossible.No.' 7 *-6/7 of 1929.

You will recall that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad mentioned this at his conversation with you before your departure, and the letter had not then been received# Upon receipt, I forwarded it to fj%Belgrave as I knew little about the applicants.

I suggest that I may be instructed to reply that there seems no reason, why any male member of the Al Khalifah should receive allowances from the State if he does not v/ork for it. but that the question is one for Shaikh Hamad to settle and that they should apply to him if they feel they have a claim. You will notice from the petition that Shaikh I amad is stated to have said that he considered them just as his sons but that he was forced by Major Daly to cut their ^ allowances# ^ Lt 18 a' -3- fact that His Excellency places the onus of every unpleasant step, he is obliged to take, either on the Political Agent or the Adviser or both.

V a~ Irv t Bahrain 4th* March, 1941 Political Age] Bahrain. Sir Ife the undersigneesbeg to put the following lines before your honour for your kind consideration, requesting you to sacrifice a part of your honour’s valueable time to study this matter. Abdul 7/ahhab Al Khalifah, who was the general Director to the late Shaikh Eisa bin Ali Al Khalifah and who has served this country for more than thirty years. Moreover we are also memebers of this family and we were drawing our allowances from the late Shaikh not on account of the services of our fither, but like all other memebers of this family. It was to our astonishment to find ourselves deprived of this previlage after H.H.Sir Shaikh Hamad took over the rulership, though some of us continue to draw their allowances. Ve took up the case with H.H. Sir Shaikh Hamad who ordered us to see the Adviser to his Government. The later stated that he could do nothing in this respect and accordingly we have reported the matter again to the Shaikh who gave us an opened letter to his brother Shaikh Abdullah and his son Shaikh Salman to go into negotiation into the matter with the Adviser. Both Shaikhs done what they were . requested to do by His Highness, but the Adviser said that the matter is completely out of his hands and the only person to decide upon it is the Hon. Politi ^ “ssident. Resident. His reply was received under a covering letter from the Agency under the signature of Captain C.G.Prior, the Political Agent, then,stating that tb^ matter is under the immediate control of His Highness, letter NO’.SO of lo30 dated 13-th January refers. dislikes that we enjoy the same conditions that our brothers, cousins, or even most of the old servants are enjoying, as we have heard from the Shaikh* himself and all others that we will get aur allowances in due course, but the only one said that we are not getting it is the Adviser who no doubt has the full control of every thing in this country and he is the only person to be the direct object of blaming in this regpect. So we again sir, request your honour to interfere into this matter as we are certain that no one can be treated unjusticely while a man who reserves the Union Jack’s wright is existed in that part of the world. had it not been that the matter was referred to the Agency some years back. Ye would have not dare to approach your honour Sir, we are the sons of Shaikh Abdul Rahman bin Through the Agency we approached the Hon. Political l?e would not translate this to be that the Adviser We beg to remain your honour’s Obedient Servants.Bahrain llth. March # 1^41 TO The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to put the following lines, hoping that it will meet your honour’s attention and kind consideration. Sir, I have only been badly forced to take this step direct with your honour as I have not left any other possible means to solve this problem and have tried all the responsible athorities but met no success. Sir* like any other man would do to earn his living, when he has no income, I entred into buisness after the stop of my allowances which was explained to your honour, in the letter signed by me as well as my all brothers. Through this buisness I became indebted to some persons and had no other way to pay them to sell some of my property to save my name and no doubt when I am successful I san repalce what I had sold. Being bound by the Al Khalifah Committee I could not do this until I had been athorised to do so, I had the sanction after very terrible difficulty, but found the Adviser jumps up in my way and cancells it. This lead my debtors to file suit against the result of which my property was put into the auction and instead of having a reasonable price for it, it only was sold to a third of it*s value. I fail to understand that if I am a member of this family why I should not be paid the allowances on one hand and on the other why I should be bound by the rules they have for themselves, and moreover, I did obey this rule and obtained the necessary authority, but why the Adviser cancells it and then passes the sentance to have my property in auction. As a result of this I have lost not 6nly the money which would have been left over after settling my debts, but also lost my trust in bazaar. Among the property which was sold is my own house after which I was compelled to reside under Barest is in winter and ’Areeshes in summer, while to save this house I have other property which I ax have no obejction to sell and keep this house. « Sir, I apply to your honour requesting to have either of the two solutions, (i) to be treated like all other Al Khalifah members and my allowances be paid or (ii) I am to be allowed to sell all my property and leave this country to elsewhere. I again request your honour to bestow the justice and mercy upon me. I bane the honour to remain, Your obedient servant. \ Saqar bin Abdul-Rahamn Al Khalifah.No, . - 6/33 The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:— The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain.

B. M’s Political Agent Bahrain. Memorandum: - Reference your Printed Letter No.448-6/33 dated 12th March, 1941 and enclosure. The complaint appears to be against the action of the Khalifah Committee. This Committee was appointed by His Highness to examine all applications for sales of ancestral property by members of the family. The Committee examines every case which is sent to it by His Highness. The main object of the Committee is to prevent alienation of the family property by members of the Ruling Family. I am informing the Committee and His Highness of Sager’s complaint. v Adviser to the Government S.Z12 No. 7/3 - » of 1360 Office of the Adviser to the Government , Bahrain. Dated, R/Thani 11, 1360 May 7, 1941. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Bahrain. Memorandum:- Reference your Demi-official letter No. 797- 6/33 dated 30th April, 1941. The Khalifah Committee has dealt with several applications from the complainant and in some cases gave him permission to sell his property. In the case in question the committee considered that it was not to his interest to sell the property, which is ancestral. Many of the family receive no allowances but the committee is asking His Highness if he would be willing to give this member of the family some assistance. It is hardly an opportune moment for asking His Highness to increase the monthly payments which he makes from his private income to members of the family who are not drawing pay.
