Considerable interest was shown in the translation rights of British books : on an average, the Institute dealt with 200 written enquiries a month in addition to innumerable personal enquiries. Communication is maintained with 123 Spanish publishers, literary agents and individuals. During the last ten months, Spanish publishers in contact with the Institute published trans lations of 192 British books, 140 of them modern works of 24 different authors and 52 of them translations of 15 classic authors. Interest in British classics is such that several houses published the same work simul taneously. At the Book Fair held in Madrid during May and June, 282 out of 5,028 books shown were translations of British books. A number of publishers have joined the Institute to examine recent additions to the library before ordering reading copies from England. British scientific and technical books are especially brought to the attention of likely publishers. Spanish booksellers have been assisted in the importation of British books, the demand for which is greater than can be met, and pre-civil war contacts between Britain and Spanish booksellers were renewed. In the last ten months the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas has been assisted in the purchase of books to the value of £778. British books are sent for review to 23 Spanish periodicals and newspapers, including for the first time, Metalurgia y Electricidad, the Bole tin Universitario de la Universidad de Madrid, Fondo y Formo, Archivo Espanol de Morfologia and Arriba.

The publications of the British organisations have been supplied to them. Pupils in the school attached to the Institute number 149 ; 80 are on the waiting list. In spite of lack of space activities have developed. The Junior School (78 children) is divided into five forms, in four of which instruction is entirely in English. Spoken English has greatly improved. There are 50 children in the Kinder garten, where, though nearly all explanations must be in Spanish, great emphasis is laid on spoken English and in the top group (aged 6-f) children are beginning to talk, read and do simple dictations. The first ' At Home ' for parents was attended by the great majority of them. Barcelona Institute. —On May 10th an Exhibition of English Books was inaugurated by H.M.

The first broadcast script has been received from Uruguay, where English book reviews are trans mitted for half an hour each Sunday morning over the Government official network. In addition to the book reviews previously reported in Malta, books are now sent to the Maltese paper Lehen-is- Sewwa, and to the periodical Scientia. Broadcast book reviews in Palestine were well received among the English-speaking Arabs and Jews. Cuttings were received for the first time from the Arabic El Muntada and from Palestine Illustrated. Palestine Post is bringing out a 4-page weekly supplement to be devoted largely to English books. In Algiers and Morocco first cuttings have been received from L?Echo d'Alger, Revue d'Alger and l.'Afrique Litter aire, Vainer e and Hesperis.

Revista de la Universidad de Madrid was added to the long list of Spanish papers already reviewing English books. A consignment of books for review was sent for the first time to Barcelona to coincide with the book exhibition. A review of Financial Times by Ronald Eraser resulted in the sale of the Swedish translation rights, and the book has now been published in its Swedish edition. In Switzerland three periodicals _^*ublished acknowledgments of the Council's book .eview service. The periodical Lettres issued a special number dealing with English poetry since the war. Contact was opened with a new paper Vaterland. e. Films Each week British News is still bringing to all parts of the Colonial Empire up-to-date news of present events and the part played in them by all Empire and Allied countries. A show of the Council's films on Wales was given to Welsh M.Ps. in the House of Commons on the 10th May. Copies of these films with commentaries in Welsh are being sent to the Welsh community in Patagonia. A showing of the second medical film ' Accident Service ' was given to a selected medical audience in the Curzon Cinema on 26th May. Professor Sun Ming-Chin of the University of Nanking has asked for scientific Council films to add to the University's Educational Film Library. A selection has been ordered for him as well as some from outside sources in this country. Mr. Neville Kearney, Director of the Film Department, is now visiting Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Turkey. 17 NEW PRODUCTIONS Films completed include Student Nurse —How nurses are trained in Britain ; Power Lines —The manufacture and wide use of British cables ; New Mine —The model colliery at Comrie in Scotland ; Learning a Job— 1 echnical training in Britain ; Local Government— A film explaining the machinery of local government and how a councillor is elected. This film is specially designed for the Colonial Empire ; Neuropsychiatry— A medical film. DISTRIBUTION 647 prints were despatched overseas of which 245 prints were for public cinemas in 63 territories and 402 16 mm. prints were for non-theatrical showing in 37 territories (including 288 to Institutes and Anglophil Societies). The film ' Surgery in Chest Disease ' has met with great success abroad. From Cyprus, for instance, comes a report praising it not only for its technical mastery but because ' it displays for the first time to these doctors, trained in Athens for the most part, where the medical school has been largely under German influence, the modernity and resources of modern British surgery.' f. Fine Arts EXHIBITIONS Contemporary British Art (Latin America) Graphic Art (Latin America) Graphic Art (Portugal) Graphic Art (Turkey) Buenos Aires, Argentina Caracas, Venezuela National Library, Bogota, Colombia Oporto Istanbul Graphic Art (Palestine) Jerusalem The exhibition of British Crafts (U.S.A. and Canada) returned to the U.S.A. from Canada, and it was arranged that part of the Fine Art Exhibition (U.S.A.) should be sent to Canada.

TRANSMISSION OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE An increasing amount of scientific material is received for transmission, chiefly to and from Sweden. BOTANICAL SPECIMENS The Council assisted experiments in the cultivation of larch trees, in which England, Canada and Sweden are participating, by transmitting the seeds collected from different trees in Sweden through the International Union of Forest Research Organisation, to the Forestry Commission in England and the Dominion Forester in Ottawa. A variety of seeds were obtained from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, for stocking the Botanic Gardens and the Yildiz Park Gardens at Istanbul. At the request of Professor Birand in Turkey, arrange ments were made with the Curator of Kew for the identification of a number of dried specimens of Turkish flora. ANGLO-SOVIET SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION COMMITTEE Twelve letters and thirty-four parcels of scientific publications were forwarded through the Council to scientific institutions in the U.S.S.R. Four requests were sent to H.M. Embassy, one to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and one to the U.S.S.R. Society for Cultural Relations on behalf of British scientists or scientific institutions requiring technical material from the Soviet Union. At the request of the Central Scientific and Technical Library of Non-Ferrous Metals in Moscow, an exchange of publications between their Library and the Institute of Metals, London, is being arranged. A survey of the Soviet scientific publications now available in this country owing to the resumption of exchange relations between British institutions and the Soviet Academy of Sciences is being made.

ENGINEERING The report and recommendations submitted by Professor S. J. Davies following his recent visit to Turkey, Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon were accepted by the Engineering Panel. Overseas Appointments. —The Engineering Department has been actively engaged with the appointment of overseas advisers, professors and lecturers, in engineer ing and science for Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, China and Latin America. Candidates for some 33 appointments were requested ; 7 appointments were made and 8 further candidates recommended out of a total of some 180 applications considered. Overseas Students. —Advice was given in regard to 40 overseas students from 14 different countries, whose subjects of study covered some 19 branches of engineer ing. Engineering Articles. —Ten engineering articles and ten bound selected articles are distributed monthly to over 80 contacts. There is an increasing demand for articles and further copies of the bound articles have been requested from countries where there is no technical press. Technical colleges and libraries in Baghdad, Colombo, Jamaica, Cairo and Alexandria stressed their usefulness and the Director of European education in Rhodesia asked for copies for schools. British Standards Specifications. —Following the joint report and recommendations of Mr. le Maistre and Professor Davies, a detailed plan for translation of about 200 specifications into Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese and French is under consideration. The current scheme for translation of some 24 speci fications into Turkish is still in progress. The new edition of B.S. 308 : ' Engineering Drawing Office Practice ' was transmitted to Turkey for translation. Printer's proofs in Turkish of B.S. 845 : ' Steam Boilers ' were sent to Turkey for final approval. MEDICINE British Medical Bulletin. —A supply of paper was granted for a small United Kingdom circulation by subscription. The current (1944) volume is to contain approximately 300 pages, and will appear in not more than twelve parts. For the whole volume a subscriptionof one guinea is charged. Single parts may be purchased at prices based on a rate of 2s. for a 24-page issue. A discount of one-third of these prices is given to medical officers of the Armed Forces. The circulation of BMB in its various editions is ; British Medical Bulletin .. .. .. 2,440 „ „ „ (Swedish reprint) 1,300 Total (English).. 3,740 Boletin Medico Britdnico (Spanish) .. 1,357 Boletim Medico Britdnico (Portuguese) .. 960 Ingiliz Tip Biilteni (Turkish) .. .. 1,000 Total (all languages) .. 7,057 Increasing use of the English edition is made by foreign doctors who are learning English. 295 copies of foreign journals were received in exchange for BMB, and 327 were forwarded to British medical libraries. British medical publishers are regularly sending new books and new editions for review in BMB. Medical Films.—Accident Service was shown to a medical audience at the Curzon Cinema, and was introduced by the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, Sir Alfred Webb-Johnson. The film has been well reviewed in the medical Press. The Sub-Committee on Medical Films of the Medical Panel has recently been reconstituted. It now includes representatives of the British Medical Association, Medical Research Council and Ministry of Health and members with special experience of medical films. The new Sub-Committee met for final consideration of a film on Plastic Surgery which after long discussion has now reached the stage of an agreed script. The Ministry of Health agreed to provide facilities for making the film in Emergency Medical Service Plastic Surgery Centres, and the surgeons in charge of these centres expressed willingness to collaborate. Medicine in China. —As a result of discussions by the Medical Panel, a Medicine in China Sub-Committee was formed to consider the most effective means of furthering Sino-British relations in the medical field. The Sub-Committee includes members with recent experience of medical conditions in China. Medical Information.—Requtsis from overseas for information on medical subjects continue to be received. Subjects included the teaching of psychological medicine ; physical training in the Army ; mosquito control ; drugs ; instruments ; methods. n. Students A student arrived from Australia in April to take up one of the scholarships allocated by the Council to women graduates from the Dominions. She is making a survey of emergency feeding in war-time in Great Britain combined with the study of Dietetics. Two Chinese students arrived in April. One of these was a British Council scholar and she has been placed at St. Hilda's College, Oxford. The second was a Rhodes Trust scholar whose grant is being administered on behalf of the Rhodes Trust by the British Council. This student has been placed at Magdalen College, Oxford. Three Turkish graduate doctors arrived and were admitted to suitable courses for specialisation. Applications for scholarships were received from 27 countries and arrangements are being made for the placing of these candidates. Although the Chinese Government recently stated that no students or technicians may leave China for the time being, it is possible that Chinese students will be able to take up the scholarships offered by the Council for the session 1944-45. It is hoped that the six scholarships offered to Chinese professors will be taken up, and also the five scholarships set aside by the Council for students to be selected by the British Embassy in Chungking. Nineteen students already resident in this country have been awarded scholarships as follows : Two Polish postgraduates, eleven Polish undergraduates, four Czech undergraduates, one Canadian postgraduate and one Canadian apprentice. The two Canadians were released from the forces to take a special course of study in this country through a scheme set up in conjunction with the Canadian military authorities. One is working on research in Plant Entomology at the Biological Field Station, Imperial College of Science and Technology, Slough, Buckinghamshire, and the other is working as an apprentice at Metropolitan Vickers, Manchester. o.

THE BRITISH COmCIL BUDGET MEMORANDUM NO. 1 The notes which follow are intended for the guidance . of those responsible for spending the funds of the Council. They are somewhat lengthy and to some of the recipients a number of the points stressed may appear obvious; but all these points, even the most obvious, have been the subject of misunderstandings, in one quarter or another, during the past year. The notes should be read in conjunction with the printed Finance Circular No. 1, familiarity with which would have prevented most of these misunderstandings. A copy of this circular is attached. The Budget 1. It has been insufficiently realised that the budget constitutes a detailed financial programme, departure from which is not permissible without proper authority obtained by the procedure laid down; and that the sum set against each item of the budget is a limit which must not be exceeded with out financial approval, except in the circumstances dealt with in para. 17 of Finance Circular No. 1. Items, in this con text, does not merely mean the summarised items on Forms A^l and AC2, but the items in the Schedules PS1, PS2, GSS, GSH^ LFS and EXT. Virement 2. Attention is particularly drawn to paras. 13-1^ of Finance Circular No. 1, which deal with this matter. 3. The authority given in para. of that circular to Heads of Departments and Regional Representatives to exercise virement within stated limits does not extend to the creation of new recurrent items of expenditure by means of virement. 4. The item for Maintenance in Regional Budgets calls for comment. Although this item is subdivided into various services - rent, cleaning, etc., - these subdivisions are not budgetary items. They are the basis on which the total alloca tion for maintenance is calculated, but from the point of view of Finance Circular No. 1 only this total allocation^for Maintenance is the budgetary item. Virement between its sub divisions may, therefore, be practised by the Representative without reference to London, provided the total allocation for Maintenance is not overspent. Records 5. Every effort should be made to keep the records of the allocations up to date. Each item should be amended in respect of any approved supplementaries or savings that have been effected. From these records it should be possible at any time to give up-to-date revised figures of the allocations. Records should also be maintained of commitments as they are entered into; and these in conjunction with the actual cash expenditure, ascertained from the books of accounts, should enable the Head of Department or Regional Representative to keep his budgetary position constantly under review. Overspending 6. The rate of expenditure and commitment against_an_ allocation should be carefully watched, and if it gives indica tion that overspending is likely to occur the probable over spending should be estimated ana reported to the FinanceDivision as soon as possible with a request for a supple mentary allocation. Adequate time should be allowed for con sideration of such requests, which very often require sub mission to the Finance and Agenda Committee, which meets only once a month. The common practice of requesting immediate approval of supplementary allocations is, therefore, to be avoided whenever possible. Still more to be deprecated is the reporting of an overspending as inescapable, or even as an accomplished fact - vide the Chairman's letter No. GB/6/53 of 17th August, 1943. Commitments 7. Recurrent expenditure is shown in the budget at''the full annual rate, and it is most important that, in addition to keeping the actual expenditure in the financial year within the allocation, administrative officers should not commit the Council to expenditure in the following financial year above this figure without reference to the Finance Division. There may be, for example, an allocation of £2,000 for the maintenance of a new Institute. If the Institute is not opened until half way through the financial year it is not permissible to spend the full £2,000 in the remaining six months (which might com mit the Council to £4,000 in the next financial year) but only to spend at a rate of £2,000 p.a., i.e., £1,000. Similarly, if there were a budget item of £400 for two clerks, against which only one clerk had been appointed at £200 p.a., at 1st April, it would not be permissible, half-way through the financial year, to make two more appointments at £200 p.a. each, because, although there would be sufficient money to pay them £100 each for the remaining six months, the Council would thereby be committed to pay £600 to three clerks in the succeeding financial year. In point of fact, the overall deduction for shortspending in the 1944/45 Budget (see Finance Circular No. 1, para. 16) is so large that it will be necessary to take as a saving, at the end of each quarter of the year, one-fourth of the emoluments of any post unfilled, and one- fourth of the provision for recurrent expenditure on any pro ject not begun, at that date. Receipts 8. All receipts from whatever source must be paid into the Council's local imprest account. The fact that receipts are in excess of the budget estimate does not justify expendi ture or commitments which have not been properly authorised; nor does a shortage of receipts entail any reduction of approved expenditure. The Finance Division should be notified of any probability of excess or deficit as soon as it becomes obvious, if possible with an estimate of its probable amount. Lump Sum Allocations 9. When a budget contains a lump sum allocation to cover a number of projects which are not specified in detail (e .g., 'Improvement of Teaching of English, £3&gt;000) prior authority must be obtained from London before expenditure is incurred against this item on any specific project, (See Finance Circular No. 1, para. 7*) 10. Some confusion has apparently arisen over the authority delegated by the circular letter GB/6/69 of 2nd July, 1943. If a Regional Budget contains on Schedule PS2 an item of, say, '6 clerical staff, £1,800' it is within the authority of the Representative to make an appointment againstI this allocation at a salary up to the maximum approved for his area, but not to create more than six new posts. Prior approval from London must be obtained for any appointment in excess of six or for payment of a salary in excess of the maximum. Moreover, the total of the full annual salaries of the staff chargeable to this item must not exceed £1,800 unless approval from London for supplementary allocation has been obtained (see para. 7 above). Contingencies 11. The budgets of a number of countries contain on Schedule EXT an item 'Contingencies'. Expenditure against this item may not be incurred on Personnel or General Services or on project^ entailing future commitments of any kind. Nor may such funds be used to supplement allocations which for any reason have proved inadequate. They may be used without reference to London only for unforeseen non-recurrent items of expenditure, within the limits mentioned below. 12. The maximum amount which may be spent, without reference to London, against the allocation for Contingencies on any one item is:- £50 when the contingencies allocation is £1,000 £2^ n n M n it £2^0 £2_o ,! ' ' ,, ,, £100 it 11 m n 11 £50 London Services 13. As noted on the form itself. Form ACL is for informa tion only and is not part of the Regional Budget. The items included on it are not budgetary items but records of the Services supplied by certain Departments in London. Wo expendi ture can be charged to them by Representatives abroad^ and they are not available for purposes of virement, being entirely under the control of the Directors of the London Departments concerned. Charges on London 14. Expenditure incurred abroad under the heads mentioned below may be charged to the appropriate budgets in London by means of debit no'tes;- Central Administration (General Services) Travelling expenses and subsistence allowances of officials from London visiting the area; of 'London- appointed' staff coming into or passing through the area on first appointment or transfer; and of 'London-appointed® staff from other areas travelling through the area on Council business or home leave. Any installation or transfer allowances payable and due to 'London-appointed' staff on first appointment or transfer. Passages home for 'London-appointed' staff in the area awarded home leave; and for officials entitled to repatriation. (Pension contributions paid by staff abroad should be credited to London.) Lectures Travelling expenses, subsistence allowances or out- of-pocket expenses in respect of visiting lecturers from London in accordance with whatever agreement regarding such expenses may have been concluded between the lecturer and the Council. P.T.0.Students Travelling expenses of, and advances made to, students en route for Great Britain. Fine Arts Local costs of all Fine Art exhibitions including installation, catalogues, publicity,packing and transport. Visual Publicity Local costs of photographic exhibitions including installation and transport except in those cases where allocations for this specific purpose have been included in the local budget. Britain To-day Local printing and publishing costs, but not distribu tion costs. Receipts, if any, should be credited to London. Hospitality Travelling expenses and subsistence allowances, if any, of official Council guests to Great Britain. Music Local expenses of concert tours by artists from London. Export (Publications ) Local costs of book exhibitions including installa tion, catalogues, publicity, packing and transport. Personnel 15. The budget estimates for salaries and allowances of 'London-appointed' staff are calculated on the average salaries of the grades into which posts fall, (in the case of the Home Service these grades are at present notional, pending approval by the Foreign Office and the Treasury.) The actual expendi ture on a given personnel item will, therefore, rarely tally with the allocation; but over-expenditure in some regions or departments will be offset by under-expenditure in others. 16. If a 'London-appointed' postj for which there is provision in a Regional Budget, is unfilled, it is permissible, with prior approval from London, to Pay a locally appointed officer against the vacancy, but it will be understood that this arrangement blocks the vacancy and that no London appointment can be made until it is terminated. Dec1aration of Estimated Sa vings and Over-expenditure 17. In the first week of January certain figures must be cabled to London. Firstly, the cash expenditure up to 31st December in each of the four main categories, i.e.. Personnel, General Services, Local Functional Services and Bxtraordinaries, together with the total receipts up to 31st December. Secondly, the estimated total expenditure to 31st March (i.e., for the whole financial year) in each of the four main categories, together with the estimated total receipts for the whole year.Thirdly, the estimated amount of the savings or overspendings (where this amount exceeds £50) on each budgetary item in respect of which savings or overspendings are anticipated. A saving or overspending, here, means the difference 'between the allocation for an item as it stood on 31st December (taking into account any alterations in it approved up to that date) and the estimated expenditure against that item for the whole financial ye ^r. The estimated expenditure will include the delayed payments mentioned in para. 18 below, the amount of which is of course not predictable on 1st January. Payments made after the end of the financial year to which they relate 18. The financial year comes to an end on ^Ist March; this means that the funds provided for that year cease to be available from that date. It is inevitable, however, that certain expenditure to which the Council was committed near the end of the old financial year will fall for actual payment in the new year. The present practice is to make no provision in the budget of the new year for these delayed payments and not to treat them as a charge against that budget, the 'lag 11 of expenditure at the beginning of the year being offset by a similar 'lag' at the end of it. 19. It is essential, therefore, that the records of such delayed expenditure should be kept separately from the records of expenditure against the current year's grants, and in each year's Record hook there should be a separate section for this purpose. The 1944/45 Record Book, for example, should contain a section headed '1943/44 grants' and in this section should be recorded all payments for goods or services for which written orders were placed in the previous year, each entry specifying the appropriate item number of that year. (Where the Accounts Department are keeping records for departments they will arrange for this to be done.) 20. It must be emphasised that the arrangement describe] above applies only to settlement of accounts for orders definitely placed before 31st March. It is not permissible, after that date, to continue to place orders against an alloca tion figuring in the budget of the expired year. If the project for which that allocation was made is not completed and no provision has been made for its completion in the budget of the new year, application must be made to the Finance Division for a new allocation. 21. For recording purposes, all invoices passed for payment on or after 1st April, 1944, which are in respect of commitments entered into in the previous year, should be marked as 1943/44 expenditure, with that year's budget item number stated; and for purposes of subsequent audit they must be supported by documentary evidence of the date at which the commitment was incurred. When the delayed expenditure on 1943/44 commitments is completed, the Finance Division will examine it in .conjunction with the total actually expended in 1943/44 against the grants affected, to verify that the total expenditure against each grant does not exceed the amount provided. Any such excess would constitute an overspending requiring explanation. FINANCE OFFICEK-THE BRITISH COUNCIL Finance Circular No. 1 FINANCIAL CONTROL 1. Financial control is of two kinds. The first is a pre-commitment control and the second a post- expenditure control. The latter depends on accoun tancy and on audit. It may bring tonight irregularities and establish responsibility for them ; and, by reveal ing defects in the machinery of expenditure, may lead to its improvement. The former is directed to the prevention of improper or extravagant expenditure and depends on a system under which the prior sanction of a designated authority is required for certain kinds of expenditure or for administrative action entailing new financial commitments. It is with this pre-commitment control that the present memo randum is concerned. General Function of the Finance Officer and Finance Division 2. The Secretary-General is ultimately responsible (under the Chairman and the Executive Committee) for economy both in framing policy and in manage ment ; and the inclusion on the Council's staff of a Finance Officer does not relieve him of this responsi bility. Nor does the existence of a separate Finance Division in any way relieve other administrative officers of their duty to be economical. Economy in the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid is to be obtained by co-operation between the Finance Division and the various other Divisions and Departments of the Administration. 3. The Finance Officer should participate at an early stage in discussions leading to the initiation and settlement of administrative policy. He will naturally be principally concerned with the financial aspects of that policy. Criticism from the Finance Officer should not, however, be limited by any narrow interpretation of the province of finance, but should be allowed fullest scope where any possibility of substantial economy is involved. 4. In the same way, all proposals requiring financial approval, in the terms of this memorandum, must be referred to the Finance Division at an early stage and before a decision is prejudiced or expenditure incurred. The Finance Officer will, as necessary, submit the proposals to the Secretary-General, for his or the Chairman's consideration. 5. If the Finance Officer advises that the concur rence of the Treasury is necessary in any particular proposal involving expenditure, that proposal should be referred to the Foreign Office (or other appropriate office in the case of Empire countries), who are responsible to the Treasury for the propriety of the Council's expenditures from its Grant-in-Aid. Any necessary correspondence with the Foreign Office or the Treasury on proposals involving expenditure must be either drafted, or concurred in, by the Finance Division. The Machinery of Control 6. Before specifying the matters which require sub mission to Headquarters for approval, it will be well to amplify the statement made above (para. 4) as to the machinery of such submission. The approving authorities at Headquarters are the Executive Com mittee and the Finance and Agenda Committee of the Council, or the Chairman representing them, and the Secretary-General, who may delegate part of his authority for certain purposes to the Finance Officer. Reference to the Foreign Office, and in some cases to the Treasury, may also be necessary. The question which of these authorities should be invoked to give approval in a particular case depends partly on the nature of the case and partly on the amount of the expenditure involved. These distinctions do not, however, concern Administrative Officers seeking a financial approval, where this is required, since the channel through which financial approvals must be sought is, in all cases, the Finance Division, whose responsibility it is to see that the proper authority is invoked. Exceptions to this rule should be rare and limited to cases of such urgency that reference to the Finance Division is impossible without frustration of the proposal to be referred. This will seldom occur, except possibly when the Chairman or Secretary- General is on tour. Even in that case, reference to London will not lightly be dispensed with, since these authorities cannot carry with them on tour all the information necessary for a considered decision of a financial question of any importance—such as pre cedents, relevant Treasury rulings, and up-to-date information as to the availability of funds. Whenever a proposal normally requiring reference to the Finance Division is approved without such reference, the fact should be communicated, with the relevant circumstances, to the Finance Division at the earliest possible moment. Proposals requiring Financial Approval 7. In general, when money has been allocated in detail for a specific project or service, the spending of the allocated money is under the control of the Administrative Officer to whose region or department it has been allocated, subject to the conditions set out in this memorandum. (By an allocation in detail is meant one which specifies the staff, services, and non-recurrent expenditure involved in the project and the amount provided under each of these heads. Where the budget contains provision for a project which has not been worked out in detail, e.g. ' New Institute at X—Recurrent expenditure £1,500, Non- Recurrent expenditure £2,000,' the project will be treated as a new one and detailed proposals must be submitted to Headquarters for approval before com mitments against the sums provided are undertaken.) 8. Financial appioval is required for all new proposals involving expenditure ; and is also required for proposals involving any of the following matters:— 1. Questions of financial principle. 2. Exceptions to any of the Council's circulated rules or regulations. 3. Creation of posts. 4. Engagement of staff, except where discretion to engage temporary junior staff has been expressly given to an administrative officer. 5. Virement of funds, outside the limits laid down. These matters are explained in more detail below. The first four categories require little explanation.Questions of Financial Principle 9. A question of financial principle is raised, for example, where there is doubt as to the propriety of a proposal for expendituie, having regard to the terms of the Council's Charter ; or where the expen diture is of a novel type, not covered by any regulation of the Council. Exceptions to any of the Council's Circulated Rules or Regulations 10. An illustration of exceptions to a rule would be a proposal to pay an officer of the Council subsistence allowance at a higher rate than that laid down for his grade. Creation of Posts 11. Proposals for the creation of posts should be confined to the maximum extent possible to the moment when the annual estimates are submitted. After the budget is approved, any new appointment, other than to a post approved in the budget, involves the creation of a new post and must be referred to headquarters for approval. Engagement of Staff, except where Discretion to Engage Temporary Junior Staff has been expressly given to an Administrative Officer 12. The appointment of new staff to posts figuring in the budget requires reference to headquarters in order that the salary which it is proposed to pay to the candidate selected may be considered in relation to his qualifications and to the salaries paid to candidates for comparable posts. Where the budget of a given region contains a lump sum to pay the salaries of locally-appointed junior staff, the Repre sentative in that country has discretion to engage staff and pay thsm against the budgetary provision, without reference to headquarters, subject to any conditions as to maximum salary which may be laid down Virement 13 Virement is the transfer of funds provided in one sub-division of the budget, in which under- expenditure is anticipated, to another sub-division of the budget in which over-expenditure is anticipated. 14. Apart from any particular rules governing the matter, virement is restricted by the general rule that funds provided to finance non-recurrent expenditure may not be used to finance recurrent expenditure, without the specific authority of the Treasury. The reason of this restriction is obvious ; if money provided for some capital work is diverted, for example, to the engagement of new staff, a commit ment is thereby undertaken which prejudices the budget of the following year. 15. To make the distinction between different types of expenditure clear, the budgets of all departments and countries now show expenditure under four headings :— 1. Personnel (salaries and allowances). 2. General Services (maintenance, rent, lighting, etc.). 3. Functional Services (production and distribution of material). 4. Non-recurrent (purchase of land, buildings, equipment, etc.). Of these categories, the first two are definitely recur rent and the fourth is non recurrent. The third ranks as recurrent but for the purpose of virement is associated with the fourth. Thus, while virement is in general only operated between items in the same category, it may take place, with approval from headquarters, between the third and fourth categories. In no circumstances may there be virement from either of the last two categories to either of the first two categories, without Treasury approval. 16. There is a further general consideration which limits the use of virement in practice. The Council's budget is framed to cover the full annual cost of all recurrent items of expenditure and the full cost of all capital works, after making an overall allowance for probable underspending based on past experience of delays in initiation of new services and in the progress of capital works. (In the financial year 1943/44, this ^ overall allowance amounts to over £134,000.) This means that savings to the amount of the overall allowance have already been anticipated when the budget is framed ; so that until savings to this amount have been realised there is no scope for virement. Until that point is reached, any new items of expenditure or any overspending of approved items must be met from the general unallocated reserve, with the approval of headquarters in London, or against any budgetary item for contingencies at the disposal of the Heads of Departments or Regional Representatives. The question of overspending the budgetary provision for a given item should not normally arise during the first three-quarters of the financial year. If, owing to highly exceptional circumstances, it does arise during this period, it must be referred to headquarters for consideration. Apart from such exceptional cases, the state of grants will be reviewed at the end of the third quarter of the financial year, by which date Heads of Departments and Representatives abroad will have submitted reports on the sfate of their allocations to the Finance Division, on the basis of which the Finance Division will take such savings as may be necessary to complete the amount of ths overall allowance for short- spending, and will consider what measures of virement are necessary to meet the overspendings which are ^ reported as likely to occur, if they are approved. ^ 17. During the remainder of the year, Heads of Departments and Regional Representatives will be authorised to exercise virement between numbered items in the same general category of expenditure, provided that the expenditure on a given item is not further increased by more than 10 per cent, and that any increase within that limit can be met by savings, other than those already taken up, on other items in the same general category, in their budgets.

In the case of the Adviser designate (PS1/B1), it may be anticipated that free furnished quarters will be provided by the Government of Bahrain when he takes over from the outgoing Adviser, if not at an earlier date. Columns B and C have been left blank in Form EC1, as, for reasons stated in Schedule PS1, a supplementary allocation may be required in respect of PSl/Bl in the 1944/46 financial year. Item C2 - Marriage Allowance This is calculated at one-eighth of the basic salaries shown in PSl/Bl and CI. Columns B and C have been left blank as a supplementary allocation may be required in 1944/45 in respect of PSl/Bl. General Services Item D1 - It^ve Provision has been made for the allowance to be paid to a married official and his wife at £60 each. The outgoing Adviser Mr. Wakelin, will not qualify for the allowance from the British Council in 1946/46. SCHEDULE PSI. Sim It will be noted that financial provision has been made in these estimates for the presence in Bahrain of two Educational Advisers in 1946/46. Arrangements are in hand for the replacement of the present Adviser, Mr. Wakelin, by another Council official next year. It would, however, be desirable for Mr. Wakelin 1 s successor to proceed to Bahrain several months before Mr. Wakelin f s departure, in order to ensure a satisfactory take-over. Item Al - §ubsicUs&lt;?d §t^ff This post is at present occupied by Mr. Wakelin, and will presumably continue to be occupied by him for salary purposes until his contract with the Government of Bahrain terminates in September, 1945. His present gross salary, towards which the Government of Bahrain contributes £300 per annum, is £1068.16s.6d. per annum. On the assumption that he will receive a normal increment of £20 basic salary as from 1st September, 1944, his gross emoluments from that date •..•(£4) V 2. date will be £1106 # 6s.0d. per annmi, increasing the Council's contribution to £806.6s,0d. per annum. It will be seen, there fore that a supplementary allocation of £22 under PSl/Al of the Persian Gulf allocations for 1944/46 is required to cover the increase for the remainder of the current financial year. When Mr. Wakelin's contract with the Government of Bahrain expires in September. 1945, it is assumed that the unexpended portion of the allocation under Item Al of these estimates will be used to pay the subsidy towards his successors salary until the end of the 1945/46 financial year. Any adjust ment to the rate of the subsidy necessitated by the appointment of a successor whose gross Council emoluments differ from those of Mr. Wakelin can only be made after the event. Consideration has already been given in London to the possibility of requesting the Government of Bahrain to increase their present contribution of £300 towards the salary of the Educational Adviser, but a decision on this point has not yet been reached. Iteu B1 - Technical Staff This allocation has been proposed in order to cover the basic salary of Mr. Wakeli^s successor for the period of overlap during which there would be no contribution from the Government of Bahrain and the British Council would therefore be expected to • accept full financial responsibility for the Adviser designate. An allocation would not be needed after the date that the Adviser designate officially took over from the outgoing Adviser. If, as would be desirable, a successor is appointed before the conclusion of the current financial year, a supplementary allocation would be required in the 1944/46 financial year. The usual allowances for this post have been provided for in Form EC1. C; - Admlnlstratlvo Staff. ^ It is hoped that, as from September, 1945, it will be possible to appoint a Supervisor for Persian Gulf students studying in Cairo at schools or universities. This appointment will pre sumably be dependent on the provision of a hostel by the Bahrain and/or Kuwait Governments, with suitable accommodation for a resident English Supervisor or Warden. The number of students involved would be approximately 80. Provision has been made in the estimates for the appoint- • ment of such official entirely at the Council's expense. It is possible, however, that the post would be partially subsidised by the Government concerned, in which case the allocations would require adjustment. The usual allowances for this post have been provided for in Form EC1. FORM EC2 - Non Recurrent Estimates See notes on Schedule EXT. / An allocation for the purchase of a cinema projector in 1946/46 is proposed on the assumption that the allocation granted for this purpose in 1944/45 remains unspent owing to non availability of a projector. If the purchase is not made in 1944/46 ...3. 1944/45 there will be a saving of £240 under EXT/A1 of the 1944/46 allocations.

SCHEDULE PS2 Item A1 In the 1944/46 allocations there was a grant of £1600 for the purpose of subsidlesing, If necessary, the salaries of Egyptian teachers seconded by the Egyptian Government to Kuwait. The Government of Kuwait has not requested any financial support in this connection, and the salaries of the teachers are shared equally by the Egyptian Government and the GovernraBnt of Kuwait. It is not now anticipated that the latter will apply to the Council for financial assistance in this respect. The Political Resident recently expressed the view that the appointment of a whole-time British Educational Adviser to Kuwait would be premature at this stage, and he has suggested instead the appointment of an Egyptian Educational Adviser. Steps are therefore being taken in Cairo at present for the selection of a suitable man on a two-year contract. The Egyptian Government would be expected to contribute 60 per cent, of his salary and it has been suggested by the Political Resident that the balance should be provided by the British Council, If final approval for the appointment is given the expenditure from the grant under PS2/A1 during the current financial year would be not more than £260, and the recurrent commitment would be £400• A saving of £1250 can therefore be declared on PS2/A1 of the 1944/46 allocation, and the entry in Column B of Form ECI has been adjusted accordingly., • T : D.O.

Dear Jjinowles, * t t*ched is a cepy of my annual report ©n Boy's Education in Bahrain Government School^,(Non-Technical), for the 1 36^. v Roughly 1944-/. I have also sent copies to the Cairo Ofrice. Yo ^ will see from this report that the foundation of the Bahrain Schools has now been firmly laid and that the time nil hl4lS come. There is every indication that the time is now ra.pe to take up once Igain the question of a Gulf College ia m u:L , r1 ' ^hat is required is a complete Secondary School with T in lril ?£ giving a two years course. As soon as ^on&lt;- t Ions allow the Government will be building a Secondary Boarding School. There should be an Emglish Head Master who is also Assistant Director with an Arab assistant. Apart from the two boys from Qatar, (a neighbouring State), and three from Hassa in baudia Arabia mentioned in ray report there are at least a dozen 0 .hers in the Primary Schools who have recently come over from baudia Arabia to join our schools. The need for education is rrcogmsed in that country but parents hesitate to send their boys to Egypt, the nearest centre, as they fear for their morals. A first otass school aere In Bahrain would serve not only the whole of the Gulf but most of Arabia too. Already our schools have a name in these parts. Before leaving Bahrain I shall therefore strongly reCortfiieMd that such a scheme be put into practice at the earliest opportunity. t .n.c T ^ k y ou for y our letters P.G./43/1 of 5th &amp; 23rd January 1945.

I also thank your for your letter of 9th January and your offer to try to obtain a Subsistence Allowance for me. I reached Cairo on 1 .)th July 1944 and first went to the Council Offices on Saturday 17th July. From them until 27th September 1944 I was engaged on Council affairs almost daily with the exception e/the period 3rd August to 21st August when I was either in hospital or c^nvalesning at home. I was paid a subsistence allowance by the Bahrain &amp; Kuwait Governments for the period 12th to 27th September. 1 shall be most grateful for any assistance in this way. v v Thaak you for your letter of 17th January 1944. You will be glad to know that yesterday I received a form from the Political Agent entitling me the NAAFI priviledges. It has yet to be couiitersigned by the Defence Officer.

Hutchings period of service finishes at the end of June. Since Steele left Hutchings has been doing oil gauging as well as looking after the Technical School. On your suggestion I spoke to Anderson about the Technical School and also asked his views about the royalty gauging. He told me that he could not help in i the matter of the Technical School and as regards oil j gauging he put up various suggestions to his principals in America. He suggested employing a member of an American or British firm of oil gauging experts, such as Redwoods or transferring someone from Bapco to tte Bahrain Government for this duty. If a Redwood man was employed the Bahrain Government would have to bear a large proportion of his cost and I understand that these experts are very highly paid and it is likely that this firm will not be able to supply the staff. After discussing the matter with Anderson Hutchings informed me that he would be willing to remain here for a further two years doing his present duty provided that he could take home leave this slimmer. Before taking up the matter officially I enquired from Anderson whether' it would suit the Company if Hutchings continued his work as gauger for another two years. In my opinion it .vould be more satisfactory if Hutchings were retained for a further two years to under take the work of gauging and at the same time to super vise the work of the Technical School. Hutchings has acquired a sound knowledge of the gauging work and is a conscientious official and suitable to undertake this duty. Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E.. H. B.

I suggest that the question o£ the re-engagement of Hutchings for a further two years principally for oil gauging for the Bahrain Government i^ scarcely what can be consi dered as a routine master and should have been raised with the Bahrain Petroleua Company in the first instance through this Agency. 3. I have pyself discussed the question of oil gauging with Anderson and received the impression ttut as it is practically impossible for the Bahrain Government to obtain a qualified man at the present time the Bahrain Petroleum Company are prepared to accept Hucchings for-the time being, though I understand thac from their point of view it would be more satisfactory to have a properly qualified gauger and inspector. It would seem to ue to be of the utmost importance that the individual who is employed to watch the interests of the Bahrain Government in the gauging of the oil from which they receive, in normal times, approxi mately two-thirds of their revenue should be particularly well qualified. V;hat»ver the cost of employing such an expert it would be money well spent. I am referring this question to Sir Geoffrey Prior and will communicate with you again but before I do so L shall ^ j&gt;1 1*-. f . $3 be glad to know what the proposed terms for Ruochings 1 new contract are and whether it is intended th^t he should be granted any extra emoluments for the work of gauging and inspecting.

My dear 'Belgrave, \ ^ / A Bahrain rechnlcal school Please refer to your demi-official letter N0.447-2E dated the 18th February 1945. 2. I have myself recently discussed the question of the Technical School vdth Anderson. As far as I can ascertain Anderson is very much in favour of taking students straight into the work-shops and giving them individual cui'tion while actually employed on Company's work. I said that if the Bahrain Petroleum Company were not interested in the work of the Tech nical school either as it is now or as it might be in the future then'the Bahrain Government would have to decide whether it was desirable for the Technical school to be continued knowing that the students on finishing their course are unlikely to obtain employment in the Oil Company. I stated that the Bahrain Government were not in need of financial assistance to continue the Technical School and that it was entirely a 4uestion whether the expenditure would be justified by the results. At the suggestion of Hanna, who was present during our conversation, it was decided that no decision would be taken until after the arrival of Hamilton and the Directors of the California Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation. You will recollect that these gentlemen are expected here about the beginning of this month. 3. I am leaving a note for Peily suggesting that he should re-open the question as soon as Hamilton and his companions have left, with a view do discovering whether the Bahrain Petroleum Company wish to shoulder the responsibility for tech nical education in Bahrain or not. In my ovn opinion the Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.jl., /Technical Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.2. Technical School should be continued whether or not the Bahrain Petroleum Goiapan/ themselves intend to sot up a- ceaching establishment to which the general public or some portion of them could be admitted. The school should however be expanded and be under the direction of a well qualified Technical Director with a staff capable of giving first class instruction in mechanical engineering, welding, carpentry, and automobile engineering.

The growing interest in British books and periodicals was shown by the number of applications for trans lation rights in British books and the increase in the number of book reviews published. Text-books, litera ture on contemporary social problems and plans for post-war reconstruction were in demand, and official publications dealing with these subjects were distributed to Portuguese Government departments and various institutions. Exchanges effected between Portuguese and British learned periodicals and proceedings of scientific societies increased markedly. Relations with the Portuguese Publishers' and Book-sellers' Guild continued to be cordial ; its trade journal gave generous publicity to the Council's book service and reveals that in 1943 more books were translated from English intv^Portuguese than from any other language. .J guests attended a reception and film show for those who had maintained continuous membership since the inauguration of the Institute, The second congress of Council officers serving in Portugal was held ; educational problems relating to English teaching in Portugal were considered.

Many extra-curricular activities were arranged at all courses, including concerts and lectures on British music, theatricals, film shows, etc. The Sigtuna courses received a visit of inspection from Herr Christian Gunther, the Swedish Foreign Minister, who was accompanied by H.M. Minister. The increased number of school pupils attending Council summer courses was due in part to the extensive school visits by members of the Council's staff. The growing number of school districts (now 80) which have introduced English into the elementary school curri culum has meant that more teachers wish to pass the examination qualifying them to teach this subject. At the request of two of the elementary school teachers* associations the Council therefore arranged summer courses for these teachers at Sigtuna and Lundsberg, generally regarded as a valuable initiative on the part of the Council. (iii) Folkhogskolor {People's High Schools). —Mr. Charlesworth attended the various courses of the Swedish W.E.A. and of the Swedish T.U.C. at Brunnsvik People's High School, and did a considerable amount ofEnglish teaching.

Fortunately, he has now recovered from the effects of his injuries. The Director of Studies of the Faculty des Lettres organised and supervised, in conjunction with Prof. Boase of Glasgow University, a French summer school at St. Andrews for Scottish University students, most of the lecturers and instructors being teaching staff of the L&gt;^- Frangais and the Institut. L SCOTTISH-POLISH HOUSE The House continues to be used increasingly for English lessons for Poles, Polish lessons for Scots, pro fessional meetings, discussions, lectures, concerts, film- shows, receptions. j. SCOTTISH-CZECHOSLOVAK HOUSE In this Centre accommodation has been overtaxed by the numbers of Czechoslovak servicemen on leave. Out standing among the events were two International Boards of Enquiry, the first on Poetry and the second on general topics, when the Netherlands, France, Czechoslovakia and Poland were represented. A:. SCOTTISH-FRENCH HOUSE This Centre has been active as a hostel for French servicemen. The liberation of Paris was celebrated by a large party of French residents, and visitors, and their Scottish friends. Lectures in English and French and concerts of Scottish, English and French music have been given. /. SCOTTISH-AMERICAN CENTRE The membership of this Centre has grown to about 400, and the library is in constant use. A fortnightly series of ' Ail-American Brains Trusts ' have been held, and on alternate weeks shows of U.S. Office of War Information and British Council films have been pre sented. The exhibition ' Young America,' sponsored by Toe H and prepared by the U.S. Office of War Information, was opened by the Countess of Rosebery. Allied and International Centres a. THE ALLIED CENTRE, LIVERPOOL The new extension, including a spacious and comfort able common room, class room and committee room was informally opened on Dominion Day of Canada, and over 800 people visited the Centre on that day. Lectures given at the Centre include ' Polish Archi tecture of the 18th Century ', ' Replanning Liverpool's China Towngiven by a British Council student, 'Modern Czechoslovak Dramatists', 'British-Polish Military Co-operation ', ' Dutch Ports ' Chinese Drama '. A very extensive programme of educational visits for U.S. psrsonnel, the R.A.A.F., and the R.N.Z.A.F., as well as tours into the country for Allied, Indian and Colonial seamen have been arranged, averaging more than one per day throughout the quarter. Groups of convalescent servicemen have also been entertained. The annual meeting of the Merseyside Council for Hospitality was presided over by the Lord Mayor at the Liverpool Town Hall. M. Jan Masaryk spoke and Lord Leverhulme gave an account of the year's work at the Allied Centre. b. SOCIETY FOR VISITING SCIENTISTS The premises of the Society at 5, Old Burlington Street are now being regularly used by foreign and British members. Membership is in the neighbourhood of 200. At the ninth meeting of the Working Committee a formal constitution was adopted, and the then Working Committee became the, official Executive Committee of the Society. A reception to welcome members of the French Scientific Mission recently arrived in England was held on 16th September. Professor Donnan (the President) and Sir Henry Dale spoke at the reception. C. ALLIED LAWYERS' FOYER Activities during the month of August were attenuated owing to the flying-bombs and the legal vacation. The Foyer has recently organised several conducted tours to the Law Courts. Each such tour comprised a party of about ten members and occupied the whole of one working day. Visits were made in turn to a Magis trate's Court, the High Court, and the Central Criminal Court. d. UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS CLUB, BIRMINGHAM It has been a quiet quarter, mainly owing to the can cellation of leave and the curtailment of transport. The opportunity has been taken to improve the facilities available, chiefly in the provision of added space for meals. Film shows have continued, and the Club has housed a number of exhibitions, including exhibitions by local artists. e. BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL CENTRE The lecture programme has included a talk on painting by Mr. Fleetwood Walker and the series ' Birmingham through the Ages ' continued. Exhibitions of painting were organised by the Centre members and the finalsof a radio short story competition were held and judged at the B.B.C. studios. The usual summer garden party was held by kind permission of Dame Elizabeth Cadbury. /.THE INTERNATIONAL CLUB, MANCHESTER Weekly classes in English language have continued, and the programme has included lectures, a garden party attended by French sailors. Allied wounded and Indian technicians. g. THE ALLIED CENTRE, CARDIFF On 12th August the new British Council House at 52-53, St. Mary Street, Cardiff, was opened by the chairman, and a special Norwegian Room in the House, presented through the generosity of a local Norwegian, was opened by M. Nils Hjelmtveit, Norwegian Minister of Education. The new House will provide not only rooms for a library, English lessons, concerts, film shows, lectures and discussions, but also the Headquarters of the Council's work in South Wales. The large mural decoration in the Norwegian room by Mr. Ceri Richards is noteworthy. h. ALLIED FORCES CENTRE, WILTON A programme of activities has been arranged for five nights a week. Recent activities have included eighteen programmes of classical recordings by the Music Group, weekly shows of films provided by the Council and the American Army, three exhibitions of paintings by members of the American and British forces, and a number of lectures and debates. Many American soldiers and W.A.C.S. and members of the Dominion Forces regularly visit the Centre to use the library and reading room. /. OXFORD The Council is privileged to have premises at All Souls College, which are visited by many members of the Allied Forces and Colonial Office students and British Council students studying at Oxford. Members of the Belgian and Polish Forces have been entertained in parties, and a reception was held for H.E. Monsignore Z. Kaczynski when he met professors of Oxford University and the members of the staff of the Polish Faculty of Law. IV FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES a. Books The West African Library Scheme, under the direction of Miss Fegan and Miss Ferguson, is taking shape. Presentations were made but, in the main, the Council concentrated on building up its reference libraries in Accra, Freetown and Lagos : in the latter a children's section was added. In Kenya the Council undertook to help re-establish the burnt-out library of St. Andrews School, Turi, and the many grateful letters received show how deep an impression such a comparatively small gesture can make. Books on sociological subjects were sent to three institutes for adult education in South Africa, and a gift to the library of a High School in Natal. These presentations are the first in this territory, apart from one presentation made last year. A miscellaneous collection was despatched to Mauritius for distribution by Captain A. J. Bell, and a library was sent to Gibraltar for the new Institute there. Many requests have come from all sections of the community in the West Indies ; reference libraries were sent to the recently established social welfare depart ments in Trinidad and St. Kitts-Nevis ; another reference collection was made for the Press Association of Jamaica and work begun on the extensive assistance arranged for the five public libraries of the Leeward Islands—the first despatch of 200 volumes has already gone to Antigua. These gifts will, it is hoped, form part of the central library scheme in Trinidad when it has been developed to include all the islands in the Eastern Caribbean. Important purchases of books were made for the Palestine reference library, the Jerusalem library and the Tel Aviv Institute. Special attention is being given to English classics and critical and bibliographical material to supplement study of the texts—historical, topo graphical, ethnological and archaeological material relevant to the Arabic countries ; and books on philo sophy, comparative religion and essential works of reference. Work in Syria increased ; books on mathematics and physics were sent to the American University, Beirut, in connection with the appointments there of Dr. Mulholland and Dr. Sloane, and on general subjects to the Damascus Reading Room. Medical books were again sent to Persia, to the Teheran Medical Association as well as to the Pasteur Institute, and large supplies of books of a popular kind to Consular libraries and anglophil societies throughout the country. From Iraq came requests for books on elementary engineering, handcraft for boys and_^on housewifery and needlework for girls. C In North Africa work has been concentrated on building up the Council library in Algiers. Presentations were made to the Laboratoire d'Histologie in the University of Algiers. The Institut Scientifique Cherifien in Morocco sent in a list of desiderata for their library. Work in Latin America has assumed such proportions that it is possible to mention only a few outstanding presentations,' such as those to the Faculties of Law and Philosophy of the University of Buenos Aires : on botany, zoology and geology to the Centro de Estudiantes del Doctorado en Ciencias Naturales, and on general subjects to the Universidad y Biblioteca Popular Manuel Belgrano. The Centro Medico Argentino-Britanico has been kept up-to-date by supplies of the most recent books. Requests for material on special subjects came from several of the institutes in Brazil and from the librarian of the Sala Britanica, Santiago, Chile. The Institute in Santiago asked for books on psychology ; some of those sent will be presented to the University of Chile. All the countries of Latin America show interest in the books on teaching of English, fine arts and architecture and the application of science to agriculture. Dr. Needham's office in Chungking continues to send weekly requests for every kind of scientific work. The non-scientific side is also developing well. iirsi b. Britain Today Arrangements were completed for printing an edition, of ' Britain Today ' in India from moulds flown out from England. It is proposed that it should be put on sale. Promotion will be on a modest scale in the early stages owing to paper restrictions. The journal will be published in India from the offices of Messrs. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. c. Drama Miss Gwen Ffrangcjon Davies and Miss Marda Vanne continued their tour of the Union of South Africa. Their work has been approved by the Government and the High Commissioner, and that it has the public approval is clearly shown by the fact that the Council's guarantee has not been called upon. Miss Marie Ney continued her tour of the Union, and is now giving recitals of classical English drama in Rhodesia and Kenya. Her lour is to include the Sudan and Egypt, ending in Cairo in January 1945. Miss Ney includes in her programmes recitals of modern English poetry. The Council's guarantee has not been calledupon so far. The arrangements for this tour have been made in London by the Council, with the co-operation of the Colonial Office. The Council is negotiating tentatively with the managements of leading theatrical, ballet, and operatic companies, for tours of representative British dramatic work in certain of the liberated European countries. The Portuguese and Latin-American republics have particularly asked for the Council's assistance in the presentatic n of British theatrical art. The Council continues to send scripts of British plays to a number of foreign countries, and to assist in the negotiation of production and translation rights. d. Export {Publications) BOOK EXPORTS The number of bookshops operating under this scheme reached eighty, spread over fourteen countries. In Egypt and Portugal the scheme was withdrawn since the facilities are no longer necessary. Several additional bookshops in Chile and Peru placed orders. Agency. —This service was extended to the Dominions. Books have been despatched to Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa. 0^st orders were received from Morocco and Tunisia. ia Algeria the first order of £12,000 worth of books was sold within a week of delivery. A second order was received. Resale (Books). —Books continue to be sent by the Council to Turkey and Persia for resale purposes. The Persian Ministry of Education recently adopted Faucett's Oxford English Course for use in Government schools, and the Resale Scheme was used in order to supply them with the necessary text-books. Sale of Periodicals. —Arrangements were made for the despatch of periodicals to booksellers in French North Africa. Subscriptions to periodicals were arranged for learned institutions and private individuals in Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Belgian Congo, Netherlands West Indies, Portuguese West Africa, and other countries. Material and photostats were supplied against repayment in response to requests from these countries. TOUR IN SOUTH AMERICA Mr. David Fullerton toured South America on the Council's behalf, to report on the position of the British book trade in that continent. COPYRIGHT The work of this Section developed considerably. C^gyright has been cleared in two anthologies of iSush short stories and essays for production in China, and in an anthology of modern English verse for publi cation in Palestine. A Swiss publisher asked for assistance in obtaining the German translation rights in some recent publications on economics and sociology. Permission was obtained for the publication in Turkey of various translations including that of the Government White Paper on ' Health Education From Argentina, among other enquiries, came a request for permission to publish a Spanish edition of the new Education Act. The translation rights of Mr. Churchill's autobiography, ' My Early Lifewere procured for a publisher in Iceland. Numerous enquiries were received from Sweden and Spain. EXHIBITIONS The exhibition of Russian books is described else where. At the request of the ' Books Across the Sea ' circle in Great Britain ten sets of twenty English children's books were sent to New York for exhibition in various American cities arranged to coincide with an exhibition of English Children's Books in Wartime, at the Columbia University. To popularise the new hostel at Beirut an extensive educational exhibition was 'despatched, comprising text-books ranging from kindergarten to University standard. Further additions to the permanent text-book exhibi tions in the Middle East were despatched. Encouraging reports were received from Sweden on the comprehensive medical exhibitions arranged recently in Lund, Uppsala and Stockholm. Many orders and enquiries for books and translation rights have been received as a direct result of the book exhibition held in the Barcelona Institute during May. BOOK REVIEWS Cuttings of reviews were received from Algiers and Morocco, where interest in the problem of recon struction is marked. The Review Scheme is developing fast in Portugal, where the following periodicals have published reviews of British books : Novidades, Broteria, Seara Nova, Ocident, Biblos (published by the University of Coimbra), Gazeta de Matematica and the Bulletin of the Faculty of Law. In Spain, from which a large number of reviews were received, first contacts were made with papers published in Barcelona. First reviews were received from the Turkish periodical Arkitekt. In Palestine books are being noticed in the Palestine Post, Palestine Illustrated News, Forum, and over the radio. Reviews of British books have been published for the first time in the Brazilian periodical Arquivos de Asistiencia a Menores, which has published notices of a number of books on education and child welfare. Other reviews appear regularly in Rio and Sao Paulo papers. In Colombia, El Colombiano and Revista J aver ana published reviews of English books, and the Council has been asked to supply suitable works for notice in El Mas Financeira y Economica. Reciprocal Reviews. Books from Argentina were reviewed in the Burlington Magazine, the Western Mail and the Bulletin of Hispanic Studies.

Films Mr. Neville Kearney, Director of the Department, has returned from his tour of the Middle East. NEW PRODUCTIONS An experiment is being made with the production of the first two of a series of films of dramatic scenes from Shakespeare's plays. The two that have so far been shot are the forum scene from Julius Caesar and the murder and sleep-walking scenes from Macbeth. In the former, Mark Antony is played by Leo Genn, Brutus by Felix Aylmer. In the latter, Cathleen Nesbitt takes the part of Lady Macbeth, with Wilfred Lawson as Macbeth. Felix Aylmer appears again as the doctor in this scene, and Catherine Lacey as the attendant.

Science {including Medicine) monthly science news There is increasing evidence that paragraphs from Monthly Science News are being used extensively by the foreign and British press. Press cuttings were received from Australia, Brazil, India, Gold Coast, Palestine, Portugal, Rhodesia, Sweden, Transvaal, and U.S.A. science comment The wide range of subjects covered and the increased number of reviews and abstracts included in Science Comment resulted in a greater demand for copies for distribution overseas : two of the larger requests came from Spain and Brazil. transmission of scientific matter Thirty-two transmissions, covering some forty-five scientific papers and letters, were effected between this country and Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey. Arrangements were made on behalf of Dr. Karabag, Head Assistant in the Zoological Institute in the Higher Agricultural Institute at Ankara, for the identification of a number of dried specimens of Orthoptera at the Imperial Institute of Entomology. scientific information The Council's Science Department is increasingly usee}, as a centre of scientific information, both by scientists overseas and in this country. A specialised library and information section is being built up under the direction of Mr. A. A. Gomme, formerly Librarian of the Patent Office. films A proposal to assemble for overseas distribution a technical programme of films in physical science has been approved. A scrutiny of sources of available films made by scientists for scientific purposes is in progress. anglo-soviet scientific collaboration committee A collection of reports, speeches and pamphlets dealing with the organisation of research and technical education in Great Britain was compiled and sent to Academician Joffe for the Science Committee of VOKS. Requests for scientific information and literature on behalf of British scientists were forwarded to H.M. Embassy in Moscow. Arrangements were made for the microfilming of a number of the Russian-Engfth technical glossaries, collected by the Anglo-Soviet Scientific Collaboration Committee and placed in the Science Library, for the University Library in Melbourne. A direct request was received from the Library of Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. for a collection of Science in Britain pamphlets and Monthly Science News. science in china Dr. Joseph Needham returned to Chungking in July after a three months' tour of the South-Eastern Universities which, in his interim report to the Council, he describes as very fruitful. He visited many academic and technical institutions to which he gave advice and assistance. Dr. Dorothy Needham, who remained in Chungking during Dr. Needham's absence on tour, has supervised the arrangements connected with the building of the British Council premises which it is hoped will shortly be completed. Dr. and Mrs. Needham subsequently left Chungking on a visit to Yunnan to complete the work originally initiated by Dr. Needham during the early days of his work in China. Dr. Picken has left for China. medicine ' ' British Medical Bulletin. —The circulation of BMB in its various editions is : British Medical Bulletin (English printing) 3,044 British Medical Bulletin (Swedish reprint).. 1,300 Total (English) .. .. .. 4,344 Boletin Medico Britdnico (Spanish) .. 1,817 Boletim Medico Britdnico (Portuguese) ,. 960 Ingiliz Tip Bulteni (Turkish) .. over 1,000 There are further indications that the English edition of BMB is found useful to foreign doctors learning English. The Director of the British Institute at Barcelona requested 40 copies of a particular number, both in English and Spanish editions, for use as a bi lingual text by a class of Spanish doctors. With the publication of No. 8-9, a total of 82 new medical books, new editions and other non-serial publications, had been reviewed in BMB. Copies of overseas medical journals received in exchange for BMB during the quarter amounted to 307 in number. The number of copies of BMB disposed of by sale in the United Kingdom is increasing. Medical Information. —Requests from a number of countries for information on medical subjects were -fT^lt with. Subjects included drugs and therapeutic bub- stances ; apparatus, instruments and equipment, medical societies and organisations, medical research on various problems undertaken in Britain, bibliographies on special subjects. Medical Films. —The two medical films completed. Surgery in Chest Disease and Accident Service, continue to be much in demand for showing to medical audiences, civilian and military, in Britain. The former film, of which a few prints have now been sent overseas, has had an excellent reception by medical audiences abroad. Plans for a film on Plastic Surgery are now complete, but their execution has been delayed by the difficulty in obtaining the services of a suitable film unit. A number of medical films from other sources have been viewed for suitability by the Medical Film Viewing Panel. Appointment of Medical Professor. —Professor W. C. W. Nixon, who had applied for a vacant chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University at Istanbul, was earlier in the present year appointed temporary Medical Adviser to the Representative in Turkey. After serving in this capacity for three months, Dr. Nixon wasiM appointed attached Professor in obstetrics and gyne cology to the University of Istanbul for a provisional period of one year. Post-graduate medical work and study. —Advice has been given on the selection of medical applicants for British Council scholarships, and programmes of work have been fully discussed with all foreign or Empire medical graduates arriving in this country as British Council scholars. Medicine in China.—ks a result of recommendations made by the Medicine in China Sub-Committee of the Medical Panel, Dr. A. G. Sanders, of the Sir William Dunne School of Pathology at Oxford, was appointed for one year as Medical Adviser to the British Council Cultural Scientific Office at Chungking. Dr. Sanders is a member of the team of Oxford workers who, under the leadership of Sir Howard Florey, were responsible for developing work on Penicillin to a point where it became a valuable therapeutic agent. The Council is indebted to Sir Howard Florey for agreeing to Dr. Sanders' release for the necessary period. Centro Medico Argentina Britanico. —The medical aspect of Council work in Argentina has always been strong. For over three years the formation of a Centre which would act as a focus for Anglo-Argentine medical rel*^ons, has been under discussion. Suitable premises foi ouch a Centre have now been found. The Centre will be administered by an Executive Committee of distinguished Argentine doctors, and Dr. R, Castro O'Connor who spent two periods of post-gradua.te work in Britain, as a Prince of Wales Scholar and as a British Council scholar, has been appointed honorary medical secretary. The development of this scheme has depended principally on the considerable expenditure of time and energy that Dr, Castro O'Connor h^s devoted to it, engineering Overseas Appointments. —Action is proceeding with the appointment of Overseas Advisers, Professors and Lecturers in Engineering and Science for Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, China and Latin America.

Students 120 British Council scholars are expected to arrive early in October in order to carry out post-graduate studies in various subjects. Arrangements have also been made for a number of private students who wish to take up undergraduate and post-graduate studies in this country. Eighty British Council scholars of 22 nationalities attended a summer vacation course at Somerville College, Oxford, as guests of the Council. The course was organised for the Council by the Oxford • Delegacy for Extra-Mural Studies, and the subjects studied were the English language and British life and institutions. Students who wished to do so took a Certificate of Proficiency in English at the end of the course. The ban on travel prevented a number of Council scholars from leaving the country at the end of their courses and arrangements were made for them to make tours of the United Kingdom while they were waiting to leave. Arrangements are now made for all medical scholars to spend from two to three weeks before departure in seeing medical centres and institutions of special interest to them in the United Kingdom, Among Allied nationals in this country the following number of students were awarded British Council Scholarships in order to take up studies in Universities and other educational institutions : One Czechoslovak national, two French, one Greek, one Dutch, and two Polish, o.

I discussed the question of the Technical School v/ith Ward Anderson and told him that BAPCC were certainly going to be faced after the war v/ith a demand for employment of more Bahrainis to replace the large number of Persians and Indians whom he already had. I told him that the only way to do this effectively was for the Company to take over the Technical School, since they wouM in any case be employing 95 per cent of the pupils, and see that they were given a practical type of instruction which fitted them to enter the oil world. I added that the Bahrain Government would supply the funds and all that was required was that the Company should supply the technical experts and equipment. 3. He told me that he had been thinking about it, but that it was impossible to do anything at the moment since they simply could not find suitable men, but that he v/ould bear what I had said in mind f I feel more than ever convinced after seeing the Abadan school that the Bahrain Government will waste their money unless and until they get the Oil Company to run the school for them.

KaPoh 1.945. \jjy W Memortm^v' on Education In the Scliools of the ( ' ov03 iu vait by Mr.F.J.Wakelin. Kducatlonal Advlaor, Apart from the need for educated youths in Qovemment Departments the work of the oil companies In Bahrain, Kuwait and Eastern Saudl4 Arabia will absorb all whom we can produce for several years to come. Clerical and technical trainees are already being sought and the demand will Increase as the new production prograjanes come Intt action. This expansion of the oil Industry will mean also a general dewelopment of trade and the creation of new opportunity on for private business. In both Bahrain and Kuwait the demand for education is not yet being fully zaet. Any new buildings or extensions added in the past four years hav«5 been utilised for pupils already at school rather than for new entrants. In the process of reducing the nusiber of v/vv children per room to a workable limit. Only the I^wrer Schools arc a more than 30 children found In one group, uv odicola nro required at once In both states to reduce this figure still further and to accomodate the 200 or so who are turned away each year through of accomodation. This will entail the engagement oi wijucj-tioriul trained teachers. The work that been begun In Bahrain and Kuwait Is merely the prelude to the development of a coordinated educational system throughout the Gulf and Eastern Saudi# Arabia. Within this area there is nothing to ooe^are with the schools of Bahrain or Kuwait except In the Hejjas, which province is so remote that it can scarcely be included in our sphere. In rapidly increasing numbers boys from Saudi Arabia and other neighbouring states are Joining our schools* at present we are able to provide a sound primary course of seven years aViA an introduction to a secondary education of three years. Provided our schools are expanded and our secondary schools well equipped and staffed Saudi Arabians will send their sons to Bahrain or Kuwait rather than to Cairo or Beirut as the environment in these Arab states is more suited to their needs. Bahrain already has an excellent hostel which can be extended when necessary. Steps//\ ' t n in Kuwait to meet this need. The Kuwait Education Committee Is fully aware of the position and Is making preparations for development and expansion* The new Infant schools will be opened In September 1945 and 15 nor Egyptian masters and mistresses engaged* The Committee Intends to set up a hostel In Cairo to house 50 students fras Kuwait, the Initial cost being £2000 and the running expenses £700 per mensem* These youths will attend schools and colleges in that city* The Intention Is that most of them will take short courses of one or two years of training as teachers* This will bring about a rapid la^provement of the local teachers who form the majority of the staff* Foreign teachers will be enployed chiefly In the secondary schools and tipper classes of the primary schools f These will be gradually replaced by graduates of the Kuwait Secondary School and those already at secondary schools abroad when they hare taken a course at a training colleger either abroad or possibly In Kuwait Btoi&gt; a to be taken In JJahrr-in, &gt;r Similar action must be taken In Bahrain* A start has been made In that nine students were sent to Egypt In the susrier of 1944, three of whftm are at a secondary school, three at a tea-chers training college and three at a technical school* This number should be Increased to at least 30 this year* If the Ooremment will set up a hostel many parents will be prepared to send their sons at their own expense* If Bahrain la to attract suitable foreign teachers and to retain their services better conditions must be provided* The terms of service ccnpare most unfavourably with those of the Kuwait Government* Except for a house allowance of rather less than £2 per menseoi 9 which la only a fraction of the rent of a small house, no provision Is made* As la dene In Kuwait special quarters must be set aside, or If necessary built* These should be suitable for a married couple aa most teachers are married* Salaries should be paid from the date of leaving Egypt and adequate detention allowances ;/allowances should the man be held up on his way to or from Bahrain* Passages Tov wlTes are also paid to Kuwait ©jaployecs# Tims 11\6x t teachers are encouraged to continue their services with ti e Govemraont over a period of years* All those who have complot od their first contract are signing on for another. It is doubtful whether the Egyptians in Bahrain will stay for a second year even# The Director of Education should have a first class Arab -V- Assistant and as soon as the nan power problem eases a British Head Master for the Secondary School should be appointed* Utader precc t conditions the Director is # among other things.

British Council Aid* The time is not yet ripe to appoint a British Director to Kuwait* The position of the Educational Adviser is no*'satisfactorily established, ffcft only conplaint of the Committee is that he is able to devote so little time and attention to Kuwait affairs and can visit them only when his duties in Bahrain permit. They fully appr eciate that the engagement of foreign staff and the placing of students abroad would be extremely difficult without the help of the British Council. That we were able to find so suitable a Director of Education for them was Indeed a feather in our cap. It has eompletol./ convinced them of our honourable intentional They know too that they can not open the Cairo Hostel unless the Council undertakes a major part of the work* What they ask for is an Adviser resident in Cairo, where xaost of their students will be, who can keep in close touch with their boys, engage their teachers and visit them regularlyi someone whom they have the right to call upon for advice and assistance/rather than a casual visitor who does what ha can in the limited time at his disposal. In conclusion I give below a summary of the part the British Council should play. lm Delegate an official in Cairo to continue the work of Educational Adviser to the Kuwait Oovemmsnt and to supervise the KUwait and Bahrain (7) Hostel in Cairo. Continue the grant to the Bahrain Qovemraent perhaps increase it to cover the Director »s full salary when he is enabled, tlirough the appointment of an Arab Assistant^ to devote more of his time to administration and policy. 3. Second an official as Director of Sducation for another period of four years. In a year or so increase the grant to cover the salary of a British Head Master for the Secondary School. 5.

Memorandum: - I have visited the following Schools on more than one occasion, The Secondary, The West, The New, The Technical Schools in Manama and the Primary School in Muharraq.. I have also seen the schools in Hedd, Al^ Khamis, Rafaa, Sitra and Buddeya. Such visits have been of necessity short and my observations are of a general nature. It is highly creditable that the schools should have started the year with such good order prevailing throughout in spite of the difficulties of staff and the absence of a Director of Bducation. This good order must be maintained throughout the yearfif the splendid foundations of an education system laid by Mr. Wakelin are to remain firm and produce the results that are hoped for in Bahrain. All the schools were well filled and there is some over crowding in the lower forms but this is due to limited accom modation and staff. In some schools the upper classes are small but in spite of the apparent extravagance in staff no attempt should be made to reduce the opportunities available to these pupils. There is a drain away from the schools for employment which must be fought if the educational standard in the Island is to be raised. In one school in Muharraq the number of boys exceeds that given in instructions from the Department but the Headmaster has the situation well in hand and his action in acceptinc the boys is due to pressure from above. The teachers are settling to the new year with enthusiasm. The Egyptians are markedly good at their profession. A high standard of teaching ability cannot be expected from the Bahrain teachers who lack training but they appear to be keen on their work. The problem of pay is a very serious one and should receive the earliest and most sympathetic study of the financial authorities otherwise many good teachers will be lost. By the courtesy of Mrs. Wafiqa Aawaf I visited the Girls * Schools at Manama^ Muharraq and witnessed the teaching of the Kindergarten section. I was much impressed by what I saw and it is evident that Mrs. Sawaf has a rare gift of teaching and of power to dispose her teachers. It is clear that the boysiyf - 2 - kindergarten would make better and more lively progress were they separated from the primary Schools and put under the care of Mrs. Sawaf. The Technical School is difficult to take up. It should in my opinion come into the sphere of the Department of Education. In the office of the Departgient, the temporary appoiittment of the Hostel Warden as Chief Clerk has worked well from an administration point of view at the beginning of the year because he has an interest in and a wide knowledge of th^/vork but it will not do as a permanent arrangement as the Headmaster will look for help to a more senior official and they should be able to get it. The former Director appears to have been his own Secretary and Accountant, thifts may have been unavoidable but the weajtfiess of such a system is apparent. The office should be a good yaoiftg ground for clerks to a sense of responsibility and order. There is a marked carelessness about the handling of funds praticularly during the period of changing over. The results are most unsatisfactory and it is exceedingly bad training for young men. The filing system was overhauled by Mr. Willey and he has brought it into line with modern practice and should prove more efficient than the old. The problem of the Egyptian teachers is not at serious as I had been led to suppose. A meeting was held and a truce of friendship and common endeavour was made which should guarantee the future against petty jealousies. I think some of the causes have been insufficient work for the Headmaster of the Secondary School, his good fortune in having his wife and family here and housed in good conditions. They should live now in better harmony and I would suggest that they be called together from time to time by a senior 3iglishman and perhaps entertained on occasions such as the Birthday of King Faroulc, etc. I do not consider it expedient that the Department be left without a senior official in-charge. I am of opinion that the Acting Adviser should keep a close supervision over the Department but as this will entail an increasing amount at work of inter- viBwing etc., he should have the assistance of a senior Bahrain official to attend the office. In support of this recommendation I would put forward the name of Ahmed al Omran, Secretary to the Muharraq. Municipal ity. A man of some teaching experience and wide culture, he enjoys the confidence of the Minister, the esteem of the Acting Adviser and is widely respected by the staff both foreign and native.1 I Ee would I feel sure carry out the plans of Mr. V/akelin without major changes. He should attend the office at stated hours and the daily problems would be brought to him. He would be the liaison with the Minister and the Acting Adviser. I recommend that Nair the Hostel Warden be made Chief Cleric to the Department in addition to the duties at the Hostej^ The files and papers would be his care. He has a good know of'the details of the school and has been the greatest value to me during my stay. He would also be in charge of the English library His salary should be raised to Ks.300/- (see Mr, .Yilley T s notes) and be ^iven free board at the Hostel. I also recommend that Ahmed Abdul Rasool continue in charge of the stores and be given charge of the accounts and account books on trial. He should be given a rise in salary. Jassim the typist and translator is doing good work add completes the office staff. I am not of^opinion that a further number of the staff is necessary to manage any branch of the office. I do not recommend the confirmation of Hassan Yousuf/as Inspector of Schools. I believe this will lead to disorder among the Egyptian staff. I recommend that the Headmasters be circularized and informed that they are responsible for the standards of work, health and cleanli)os5 of their schools and that they may apply from time to time for inspection of the teaching in certain classes which they are unable to gauge themselves. I believe the headmasters of the larger schools are of sufficient calibre to warrant this post. It will be necessary for Ahmed al Omran to visit the Schools from time to time. I recommend that a course of lectures for teachers te smarted and that Hassan Yousef be charged with the organisation of the courses. The lectures should be given in the evening and it would be an advantage if there were some financial rewards for diligence (a more detailed proposal will be sent after consultation with Mr. Wakelin). I have received numerous requests from the stfiffs for assistance and I have interviewed a very large number of people. My authority does not extend to the settlement of these affairs. I iiava therefore reduced these requests to some and they are given in separate documents, I would draw attention to the 4/— \ -4urgent need of (1) the salaries of teachers and (2) the maintenance of the schools in a good state of repair and cleanliness. Mr. Wakelin has left behind him a great reputation. Tributes have been paid to the interesting effect he put into his work and to his ability to gain the confidence and friendship of the people in whatever station in life. I shall emphasize to the British Council the urgent need of finding a successor and of this tradition being carried on. I see the need in the future of an advisory Council for Education but it would be out of place to make a recommendation at this stage. Finally I must point out that this is a rough draft of my observations and recommendations and is submitted in this form for convenience and because of the pressing need Cor arrangements to be made without delay. I conclude by recording my gratitude to Mr. G-.W.R. Smith for his hospitality, guidance and advise and to the staff of the Department for their whole hearted co-operation during my visit. - 4 - Si/ R.W. HIGHWOOD.

V _ Education in Bahrain NS. _(ri VISIT TO BAHH^I^ I arrived in Bahrein in the evening of October 13th. At this date all the schools were well started on their courses. During my stay I made a fairly thorough examination of the secondary school, the two primary schools and the technical school at Manama, and the primary school at Muharraq, and visited them more than once. I also paid short visits to the village schools at Hedd, Souk al Khamis, Rufaa, Sitra and Buddeya. In view of the difficulties of starting a school year without a Director of Education, and with the late arrival of many of the Egyptian staff, and the shortage of teachers, it is highly creditable that such a prompt and orderly start should have been made, ^t is a great credit to the Acting Adviser, the clerical staxx oi. the Depart ment and the Headmasters that this should have been done, and is a tribute to the splendid foundation oi the system laid down by Mr, ^akelin. It is of the greatest importance that this order should not be relaxed during the year, ®ie Headmasters and their staff were working on their timetables of studies with interest and enthusiasm, !I3ie .Egyptian teachers were evidently competent. Most of the Bahrein masters were not lacking in enthusiasm if some were wanting in a trained technique of teaching. The schools are all well filled: there is overcrowding in the lower forms of some of the schools, but this cannot be avoided with accommodation limited and teachers difficult to find. One school (that of Muharraq) had taken more boys than the instructions of the Department allowed, but the Headmaster had the situation well in hand and his action was due to pressure from above. The school buildings, which are of a nature difficult to keep clean, had attained a fair standard of cleanliness as is to be expected at the be^innin^ of a school year, but very considerable attention will have to be given if this standard is not to deteriorate, especially in the sweeping of floors, repairs, etc. The provision of drinking water and lavatory accommodation left much to be desired, I found a certain weakness in the administration of the office of the Department, The Director had been his own secretary and accountant: this may have bean difficult to avoid, but a valuable opportunity to train young men in responsibility has been lost. It was particularly noticeable that a somewhat casual method of dealing with funds had led to a discrepancy in the accounts. An administration of this sort is very bad training for young clerks, Mr, Willy had revised the filing system, but unfortunately was not able to see it put into use; it should, however, be sounder than the old system. The Indian warden of the hostel was in charge of the clerical work of the Department, He had a very good knowledge of the details of the schools and was of very great assistance. The senior headmasters of the schools were ilgyptian. There was no senior Bahreini official in the Administration, As all the boys in the schools and a great number of the teachers are Arabs of Bahrein, and the Minister of Education is a Sheikh of the ruling family, this was most inconvenient. I have recommended an important change. There is a problem of the Egyptian teachers. A meeting of the Egyptian staff was called and they came to an agreement to work in harm ny and good fellowship. I am of opinion that the headmaster of the secondary school has insufficient work to occupy him, and the fact that his wife and family are housed in good conditions is sufficient to create an atmosphere of intrigue and jealousy. Another Egyptian teacher had been replaced at the secondary school by a highly paid Indian who had a good knowledge of iSnglish but whose ability to teach was untried. I trust that a better spirit will now prevail among them. I feel that it would be a great advantage if some senior jSnglishaan could entertain them from time to time, perhaps on an Egyptian holiday such as theBirthday or the King of ^zyptt this should help to maintain a -jood spirit. With a clear undarstandins this problem should not be difficult. I visited the girls• schools at Budde/a and Muharraq under the guidance of Mrs. wafia 3awaf # a lady with a rare gift of teaching and of inspiration to her own teachers. 1 was most impressed by what I saw, and it is clear that boys 1 kindergartens would at some future time make better progress under the guidance of women teachers and thi inspiration of Mrs. Sawaf. rart 2 ~ Re commendations , I do not consider it expedient that the Department of Education be left without a senior official in charge. I aa of opinion that the Acting Adviser should keep a close supervision over the Department, but as this will entail frequent attendance at the office, I would recommend that a senior Bahrein! official be placed in charge of the office of the Department. In support of this recomraendation, I would put forward the name of Ahmed Arumran, secretary to the Mnharraq Municipality. He enjoys the confidence of the Minister, he is highly thought of by the Acting Adviser, and is widely respected by the teaching staff, both foreign and local. He is, in my opinion, well enough educated to carry out this duty in addition to his work at the Municipality: he would attend the office at stated hours, and the details of office routine would pass through his hands: he would be the liaison with the President and the Acting Adviser, I recommend that Isialr, the hostel warden be secretary to the Department in a clerical capacity. Bie files and papers would be his care in addition to the hostel. He has a good knowledge of the Department and has been invaluable to me during my short stay, I would suggest (see Mr. Willy^s notes) a rise in his pay to Rupees ^00 and free board and lodging at the hostel. He would also be in charge of the .aaxjlish Library. I further recommend that Ahmed Abdel Rasoul be given charge of the accounts on probation, and continue to look after stores. He should be ^iven a rise in salary. With Jasim, who is doing ^ood work as typist and traxiSlater, it should be possible to run the office without farther staff. I cannot recommend a confirmation of Hassan Youssuf as an inspector of schools, I believe this would lead to discord among the ii^yptian staff. In place of this arrangement, the headmasters should be told that they will be held responsible for maintaining the standard of their schools, and that they should make requests for inspection in these subjects which they cannot undertake themselves. Ahmed Alumran would see the schools from time to time. I believe that the headmasters of the schools are of good enough calibre to warrant this trust, particularly those of the larger schools. I would recommend that the Technical School be brought under the control oi the Department ox' education. I would recommend that a series of courses for teachers be started as soon as possible. These courses would be directed to the Bahrein! teachers who are undertrained. I suggest that they be held at the secondary school and that the headmaster arrange the lectures. A detailed suggestion for such courses would be sent from Cairo, in order to ensure the success of this undertaking, it would be cm advantage if there were some financial reward for diligence shown by the teachers, and probably a small fee would have to be paid to the lecturers. I feel that it would be a distinct advantage if an Advisory Council for education were set up# composed, not only of those con^ cerned with education, but to include some of th^ more influentfcl men of the towns. It would open to discussion that activity inS&gt; J* Bahrein which is of the greatest interest to the population, and would serve to advertise the affairs of the Department and to disarm some of the criticism - particularly the criticism that the schools have little to show after four years. 1 was not aware that the girls* schools were not under the control of the Department, I recommend that they should become part of it and that the Director should work through the Inspectress. Mr. v *akelin has left behind him a great reputation. Tributes have been paid to the untiring efforts he put into his work, his interest in the boys, and his ability to gain the confidence and friendship of people of all conditions in life. In making my recommenda tions to the British Council, I shall emphasise that this tradition must be carried on. I do not think it would be commendable that on the appointment of the new Director, Ahmed Aliamran should close his connec tion with the Department as his retention qjpuld make valuable experience and advice available to a newcomer. 1 have interviewed a large number of people, and received much correspondence. A large proportion of these were concerned with requests 01 one sort or another. I had no executive authority and I have therefore endeavoured to put these into order and have added such recommendations that seem necessary to the maintenance of the education system. Of these I particularly draw the attention to (1) the salaries of the teaching staff which require sympathetic cojpsideration if numbers of the teachers are not to be lost^Mt(ii) Die requests for repairs and reiiewals of the schools, (kM R.W.HIliHWOOD. j November 1945.RWH/MLW 12th November, 1945 ADDITIONAL NOTES (i) (2) (5) The British Council has been sending out from time to time English books, novels etc., all of an advanced nature. I do not think that these books should remain idle on the shelves but rather that they should be made available at stated times in the room of the Department which is called the Library and which I hope will be Mslr's office. They would then be available for the 'English readers of the various communities in Bahrein, The films which have been sent out by the British Council seem to me to remain idle and unused too long. I do not know the projection facilities in Bahrein t® any great extent, but they might, for instance, be of interest to the Political Agent. I am discussing the subject with the films department in Cairo and will let you have further notes.

The Company can offer the following assistance at this time and I will be pleased to receive any comments you may have after reviewing the items with your Superintendent of Schools* (1) For a length of time contingent on their own require ments, the Company will lend the Governmenti 1 - 200 amp. G.E. Electric driven welding machine 1 - 300 amp. Hobart Gasoline Engine driven welding machine. (2) The Company will assist in the matter of obtaining welding supplies such asi Welding Hoods, Lenses, Electrodes, etc. at a cost to the Government representative of the landed cost plus handling charges to the Company. (3) The Company will lend or sell to the Government an acetylene cutting and acetylene welding torch with various siae tips and sell to the Government expendable equipment for acetylene welding such ast Hose, Oxygen. Acetylene, Goggles, Bod, etc. Possibly a small acetylene generator may be made available in the future. (4) In order that the boys studying Machine Shop practice can have the opportunity of doing some practical work which we believe they will find of more interest than ordinary routine class work we will be glad to supply sufficient valves, and other equipment in need of re pair. to the school on a basis that the students do the repair of this equipment and the Government charge the Company accordingly. (5) If you and your Superintendent believe it desirable the Company will be glad to provide some instruction fbr boys in the advanced classes in either welding or Machine Shop practice.A a-956 C,D.Bplgrave f Esq., Bahrain - 2 - 2nil K *y» 19f6&gt; (6) In order that the school may provide a course In eutomotlve repair the Company will endeavor to make some piece of discarded automotive equipment avaliable 9 to the school. I believe that at least some of the above items should be put into operation this spring even though I under stand the remaining time, before school is dismissed for the summer) is very small. The addition of some new courses to the curriculum and the expansion of some ol the v/ork now done for the present class9 we believe^ should add interest to the school and attract more students for the next term starting after the summer months. The Company has not yet been able to complete any comprehensive plan for coordinating school instruction work in your Technical School with advanced supplementary training by the Company, but we are pursuing this matter end do expect to be able to'discuss such a plan with you in the future. In the intervening period it is thought that assistance along t' e aforementioned lines should be of some benefit to the students.

This is not satisfactory and consequently I have approached the Bahrain Petroleum Company. That Com pany inform me that a certain sum of dollars, 50,000 I believe is the figure, has been allotted for technical education, supply of machinery, necessary tools, etc., and that the proposal was to train youths in BAPCO shops utilizing the part time services of the company's skilled employees. I, therefore, proposed to the General Manage ment that they should combine their scheme with the Bahrain SfflcsxHisBHXxjc Technical School and run the latter for the Bahrain Government. Ward Anderson favoured the idea and details of the scheme on the above lines will be worked out here and sent to the New York Board of Directors for comments. The Bahrain Government is in favour of the proposal in general, and I shall keep you informed of developments. xx xx xx(§) Extract from Sir Geoffrey Prior's Note dated the 25th March, 1946.

I*} Thank yoa for your letter Mo. FA-956 dated gnd May 1946, on the subject of the Technical School, I have now had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the headmaster, owing to his having been in hospital until three days ago I was unablejto reply before. 2. Your offer of material and help is greatly appreciated and will I am sure do much to improve the usefulness of the school. Already a number of boys from the higher classes of the Grovernmunt Sc hools, wh. have h^ard th^t the Technical School is going to begin to teach welding and automotive repair, have apnlierl to enter the Technical School next terra, these applicants include some boys from the Secondary School which is an indication that instruc tion in these two branches will attract a number of boys. 3. The loan of the Electric and Gasoline weldin^ machines will be extremely useful. Said Tabbara, the headmaster, has experience in teaching this work. 4. We shall be glad to buy the welding torch and equip ment which is mentioned in (5) of your letter and if you can provide valves etc? which can be repaired by the boys in the school it will I am sure stimulate their interest. 5, When the new classes have been started it woul be of great value if an expert from the Company could give occasional instruction to the most advanced boys who are working on welding and machine shop practice. 6, Automotive repair is work which will undoubtedly attract a numbr of students, if you can provide a piece of die rded automotive equipment it would be of great use, if it is not possible for you to find this the Bahrain Government mifrht be able to procure it in Manama. In this direction we are rather handicap ed as we have not got on the school staff a trained motor mechanic and the mechanics in the Government Garage and Power House are fully occupied. With our present staff we could st^rt on this course but later we should require the services of an expert, Local bazaar trc.ined so—called mechanics would not in my opinion be satisfactory teachers. I should like to start this work at once and for the rest of this term our present staff could carry on but it would probably be necessary to engage a special teacher to give lessons in this course at the school on certain days of the week, next term, V/ould it be possible, next term, for anyone employed by you to give lessons,say, twice a week, on this subject at the school ^ 7, The schools close on 15th June and re-open on 1st October. I should like to start the new lessons as soon as possible and if it is ossible for you to supply the welding equipment and the automotive equipment now I will arrange for the new classes to begin at once. The very fact of the equipment being in use at the Technical school will attract applications for entry into the school next terra. We have already received forty applications for admission to the school on the strength of the rumour that classes are to be given in welding and automotive repair. s.z.D.O.

Of course, the Bahrain Petroleum Company is under no obligation to provide educational facilities for Bahrain but, nevertheless, they have accepted the principle that they should help very materially in the efficient running of the Bahrain Technical School. 3. Prom Belgrave^ letter to me it appears that ho wishes to put off the issue for more than a quarter of a century, but he contradicts this to some extent in his letter to Russell Brown from which you will see that he has asked for his assistance in the provision of instruetion. 4. This, I think, may be considered satisfactory for the moment, and if read with Russell Brown»s penultimate paragraph should enable us to jockey the Company into eventual fuller co-operation. Yours sincerely, The Hon»ble Lieut-Col. W.R.

RaW n.b.w...d.w ...M-y-z — fiS* Your letter No. 977-2E of May 11th regarding technical school equipment has been received. We are sending immediately by our transport, both the 300 amp # gasoline engine driven and the 200 amp. electric powered welding generr.tor with st licient cable to place them in operation. Likewise, we are including 1 electric holder, 2 welding helmets complete with lens and cover glasses, 2 pair of welding gloves and 25 pounds each of 5/32 M and 3/32' welding electrodes. As agreed, you may consider the generators to be loaned you on a rent free basis, however, the balance of the items are expendable end the school will be billed for thoir plus a reasonable handling and transport charge. In regards to oxygen acetylene welding and cutting equipment, we would like to withhold sending this 1 pterial to you at this time until we have had an opportunity to discuss this process with the School Superintendent. There is a certain element of danger to be considered when operating acetylene generators and oxygen under high pressure. Also bottled acetylene is exceedingly high in price at Bahrein. Perhaps bottled petroleum gas could be used for cutting which we make ourselves and its cost is very nominal. If possible, we would like to have the Technical School Superintendent come to Awsli and discuss with Mr. A. D. Bell matters concerning the scheduling of an occasional instructor for the advanced classes in weld ing and machine shop work. We have an old Ford Truck which is still operable but in a poor condition which we could loan the school for dis-assembling and repassembling. Please advise us when you are ready to received this equipment. ConfidenHal p r 1 : \ i .dtuq o2./. ^ ft JFA-974 C. D.

(a) It is .jUite cle r th. t the Persian Gulf, altnoujjh a geogr phic-^l unit, has so aany different conultlons prev 11- ing in the Sheikhuoms that a Persian Gulf Training Colle fc e in the early stages Is out ot the question. Opportunities for the training oi teachers should be au de, no in f &gt;ct are be- in*. ,. .e f in the princip .-l Sa^ikv.oms of b hn in anc \a . xt on a small scale.

If this is to become''The Persian Gulf Train ing College 1 it must become so by it? achieveuents and repute nd not ncffied so it its initiation. • This Tr. ninp Centre should look wider than the teach ing profession, s for many years to corie there will be &amp; comparatively small number, of boys in the Secondary £c -iools %ho will &gt;ant to join the teaching profession. Also there is need for a stalf of Government servants to assist in the sdministration of tiie newly organised Post Office, the Customs etc. There is no B -.hraini of any professional sttnd- ing in the inland, an the lr- ining Centre, therefore, should provi..e preliminary studies for Ledicine nc possibly La?.. The idv. ntages of Centre for these subjects oi training are clearly greater than those of sending boys abroad to other Arabic-speaking countries, because, apart from the politic*1 aspect, there is the opportunity of practical training on the tpot run in g han. in hand with the theoretical. With the heavy demands rafc e on the supply of intelligent young men of the richer families by Commerce and by the opportunities of fered in the Oil Company, the flow of candidates would for some time be smalli it would therefore be a great advantage for the Tr inin^ Centre to be run on the lines of c,n Insti tute where instruction oi all rwinas in the evening coule be given to adults ulready in employment. The Training Centre should be run as part of tne Edu cation 1 system ana therefore unaer the direction of the Education Dep rtment. This .oula prevent friction and the danger of beys being taken a^ay from school to attend the evening classes. Direction of the Centre shoulc be in the hands of a man of vide knowledge and experience, and he sh uld be n Englishman appointed, if possible, by the British Council, the chief obstacle to this is the .uestion of fin nee: it would make heavy demands on the Stats budget, but in l pro ject of this import-nee the Oil Company and the merchants could De induced to assist. The sta ! o' the Centre, part fro® the Director, would be recruited from J£gy : . t ^nd S/IPie, and would also perhaps include some of the British Ofiicials employed by the Bahrain Government.Government./ Whatever be the future of Bahn in «• « coau.erclal centre- there is no reason ishy it shoulc not t; ite the i-etu i « j-n educ &amp;tionfcl and cultural centre.

There is much to be said for tais vle^ but the fact remains that Kuwait will no longer enjoy the mediaeval sUte of its exist ence, and there will be a cry for professional men, and more aodern-trained Government officials. To meet this demand I have appended to my report the suggestions I m&amp;ae to the Minister of Education. The willingness to accept .no ttinic in practical terms of progress was more evident here th^n in Bahrain for the simple reason that there is no ^ueition of who rules the State, and ^.ho is determinea to cio so. The proposed TechnioA. Echool is the subject of a separate report. £\i£c£l* Transport arrangements -aade *t impossible for e to :ui.ke this journey and the absence of the Sultan in the interior,In any case,mace it inexpedient.

During this time I was in close contact with the Acting Director of Kducation and visited all the schools of the Kducation Departmentt both boys and girls, in the island of Bahrain and Moharrak with the exception of one girls* school. Owing to the two days 1 holiday of Moharrem and three days' of strike owing to the partition of Palestine I was not able to put in as much time as I should have liked in some of the schools. My observations are given below BCyR t SCHOOLS : (1) The Secondary School ; This school is housed in a building which has been erected above the Bast School. The classrooms are adequate for the number of students as a temporary expe dient. Such a school requires its own playgrounds and other recreational facilities. The standard attained by the boys was most creditable, but the sta^f for the teaching of English is not adequate for the needs of the school. The senior English teacher, although competent, has a difficult accent. It would be a great improvement if, in the absence of an English teacher, some member of either the Government service or of the Oil Company could spend an hour or so and work with the top classes improving their ease of speech and fluency. There is a very great need for a science laboratory and of improvement in the teaching of Science. It is taught in English whereas both English and Arabic should be used and Arabic textbooks. The Oil Company might contribute to the equipment of a laboratory and, in the absence of accommoda tion, the Technical School might house it. The Headmaster is young and not very experienced but the progress in the school is very creditable. The standard, because of their continuous work, is equal to the education they would have in Egypt and they are further advanced in the year's work. Mathematics is being well taught and the Arabic writing was good. The curri culum follows closely that of Egypt* There is a four-year course following the practice in Syria. Seven boys have been selected as trainees for teaching: they follow the ordinary Secondary Course and extra tuition in the evening, ''hey are subsidised by the State and are resident in the hostel, ^his is a most valuable development. (2) Primary School - Muharrak : The oldest school in the State. The toys belonging to the Arab families of the town, the school is therefore more homogeneous than those of Manama, 'he Head master, an Egyptian, has no easy time as the boys are apt to be troublesome. m he elementary section was bigger than the Primary, but with fewer classrooms. It is not healthy for the elementary section of these Primary Schools to be too much mixed with the older boys, ^his applies to all the primary schoo ! s. It would, however, involve an expensive building programme to separate them as yet. ^here was a display of art which if maintained during the year would be a valuable tribute to the boys 1 study. The teachers method of address, however, is onen to criticism# The other subjects were being well taught and the boys lively and bright. (3) 'he West School ; The Headmaster is young but the school is alive. Tt has certain advantages in grounds, shared only by Fuharrak, but alterations in the building would improve the classroom accommodation.Itfl 8.- (4) The East School; This school building is not satisfactory intPii?^ 00 ' 18 small and stuffy.

In my opinion they are better than the Egyptian elementary teachers.

His ariministrntive duties take up a lot of time but he should be able to do more inspection, 'he urgent need is for teachers and this is a very difficult problem because the profession is not attractive financially, and the import of foreign staff surrounded with difficulty, ^or many years to come teachers will have to be recruited from Syria and from Kgy^t* ''he Becondary School needs a well qualified staff and Kgypt is the only satisfactory recruiting ground if the right men are selected, r'he S'.ate is s-oending a satisfactory proportion of its budget on education, but more will be needed if the schools are to be adequately equipped. In Bahrain the schools are crowded and boys are refused admission. m his causes some discontentf but the lower parts of the schools are not as overcrowded as they are in Kuwait where no boys are refused. In view of the importance of the subject T was pleased to see that the standard of knowledge of religion and the teaching was good. 0IRI»3 SCHOOLS By the courtesy of Mrs Belgrave I was allowed to visit the junior sections of the girls schools in Manama, ruharrak and Rifaa. ^he atmosphere of the schools was bright and the singing and games were cheerful, 'he translation of European songs into Arabic while maintaining the original tune is the work of the Tns-nectress and the effect is happy faces in contrast with the somewhat dismal dirges of national hymns, etc. heard in the boys* schools. The needlework was excellent- Judging by the exercise books of the senior girls, the standard of learning was creditably high. There is a great need for books, ^he texts are not sufficient for the girls all to have copies and the supply of modern school books limited. Cairo will endeavour to supply specimen copies but funds are needed to 'nurchase books in Kgypt and Syria. It is difficult to find suitable training colleges for teachers abroad and it would seem desirable to train as many as possible even to a limited extent by means of the well trained staff now in Bahrain, ^he Government is fortunate in having an Inspectress of the calibre of Miss T?alr, whogpenthusiasm and cheerfulness are an inspiration to her staff. thk tkchntcal school m he Headmaster is experienced and keen. He has many difficulties, the chief of which are terms of employment for his students and the reluctance of the Arabs to engage in manual work under existing conditions. I was told by an expert that there was a tendency for the teachers to do much of the work themselves but of this I am no judge. T could s e however that the school at present is ^ot satisfactorily progressing and that the cost is relatively high. As this school is not part of the Kducation Department# I recommend that the Adviser, the Headmaster and the British Representative from the Bahrain Petroleum Company should discuss the present position* ^he problems are not primarily educationnl; they are financial and technical and the relations between the school and the markets of employment in the ntate and the CompHny. It is most urgent that these questions be examined and a progressive policy evolved. R.W.HTflHWOOnD.n. NO. C/212. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 13th February, 1943.

Highwood recommends the setting up of an Institute in Bahrain which would be a cultural and educational centre eventually for the whole Gulf, with a British Director, under Government authority. The Institute would be a Training Centre for boys requiring more advanced education than what is now available, future Government servants would study there and he mentions the possibility of boys receiving preliminary training in such subjects as Medicine and Law. He emphasises the advantages of training boys in the country instead of sending them to other Arabic speaking countries and mentions the possibility of eventually filling the posts in the schools, which are now held by foreigners, with locally trained teachers. He says that the suggestion was well received locally and some of the merchants even accepted the idea that they should participate financially. 3.

In principle I think that the suggestion that there should be an Institute in Bahrain is a sound one but the proposal presents a good many difficulties the chief one being the question of costs. I do not think there is the slightest possibility of the merchants contributing any amount worth considering towards this project. The richest merchants in Bahrain complain bitterly when they have to pay five rupees a month as a municipal house tax. They are so accustomed to get everything for nothing, such as education, medical facilities and other public amenities, that they resent being asked to pay for any kind of service. They consider that the Government should provide everything. Whether the oil company would contribute towards a British Institute is, in my opinion, doubtful. I think most probably that the whole cost of the scheme would have to be born by the Bahrain Government. Highwood seems to make a distinc tion between the Ruler and the Government, in fact there is none. At present His Highness is not inclined to sanction additional expenditure upon Education partly because he regards the present political situation in Bahrain as being in the main the result of the State having educated a number of young men many of whom are now politically opposed to his Government. Whether education can be blamed for the present state of things is doubtful. 4. Before it is possible to discuss the scheme with His Highness it would be necessary to know how much money such a scheme would require. Until at least a 3/-- 3 - very rough estimate of the cost can be obtained I do not think that any useful purpose can be served by putting up the matter to His Highness. Presumably money would have to be provided to erect a suitable building, there are none available which could be hired, to equip it and to pay for a director and for the staff. I have no idea what this would cost nor do I know whether the British Council would bear part of the expense^ From Highwood^ letter it appears that the Council would not contribute, I assume this fact because there is no suggestion in the letter that the British Council would provide any funds. I suggest that, if the recommendation is pursued, before doing anything more we should get some sort of idea as to how much it would cost to set up and to maintain an Institute or Centre. 5, Regarding the notes on Highwoodfe inspection of schools, Ahmed Omran's appointment has been confirmed. The fact that it was not confirmed some time ago has caused a good deal of undesirable comment. I think if an Institute came into being it would be possible for the Director of Education and the British Director of the Institute to work harmon*iously together, provided that the latter was carefully chosen. 6. The staadard of education is very much higher here than it used to be. Criticism is inevitable and the fact that some of the merchants send their sons abroad is not entirely because they have a low opinion of Bahrain schools. To be educated, even for a few terms, in Egypt or Syria is regarded locally as a distinction, the degree of education which the 4/-5/- young men receive is a secondary matter, what does matter to them is that they can claim to have been to school in Cairo, Beirut or Baghdad. Khalil Kanoo's son is getting free education in Cairo, if it was not free the boy would not have been sent there, yet Khalil Kanoo is one of the richest men in Bahrain. 7. We have had previous experience of an Education Committee in Bahrain and its activities form a depressing record. It would certainly create dif ficulties for many people and I do not think that His Highness would agree to give the local merchants, who would form the committee, any control of school affairs. 8. Only one school and the hostel are not the property of the Government and as soon as possible we propose to build new schools, but at present there are other public works on hand which are more urgently needed and which will take time to complete. During the last few years the Government has bought houses or put up buildings to ^nrtrin several schools. 9. I entirely agree with Highwood's remarks about the Egyptians. His Highness and Shaikh Abdulla would like to get rid of all of them but we find it impossible to obtain suitable substitutes. Here they are not so entirely in control of the schools as they are in Kuwait. We have several local headmasters and we employ Syrians as well as Egyptians. 10. In the second report Highwood deals more in detail with the schools. He suggests that an English man should spend an hour or two giving lessons in- 5 - English in the Secondary school. I know of nobody in Bahrain with a suitable accent and sufficient education who could afford the time to do this work# What about Stobart or Andrew? We have on order equipment for a small laboratory. Highwood made a mistake about the headmaster, he is an Egyptian and by no means young. 11. I fully realise that it is 'not healthy n for older boys and younger boys to be together in one school. We have lately opened a Kindergarten school in Muharraq for small boys and we hope to do the same in Manama. 12. I agree with Highwood^ remarks about the Technical School. This school has always presented a difficult problem for reasons which I have frequently stated. Its cost is very high and it does not attract pupils who in order to attend it have to be paid allowances. After doing a year or two at the school the boys leave and obtain work outside. I will arrange for another discussion of the matter with a Bapco representative. The Company has on many occasions given valuable assistance to the school. 13. I have never known a boys* school where the boys were satisfied with what they were given to eat! 2 C.J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., I.C.S., H. B. M's political Agent, Bahrain.PPEOl -AL.
