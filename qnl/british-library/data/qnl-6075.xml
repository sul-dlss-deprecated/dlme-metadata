CONFIDENTIAL Kuwait Receipt \ Dated | KUWAIT CQNPIDE2TTIAL Your Reference Our Reference D.O/37 BURG-AN BITUME1T ARABIA 20th June, My dear Hickiribotham, I have received a letter from Mr* N*A* (Jass in reply to mineyin iwhich I enclosed a copy of your letter 567 -5/7 of k/G/lg. and its enclosure and of ny letter 5316 of 7th June to you, in it he discusses the question of Royalty and sand payments to H*H* the Shaikh* Our royalty to the Shaikh on the bitumen content is fixed by the Concession and, consequently, inviolate in so far as we are concerned. As regards the sand, the position is that we can utilize sand free for our own requirements but the consent of the Shaikh is required to allow the K.O.C. to dispose of sand to a third party, this consent has been obtained on the same terms as apply to the A.I.O.C., namely Rs.5/8 per 100 cu.ft. The payment made by the A.I.O.C. has become established by practice over a long period. Nevertheless it might perhaps be considered to be excessive for the purpose and in the circumstances contemplated under war conditions, so if you^should be of the opinion that the suggested payment to the Shaikh on account of sand is excessive under these conditions perhaps you would be prepared to take the matter up with His Highness?

I understand that the sum involved is Some where in the neighbourhood of £. 700 and I consider that it is not desir^ahle to take the matter up with His Highness and to risk fresh issues heing raised for so inconsiderable an amount. Should however His Majesty’s Forces place contracts involving large exports I shall he prepared again to consider the position. ^. r ours sine:' 'ely, L. D.

In view of this letter and cable received by 0C DDTV(3) Dett. MQL, forwarded to you unuer his DDWS/D/32 of 10.6.42, it seems desirable that you should signal Kuwait Oil Co. that the terms set forth in their letter No. 5295 of 30.5.42 sent to you with ny No. CI2B/316/62/K-2 of 3.6.42, are acceptable to Tenth Army and that production can start as soon as transport is available when also a contract will be entered into with K.U.O.C. As stated in my first mentio ned letter it now appears thau royalties payable to the Shaikh cannot be reduced. it is felt that the Kuwait Oil Co. who are activated by purely patriotic motives, m n y feel that their motives in this matter have not been clearly understood.

I fixed a price of 34 with Alghanim, on a sliding scale on tonnage delivered, taking the first 400 tons at his present rate of 28. I have no objection to getting tenders provided I don’t get any which force me to pay more than 34 maximum. Actually for quantities less than 1000 tons a month the average is less than 34. The RAF have offered me their 12 Dhows and I have accepted: so for their cargo I pay only for loading, which Duncan will arrange. I am reasonably satisfied with cue present arrangement, although I think the' Dhow price is high. The actual average rate was 32.8 but I gave A.34 so as to get plenty of Dhows: but if you think tenders will show a reduction I am all for it. I would not like to call for them, if they were all higher, even A’s. - nor wo .11 F.A. like iti I must keep the cost - all in cost - down as the asphalt is almost on its .economic limit now.

I have your letter of the 4th instant giving me reasons why you wish to withdraw from this Contract. I might say that you are the only Contractor with whom I have dealt with in this country, who has withdrawn from a Contract because it does not function quite smoothly. The reasons you give in para 5 were well-known to you at the time you signed the Contract. In fact, it was because of those reasons, and that you wished to control the dhows, that you signed the Contract. I am, of course, already fully aware of the objections of your brother, and know that because the Contract causes him more trouble than he feels inclined to take, he has issued an ultimatum to you to break the Contract so tha$ he may be relieved of that trouble. Altogether I find your action to be one which departs very widely from the generally accepted relations between contracting parties. With regard to para 6, you need not take any action in helping the War effort in view of the fact that what action you have taken hinders that War effort, and you may cease work from the time you receive this letter.

The latter together with the two approach roads is shaped rather like the letter 'Y', and there is a total length of about 3/Zf of a mile to be done, or possibly a trifle more. Mr.Scott is anxious for your cooperation and asked me to address you with a view to your putting the matter up to your Head Office in Basra and getting permission to dump on the side of the avenues in question two of your lorry loads of asphalt each week, for say 3 months or until sufficient asphalt has been collected to make the roadways. Mr.Scott then hopes to bring down an expert from Abadan to supervise the making of the roads in question in the early spring 1943« P.S. I understand from Mr.Scott that he has mentioned the matter to the P.A., but in case he has not done so I shall take an early opportunity of doing so also. The dunping of the lorry loads should of course not be on the roadway itself and should be at suitable intervals along one side so as not to make the place look untidy.

Dear Sir, Tne a no ant of asphalt delivered bv vou jciit at Basra for January is only 195 tons. This is far below the 1000 tons per month which you contracted to carry from Kuwait to Basra and is most disappoint ing. It shows that you are'not taking this contract seriously and cannot be regarded as a reliable Contractor.

This II.Q. has a contrac&lt;^foj?'the quarr dn^; of natural .isphalte at Bur^an. Kavnit , with the Kuwait Oil Co. Tliore are two subsidiary contracts, one for the transport of 1,000 tons per nonth of asphalte by road from Bureau - where it is quarried - to Shuwaih jetby, a distance of 30 miles; and the other for the transport of 1,000 tons per month by native craft from Shuwaih jetty' to Basra. The Contract rates are R. 8 /- per ton and Rs.34 per sudrom (100 cu.ft.) respective! tousuf and Sa’dun Jussim ArYnkab (Cvuioit iy. Both contracts are with of Basra and Kuwait. The use of A asphalte for roads, floors of buildings such as stores and Workshops in this area is increasing and demands for it have risen to 2,000 tons per month. Bifficulties have lately arisen with both contracts. These have been discussed with the P.A., Kuwait, but their solution is beyond the powers of th^Sll.u.; aild there appears to be no al ternative but t,o request you to arrange for these two movements. The Kuwait Oil Coy. can increase production to 2000 tons :er month, provided neces 8 resent time there are cu.ft. at Burgan awaiting transport. sary transport arrangements are made. At o 13,000 cu.ft. of asphalte at Shuwaih and :u Knpuiries mde by this H.Q. of the Oulf Trading Coy. indicate tliat this Company would probably undertake sea transport of 1,000 tons per month.

The Political Agent however doubts the ability of tiie contractor to carry more than 1000 tons per month by h.T. as no employs a sub-contractor and is in his hands.

You are probably aware that Kuwait Oil Company mined bitumen for the Army under contract which terminated in 1943. After that Army left approximately 43,000 cubic feet mined bitumen (about 1700 tons excluding sand) its property lying in Kuwait Oil Company stores area at Shuwaikh and at mine site Burgan. Jameson promised Sheikh to asphalt Kuwait roads for him and Scott wants Army bitumen for this purpose. He asked Army to give it to him free and they asked him to quote a price. He has now come to me asking our help to get bitumen for nothing. I told him it would have been better to come to me in first place but promised I would do what I could to help as Sheikh is very keen on having roads asphalted and I ac-cept Scotts statements that bitumen really valueless to Army as it would cost more than it is worth to move it and it was mined by Kuwait Oil Company for Army on favourable terms. In view of these considerations, and particularly as Sheikh has been very co-operative in allowing 1.7.T. facilities free, I shall, if you have no objection, address Or. H.Q Paiforce asking them to give up bitumen free or at nominal price to Company.

NOW L-UIG- AT SHtf AJIUI &amp; BUR^AN . ./ith reference to our conversation of the 1/(.th June and in reply to G-.11.(4. raiforce's telegram, we have the honour to request you to inform the Financial Adviser that the Kuwait Oil Company Ltd., off^r the sum of Ps.1000/- for the Tjurcliase of the stocks of asphalt mint d for the Army which are now lying on our land at Shuwaikh. The following points are pertinent in connection with this offer 1. Burgan asphalt consists of a sand/biturnen matrix, containing an average of 1 6 per cent bitumen by volume. This source of supply was exploited in 1942 because the demand for asphalt for roads and flooring far exceeded the supply available from other local sources. The scheme broke down because the military found it impossible to continue to supply their own transport and craft, and transx-&gt;ortation costs by other means were prohibitive. 2. We have undertaken a small programme of improvement to Kuwait Town roads and it is proposed as a coirr'encement to continue the mix-in-place surface from the Dasman road to the Safar. If the asphalt lying at Shuwaikh could be utilized free of charge for this purpose we estimate that the work can be carried out more cheaply than by using pure bitumen obtained from other sou ces, mixed with local sand. The estimated difference in cost approximates the offer now made. No offer is nade for the stocks at Burgan as the cost of transport ing them for use in Kuwait Town is such that cheaper alter native methods can be found, 3. The resumption of work at Shuwaikh when the Kuwait Sulphur Go. com ence operations will entail removal of trie stocks from the site they at present occupy on our land and the acceptance of the offer now made will relieve the Military Authorities of this additional obligation.

In addition H.H. tha Shaikh of Kuwait ***•*% will ehferga a royaiV on every ton of material sent out of tho com try. Tha approximate costs are 1C/- to W* pw ton for quarrying and s/0 par ton for royalties. lagardlxu; costs of quarlying tha Oil Coy suggest tha Arey Auditors audit these on behalf of military authorities end themselves. The dhaikh would appoint a roprassntativa to attend at tha quarry and check all amounts loaded on to lorri es. Eha^SheAkh To ascertain the bitumen content^ which is available, tests would be aadw from selected s«raplea every two days. To the above met be added costs of transport which will naturally be high. V THAS&amp;POliT - This is the big problem and is dealt uith before production. The site of quarry is et ?argon sov»e thirty miles south of Kuwait and tha asphalt must be transpo rted from there to Kuwait ana thence to Baara. a distance of 132 miles by land. 3 wethoda of traasoort Have bean investi gated - (&amp;} Animal transport to K%7 and thence by tea to BE. To carry this out for a production of say 50 tons per day, some 095 camels are required - each camel can carry 400 lbs and Journey Barren - Kuwait with loading and unloading would take about 36 nours. Probably cost would Uf £s. per camel per day or H*. 23,^ per toe « £ vVO per ton. fts. 2/- per day is the sin. cost and might be increased. This is fgntsstlo. The question of aea \riusport is difficult as both Poli tical Agent and *r# Scott (of X.O.C.) state that it is impo$ji*3te to hire native ships such as 9 booms 9 or bellams for sea transport. In aiiy case cost mould be high - about B*« 600/- a ship. The alternativs is to obtain barges from I.W.T. (b) l^otor transport from Bargan to K*T axel thence by aea to Bil. The difficulty again is sea transport. la addition if barges are available from I.fc.T. t there is the objection that ti» asphalt would 'cake' during ^ ,p ^w^ - w vw'i ^ &gt;«» v vw**.** the loumsy end wottM fo be Jug out \coJiMai ~ rfw&gt; CclA Ms* JL&gt;y n jiaokei ^ J^id 1 / ( ■ ^ /&lt;i» I X /vu /it i U/n/iJ &lt; rfui/wk-t') * KU)'T . imi tl u&gt;cul^ &lt;w)*- ^ f ( 6* £U*^ Jbc** uo&lt;_ at- 3 - *Z j . y No. 4 compressora 500 cub.ft. )\I0C cannot now supply- per mimite would be required.)can you now supply W®* Ho. 20 Air hoses 30 ft x f* )R.B. - Xhree of the compressors would be connected up and worked in parallel* One would be e standby.

One sample had been laid two years* The as| ncu.u i&gt;( ^ eri laid as quarried and had not been hested. The road, showed no sisn of wear although heavy pipe carrying lorries and •yuite°a fair number of lorries piss over it, neither was there any sign of melting from the sun. Heat of sun hardens this asphalt and does not melt it. It is considered that with slight heating a first class road surface could be obtained. The material is also ideal for road repairs i.e. patching etc. For repairs it can be made up into bricks or blocks with the externa) surfaces sanded. May the question of costs be taken up with the appropriate authority. Subject to the actual pruce being reasonable, it is recommended that the h.U.Ca offer in para (1; A* be accepted. From ~ara (2)(c) it will be seen that the question of M.T. is urgent. As far as I am concerned I am unable to produce the necessary transport. Until something definite is known it Is inpossjble to do anything further regarding production. &lt;£/- -e.'drgffah Wua Brigadier, CHIB? ENGINEER, Bases. V7I/K Copy to:- Po3itioal Agent. C.R.B.

Dear Sir, With reference to our letter dated 13/5/42 we have now received replies from our London Principals to the communication addressed to them and we have to inform you that we will undertake the mining of the Bitumen on the basis of recovering from you all charges incurred in the operation, including any Dues and Duties payable by this Company to the Shaikh or to any other person or institution in Kuwait. Administrative and indirect charges will be recovered by means of a percentage on the aggregate of the other costs. additional remuneration for their services, but for this reason we would exoect the right to review and revise this basis If we wished to do so on giving reasonable notice, say, 3 months• In our last letter we nuoted to you a figure of ah.15/-per ton, but as the main expenditure and payment will be in Rupees we now quote Ks.lO/- per ton as being our estimate of the approximate mining coat, this figure is exclusive of local Dues and Royalty payable to the Shaikh and the local authorities, which we estimate will amount to Ra.l/*/- per ton on an average sample of raw material, but this amount is dependent on the bitumen content. There may of course be other Dues and Duties to be charged of which we are unaware at the present time, but the total charges incurred according to our present estimate will amount to approximately Rs.11/9/- per ton of the raw material, to which we would propose to add 10% to cover administrative and Indirect charges. lie shall be grateful to be Informed as soon as possible whether this work is to be put in hand. Yours faithfully. Thus Kuwait Oil Company will ask no profit orContd. page 2 52*4. 30th May 1942. Mr.Abdulla Mulla Saleh, F.H.The Shaikh's Official Representative, KUWAIT. Dear Sir, We confirm our conversation of the 24th instant in which we informed you that the Company had been approached by the British Army Authorities in basrah in connection with their requirements of burgan bitumen. If this business eventuates the transportation will be handled by the Army and the material will be mined and delivered by the Company into their vehicles at Burgan. The Concession Agreement concluded with His Highness the Shaikh entitles the Company to win and sell bitumen but does not, however, entitle them to dispose of the sand which Is an integral part of the 'Burgan Bitumen deposit”. We there fore request the consent of ^is Flghness the Shaikh, to the Company undertaking this and shall he pleased to pay is Highness for the sand at the same rate as paid by the A.T.o.C. for taking sand from Kuwait. In accordance with Article 3 of the Concession Agreement payment on the net petroleum content (1*e.bitumen&gt; shall be either Royalty of Rupees 3 per ton of 2240 Ihs or the yearly payment of Rs.250,000 now paid to His Highness, whichever shall be the greater, no further payment in respect of Royalty Is therefore due unless sales of nett 'petroleum” exceed 83,333 tons during any concessional year. In accordance with Article 7 of the Concession Agreement the Company will pay to Kls Highness the shaikh, Annas 4 (four only) for each ton of 2240 Ihs of nett bitumen content. We propose that measurement of the material will be by volume (50 cu.ft.boxes) a daily check being made of the weight of one or two boxes chosen at random.duality check of email samples will be 'a e every two days by our Geological Department from which will be ascertained the percentage of bitumen d respectively. Payment on the sand ®°“tent on the results of these checks and will be at the rate of R8.5/8/- p®r 100 oueft.of sand. Should you wish to discuss any points arising out of this letter we shall he pleased to do so and we request His highness 1 agreement to the points rbiaed. Yours faithfully | (Sgd.)

In our letter 5295 of 30/5/42 to C.E.Bases we offered to supply this material, as it is required for the war effort, on a no profit basis in accordance with the wishes of our London Principals. The royalty on bitumen content payable by the Company to the Shaikh is laid down in our Concession Agreement and the dues on the sand, content are those custom— arily paid on sand exported from the State, they constitute fixed dues which will have to be paid. We are forwarding a copy of this correspondence to our Director in Abadan for his views on the points raised and It is of interest to note that a scheme for the production of Burgan bitumen for use on our roads within the State was postponed in early 1941 owing to curtailment of operations consequent on^war. In conclusion we would add that our aim in offering this material is solely to assist the war effort as much as possible with the limited resources at present at our disposal. 1.
