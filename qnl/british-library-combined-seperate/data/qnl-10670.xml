The first two sets of correspondence in the file (each relating to a single member of Agency staff) are preceded by a title sheet (f 3, f 12). A contents page at the front of the file (f 2) lists these two cases, giving the individual’s name and post held.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 217; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 1-216; these numbers are also written in pencil but are not circled.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence and papers, including confidential notes, relating to staff at the Political Agency in Kuwait (including the News Agent, Assistant Surgeon, and Head Clerk). Many of the papers relate to the recruitment, departure, and transfer of staff between British offices in the Persian Gulf, and are indicative of a general opinion amongst British officers that reliable and able staff are in short supply in the region. Many papers also discuss the pay of staff, and assessments of staff performance, skills (typewriting, proficiency in English, Persian and Arabic) and general demeanour. The file’s principal correspondents are: the Political Agent at Kuwait (most notably, Captain Stuart George Knox and Captain William Henry Irvine Shakespear); the First Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf (Captain L Birdwood).Much of the file’s correspondence relates to the sixteen-year career of Head Clerk Louis Michael D’Mello, and his movements between different British offices in the Gulf, including Kuwait, Mohammerah [Khorramshahr], and Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency, First Assistant Resident</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency, Assistant Surgeon</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency, Head Clerk</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Government personnel</topic></subject><subject><topic>Confidentiality (personal data)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00039d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00039d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
