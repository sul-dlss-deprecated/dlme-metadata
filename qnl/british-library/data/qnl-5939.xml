On the 12th Ordibehesht 1313 (3rd May 1939) and said Karuban applied for the above mentioned dhow to be transferred in the name of Muhammad, son of Ishmail. As, on examination of the papers of the said person, it was found that the particulars produced did not relate to the -^aru in question, but to ho.435 (Koweit) named '* MAT IRAN ^, which was not registered or numbered in the port register of the Southern Pleet, the man was trying to take advantage, in a fraudulent manner, or the provisional number 87, which was given to the first dhow, he was therefore told that he could use the dhow in Iranian waters (only) pending production of documents oi ownersiiip ana, provided that he should give a guarantor of good standing, -^s nobody offered to act as guarantor for him at Khurramshahr or Abadan, the dhow in question was interned, and the haruban went to hove it, and on the 6th Khurdad 1318 (28th hay 1939) the dhow, on production of the document of onwership, was registered / under —— ^ ■■■■ 2. under provisional iio• 120, and allowed to worn: in Iranian waters* In the circumstances, Y.h. will see that the ^aruban was responsible for the incident and he was in no way prosecuted in the matter.

Boat and Kuwaiti crew reiain at Lingah. The owner Ibrahim al \bdul Aziz al ’hitawwa of Kuwait says that the Sheikh of Debai where the cargo of Chinese silk was loaded in the boat for Catch handvi, has further information and issued manifests. The cargo belonged to ^araad bin Saleh al Humaidhi of Kuwait and it appears to me likely that the cargo was intended by the receiving merchant in Cutch Mandvi to be smuggled into India from Cutch Mandvi. 2.

On arrival opposite Dohat Khasab in Oman a Persian man-of-war went to the boat and took it to Lingah where the Kakhuda and the crew were imprisoned and the cargo confiscated on the ground that they were not sho rn in the manifest. I enclose herewith a letter received from the said merchant stating tkxfc the reason on account of which the Nakhuda, in order to save the boat from danger owing to strong wind, was compelled to sail by order of their agent. I request you to give the matter your kind consideration and report it to the competent authorities as early as possible because the Persian man-of-war has exceeded her liiaits 'and acted against the principle by seizing the boat in that place. I hope you will take the necessary action for releasing the boat and her cargo from the aggressors. I would be grateful if you would grant the merchant a letter so that he may take to the authorities before whom his presence is required in person as he wishes to go for the boat and to see his agent at ‘“'ebai with a view to get some evidence to strengthen his case.

The Boom went out of the creek after shipment of the cargo when a strong wind sprang up. As it was Friday and the office was closed he could not get a mani est for the cargo. In order to save the Boom from danger hy remaining atjQehai during the stormy .eather the agent ordered the Nakhuda to sail with the cargo for Gwadur where he intended to despatch the manifest to him. The Boom left with a manifest in which no cargo was shown hoping that he would receive a manifest on arrival at Gwadur. Then the Boom was at Dohat Khasah, Arab Coast, the Persian man-of-war came there and captured the Boom and took it to Lingah where the Nakhuda and the crew were imprisoned.

But if it was seized out side Iranian territorial waters I agree with you that protest will be desirable. If on the other hand seizure took place within three mile limit off Henjam as one report received by Consul Kerman wouia suggest, no protest can of course be maae. First step therefore seems to be to establish accurately position of dhow when seised. There are it the moment four conflicting reports on this. 2. From enquiries mace of Uinistry of Interior it seems certain that Ling ah is not in Kerman Consular District, as agreed by Iranian Government, but in yours. In any case I much doubt whether Lincoln would be given any facilities by local authorities except on instruction from Tehran and I am reluctant to approach Ministry for Foreign Affairs till we are more sure of our ground. In the circumstances I think best course would be for his interpreter/interpreter to go to Ling&amp;h as soon as possible and 1 aiii telegraphing instructions accordingly* This would not preclude request for facilities for Lincoln to go there later if circumstances seemed to warrant it. - LEYMOUR -The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to 1« His jja j esty»s Secretary of State for In^ ia 9 London. 2.

I forward, herewith, for your information further report referred to. ad. C.H.Lincoln, :Major, H.B.M. f s Consul. 5 ' / r v \Kuwait i dhow seized by th* Iranian Sloop 'BASR* near quoin Island (Salamah). Conaul * ^or your confidential information, I beg to report the following, which X heard from a reliable friend of mine who w&amp;e going to Muscat by the 8»8**BAftAliA'« 2* The dhow in question belongs to Yusuf K1 ]?ahad Al Marzooq of Kuwait, who has a branch at Karachi and whose agent at Diarah (Dubai) is Murahid Al ^Saimi. She was loaded with 120 gunny bags containing 4,200 pieces China silk with her manifest showing *Mil* cargo on board, intended for smuggling into British territory• The fact Is that the Nakhuda had instructions to land her cargo at a fishing Tillage called 'Charnah* near Karachi, where transport would await the dhow’s arrival and take the cargo into British territory and then the dhow would continue her voyage to Karachi, and, in order to satisfy the Customs Authoritea there, her manifest showed cargo on board as •Nil”. On her way near quoin Island (Salamah) the sloop *Babr' met her and thinking that the cargo was intended for Persian Gulf coast, she seized and brought her to Lingalw Usually these sloops when they cone acrese dhows, ask for their manifests, and if they are not satisfied with the contents thereof, then only they search the dhows to see if they have ary contraband goods. 3. There is some ulterior motive about this case. 4. The main point at issue is whether dhows leaving for India from the Trucial Coast generally have their manifests signed by the Residency Agent at Sharj ah, or does he issue any certificate ? If the reply is in the negative, I may add here that the Residency Agent is quite aware /mware of theae arrangament b, as tne Heaidenoy Agent’s (Mr. Abdul Raaak) olerk at Sharjah named Alii AX B’Saiai is his brother- in-law and a relation to Murshid Al B’^airai, the shipper and owner's agent at Dubai* Id. A.R.G. Bandar Abbas, 14th February 1937.Translation of a letter No.E/5/401 dated the 24th February 1937 from His Excellency the Kuler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, I beg to inform you that the SaabuJc celled ••Hibat a! Karim 1 *, No.478, belonging to Ibrahim bin Ahmad bin Ibrahim, which is engaged in carrying shingle from Kuwait to Abadan, was caught at usbeh on her return Journey from Abadan by the Iranian official who demanded from the Gambuk customs dues. The Haichuda told the ofiicial that he had no right to demand anything from a sailing craft carrying a Kuwaiti flag and papers but the official would not listen to him and kept some guams on the ooat. The boat was empty find nothing dutiable was in it to give cause to the official for complaint. I would be grateful if you would kindly give this case your favourable consideration and have it represented to the authorities concerned. Usual Ending.Particulars of the incident in tabulated form. (1) The Sanbuk was detained on or about 8th February 1937. (2) Seized at Qusbeh. (3) Name of vessel 'Hibat al Karim”. (4) Nationality of vessel Kuwaiti. (5) The boat was flying Kuwaiti flag. (6) Nationality papers carried. (7) Nakhu&amp;a auhaaad bin Husein, Iranian subject. Crew: - Khalaf bin Husein, Iranian subject. Shaban * Husein ' Yusuf B ihmad w Ali ^ Husein ” ^ Ko passenger on board. (8) No cargo carried. (9) Sailed from Kuwait about 3 months ago.Statement of Khalaf bln Husein one of the crew. Khalaf bin Husein an Irani and one of the crew who brought the nows about the detention of the Sanbuk states that about three months ago the Sanbuk left here with a cargo of Sand for ibadan. After discharging her cargo the Sanbuk returned to Subiyah where she again carried shingle for Abadan. As some of the crew had their families at qusbeh the Sanbuk went to that place in order to give a chance to the crew to see their families, on arrival there the Customs official came on board and detained the Sanbuk on the ground that it belonged to the Nakhuda who is an Iranian subject and not a Kuwaiti. The hakhuda protested and showed the registra tion papers of the boat to the official but he did not listen to him. The Hakhuda has given a security for Ts.600 as security for the boat pending settlement of the case.' • Lf v Political Agency, Kuwait. The March 1937. From, Captain G.S. &amp;e Gaury, M.C., political Agent, Kuwait. To, The Hon*1)16 the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Sushi re. Sir, I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter received hy me from the Euler, reporting the seizure Toy the Iranian Customs authorities at qusbeh of a Kuwaiti sailing hoat, which was engaged in carrying sand from Kuwait to Abadan. 2. I enclose in tabulated form the information , as reduii‘ed under instructions contained in your letter No.0/143 dated 29th *arch 1934. 3. From these particulars it will he seen that the boat, at the time of its seizure, was carrying its nationality papers to show that it was a I uwaiti owned and registered boat and was also flying its Kuwaiti flag although the JNakhu&amp;a and its crew were Iranian subjects. 4. I also enclose for information a copy of the statement of one of the crew who came back to Kuwait to give news of the boat’s detention to the Kuwaiti owner. He is returning to usbeh where the Nakhuda and remainder of the crew still are. 5. If you see no objection, may steps be taken to have the boat released and the amount of security refunded as the owner a Kuwaiti is being put to financial loss through the detention of his boat. 6.

These Proclamations are not likely to cause any difficulty even if the Iranians realised that they possessed these rights* 3. We have had two cases recently (vide correspondence connected /connected with my Printed letters J*o. 193-3 of the 12tn February 1937 f and No.252-3 of the 24th February 1937) of interference with Bubal dhows and a Kuwaiti dhow respectively, on the high Seas* by Dubai or any other Trucial Coast £&gt;haliens, and the Kuwait Proclamation was restricted to search in Kuwait, Indian and Iranian waters. The fact however that the Iranians mve a right of search of Muscat dnows on tne Hign Seas may give the Iranians some excuse to board vessels under the cover of verify ing whether the dhow is not a iiusoati one* 5. I think therefore that, subject to the views of the Government of India, we should now ask tne Sultan of Muscat to cancel the Proclamation of 1893 end substitute for it an authority confined to His Majesty’s Ships, and, to round matters up, ask the Shaikhs of Kuwai t and Bahrain to do likewise in respect of their Proclamations referred to in paragraph 2 above.

I discussed this case with Captain de Geary at Kuwait. Captain de Gaury explained tnat this case was a typical one. The Iranian Gorernment have forbidden Iranians to own dhows built in Kuwait, and presumably this order applies to dhows built anywhere on the Arab Coast. The idea behind this order is that the Iranians should build their own dhows. This, however, they can’t do. An Iranian, therefore, wishing to own a Kuwait built dhow, gets the dhow registered in Kuwait nominally as belonging to a Kuwait merchant. The dhow then flies the Kuwait flag but to all intents and purposes is an Iranian craft, since it is really owned by an Iranian and the Captain is Irai ian as are the crew. 2. If such dhows are seized by the Iranians, as in the present case, therefore, we are really on a bad wicket in protesting. Captain de Gaury will explain the position to the Shaikh and in future the reports from Kuwait or other posts on the Arab side of the seizure of any dhow should ment ion if the dhow does or does not come within this doubtful category. 3.

No. 11 16th Mar^v. 10^7 Sir With reference to my despatch No.101 of March 14th, I have the honour to report that I called on the Ministry M&amp; of Foreign Affairs to-day and handed to him the note respecting the arrest of the Kuwaiti dhow 'Furat*, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch above referred to. 2. After describing the incident to His Excellency, I pointed out that the action of the Iranian vessel appeared unjustifi able; I thought it well to add, as the Iranian authorities are no doubt aware of the fact, that it might well be that the dhow f s cargo was intended for smuggling purposes and that I had in fact heard that it had been hoped to smuggle the cargo into India. But even if this were so it provided no justification for the behaviour of the Iranian vessel. I added that these incidents, if continued, must inevitably lead to some really serious incident and loss of life, and that it was really important that proper instructions to prevent them should be given. 3. Rather to my surprise Monsieur Samiy did not contest the right of His Majesty’s Legation to make representations on behalf of the Arab rulers. He may however have been ignorant that this was the usual gambit for an Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and may well raise the point in his written reply. Heundertook to look into the matter at once and did not attempt, for the moment, any defence of the action of the Iranian vessel. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No.51, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No.22 and to His Maiesty’s / The Right Honourable Anthony Eden,MC. ,MP., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign OfficeMajesty^ Consul at Kerman NOoll# I have the honour to be with the highest respect Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (signed) H.J.Seymour*26th Apr 11, 1937 Copies tot India. 76* Bushire- 38,, Kerman 13 • F.Oo 168. No. 260/42/37 . Your Excellency will remember that I called on you on the 16th March laat (25th Esfand, 1315) and left with you a note respecting the arrest by an Imperial warship of the Kuwaiti dhow •’Furat*. In the fourth paragraph of that note 1 also invited Your Excellency’s attention to the fact that no reply had ever been received to Mr. Butler’s note No.428 of the 31st July 1936 (9th Mordad,1315), regarding an incident which took place on the night of the 14th May 1936 (24th Ordibehesht, 1315) when an Iranian Customs launch fired without warning on the Kuwaiti dhow •’Suhail' and seriously wounded one of the crew. 2. As I pointed out to Your Excellency, incidents of this nature cause a most unfortunate impression and arouse great resentment; and I made the request that these cases should receive urgent attention and that strict instructions should be issued that Iranian vessels should refrain from any interference with Arab dhows outside Iranian territorial waters. 3. As almost six weeks have now elapsed since I left this note with Your Excellency. I am venturing to send you this private letter to remind you that my Government regards these incidents as possessing both great importance and great urgency. A most serious impression will be caused unless they are rapidly and satisfactorily settled, and I would therefore express the strong hope that Your Excellency will be able to furnish me with a reply to my note at a very early date.

I have,.to inform you,with reference to your tele gram JSo.r/33 of the liith April concerning the seizure of a KO¥/eiti sambuq at usheh that the Head of the Third political Section at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently conveyed to me,through the Oriental secretary,the following account of the incident furnished by the Ministry of Finance. 2. On the 4th February a aambuq belonging to Ibrahim Koweiti and in charge of one Moharamad of cuebeh was seen to arrive at (usbeh without taking out the necessary papers either for passing through in transit or for staying in the port. At the order of the Khorrsmshahr customs authorities the Q-usbeh Customs instructed the Ifakhuda either to declare his boat for transit or for stay in port or to remove it from Iranian waters. The sarabuq quitted Iranian waters and nothing further occurred. 3. Although this version of the affair makes no mention of the boat having been drawn up on shore nor of the guarantee taicen from the pakhuda and reported by His Majesty's Vice-Consul at i-Jiorraraahatir,in his telegram j r o.lJ2 of the 6th April,to hove been aubseque tly cancelled,it appears to me to be plausible and to confirm the opinion which I expressed in my telegrstfa of the 9th April,that the action of the Iranian Customs was not without some justification. In view of this and of the fact that the boat was released,! do not propose to pursue the raatter further. 4.

Most of the file consists of copies of telegrams between the following British officers: the Political Resident, Bushire (also serving as British Consul-General); the British Consul, Kerman; the British Minister, Tehran. Other correspondents in the file include the following: the Political Agent, Kuwait; the British Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr; the Ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]; the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs.The majority of the file is concerned with a case involving a Kuwaiti sailing craft that was reportedly seized by an Iranian warship (an Imperial Iranian Navy ship referred to as HIMS
                           Babr) near Henjam [Henjān] on suspicion of smuggling, and towed to Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh]. Much of the correspondence between British officials is concerned with confirming whether or not the boat was outside Iranian territorial waters when it was seized.Another case relates to a Kuwaiti boat that was apparently seized by Iranian customs officials at Qusbeh (also referred to as Gusbah) [Qoşbeh-ye Manī‘āt, Khuzestan, Iran], on the Iranian side of the Shatt al Arab. The third and final case concerns a Kuwaiti dhow that was reportedly seized at Khorramshahr.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Kerman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qusbeh</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Detention</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
