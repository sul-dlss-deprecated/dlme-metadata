Reference to previous correspondence: Letter to from the Colonial Office of the X&gt;.37959/34. Sir, I am directed 'by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to transmit to you, to he laid ; 1 before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasur*y, a copy of a despatch from the Resident at Aden, submitting proposals for the provision of additional office accommodation in the Residency Office at Steamer Point, at an estimated cost of Rs. 13138. 2. The alterations in question are rendered necessary by the increase in the Political Staff of the Aden Protectorate, and it is clear that they are urgently required. The Protectorate Staff use the Residency without charge, and in the circumstances, the Secretary of State considers that it is reasonable that the expenditure involved should be charged to the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote, on the assumption that the Government of India will contribute THE SECRETARY, TREASURY.contribute one-third of the coat in accordance with the usual arrangeadivta• t. 3* I aa accordingly to invite their Lordships ’ approval of the eoioenditure involved, by the Beeide&amp;Ve proposals which can be met from sa^ngs* L. a a the Resident has asked fora telegraphic reply, I am to request that an early reply may be returned to this letter and that the plane enclosed in the Resident's despatch may be returned at the same time* 5* A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office. I am, dir, four most obedient servant, cJi;- ,L •' UOWF.LLCOPY , No# 256. Sir, I have the honour to bring to your notice the necessity for providing additional accommodation in the Residency Office at Steamer Point which has arisen from the recent increase in the Protectorate staff. I regret that I should find myself under the necessity of applying for funds for this purpose but I have been unable to devise an alternative satisfactory solution to the problem. 2. You will no doubt be aware that under present arrangements His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom has enjoyed the use of accommodation in the Residency Office which is a Government of India building, free of charge: this arrangement however has not been entirely satisfactory to either party for while the Political Secretary is well housed in a good room the Political Officer has been accommodated in a small room ten and a half feet square. On the other hand the congestion of the office staff of the Chief Commissioner has formed the subject of representations to the Government of Bombay (and latterly to the Government of India) for some years. The advent of the Frontier Officer and the Second Political Officer has rendered the position impossible for when they are in Ad^n there is nowhere for them to work except in the Political Secretary’s room, an arrangement Y/hich is extremely unsatisfactory to all concerned. 5. The question of the provision of funds for urgent public works of this nature received the attention of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in 1923 and I encloseenclose for convenience of reference copies of the relevant correspondence, drawing your attention more particularly to Sir John Shuckhurgh f s letter No, 45140/23 of the 2 2nd September in that year and to sir George Barstow*s letter from the Treasury No.S.21567 of the 25th September. 4. In 1925 a scheme of office reorganisation estimated at Rs.1*50&gt;000 was submitted to the Government of Bombay and was in due course approved by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury under the arrangements made in the letter referred to above. In May 1927 administrative approval to the works was given by the Government of Bombay but in March 1928 that Government intina ted its inability owing to the continued financial s tringency to provide funds in 1928-29 and postponed consideration until 1929-30. 5, In November 1931 I again addressed the Government of Bombay on the subject. The conditions had somewhat altered as the abolition of the Cantonment had freed buildings for civil use&gt; and&gt; although the new arrangements were not entirely suitable from an administrative point of view, I felt myself able to ask for approval to a modified scheme estimated to cost Rs,32,456, but the Government of Bombay declined to consider my proposal in view of the expected transfer of the control of Aden to the Government of India and the grave financial condition of the Bombay Presidency* A later attempt to procure the still more moderate sum of Rs.26,332 from the Government of India for the estimates of 1934-35 has proved equally fruitless. 6. The congestion which these proposals were Intended to relieve has been greatly aggravated by the arrival “of two new officers whose accommodation formed no part of the original schemes, and is now so acute that an immediate solution is imperative. I think it will be agreedagreed that provision of suitable office accommodation should properly he met from Imperial funds, particularly as the cost of the administration of the Protectorate will inevitably fall ultimately on this source, even after the transfer of responsibility for Aden itself to the Imperial Government. I have considered the question of estimating for a separate building for the Political Staff and thus making more room for the Government of India staff, but in view of the need for economy I am now proposing the addition of extra accommodation to the existing building which will be less expensive* The alterations I propose provide actually for a suitable room for the Chief Commissioner and Resident of a sufficient sise to enable meetings to be held there and for a room for the Passport Officer thus freeing other rooms for Political Staff. The remaining alterations allow for an extension of the Arabic Office (paid for from M.S. Votes) which is badly overcrowded* 7, I enclose detailed estimate and plans and trust that you will be able to approve this scheme and in view of the concurrence of the Treasury in the original scheme for a lakh and a half rupees, I hope Their Lordships will find themselves in a position to sanction the provision of the comparatively insignificant amount of Rs*13158/-** In view of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, I shall be grateful if I may receive a reply to this despatch by telegram and X shall then seek the formal authority of the Government of India for the proposed additions to their building.

Chatfield, Esquire, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govts of Bombay, Finance Department. Secretariat, Mahableshwar, 4th April,1923. © The Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department. Sir, I am directed to address you on the question of capital expenditure of an urgent nature at Aden. 2. The present state of uncertainty as regards the future of Aden is responsible for continued postponements of all schemes of capital expenditure however strongly urged, and however reasonable such demands appear to be on examina tion. His Excellency the Governor has had the advantage recently of discussing matters personally with the political Resident, and X am to offer the following suggestions as a way out of the present impasse. At present revenue and expenditure are classed as provincial or central under the Devolution Rules, but it is obviously difficult for either the Provincial or Central Government to undertake capital expenditure which might reasonably be undertaken if a continuation of the present arrangement were certain. I am to suggest, therefore, that expenditure of an urgent and non-recurring nature may be incurred by either the provincial or Central Government, according to its classification under the Devolution Rules, on the understanding that either Government will be recouped, if and when a transfer is effected, from the authority which will ultimately be held responsible for the administration of Aden. As examples of such emergent expenditure I am to suggest the construction ofof nurses 1 quarters at a cost of Rs. 74*0001 of certain Police 'buildings at Rs.1*24*000j and recent proposals submitted by the Political Department for improving the sanitary condition of Meyun and its surroundings on the island of Perim. I am to say that the Governor in Council presumes that* even if the final decision is to hand over Aden to the Home Government as an Imperial charge* the terms of the / transfer must be settled in consultation with the Government of India, and no difficulty should arise in giving effect to the understanding which I suggest. I am to suggest* further, that any expenditure which is at present of a Provincial or Central character, should be approved also by the Central or Provincial Government either of which may ultimately be saddled with the liability. The present situation is in the opinion of the Governor in Council highly detrimental to the administration of Aden* and should be ended at once. I have* etc.* (3gd.) G.E.

Sir I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter of the 30th May, 1928, No. P.2532, regarding the provision of a 'Frigidaire' for use in the Residency at Aden and to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatch from the Resident recommending the replacement of this machine by a more suitable model. 2. While it is regrettable that the machine should require replacement after a comparatively short period of service, it is considered that, in the circumstances, the Resident’s wishes in the matter should be met. I am accordingly to enquire whether the Government of India has any objection to the Resident’s proposals being approved and, if not, whether a moiety of the cost of installation of the neY/ machine will be refunded from Indian revenues in accordance with the arrangement under v/hich t the r -Residency is shared THE UNDER SECRETARY 0 ?

A O At ^ v : O i ! ^ ^ O |HE RESIDENCY, Aden, 13th July, 1932. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my predecessor Sir Stewart Symes's letter No. 171 dated 12th September 1928 and to state that the frigidaire which was installed at the Residency on 5th September 1928 at a cost of Rs. 1215/- has been almost continuously out of order during the past year and, in spite of frequent repairs which within a few months have cost over Rs. 140, it has ceased to be of practical use. During the last six months it has worked for only three weeks. This is due partly to the fact that no mechanical repairer in Aden really understands this type of machine. 2. The Residency is thus virtually without a refrigerator, and I request that I may be authorised to sell the 'Frigidaire” at present installed here for what it will fetch, and to purchase locally a British Thomson Huston machine at a cost of Rs. 850. This price will include installation. This machine carries a two year guarantee and has a resident agent in Aden who is capable of carrying out adjustments. I have etc., (Sgd.) B.R.
