Bruce provides details of how Sultan bin Sugger lost control of Rasselkhyma [Ra's al-Khaymah] and sought the protection of the Imam of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd], who took him to Shargah [Sharjah] and placed him in charge of the Joassmee [Āl Qāsimī] tribes there. Bruce gives his opinions on Sultan bin Sugger's character and provides details of his claim to the chieftainship of the Joasmees [Qawāsim] and his attempts to regain control of Rasselkhyma. Bruce expresses his hope that Sultan bin Sugger and the other pirate chiefs will abide by their agreements and will not cause the British to regret the confidence that has been placed on them. He concludes by reporting his arrival at Khen [Qeys] and his intention to await the return of Major General Sir William Grant Keir from Keshmi [Qeshm].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x00001a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
