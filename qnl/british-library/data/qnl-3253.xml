At the request of the Director of Military Intelligence, War Office, I submit an up-to-date report on the resources, administration, and general aspect of affairs in whither I went in 1897 on a political mission. ~ , r I hive in my report on the Mission to Seistan (compiled for the Government of Triflin'! fullv described the political situation and outlook. . , . „ , , r Political considerations and future policy are therefore only briefly touched on in, the f ° llo s '”“f P ^ i e d 8 ' descri p tion of the mountainous country to the west and gouth is embodied in this report. This is of considerable strategical importance in the defence of Seistan and had not previously been explored or surveyed. Leadino- points of interest on the approaches to Seistan from India across the intervening deserts of Baluchistan, are dealt with on the outward or southern journey, and ‘rheTnfOTnatio^o^routes^&amp;c! 1 ,Compiled while in Baluchistan, are being incorporated ' ‘'Tbettttd maps^aml plans^ to‘which ^special attention was given fully portray the leading features of the country and points of special interest referred to in the body of the r ®P^ t a tribule 0 f pra i se to Colonel Bell, V.C., and Captain the Hon. H. D. Napier, who preceded me over this ground. The accuracy of their reports, and in orma- tion therein contained, helped me very considerably. . . Captain McMahon, too, who found previous maps of the frontier misleading, very accurately describes Koh-i-Malik Siah and surrounding country ; his maps and survey by Mr. Tate, very clearly and accurately portray the geographical surroundings.

General Account of Journey Across the Baluchistan Desert. ■TO&gt; loft Ouetta on the 6th April 1897, in accordance with telegraphic instructions from the Foreign Department directing me to reach Seistan with the utmost expedition. My party S and escort included Hospital Assistant Abas Ah, Surveyor *S ar Bc „ KiV Sher Ali, clerk, Dafifadars Muhammad Azim Khan and Ghulam Haidar with 12'sowars 'of the Sind Horse, Jamadar Jhanda Khan, with 15 Rustomzai llaluch ev e. , mounted on trotting camels.

Here I was forced to halt for one day the local Sardars having intimated their desire to come in and salaam to me, as ah Kort a recent raid that 0 had been committed, the result of a long-standing feudal nnarrpl between the Rakshani and Zagar Mangal tribes. , . ;1 quarrel between^i tQ Dalbandin (122 miles) on the 15 h Apr From here two routes were open to me, a northern one, vid Ismail, IVIera! Jhuh, Manz 1 and Amtr Chah, and a southern vid Asa, Zeh, Isa-Tahir Mash-Kiga, and Amalaf Phe latter route, though somewhat longer, was chosen, as being the least known, and SeqU ^^Barn™ 0 too^nmognLing the^nec^essity of finding out the best routes, and having a complke reconnai s ’sance b and survey of those best suited for the deyelopment of our commercial interests in this sphere, requested me to proceed by this little k o mute unless some unforeseen obstacles arose to prevent my doing so. ^Sg Mbandin on the 17th April, having halted aaaytohiresoine ra camels to carry water before facing the desert, we reached kuudi (134 miles) miiI.ou “^^Thirthe first n secfio r n ll of the route, was over weird, arid and barren stretches of sandy desert unrelieved by a single interesting feature. Nothing but a vast expanse of sant y plaTn and sMtings, stretching away on afl sides, apparently without limit till lost in yellow fiery haze and mirage. It°can be dismissed in very few words, having no advantages whatever, strategical or otherwise, to recommend it. , n „ A Tni i (1 „x on Pushing forward from Kundi on the 24th April we reached Kirtaka (131 miles) on the 98th Amil having’ halted one day to explore the Amalat range. , , _ ThK, the second section of the route, is over a much better hoe, being hard pat most of the way ; water, too, is procurable at reasonable intervals and is of better quality than that met with on the first section of the route. strewn skirts Startino- a^ain next morning we zig-zagged along the rugged, boulder-stre n .1 of the hillsf crossing numerous broad scours, the outlets ot the drainage from e Miriawa, Racha, and Lar ranges. t j ont-v. AtmmI J Our frontier post Robat (47J miles from Kirtaka) was reached on 30th Ap . The intervening distance between Quetta and the Persian frontier, a distance of 5274 miles, was accomplished in 24 days, including five days’ halt, averaging — mi es per daJ Thls^wf over e^eptbnally 1 bad going for the greater part of the journey, and in excessive heat, with indifferent, not to say bad, water at long intervals, is a test ot what our native cavalry and heavily-laden camel corps can do at a pinch. The length of the marches varied, all distances from 12 to 43 miles^ being covered each day and I had not a sore back amongst the animals on reaching Seistan. Letters awaited me here from Sartip, Deputy Governor, and from Colonel . a ,I i 8 Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, with a copy of the order issued by the Governor-Generaf of Khorasan to the Hashmut-ul-Mulk, directing him to receive me with all honours and render me all the assistance that I might require during my stay in Seistan, &amp;c. The condition of the horses and transport on the completion of this exceedingly hot and rapid march necessitated a rest. Consequently a halt of a few days was made at Robat. During this period I was able to make a complete reconnaissance survey of the surrounding hills and valleys, which are ot considerable strategic importance affecting our trade routes and future policy towards Seistan. Leaving Robat again on 6th May, at 7 miles, we joined, and followed the main kafila route from Sarhad to Seistan and Western Afghanistan, by no means a well-supplied route in the all-important matter of water, which is only met with at long intervals. We reached Seistan, 94 miles, on the 9th May. This latter part of the journey to us appeared a regular highway, after the lonely deserts and plains we had crossed; travellers and traders are free to come and go unquestioned, no restrictions being imposed on them similar to those affecting our Seistan—Quetta routes, instituted by the adverse influence of the Muscovite under the cloak of plague. Incidents The journey at this season of the year, as may be supposed, was intensely hot, added tn route. to which was a scarcity of water, which, moreover, was neither suitable nor palatable for horses, much less human beings. Most of the old wells hail either fallen in or had been filled in by sand-drifts; the majority of them had been fouled beyond description by years of fcecal and other matter, which, saturating the ground in the vicinity of the wells, had percolated through, thus rendering the water positively dangerous for drinking purposes. Though little if at all inhabited, excepting by a few wild nomads, this, in former days, was a much frequented route, but, owing to the zulum of Sir Nauroz Khan and the predatory proclivities of the Reki and Dawani bad-mashes, it fell into disfavour.* It was reported on reaching the Perso-Baluch frontier that the Amir of Afghanistan meant to establish a post at Robat Pain on the site of the old Afghan Fort (vide Plan Ko. 3), about Ij miles south of our frontier post at Bala Robat. Up to the date of our departure from the country no steps had been taken in the matter, nor do I think there is any likelihood of such a step being put into execution. The surrounding hills near Robat and Ziarat-i-Malik-i-Siah abound in iron and copper ore ; lead, too, is reported to have been found here, and there are evidences of smeltings existing here in former days. The hillsides are plentifully covered wuth the bastard or wild rhubarb (rivas), the acrid juices and stalks of which are appreciated by the Baluchi. The assafcedita (king) plant abounds all over the hills. Kafilas come here annually and collect and dry large quantities w hich they import to India. On the Koh-i-Sultan range, to the east of Amir Chah, large collections are also made of the plant. Return We retraced our steps from Seistan as far as Saindak, from which place we returned journey. by a more northerly route, via Amir Chah, rations having been laid down on this route for the cavalry escort which I had purposed sending back at an early period, but did not do so eventually, consequent on the aspect of Seistan affairs. Our journey back was unmarked by any incidents other than those naturally consequent on rapid and long marches in varying temperature, and a paucity of water, at all times bad, often at distances of from 20 to 45 miles or more apart. Disadvan- From Saindak to Gat-i-Barot, vid Amir Chah, the country is very desert and ta^es of the waterless, and cannot be considered either a promising or practicable route, northern Up to the time of our leaving Baluchistan, no water had been found between Saindak and Amir Chah, although “Ido, 55 palwar of great fame, had worked hard for 6 months to sink w r ells at Drana Koh and Zeh, nor is there any between the long weary stretch from Amir Chah to Mizzil. On the other hand, as will be seen by a glance at Map KA. 1, water is found at reasonable intervals on the southern parallel route in this vicinity, excepting on the Siastarji plateau, where, in several spots, water is near the surface and could be easily obtained. With little difficulty, such as cleansing out and repairing existing wells, sinking a few new r ones, and above all, building pucca watering troughs to prevent pollution of water, * I shall again refer to this section of the route. Strategically it is a much better line of advance than that by Amir Chah.—B.-C.9 the great natural necessity of our existence over any trade route that it is contem^ated to popularize, a better and purer water supply could be guaranteed al r ° Ut&lt; The greater part of the route between the above-named places on the Amir Chah --j-jMj. a. stretches awav rLht up to and beyond the Helmand river; and all ^e year r oun d the country being‘subject to violent wind storms, it is not unnatural to expect that the enti e character of the country will still further undergo great changes. From Ismail an intermediate route runs south, between the northern route and the one we proceeded by, joining at Kundi (ride map.)

T would here state that I have pointed this out to Mr. Barnes, agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, as also to Lieutenant Webb-Ware, the P 0 ' 11 ^ 1 Chagai su-n-estinff at the same time the advisability of transferring the greater numb of the ievtel from°Amir Chah to Saindak and placing all under a strong crafty native, leaving but a small post at the former which requires but little guar mg. . , f U is in this verv vicinity that the Damini tribe cause such trouble and interfere with our trade blocking the route by perpetual raids and bolting into the fastnesses o Miriawa range. It will therefore be seen how important it is to have a strong post at S‘iindak to check the Damini, who dominate the entire western districts. . r From Saindak to the frontier, the most practicable route within British limits I think will be found to follow along the skirts of the hills as straight as the nature o ^^SnclTf^map' 1 ^! show the exact places, with their names where water is available all the year round (coloured in blue circles or crosses) along the whole routes traielled. or other rposes it is ever contemplated to construct a railway and link up Eastern Persia with Quetta, this must be the line of advance and no I think via Amir Chah if we wish to avoid a source of anxiety similar to that hml Russian administration have to combat in the section of her Trans-Caspian Railway bet 'TOs M linl a nms C through lofty sand dunes, from which the sand is always on the move under the influence of perpetual wind, and necessitates a considerable expenditure tt “s'S ussrw cm,-, -'i &lt;•■•'“ 3* recommendations made by me in my earlier letters to Mr. Barnes, a 0 cn ^ Governor-General, Baluchistan, had caused supply depots to be placed along the rou e at convenient centres.

Future trade prospects. Danger threatening onr com mercial prospects. Practica bility of routes. Many encouraging signs are manifest to betoken an increased appreciation of the opening 1 up of the Baluchistan—Seistan caravan route. The returns from February to October 1897, as seen in Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s report, give the total value of the exports and imports as over lakhs, and it is only fair to assume that these figures would possibly have been much higher but for the adverse influence exerted by Russian action in blocking the trade by causing the frontier to be closed on the plea of plague,” whereby traders were afraid to send out kafilas, and traffic practically came to a standstill. i u c 6 ^p 10iass ^ n an d Seistan kafila season opens in August, and several large caravans both tor Quetta, khorassan, Bam, and Jalk were inspected by me before starting from the country, bteps must be taken to protect the interests of traders and counteract ivussian mtngue, both m Khorassan and Seistan, if we are to ensure the rapid expansion ot tins trade, which may be said to be but in its infancy. There is a very large field open in tea alone, if the Indian tea planters and me. chants bestir themselves and wish to regain the trade with Central Asia, which was formerly in their hands some years ago. As regards the future prospects of a tea trade (provided it is green, which is pre erred all over Persia) there cannot be a doubt. Russia cannot supply the market: her tea is inferior, and it is said, possibly with a microbe of truth, that the bouquet of their tea is affected by the passage across the Caspian in petroleum steamers. Against the expansion of our trade on this side, the entire weight of Russian influence in Persia is now being exerted. How strong this is may be gathered from the events narrated in this report. The difficulties of the intervening route have been much exaggerated, as exemplified m r ?P ld retu ™ Jo^ney from Seistan, covering a distance of 579 miles with cavalry m — days. AJ1 along the return journey there was not wanting evidence of con tentment under the new rule, and, on enquiry, we were invariably informed that affairs were much more peaceable and settled, even in this short time since the acquisition of this territory by the Indo-Afghan Boundary Commission. The people appreciate and applaud the British Sirkar’s large expenditure for their well-being in opening up these routes.

During the stay of the Mission in Seistan over a lengthened period, I travelled every foot of the country which enabled my party to cement very friendly relations with the priests and people of the country. My repeated tours in all directions enable me to verify the information embodied m this report, which was chiefly extracted from the Revenue, Octroi, and State Records, to which I had access (surreptitiously) owing to the cordial and friendly relations which my profession enabled me to establish with the Sardars, officials, and others. It is not my intention here to explain from what source I gathered the information anent Russian aspirations, &amp;c., I simply confine myself to recording what came to my notice. . The remedies to be adopted to counter Russian designs I leave to abler heads than nune, yet I do not think a fatal blow would be struck to the well-being of our trade and prestige all over Persia, Baluchistan, and Afghanistan if we were to establish without loss of time a British agent in Seistan, and thus checkmate the not remote contino-ency of our rival forestalling us by making such an appointment. This alone would strengthen our hands and give confidence to British traders. The Sardars, priests, and people throughout the country have for years been well disposed towards the British Government, and are strongly in favour of coming under our suzeiainty in preference to that of our northern rival. This was frequently assured me and beautifully illustrated by the following expression: “ Sag-i-zard, biradar-i-shiyhal” (literally, the yellow dog and the jackal are of the same family), often repeated to us, and really meaning that the present Persian rulers are bad enough, but that the Russians would be no better. One of the head Mullahs of the country informed me secretly that “ beyond doubt the Russians had got hold of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah, and there was every probability of his secretly granting them concessions and allowing the Russians to occupy Khaf Biriand and Seistan. That when that day came they would no longer be Mahomedansthey all knew the Supreme Sarkar respected the Mahomedan religion and laws all over the world but they did not think the Russians would. That everyone throughout the kingdom knew in their hearts of the right and might of the English laws, &amp;c.” I cannot in all humility say what ought to be done, and merely repeat the above as things that may come to pass, feeling steadfast in the belief that if we neglect to maintain a preponderating influence in Seistan our northern rival will assuredlv become mistress of it. I he object of Russia’s recent activity in Khorassan has yet to be disclosed. Her political aspirations as regards Eastern Persia, particularly the fertile oasis of Seistan have been revealed to me during my stay in the country. With her rapidly increasing influence in Northern 1 ersia, the present official entente between Persia and Russia must be carefully watched. It is certainly prejudicial to our Imperial interest to permit anv further extension of Russian influence south, on this side, so near our Indian frontier at the only assailable point now open to our northern rival. The most important of these are the gigantic railway projects of linking up the Irans-Caspian Railway with a port on the Persian Gulf (Bandar Abas or Chahba) and the acquisition of Khorassan as far south and including Seistan, with a branch line running to it from Birjand. Some ambitious Muscovites hope that with the advance of time, and by mutual consent, this proposed extension may be linked up with our Baluchistan railway. ^ ^ ^ e 1 e .^ k e . ^ severe blow to our amour propre if Russian influence at the Tehran Court (which with the present Shah is very great, vide previous report at pa^e 79 A Reconnaissance through Persian-Baluchistan and Eastern Persia, 1893 and 1894 succeed, and her long-sought-for concessions be granted by the present Shah. The acquisition of Khorassan and ultimate occupation of Seistan by Russia is of no mean significance, yet it is to her trifling, in comparison to its importance to us. Such a concession would virtually damage our prestige, not only amongst tribes in the country,13 along the Afghan-Seistan frontier, but over the whole ^nArmy “Izzat-i-Daulat-i-Angrez,” now so firmly established in the hearts of the Indian A y and w r e Pe cannot lose sight of the fact that all Asiatics recognize that might alone is right. Strategical Notes. Havimv now approached Seistan from India over two routes, and having during my Approaches travels in 1893 andhsgt very carefully investigated the approaches from the coast I have no doubt in my mind as to the most suitable and practicable line of advance. For reasons previously given in a former report, having travelled the Chahbar—Geh—Bampur —Sarbad route almost to the confines of Seistan, the Bandar Abbas-Daolatabad Baft—Kerman route, and in part the Bandar Abbas— Regan—Nahima,bad—Nasratahad route I am forced to the conclusion that the Quetta—Nushki—Dalbandin No i Kondi—Amalaf—Saindak route at once commends itself as the easiest and most practicably route ^J^Yto^ush forTraorhlirup 0 ^ Indo-Baluchistan railway As'a^n alternative route, smaU well-equipped flying column, I would suggest the Amative Chahbar—Bahu Kalat—Irifishan—Magas—Kwash route which was trailed o\er y mv oarty from Magas onwards in 1894. . . , , T i r ~ J V Thl southern section of this route awaits reconnoitring, but I learn from native information it is frequently travelled over by kafilas, and is reported to be much less difficult than the route from Chahbar, via Geh and Bampur. Another great advan age not to be lost sight of, is that Chahbar is the best and most healthy port on the Persian Gulf.* Influential Tribal Chiefs with other interesting matter immediately CONNECTED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SEISTAN. An erroneous idea prevails that the tribal chiefs in Seistan are of “no account and none occupy a higher position than that of village Kad Khuda. „ , This has not been my experience. I will mention some of the leading Sardais on whose influence are dfependent the internal affairs and a ”YY country, and to whom I know for a fact (having perused the letters) the deputy Sartip^and his father, the Governor of Tabas and Seistan, appeal for a settlement o the frontier water distribution, tribal discontent, land revenues, raids, and other matters concerning ihe well-being of this isolated little territoiy. , ,, • To these Sardars is justly due a mead of praise from my pen ^ ^,1,1 hive assistance, at all times willingly rendered, and against official opposition, I should have had YYYfgy'Yo, of the country, I must not omit to state, rendered us valuable assistance, and by timely information on more than one occasion prevented what mig - of Sardar Lutuf Ali Khan, is the most influential I—a, Sarda Thil in fhf ea Nawar, he is a general adviser to the “ Deputy Sartip on matters of importance affecting tribal affairs, &amp;c. a He exercises considerable sway not only over .the Seistan Sarbandi and sub-sec of this tribe, but his influence extends over the Dammi and other small sub-tribes on Sarhaff plate^an . g great ^ v re spected, of undoubted ability, strength of character, and, as his name implies, courageous. It is stated that he did good service in the British cause with Sir Oliver St. John. „ . • This Sardar has lost his right arm, and the following account of the occurrence is &lt; fireside story in Baluch hearths : When a voung lad of 10 years, he fell backwards off a donkey; apparently he did not mind the fall, although it appears the humeral bone was fra ctured badly. * Thp one too which the Russians are desirous of possessing.—B.-C. v „ Noxe —The Russian Medical Officer who visited Seistan during my stay, and subsequent ^ ren amcu a —B.-C. (907) D14 His father, Lutaf Ali Khan, seeing that the arm was partly severed from the shoulder, cut off the entire arm and plunged the stump into boiling rogan which the people say, possibly with truth, prevents the wound going bad and hastens the healing process. The boy did not seem to feel the operation and did not even cry when the stump was put in the boiling rogan; hence his father re-christened him Purdil, i.e., stout hearted, courageous. Purdil Khan and some other members of his family were for some time patients of mine, he was much debilitated on his return from Tabas where he had been for four months with Ali Akbar Khan during troublesome times at the beginning of the year. He returned to Seistan in the early part of June and rendered me much valuable assistance. He states the climate of Seistan is much better than that at Tabas at this season of the year. This is at variance with the generally accepted idea as gathered from the records of other travellers on this side. Sardar Syed Khan, Xaroi, son of Sardar Sharif Khan, lives at Khwaja-Ahmad in the first Nawar. In 1888 Sharif Khan was invited to the Kabul Court, and was treated with much favour by Abdur Eahman, in return for the valuable assistance he had rendered to him (Abdur Rahman) when on his flight from Kabul. Abdur Rahman, it is said, gave the Sardar 4,000 Kabuli rupees, and 1,200 for his son as annual stipends, and asked Sharif Khan to remain with him at Kabul, which the Sardar did, the governorship meanwhile being bestowed on the elder son, Syed Khan, who had remained at Khal-i-Fath. On the death of Sharif Khan, at Kabul, the Amir sent for Syed Khan, who was also treated with favour on arrival at the Kabul Court, and was offered the governorship of some out-of-the-way place near Kafristan, it being a policy of Amir Abdur Rahman never to bestow any hereditary appointment in order to possess himself of proprietary rights, and stifle local tribal influence which might be an opposing factor in his admin istration on the frontier, Syed Khan acceded to the Amir’s request, and accepted money from him for the transport of his family to his new appointment; but on return to Khal-i-Fath he simply transported the lot, bag and baggage, into Seistan, preferring to remain near his own people rather than at the other side of Afghanistan in a doubtful appointment. It must be remembered that Syed Khan’s sister had been married some years pre viously to Ali Akbar Khan, who was, before his father’s (Mir Alum Khan) death, Sartip of Seistan ; consequently he claimed a refuge in Seistan from his own brother-in-law. Ali Akbar treated Syed Khan favourably and gave him some lands and the administration of villages at Khwaja-Ahmad, making him adviser also to the young deputy Sartip, and his mother before proceeding to Tabas to take over the governorship there. This trust was duly carried out till Birjand influence ousted him. Syed Khan is a middle-aged, active man. He was summoned to Tabas soon after my arrival in Seistan, to relieve Sardar Purdil Khan; consequently I did not see as much of him as I should have wished. What I did see I liked : his frank and pleasing manner, and voluntary information on matters then affecting British interests, could not fail to appeal to me. He has some 200 footmen and a few sowars; some of my men being of the same tribe we had a welcome amongst them. Muhammad Ali Khan, the young brother of Syed Kban, who had been in Kabul with his father, awaited some time the return of his brother, Syed Khan; but hearing he had taken refuge in Seistan, Ali Khan fled also. He then came to Peshawar, vid Jalalabad, where it is reported he was kindly treated by the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Merk ; but being unable to secure any appointment or political pension he returned to Persia homeless, and proceeded to Kerman, On application to the Persian authorities he was given the governorship of Ladis by the Firman-Firmaf, at Kerman, and is now established there. Sardar Khan Jehan Sanjarani, son of Sardar Ibrahim Khan, late Governor of Chakansur, lives at Saidak, in the 7th Kawar, beyond the Rud-i-Parian. Ibrahim Khan held Chakansur when Amir Abdur Rahman ascended the Kabul throne ; but on his death the Amir did not, as is his custom, allow the father’s rights to the son, Khan Jehan. Khan Jehan fled into Seistan, and was offered land, which he at first refused. He came thence to Quetta, and was treated as a hostage for some time there by Sir R. Sandeman. He received a khillat from the agent to the Governor- General, Baluchistan ; but no political pension being sanctioned for him by the British Sirkar he returned to Seistan. Sardar Ali Khan Sajironi, pf Pulgi (sinpe deceased), at that time represented to15 Alum Khan, Governor of Ghain, that the Taoki tribes, who had always been under the auspices of the Sanjarani tribe in Seistan, were now without a Sardar since the death of Sardar Khan Jehan’s father, who had settled in Afghan territory at Chakansur; that now, misfortune having driven his son into Seistan, he might as well be considered Sardar of the Seistan Taokis. Sardar Ali Khan being an influential chief at the time, the authorities accepted his representations, and Khan Jehan, who was known to be a shrewd, strong chief, with much influence amongst his clan on the Chakansur side, was given lands at Siadak, in the 7th Nawar, on the understanding that one-fourth Government revenue was allowed him as a Jagir. We stayed three days with Khan Jehan, who treated us with the greatest courtesy and hospitality. He supplied me with horses and donkeys, which saved us many a hot mile’s tramp on the return journey, for we had to travel on foot in those parts owing to the swollen state of the Rud-i-Parian (an offshoot of the Helmand river), .which is unfordable at this season, and can only be crossed on tutins (reed boats). The first glance shows Khan Jehan to be an independent, resolute, and indomitable character: one who cannot but inspire respect. He gave me a lengthy account of his career and of his visit 14 years ago to the late Sir R. Sandeman at Quetta. By dint of hard work the tribe have reclaimed a good deal of jungle land, and established several villages in those parts. Khan Jehan boldly told me in front of a Persian official a that he was a zamindar now and not in receipt of any Government allowance; the paltry one-fourth Government revenue share which accrues to him is but poor reward for his hard labour and what he has done to cultivate and reclaim those jungle lands, still, as he had fixed his abode now here, and the Persians having given him an asylum, he was not faithless to his salt, but wherever he and his tribe were they felt warmly attached to the British Sirkar, and there is, naturally, a common bond of union between them and their kinsmen, the Sanjarani of Chagi and Dalbandin, who are under the supreme Sirkar.” Sardar Khan Jehan was united in marriage while I was in Seistan, on the 1st October 1897, to a sister of Sardar Syed Khan {i.e., a younger sister of the Deputy Sartip’s mother), the band-o-bast being that Sardar Khan Jehan was to give a young daughter of his, by another wife, to Syed Khan’s son, on the latters return from Tabas, where he was at the time with Ali Akbar. Khan Jehan is an uncle of Sarlar Ali Khan, of Chagi, who, from what I saw of him at Dalbandin, is but a miserable specimen, and cannot be expected to exercise either influence or moral force in the administration of Chagai. The Persian policy with regard to these Afghan refugees is to assist and settle them along the frontiers of Khorassan and Seistan. Such refugees as Sardar Khan Jehan and Syed Khan Naroi are the only safeguards against Afghans raiding the weak and easily intimidated Parsiban, which for years previously had been the case. Since the above-noted Sardars have been established in Seistan, it is a well-known fact that there are 100 per cent, less raids in the country, and it is said that through the Sanjarani and Karoi tribes the Persian Government have not only made substantial increase in her revenues, but have made a wall of peace between Afghanistan and Seistan, as the transborder Afghan-Baluch will not raid his kinsman, the Sejstan-Baluch. The Baluch chiefs repeatedly pointed out to me the neglect of the British Govern- Treatment ment to show any favour to Seistan or Afghan-Baluch refugees. of refugees Sardars Khan Jehan, Purdil Khan, Syed Khan, and Muhammad Ali Khan, ^ particularly brought this to my notice in their own case, and also in the case of Taj meut Muhammad Khan Sarbandi, who, on escape from Tehran, came to Seistan to say a last farewell to his kinsmen, and on being pursued by Mir Alum Khan fled to Kandahar, where it is said he did hard service with Sir Oliver St. John, and in compensation but a small subsidiary allowance was allotted to him, when in Quetta, and on his death his widow and children had to return to Seistan penniless, and are now living on the bounty of Sardar Purdil Khan. One other man of importance is Mir Abas of Iskil. On the father’s side he comes Seistan of an ancient Arab family, on the mother’s a Baluch chieftain’s daughter. _ coUeetor His family have enjoyed remission of Government lands in several villages by L( H - hereditary rights for many years, since Jahangir Khan’s time it is stated. He holds the contract for octroi in Seistan and also trades. He has steadily improved his position and wealth, and the officials are somewhat jealous of his well-being and influence with the priests and people. Being a clever, sharp, and straightforward man, and having sufficient interest in the country to support him, he has given the authorities no opportunity to encroach on his interests ; he bears no kindly feeling towards the Parsiban officials.16 Feeling of the people. It may be said of Mir Abas, “ laugh and grow fat he is a young man of 40 years, and always wears a genial frank smile of contentment; he rendered the Mission through out our stay in Seistan some genuine service, and he is most loyally disposed to the British Government. It is satisfactory to note that the chiefs and tribes inhabiting Seistan and the intervening districts are almost without exception loyal to the British; this I also found to be the case in southern Perso-Baluchistan and Sarkad on my former tour. Baluchistan and Afghanistan are always spoken of as Mal-i-Angrez, and many are of opinion we have some lien on Seistan by arrangement with the Shah. None but the higher officials of Birjand, Tabas, and Seistan, knew or cared anything of the plague, but all, of high and low degree, were cognisant of the fact that the trade routes had been closed at the instigation of Russia ; the possibility of the Russians now annexing Khorassan and Seistan, as they had encroached on Northern Persia, was openly discussed on many occasions by the officials, priests and more enlightened people. As far as my experience goes, the people of Southern Khorassan and Seistan are averse to the probable presence of Russia, and her action in causing the routes to be closed has not increased her popularity. The fact of our presence and prolonged stay in the country gave rise to the rumour which spread far and near throughout Khorassan and Afghanistan, that the British Sirkar had caused the routes to be opened again in face of Russian influence. In conversation with the officials, clergy and more educated, feelers were repeatedly thrown out as to the possibility of the purchase and incorporation of Seistan with British- Baluchistan, which remote contingency seems to be the great desire of all excepting “ Birjandi &amp; Co.” ® 1 frankly told all that the British Government were not desirous of acquiring or adding any more to her already large possessions; her desire was to protect her own, open up the avenues of commerce to all nations, and live in peace with her neighbours. ’17 CHAPTER III. Resources and Population of Seistan, 1897. The geological division into nawars is shown in colours on Map No. II To te!^£ZBS!3S£Z£: i.... .f character. Neither contentment nor happiness is expressed in the countenance of the tioD • LahUants and the general cry throughout the country is one of dissatisfaction. The officforKad Khuda (head of village or buluk, district) is bought and sold nf Nau-roz according to the time-honoured custom of Iran. , x . . ^ Not infrequently one man is Kad Khuda of several villages at a distance and outside his own nawar^ where he has no interests other than screwing all he can out of the un- fortnnatemh^bitants. truck at once with the difference between the prosperity of a Kad Khuda’s own village where he and his people reside and his interests are fixed and those \ wh^re he has hut an annual lease, and so aims at making all he can dunn^ temporary proprietorship, thereby impoverishing both the inhabitants and the lan , which next P yeir, is doubtless knocked down to some equally rapacious rival bidder. h The following show the present Tahsildars and administrators of law and order (sic) in each of the seven nawars. 1st Nawar, Mohammed Hassan Khan ; he is also Tahsildar of several villages in the 4th Nawar. 2nd Nawar, Nirza Ismail; also has interest in several villages in the 3rd and 5th Nawars. 3rd Nawar, Mir Darvesh, who has also interests in the villages in 7th Nawar. 4th Nawar, Mirza Mohammed Azim, having interests in some villages in 5th Nawar. 5th Nawar, Ali Akhar, who has officials under him in several villages in the 3rd and 6th Nawars. 6th and 7th Nawars, the leading Sardars, viz., Purdal Khan, Syed Khan, Khan Jehan, and Syed Ali Agha, are the chief administrators in these nawars. Reference to village resources will show the lahuildars. In the attached compilation are given all the villages and permanentl^occupied Fertile spots.

It became more or less a ruin until such time as his son, Syed Khan, returned to Seistan on the death of his father at Kabul. It was restored as an hereditary property to Syed Khan in 1886. Sardar Syed Khan mostly resides here now with his first wife and part of his people; his second wife and party reside in Daulatabad in 7th Nawar. This was the first village in Seistan established by the Narozai (Baluch) tribe on their coming to the country from the Nehro Hills, and was so called after their Sardar. There are three villages (seh—three) close together. A little way off are the ruins of old Khudang, this town, like many others in these parts, is said to have been destroyed by floods. The jowari and palaz crops of these villages are famous. This is now but a small village situated to the north-west of ancient Zahidan. The area of Zahidan ruins show it to have been an extensive city in bygone days, and much larger than any of the ancient ruins of other cities that extend along a line north and south from Jalalabad to Shahristan. A mistaken idea prevails that the ruins of Zahidau extends in a strip of 14 miles in length, these ruins are quite distinct and have no connection with those of Jalalabad, Rindan, Gazbar, Boli, ancient Iskil, and Kasimabad which all run in a strip nortn of Zahidan. Zahidan, according to ancient records, occupied an area of 2^ farsucks only, each of the above named ruins had a separate existence from the ancient capital of Zarblistan, being as it were suburbs of Zahidan. The ancient city of Dahshakh was also a separate town. Zahidan, which is represented as being the ancient capital of Zarblistan or Seistan (modern name), was a city of great fame in the time of Malik Qutab-ud-din Kyani. It was devastated and destroyed by Furrokh Shah son of Tamur. To the north and north-east of the ruins are huge sand ridges and the ruins are gradually being obliterated by the banked up sand carried along by the withering and howling north-west wind which sweeps over the open plains. The Ziariat Shaik Mahamad or Pir-i-Chihal and the Darwazai Baktiari are now the only points of interest to the numerous pilgrims who visit Zahidan to honour the mains of the departed Shaik. Five miles north of Zahidan ruins and a mile east of Kasim Abad ruins stands the ancient and conspicuous tower called Mil-i-Tapa, or Mil-i-Kasim Abad, a little to the east of the ancient ruins of Killah-i-Tapa. This monumental relic of man’s handiwork which has stood the test of time so well is altogether outside the wall of ancient Zahidan and has been erroneously styled Mil-i-Zahitlan. The ancient Kayaui manuscripts show this tower to have been part of a large masjid to wnich was attached a large college (Madrasah) for the education of Mullas. The Namaz-i-Subh and Namaz-i-Mazhrib (morning and evening prayers) were chanted from the top of the tower summoning the faithful to pray.Remarks. s« 3 (t ^3 bC.* rA GC * r2 ° § *3 A AH 80 60 600 600 10 360 160 160 80 250 60 260 260 18 10 48 22 » • 18 10 40 10 37 35 210 150 120 125 100 1,200 250 50 300 240 400 460 10 19 60 17 10 15 10 20 58 This village is mostly occupied by Rinds. A large and well-to-do village. All supplies available. M-n? Abas, the headman of this village and Kasinabad, holds contract for octroi in Seistau. He rendered the Mission, throughout our stay in the country, valuable service, and is most loyally disposed to the British Sirkar. To the south west are the ruins of old Iskil. There is here a notable female shrine, to which no male is permitted to enter. After a liberal donation and some pressure I gained admittance, and was told the legend connected with the Bibi-Dost. Over a century ago the Kad Khuda of this village committed a diabolic al rape, hence he was called Shaitan (devil). Since which the village name. The Kad-Khuda Asad-Ullah and his brother, Agabai, own half Kad Khuda rights, the other half belongs to Mir Auyat. This is a large well-to-do village. There are three water channels and considerable cultivation on the east and west. It is a terribly wind-stricken place, and blew a regular hurricane during our visit (18th June 1897). Ihe surrounding country here presents a weird scene: north and south from Gazbar to Zahidan, is a desolate stretch of glaring, white, wind-swept plain, with equally glaring quaint ruins scattered around. To the north-west ol present village are the ruins of Killah-i-Bolai, with ancient Bolai rums m a line south of it. The old fort and city has many good buildings, now m ruins, and covers a considerable area. _ . Is the northernmost village of importance in Seistan proper. During the inundated season there is here a ferry, but on the subsidence of the waters a well-beaten track crosses the Hamoon, leading to Lash-Juwain, over which there is much traffic. Kafilas to and from Sarhad, Jalk, Seistan, Lash, and Tabas, halt here before crossing the desert to Peshawarian. The village is a collection of usual buildings, situated on a slightly elevated ground. The Hamoon waters reached within 600 yards of it during my visit (17th June 1897). As the name implies there is much tamarisk (guz) about, a regular jungle of it stretching away east over the swampy 7th Nawar, holding many fine sounders of khuk (pig). A small caravansari has been recently built here to protect the kafilas from the perpetual winds (north-west), which sweep over the Hamoou in hot season and the barren plain in winter. In a temperature like the present (103 degrees) a stroner gale blew from noon, subsiding towards evening. A kafila, with 40 bales of cattle hides, en route to Mashad, halted here during my stay. Supplies, except for small parties, scant. The Kad Khuda, Ali Muiad, unreliable and a bit of an obstructionist. A large village. Most of the country trade on the north-east belongs to Bunjar. The Mujtahid (high priest) lives here. He commands about half of the country in all religious matters. All supplies available here; good grapes cultivated; crops superior; inhabitants a more contented com munity than in many other places. Being under the authority of the chief priest they are less squeezed. Another neat and prosperous village; glebe lands; small well-preserved fort to the west; good arable land, well cultivated, crops clean and rich. A son of Haji owns this village. This snug little village is “ muft” the property of Haji Mohamed Ismail, who resides there when not at Nasratabad. Taghazi, or Tak-i-Ghazi (i.e., place of fanatics), which was the name of the place before Tamur’s invasion, was one of the old defences of beistan. ^ This village is “muft” glebe lands, the property of Mujtahid Haji Muhammad Ismail. Under the Haji administration, in comparison with other villages, it presents a snug paternal appearance.

After the devastation of Zahidan by Furrok Shah, on the re-establishing of Kyani dynasty, Kachian was the capital of Kyani governors up to the time of Malik Barham Khan. Some 60 years ago it was destroyed by Hamoou incroachment. Waters were within l£ miles of it this year, and on two occasions only, it is stated, has the flood come so near since the above noted flooding. There is good grazing all along north by Hamoon bank : jowari and palaz crops were well forward. There is a lot of good cultivable land in vicinity untilled. Darwesh Khan Kayani is second son of Malik Hamza Khan {vide genealogical table attached). • These two villages are also “ mujt,” and consequently prosperous. There is here also a ferry meeting the road leading to Lash, on the distant bank of the Hamoon. To the south and west is a collection of ruins of ancient Allahabad and other villages. Here also we were reminded of the Lamentations of Jermiah as^in other parts of the country. Inhabitants in bitterness com plain that more than the stipulated half of the products are abstracted from them by the officials, and what is left them is not in any way sufficient for their own wants, or equivalent to the seed sown, they pray that British Government may take the country and relieve them of the grinding yoke they suffer under. Inhabitants mostly Naroi Baluch. Since the Yazad-i-Jard dynasty in Seistan this has been an ancient city. Though now a comparatively insignificant town, still it is one of the import commercial entrepSts as the kafila routes radiate from here, via Kiliah-Nao or Burj-i-Alam Khan to all quarters. The Kad Khuda Abas Khan is a Jamalzai Baluch, a tribe famous amongst their fellow-tribes for deceitful ness. Abas Khan, “ the one-eyed,” is true to his breeding, and gave us considerable trouble during a prolonged stay in the vicinity. The town is built in a circular form on an elevated site, on the south-west are the remains of old fort, most of the houses are built in a straggling order on the east, beneath which the old canal formerly flowed. The centre is an open space between the ridge on which stands the fort, and that on which are the majority of the habitations. The fort is now in ruins, outside and a little south is another collection of houses. Quarter-mile due west runs a high ridge, on the north and south points of which are the remains of ancient fire temples, hence the name of the ridge, viz,, Atashgah. Ancient graveyards are situated on the top of the south-eastermost ridge by the fire temple. Present inhabitants are very superstitious and assert that voices and cries are frequently heard proceeding from these ruins at night and early morning, and many legends are recorded of former inhabitants. The present bed of the river, or canal, now styled the Rud-i-Seistan, has for past two years been diverted and flows some 300 yards S.S.E. of the town. During our stay it was 40 yards wide and stirrap deep, always fordable at this period of year, it becomes unfordable in March when the Helmand rises and has then to be crossed in tutins (reed boats). To the south, stretching away west beyond Warms 1, run lofty pebbly strewn clay ridges the silted up deposit from former Hamoon which ancient records showed to have existed in bye-gone days instead of the inundation which now floods the north, and almost encircles Seistan, practically turning it almost into an island for the greater part of the year. There is a considerable area of good land along the basin north of the ridges, grazing plentiful, water at all times abundant. This stretch is undoubtedly the most healthy site for military camp, or permanent occupation by troops, of any part of the country. My party were in camp here for over a month, while I travelled over the country, and both the humane and equine members improved wonderfully after a residence in Nasrabad, the capital, which is at all times of the year detri mental to health. •suuuqq ° 1 B 1 S P '°N # SJUA\J12l|3{ Ul UUJjS jo uoponp -ojd iunnuy •enimputAV •siqiuuq25 &lt;D a a O g 'S 2 o a-§ eS a E s « bD^; jd 'a CQ O ^ 42 25 30 26 16 660 600 18 60 300 80 50 300 170 *100 15 20 1,200 15 3 26 7 Remarks. A large village chiefly occupied by Shahraki tribe. A large village with considerable amount of good arable and pastoral land well irrigated and not infrequently almost surrounded by overflow from the main canal called Rud-i-Seistan, chiefly occupied by Shahraki tribe. Ruined. Hussainabad is situated close to the south of Nusratabad Fort. The Tahwildar is Mir Alum Turah, chief domestic servant of Deputy Sartip, a son of Mir Ali Beg, lately transferred to Tabas. The Russians have built a large house here, and established a Consulate ^since my departure from country, vide my report on Mission to Seistan I8y7. The Mujtahid Haji Muhammad Ismail lives here, but owns as glebe lands the village of Piran {vide Map No. 51), &amp;c. Although styled the “ Shahr” there is no city or village. It consists of the fort onlv, with some wretched shops in small bazaar {vide sketch). The “ Arg ” is occupied by the Sartip. or Deputy Governor, his mother, and minor officials. The Naibul Hakmat lives in a very unpretentious house on the right of the main street leading to the bazaar, the remainder of the interior is a crowded mass of small-domed shaped hovels, occupied by a mob of ill- clad. undisciplined, opium-sodden, miserable soldiers, who compare most unfavourably with the hardy, physically well developed soldiers whom ve saw when on tour with the Firman-Firma, and during a visit to Kerman in 1894. Attached is a ground plan of the fort which is of no importance as far as defence is concerned, and is rapidly falling into bad repair. A well-stocked walled-in garden is situated to the north, by which is the visitors caravansari. Water supply is from an irrigation canal on the east, where are other small gardens and a considerable amount of cultivation. There are 13 shops in the bazaar {vide plan of fort at No. 7), two of these are general shops and sell Russian goods. Here we procurred some inferior official paper, trays with painted pictures of the t zar and decolte dressed ladies, Russian tea, candles, sugar, and very inferior chintz, glass bowls, and stamp of Kalians, china teapots and other waie, handkerchiefs and leather I was careful to show the merchants of the country the difference between these and English and Indian goods, the superiority of which the^ were quick to recognize. There are stated to be 46 other houses in the fort, or Shahr, occupied by attendants, hangers-on, and their families. Garrison said to consist of 280 men, commanded by Yawar Muhammad Beg and two Sultans. I saw no guns here, but they may have been under going a condition of “ dry rot” in store. There are a few more soldieis scattered in various villages throughout the country besides which local irregulars, chiefly horsemen, are maintained by the Sardars, previous!} mentioned, and summoned when required. Each Sardar proceeds annually for a month or more to Tabbas. Both Sardars, Purdil Khan and Syed Khan, were the selected representatives during my stay at Seistan.^ The garrison are chiefly Ghainis from Birjand, and the regiment is supposed to serve here one year. The men are a mob of ill-clad, ill- disciplined, opium-sodden vicious crew. Not only here but throughout the entire country my escort of cavalry “Sind Horse” (Dera Jat Pathans) made a great impression, even in com parison with the Russian Cossacks who accompanied the Russian officers. This village is gradually being enveloped in sand, which is swept along by the blithering north-west wind over the barren stretch to the north of the village, and has already covered many of the houses on the north face. The crops, in the vicinity suffer in consequence and are half-buried in sand. G27 02 » **-&lt; rt O 0.3 .

One-half of Government revenue of village is allowed him by the Bashmat-ul-Malk and is all he now possesses. Amongst other old manuscripts he showed me the old Kyani title deeds (from former Persian Shahs) to Seistan lands. To the south, on the site of an old fort, is a primitive powder factory, from which is produced a fair sample of rough powder. The propnetor is an Afghan refugee, and his 15 assistants are Parsibans. Ihe Persian officials here reserve the right of making powder also by supplying the materials. About 100 kharwars is the annual output. The saltpetre only is made in summer, the powder being turned out in winter. One-tenth of the product is taken as tax. The powder is exported to Birjand Sarband and other parts. Rate of sale, about 1 seer per rupee. This is now a desolate place ; the extensive ruins of the old town are a mute testimony of its earlier importance. This village, too, 'is rapidly being buried in sand.^ A few years ago Old Jazinak was completely devastated by sand drifts, since which this village was established and already one-half of the village is now buiied in sand. Ruined. There is here a ferry. It is the terminus of arrival and departure from and to Seistan on the north, which is cut for greater part of the year by a broad expanse of water. No one can cross here without permission or Deputy Sartip. Anyone wishing to leave without official knowledge must proceed bv the more circuitous, round along south and thence north-west parallel with Hamoon and Palang Koh. The Birjand and Neh kafilas who came in August and September for grain travelled by this route. There are but a few wattled huts here now. The old fort and ruins of ancient Shahristan occupy a considerable area of ground on a commanding site by which runs the Rud-i-Seistah. , The former name of this village was Sharifabad. On the escape of l ag Mahomed Khan Sarbandi from Terhan when he came hence to Seistan, he was accorded a hearty welcome by the military and civil inhabitants of this village. Many of them also joined his retreat. Mir Alum Khan, the Governor, pursued him, and, on arrival here, destroyed the fort and punished the garrison and people for their demonstrative welcome of the fugitive. Subsequently the fort was partly restored, hence the present name, Killah-Nao. , x j The Rud-i-Seistan runs a little north of the village between it and Kimak, and during my first visit (6th July 1897) there was much waste of water and flooding, consequent on want of repairs to irrigation canals; whereas, further west to Warmal, water was not sufficient for area of culcivation. To the south is seen the remains of the old lagoon or Hamoon, called Sabz-i-Kim (Sabz, green; Kim, reed or rush). This Hamoon and Tarakum Canal, with other cultivated parts along the banks of Helman (now extinct) took off the surplus water from the Helmand in former days. The condition of affairs is now reversed, for, whereas'the Hamoon is now on the north it was formally on the south. ^ ^ j , The lofty clay ridges which stretch away S.S.M . in a well-defined broad line is the silted-up deposit brought down by the Helmand, and clearly maps out the course of the waters which reached as far west as they do now by the northern route. ,, ., r . ... . . It is stated to have flowed away via, Warmal beyond Mir Akhun, keeping south of Koh-i-Khwaja, possibly as now, to the skirts of the Koh-i-Palang, finally as now, reaching the Goad-i-Zarrah, through the Kud-i-Shelag. The elder present inhabitants state, and old manuscripts pro's e, that thei e was formerly very little water on the north, as it all flowed on the south. The physical features of country on the south are corroborative pi oof of this. The ridges and deposits of the old lake on the south are very much loftier and extensive than the deposit from the rivers entering on the north. It is recorded the Herat, Farrah, and Khash rivers formed a Hamoon on theRemarks. Lorth, but the extent of the delta of these rivers was nothing like so large LS ^^weU-Lfined 8 ridge on the north, which is not at all so high as those m the south, mark to some extent the previous condition, but, naturally, t ;xact geographical outline is masked by the present state of annual flooding. The rivers entering on the north and north-east naturally discharge ■heir waters along N.N.E. border of the Herat-i-h arrah-i-Khush Hamoon, ience the depositions from these streams would affect the northern basin mly, but it seems to me that such a condition m no way goes to prove hat in the more distant southern portion of the low-lying beistan theie did 3 xist a lake, in fact all historical records go to prove the contrary 4o- a in on the subsidence of the present waters (which takes place gradually’ from middle of August), the ancient and extensive ruins of A.swar-Shah-Kohlalk-Killa-Kakha, &amp;c., as also the raised plain to the north- sast on the kafila route from Gazban to Lash, which makes the limit of t Farrah Hamoon clearly demonstrate the non-existence of any northern Hamoon or lake As the above-named ruins stretch along on the north rio-ht round to south-west in the centre of the present Hamoon &amp; The ridges formed of depositions from the Helmand, which form a well- defined vast line on the south are also very much loftier than any of the depositions on the north, and we have been repeatedly informed that the old Hamoon floods on the south covered the dimensions previously noted, nearly reaching the southern end of Koh-i-Khwaj, but that this peculiar landmark was a part of the mainland, and not, as now, an isolated isle surrounded during flood time by an immense sheet of water. Killah-i-Nao is a fair-sized village nestling under a lofty hill on which are the remains of an old fort and other ruins. It is another important commercial emporium. There are here several well-to-do merchants. It is the point of arrival and departure of all kafilas on the south who travel vid Kala^Fath—Tarakun—Gumbaz-i-Shah Saindak (wVie Map No. 1) ; from the latter stage these to Jalk and Makran go south tna Mirjawa, while those fnr Onptta Peshin &amp;c., proceed east, via Amir Chah or Amalat. _ All supplies are available in Killah-i-Nao ; the area of cultivable land is larc-e • cliinate and situation are salubrious in comparison with other parts of “the country. The most favourable and healthy site for a camp or permanent occupation throughout the country is south of a line drawn from Nos. 66, 85, 109, 158 on Map No. 2. Killah-i-Kohna is the largest and the most important village on the south, and like Killah-i-Nao is an emporium of considerable importance; there are here also a number of merchants, vide page . Half of the revenue of this village is the property of Syed All Agha; he is a man of considerable influence throughout the country in all matters affecting country. He deals direct with the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the father of the Deputy Sartip, and is in no way guided or influenced by the local officials He is a very prejudiced person in many matters, and would not receive any visitors in the country. The Russian officer stayed in his village a few ILvflnd desired v7 r y much to see him, but ho refused. 1 made no attempt to break in on his seclusion; on more than one occasion he sent me very kind messages and presents of fruit. His Mirza I saw much of, he was a personal friend, we exchanged repeated visits, and he gave me considerable help, both when in camp here, and also when returning. All supplies available ; lots of good grazing. , .. . Several nomad encampments of Shahozai and Yagazai (counted lo4 Siah Khans) annuallv visit this locality. They own most of the camels grazed in country, and during this period of year (August and September) this is the best place to find transport. Considerable diplomacy and tact is required when dealing with owners, or exorbitant rates are demanded, and system of “Boycott” attempted. Sehkoha (3 miles) is the old Sarbandi capital. Pasand Khan Gorgaiz Raluch is Kad Khuda, a very plausible and crafty person He has little if my influence, as the Gorgaiz Baluch are a subsection of the Sarbandi, and Purdil Khan is their chief. , , . , ., , , , Pasand Khan was formerly a noted highway robber, and caused much trouble to the Seistan officials, so, in order to check his raiding propen sities, he was married to a sister of Her Begs (Pesh-Khidmatgar to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk), and was given Sehkoha or revenue contract. 1 am informed he draws no allowance from Government, and is now a peaceably H •suuuqii °IHS 1° '°N •SJUAvauqq m uiuj^ jo uoiqonp -o.id lunuuy O to 1-H r-H o o o o O O O3 31 a o a T3 a a •2 a § § a ' 0 -3 ei cS (h _a ^ rm GC C3 «*-i a o 3 a: c Remarks. 10 50 70 15 30 80 1*30 40 42 30 460 30 600 60 40 250 1,560 18 25 35 60 30 25 500 75 900 10 15 25 *5 7 8 ’ll 30 disposed citizen. His elder son is a chip of the old block, and like his father draws the long 1 bow. The younger son appears to have a stronger character and physique, and would be more reliable. A detachment of some 40 sowars and footmen are stationed here to protect the frontier (sic). Excepting the citadel, the fort is a mass of ruins, as also are a number of the houses surrounding it. The entire place, gardens, &amp;c., present a dilapidated and non-parental appearance. There is a large area of cultivable ground between it and Kosha Pain, a broad pebly tableland separates it from the more fertile surroundings of Killah-i-Kohna. A thriving village in healthy area, surrounded by good cultivable land. Party were in camp here for six weeks; inhabitants very friendly, and helped us in every way. Jafar Khan, too, was a kind host, and while absent on tour supplied my escort and levies with all necessaries. Mir Jafar was a noted old warrior, and is riddled with bullet wounds. A corruption of “ Kolang,” so called from a water bird who frequented the marshes in vicinity. A large and important village, the centre of a large area of good culturable land, well irrigated, and producing rich crops. There are several merchants here who trade with Quetta and Karachi, &amp;c., There is also a goldsmith (native of Quetta) residing here. The Kad Khuda is a respectable man, and reliable. Supplies available. This is a large, thriving village. Some fine Afghan Ghilzai merchants live here, but being of Sunni religion they do not fare as well as others of Shia religion, and are not given land to cultivate.

This is the first village of importance in Southern Seistan being the en trepots where the Sarhad and Bam-Narmishin kafilas make for on arii\al in the country. The village was founded some 200 years ago by Moham mad Roza Khan Sarbandi, he also founded several adjoining villages, viz.: Hussainabad, Tuti, Sehkoha, &amp;c. The present chief of the tribe is Sardar Purdil Khan, who resides here with his family and a strong following of the tribe who are scattered throughout Seistan. The strength of the tribe which is the most influential in the country is estimated at not less than 3,600 men. There are four merchants here, of whom Azghar Ali is the most reliable, and served the Mission well. All supplies are procurable, the culturable area is large and yields good crops. The current prices are similar to those as shown in attached list for ISasratabad. Hussianabad (Pain) is 2 miles south from Daulatabad. The ThaB\ idr here is Mi Khan Beg, a great scoundrel. The ground in the vicinity is much cut up and is intersected by several joos, which caused our entrance into Seistan to practically be by u leaps and bounds,” which afforded the onlookers much merriment, particularly as my escort (5th Bombay Lancers) acquitted themselves well. •« u A village touching the main road from Sarhad, Quetta, &amp;c., via Robat and Harmak to Seistan, the first village met on arrival in country. Sup plies only in small quantities available here. As its name signifies it is situated above the ridge or hill about half-way between Lutak and Warmal. There is an octroi office here under an agent of Mir Abas of Iskil. A very much neglected village. The area of culturable land is large, but there is at all times a paucity of water. The water is always slow in reaching here, so much being utilized by all the other villages further west along the Rud-i-Seistan, in addition to waste from bursting and overflow of the canals. Jalalabad was a large village of some 500 substantially built houses and extensive fort during Kyani occupation. It was partially swept away by encroachment of floods some 30 years ago since which it has been entirely destroyed, in 1894, by the Rud-i-Parian offshoot of the Helmand. It is now derelict, waterlogged, and surrounded by a regular lake through which we had much difficulty in wading, and a memorable night’s stay here from the rapacious attentions of mosquitos. Some flue gardens close at hand, as well as an old Ziarat, were only discernable by some superior fruit trees and ancient Gohguz trees. , , 1 measured some of these latter trees which were as follows : length, 45 feet; circumference at base, 18 feet; near branches, 14 feet; another old stump was 43 feet and 16 feet circumference. This, I think, will do away with the accepted theory that trees will not grow in Seistan con sequent on perpetual winds. The apathy and a system of stifling all individual enterprise has more to do in such matters find general neglect of development all over the country. In former days prior to and during the Kyani rule under Mohammed Bahrain Khan, who built this fort and town, there is on all sides evidence to show that the former inhabitants understood the art of brick making and were masons and architects of no mean capability. The wainscotting, cornices, &amp;c., in the fort and offices were covered with a first-class cement,35 ' 'r! a o O O u m Cu a U ce ^ rA o _ £ o3 00 ’’3 a To E 3 O § a a ^3 No. k 03 o £ &lt;&lt; Remarks. and the courtyards, tanks, and deep well were substantially paved with well preserved brickwork. &lt; A few Kyani descendents of Malik Jalal-ud-din still cling with com mendable tenacity to their ancient home a few habitable houses cm high ground to the south of the ruins. On the lands now called Parian, i.e., those watered by the Rud-i-Parian and an offshoot of it called Rud-i-Dashak (vide Map No. 11) are extensive ruins, these are called the ruins of Dashak, conspicuous amongst them are old Jalalabad, Rindau, Burj-i-Nasir Khan, Kohak, &amp;c., these are stated to have been the capital of the country during the reign of Yakob the Potter’s time somewhere about 258 Hijrah.

Garshahsap is said to have been the capital of Zarblistan during the reign of King Garshahsap. 15 125 Elevation, 2,088 feet. Village consists of a collection of wattle and dab houses, situated on an elevated clay ridge at the south end of 7th Nawar. Although a small village on frontier, it is important as a trade route along which the kafilas from Bokar, via Herat Sabzwar 1 an ah pass, as also those going to Afghanistan via Chakansar. A kaiila arrived here, m route to Seh Kuha, during my visit, who gave me some usual information. The surrounding country to the north and west is under water some 4 to 8 feet deep, and a thick guz jungle fringes the old bed of Helmand. Area of tillage is on the east and south. Two years ago the Helmand changed its course, the greater bulk of water now flows through the Rud-i-Parian {vide map), and there is but little water in the old Helmand bed, in some parts it only contains pools. There is a ferry crossing at the mouth of Rud-i-Parian where it leaves the Helmand ; the breadth of river is some 300 yards, with a deep, violent, and dangerous current (lost a horse crossing, and was carried some ^ mile down current myself, very near going the way of the horse). Parian means abrupt, sudden, and is derived from paredan—to fly, hence the name of river which so suddenly changed its course. Sardar Shamas Uddin resides here, he is a nephew of Sardar Khan Jehan, of Saidak. We received a hospitable welcome here, the inhabitants along the frontier here were all anxious to know when the British Sirkar37 0&gt; 2 a g , ~o a «*-c o o.

The 7th Nawar is a difficult place to visit during flood time, as it practically becomes a little isle, in addition to being overrun with irrigation channels. The Rud-i-Parian cuts it off from Seisran; on the north is the Hamoon, the eastern arm of the Helmand being a buffer between it and Afghanistan. A little east of the ruins of Rindan, up to Margo, was barely traversable, being waterlogged, and only passable after 20th June. At Margo is a ferry which transported us across a rapid, treacherous, reach of muddy water, some 200 yards broad, and 4 to 6 feet deep, beyond which our tutin was pulled through an intricate maze of guz jungle, taking altogether the best part of an hour from Margo before we gladly alighted from these frail barks on dry land, and made our way on foot, in a broiling sun, through dense guz jungle, to the village of Deh Pahalwan. In addition to other crops l note that a good deal of jow, cotton, and flax are cultivated in 7th Nawar. Ruined. 1,765 * Annual production of small grain in Kharif crops, as jawari, &amp;c.4 Climate. Seasons and winds. 38 The altogether too unfavourable estimate of the Seistan climate, formed by other^ officers who have passed this way, will be found to be at variance with my experience. J Being the first European who made a prolonged stay (extending over an entire hot season) an opportunity was afforded myself and party of carefully observing the physical effects both in the inhabitants, ourselves, and the equine element (i.e., horses, camels, and mules) in my transport train. (consequent on rapid travel, during flying visits by other officers, a fair opportunity ^ the true factors in the causation of diseases could hardly be expected. Conclusions drawn from native report (in all things greatly exaggerated) cannot be altogether relied upon. On the principle of giving the devil his due, the climate is not at all so bad as we have been led to believe; the erroneous idea hitherto prevalent, that the country is unsuited to European occupation all the year round, can be dispelled. There is nothing to depress the bodily powers and produce the lassitude from which we suffer during a hot weather in the plains of India. Throughout the hot season the heat is tempered by northern winds, and the nights are fairly cool. There are no hardships which a moderate degree of foresight in preparation will not overcome. During our stay in Seistan my party were under field-service tents the whole time; we travelled the entire country, walking a good deal; were repeatedly above our knees in water, often up to our waists; and, more often than I can now recollect, we all bathed in the Hamun and deep pools. We travelled along the grassy fringe, encamping for days together quite close to the waters right round from north-east to south-west, and always slept in the open at night with a blanket or two over us. Accompanied by one or two of the party I have shot from sunrise to mid-day, both in the Hamun waters and swamps, sometimes on reed boats (tutins), and on other occasions wading during the very hottest days in the year (thermometer registering 110 degrees, 112 degrees, 116 degrees). Neither then or since have I personally had any fever, malarial taint, or abdominal complaint (have repeatedly suffered from both in India); and out of my entire party of 86 all told there were but two mild cases of fever amongst the cavalry sowars, and two amongst levee sowars. These I attribute more to sun exposure and fatigue fever than actual^malaria. A small party of us, including myself, horses, &amp;c., suffered from the sharp and depressing effects of severe purging, &amp;c., being compelled to drink the saline and highly surcharged alkaline waters in the southern waters of the Hamun when caught in a violent sandstorm on the Shelag desert, and when exploring the limestone range called Palancv Koh &amp;c on the west. &amp; ’ v Man^ and beast suffered alike, and in no case could this be attributed to climatic causes. I he cause and effect were the results of an impure and poisonous water supply which, nolens volens, we were all forced to drink. 1 J W e all felt the heat crossing the intervening deserts of Baluchistan, much more t ian uhile in Seistan, but this may possibly be due to long, rapid marches, want of condition, and sudden change from cold of Quetta to great heat, and a paucity of water at all times bad. the hot weather favoured our endeavours to be industrious, and we were much in the open. 1 he repeated tours, which alone kept the party fit in such a country at this season of the year, enabled us to verify by personal observation each detail which had also been otherwise compiled while halting. There are four seasons of the year, viz.:— Spring .. „. .. .. April to June (Bahar). Summer .. .. .. .. July to September (Lawar). Autumn .. .. .. .. September to December (Tirmah). inter .. .. .. .. December to March (Zamistan). There is a maximum of hot weather and a minimum of cold, neither of which can be considered very vigorous. The transition of hot weather to cold is short and sudden. The winds might be said to be almost perpetual. The light gales of wind styled the Bad-i-Bahar, always commence in the middle of May; it blows steadily all day rising about 9 o clock a.m., and falling about 4 o’clock p.m.; it is most refreshing, reducino- the temperature considerably by day, and rendering the nights cool, the early mornino-s bein«- not unfrequently chilly. From the middle of July, when the Bad-i-Bahar becomes hotte?,39 it is called the Bad-i-Lawar (poisonous hot wind), this continues to blow with some violence, on occasions, into September, reaching its maximum intensity of heat between 16th and 30th July A howling warm wind blows throughout the day; during this period the landscape is enveloped in dust and haze, obscuring all but near objects. J udgmg by this experience, and the accounts of the Bad-i-Zamistan, it seems as i a e wm Northern Persia, Herat and Turkistan had arranged a meeting, and, arrowdike, direct their united forces on Seistan, determining to have a real good time over this flat,feature less and ruin-scattered country. . . These inland hurricanes, starting without any warning, lasting so long, and in the hot season, are to me unaccountable, more so as they are stronger during the daytime up to 3 o’clock p.m. than during the night. This year Lawar has set in earlier y a)s than usual, having begun (on the 19th of the moon) in June. During Zamistan, there are strong gales of cold wind, and during 25 days of th s period, in different months, the winds become very severe. In each of these periodic wind visitations their advent is fixed by a bunch of stars, called P^lam, coming from t e west and meeting the full moon at any time during the night. The resistance caused by the meeting of these stars with the moon is stated to cause the winds to become colder, and these are styled Bad-i-Zamistan. -d u • t* o The autumn, which is marked by the commencement of the Bad-i-lirmah, *s a pleasant, mild season ; all the kafilas start from the country at this period. . „ The gales, commencing with the Bad-i-Zamistan, is styled Bad-i-sacl i-bistroz (wind of 120 days); it is stated never to last more than 80 days. During this season, raw biting north winds blow, frosts are prevalent, thermometer registering 35 decrees of frost. Amongst a community of ill-fed, sparsely-clad, poverty-stricken and much oppressed people, such weather is indeed trying, bringing its attendant train of disease, such as rheumatism, chest affections, abdominal complaints, ium Jago, optha^mia^c-R ^ ^ considered an ordinary type of Seistan season, but somewhat hotter in comparison with the last 3 years. , , , • j i Taking the climate as a whole, and judging by the physique energy and labour performed, even in the hot season, I am forced to the conclusion that, the climate, in comparison with some other parts of Persia, is certainly much better. Bampur, Jaruft, Makran, Rudbar, of which I have had personal experience, aie much worse, and the Sardars and Sawars told me that Tabas was far worse and hotter; also Nasratabad and Bam-Narmishir on the south-west. , x The water-logging of the soil by Helmand floods (want of proper head canals) and Pecuhar- the meteorological conditions, which result from it in warm weather, are factors in ^ production of malaria ; yet a water-logged condition of soil, although aiding in the irmnunity causation of malaria, will not of itself produce it unless the ground be rank with vegetable f r0 m decayin 0 ' matter and there be extremes of temperature. ^ i • i The immunity of the inhabitants outside the area of this inundation, from marianal taint, is singularly noticeable, and amongst the nomads, who camp along its bank and even follow aquatic pursuits yi.e., ferrying, fishing, shooting, reed-gathering, &amp;c.), 1 saw little if any fever, and never met a case of enlarged spleen or liver, such as we find daily in India Those who live in the north-east do suffer from fever and have an aenemic appearance, but I am inclined to the belief that bad diet, insufficient clothing exposure, a total disregard for sanitary laws, and opium habit has much more to do in the pioc ac tion of Ccehectia, bilious, remittent and other diseases met with. It is scarcely necessary to point out that, there is a general exodus of nomads trom the Hamun vicinity towards the end of September, when it begins to dry up, and the malarial effluvia begins to arise by the action of a hot sun on this water-logged mud baMm ^ are all fired aTmua lly 5 as the young spring shoots make good coarse orazino- for cattle. For days together the horizon is obscured and the atmosphere sur charged with smoke, this, and the fresh north-winds, has a purifying and beneficial effect Sanitation throughout the village is of the good old sort, which invites disease from Sanitation, afar, and promises it every hospitality ; filth of every description, decomposing carcases, the friends and boon companions of disease, lie at the door of every village; these are the hotbeds and culture grounds of disease. The nomad Balueh and Ghainies, who wander and graze along the Hainan trmge the greater part of the year, who live fairly well, are warmly clad and work hard, are 9 days iu January, 10 days in February, 6 days in March .. .. 25 days.noticeably more healthy than the garrison and Parsiban folk, who lead a lazy life, are habitual opium and shangarif smokers, and addicted to vicious habits. I trust I may be pardoned for entering so into detail on climate; my apology for so doing is its great importance, in the event of any future policy we may be forced to adopt, with regard to this country. Population. Taking the total number of houses in the overleaf compilation, viz., 19,472, and allowing each house to contain three people, a reasonable estimate (allowing for empty houses contantly seen), we get a total of 58,416 inhabitants plus 1,765 Siah Khanas, each containing, say, five people, i.e., 8,815 nomads. The above figures may be relied on as a fair approximation. The elements comprising this population consist of the following:—Sarbandi, Sharaki, Naroi, Sanjarani Taoki, Kyani, Sarhadi and Ghaiani. The following are the subdivisions of the Baluch tribe (above noted) that are met with, viz., Safarzai, Muhumsani, Sangtrash, Kashani, Aisanzia, Gorgaiz, Rakhshani (fellow kinsmen of my levee escort), Kharot, Jamalzai, Murrai, Humazaini, Sharani Reki, Galachah, Yaramadzai. The following are among the Parsiban tribes met, viz., Jar, Ali Sufi, Arab, Sarwani, Sulimani, Barani, Tujki, Dilarami, Sinchuli, Mulla Mardan, Arjuni, Goorg, Kolikani, Ali Ahmed, Kamarki, Goshchin, Qrduni, Halil, Panj Kohi, Tillas, Babzai Garak, Shalvi, Uzadi. Resources. The tables showm include all the flocks, cattle, camels, &amp;c., grazed and owned by the nomads from Naiband, Sarbad, &amp;c., who pasture their flocks in the country. Some go over into Afghanistan, where without any distinction either Parsiban or Baluch, they profess Suni religion, and hence on payment of grazing tax are not molested, temporarily encamping by the villages throughout the country. To the above may be added some 50 mules. We saw a few in the fort at Nasratabad, also a few more at Saidak with Sardar Khan Jehan and others, in a few villages on the frontier in the 7th Nawar. Transport. (a.) Camels. —Camels are the most suitable form of transport. Those available are of a good, hardy class, well used to kafila work, and carry loads from 5 to 8 maunds, Indian scale. Amongst them are some very good breeding camels and also sowari (fast trotters), who can cover their 40 or 60 miles per diem even in this weather (dune and July). The above number could be augmented if required by some 3,000 from Dalbandin and vicinity, and from Sarbad and Damini territories by some 2,000 more ; if more were required they must be brought from Peshin, Kalat, Mashkil, and Makran. During the months of July, August, and September camels suffer quite as much from flies as horses do if in the vicinity of the Hamoon. We had little difficulty in procuring a large number of camels for transport while in the country to supply my posts on the intervening barren deserts between Seistan and Robat, &amp;c. We also employed a large number, laying down a six months’ supply of grain at Robat post,* with a large margin to carry them on in case of boycott by Seistan officials ; besides this I laid down all supplies of grain, forage, flour, &amp;c., right up to Amir Chah (to convey the Mission back), no small amount, considering the strength of the party, &amp;c. :— Men 35 Horses 14 Camels.. .. .. .. .. .. 21 Mules .. .. .. .. .. .. 6 I purchased some very good barbardari camels at from 80 to 100 rupees, and three sowari camels at 65, 85, 110 rupees respectively. Almost all the camels are absent from the country during the cold weather on kafila work to Bandar Abbas, Quetta, Meshad, Jalk, &amp;c. (b.) Donkeys .—The donkeys are small but wiry, their powers of endurance great. They are largely used both for transport and riding. The Persian infantry in the * This action was a considerable saving to Government, as grain rose in price before we left the country, when most of the surplus grain had been exported. This supply was procured at following rates:— Flour .. ,, .. 16 seers per rupee. Wheat .. .. .. ,.19 „ Barley 37^ „ flhusa ,, ,, .. ,. ,, as 4 per maund.(907) 41 provinces (I have no experience of city customs) might really be styled the “ donkey corps.” Each man generally has a donkey, or one per couple of men. The load these donkeys carry over long distances and bad going is surprising. (c.) Horses .—There are about 1,000 horses, roughly speaking, in the country, which include those of the garrison. Some were out of the country with Syed Khan at I abas The breed of horse, though small, is a good, hardy, serviceable one. \ saw several goo stamp of brood mares in the 7th Xawar, doubtless Afghan. Very few horses could be procured, as there are only sufficient for the requirements of the country. We counted 36 windmills in the country. They are built of parallel mud walls like W mchmlls. a tower, so constructed as to catch the prevailing wind. To the top stone is attached an upright post supported by a cross-beam. To this is attached the rudely-constructed wooden flange on which is lashed the layers of tutor reeds. They are in use the greater part of the year, even in the hottest weather at certain periods of the day. We repeatedly oround our corn with them which will give some idea of the strength ot the Bad-i-Lawar (poisonous wind) which blows in hot weather. In such a grain-producing country not to speak of the almost perpetual wind, styled “ Bad-i-sad-i-bis-i-roz,’ the absence of these Agriculture is of the most wasteful and slovenly description. Watered by the noble Agn-^ Helm and, which not only causes the country to be highly irrigated, but for the greater part of the year practically turns it into an island, what might it be if this the grea natural necessity of any country were but controlled by head canals and the country in other hands? The staple products are wheat and barley. Jowari and cotton are gro\\n in small quantities and are seen mostly in the 7th Kawar. Opium and tobacco are also grown in fair quantity. . .. The Kharif crop is very rich. Superior melons of different sorts are gro^n all over the country, besides which bringals, turnips, onions, kalam (a coarse kind ot cabbage) and garlics are grown. A little henna is also cultivated for dyeing purposes. Attached to most of the important villages are gardens containing the usual eastern fruit trees, which, if they received any attention, would yield good fruit, especially the grape crop. There are four distinct sorts of grapes, viz.. 1. Hassani.—This grape is fairly good, of light colour, and generally has not more than two seeds. , 2. Hussaini.—This grape is better than the foregoing, of still lighter colour and more delicate in form. . 3. Abasi-or-Askari.—This is the best species of all. They are of light colour, are much more delicious than any of the other sort and keep longer. lhe&gt; will keep well for 15 days. . 4. Khaya Ghulaman (slaves’ food).—These are the worst sort, as their name signifies. They are of dark purple colour and are almost full of seeds. Current Prices.

The nomads are chiefly stockowners, possessing large herds of camels, sheep, and goats. Amongst them are a class of Scyads, who, for the greater part of the year’ reside on the Helmand and Hamun banks. They live entirely on the sale of fish’ feathers, water birds, and working the ferry boats. Professions. I met with an Afghan who had seen some hospital practice in Kabul. His success as a surgeon, particularly in that delicate operation for extraction of stone in the bladder surpassed all my previous experience. The primitive method of operating I will briefly describe, viz., no earthly attempt at antiseptic surgery, no anaesthetic, a scrotal incision with a sharp knife, the index finder being pressed in till the foreign body was found, the small hooked (at point) horn of a gazelle guided by the finger hooked out the stone. Ko preliminary sounding was at all attempted. This artist was indeed proud, as well he might be, of his success, for he showed me a couple of handful of stones of all sizes and composition. He omitted to supply any statistics of death percentage or complications following his operations. Imports, From what we saw there appeared to be a good deal of trade in Seistan, and there is a andTrade P ros ™ ab ! e P™spect of a brisk increase if it be not interfered with by our northern rival, prospects. The im i )0rts ar e English and Russian piece goods, indigo, tea (Indian), copper and brass utensils (Indian), ware (chiefly Russian, in small quanity), leather (Russian), cast- iron (small quantity), spices, dates in large quantities from Jalk and Bam. Slave’ oirls from Bam (several were sold in August last, also camels), sugar (chiefly French), grain from Afghanistan, tabacco and old clothes from Quetta. I could get no confirmation whatever of arms being imported through the country and reaching the frontier tribes. ° The exports are grain in large quantities (unless seen, the export of grain could hardly be imagined, a lot comes in from the Afghanistan side, and is sold and reshipped to Khorassan, Bam, Sarhad, Jalk and Baluchistan), hides, feathers, wool, camels and goat’s hair, ghee. Roads and Roads, properly so called, do not exist in Seistan, narrow well-beaten tracks alone canals. connect one town or village with another. These are so narrow that onlv one animal or pedestrian can traverse them. The water I n 80 highly irrigated a country the water cuts are, as may be imagined, a regular cuts (joos). network of intricacy. They are insecurely bridged here and there with a few tamarisk houghs thrown across and covered with earth, but in many cases sheets of overflow water have to be crossed, and the unwary traveller will know nothing of the traps that lie hidden till his animal and load go souse into a canal.* One has to change one s guide repeatedly ; local ones alone know the intricacies of these obstacles. In outlying districts it is impossible to get guides who know the lie of the land, so one is obliged to feel one’s way cautiously, Transport r I he extreme difficulty of moving about in so highly irrigated a country at once cu y * proved the necessity of forming a camel corps, which I immediately proceeded to carry out. J Camel corps. Our own camels being the worse for wear after so rapid a journey across the deserts and also feeling the effects of Seistan climate being used to the higher altitude of * lliere was much more flooding this year consequent on the bursting of the Band-i-Kahuk and delav in repairing it. ' ’43 Quetta, I hired permanently (at 20 rupees per camel monthly), using my own saddlery and equipment. We carried our supplies and were thus independent of official opposition, porterage across canals, and were enabled to move rapidly about the countiy, pacing flying visits to my dak and outlying posts, in fact here, there and everywhere. tt The geographical limits of the Hamun or Naizar are seen in Map No. II. A broad sheet of water covers the entire area, practically turning the country almost into an island for 7 months in the year, except on the south-east. In very exceptional seasons of flood only, does any overflow reach the God-i-Zarrah. This year there was no water m the Shelao* river ; a few intensely saline pools were found here and there along its bed. Up to 20th May the water had only reached a little south of Koh-i-Khwaja. Some of my party crossed the desert {vide Koute No. 2) from Warmal to Makh Surkh on above d a te The limit of the 1896 flood reached a line opposite Daulatabad, and it is stated that in 1893 there was an overflow into the Rud-i-Shelag. _ r lhe waters begin to subside in August, but the process is very gradual and the road is not practicable till fsovemoer. Between March and November, or the middle of October, as the case may be, the Hamun is crossed in tutins or reed boats made of the tutor reeds. On the Helmand side, and at the ferries on the Rud-i-Parian where the current is extremely rapid, broad rafts made of tamarisk boughs lashed together and supported by hollowed pumpkins are m use. These are directed by stout swimmers, round whose necks are also pumpkins like inflated bladders. On these rafts are piled the belongings, saddlery, &amp;c.; on top of all sits the traveller, his animal swdmming behind, being tied on by a leading string. On the nort - w r est and west the reed boats are poled along in the shallow smooth water, which varies m 1 On the Seistan side there is a broad stretch of clear water, beyond which, on the Nehbandan side, is a wide and almost impenetrable belt of lofty reeds. A deep fringe of coarse grasses surrounds the whole, and here the nomads flock to graze their herds, In the bed of the Hamun are the ancient ruins of Aswar Shah, Dargo Samur and many others.^ ^ ^ veritable sportsman ’ s p arad ise ; on the Hamun and Joos swarm wild-fowl Sport and of every imaginable species, who flock down from the north and winter here. Then cues are deafening, and so thick are the swans and duck that they are netted, and a large ia e done in their downy feathers, which are exported to Meshed and Afghanistan ; they make luxurious pillows and quilts. The pelican is also shot for his feathers and fat; t ic latter is a specific lubricant for rheumatism, &amp;c., and commands a ready sale. In addition to wild fowl, hare and partridge are numerous; on the desert to the south, wild asses, lynx, hyama. and gazelle are plentiful; while in the mountain districts on the west and south, oorial, ibex, and leopard abound. I had some fine sport all over the Hamun, bringing my tutin home repeatedly laden with duck and castins, and hundreds of eggs of the latter (which are capital eating, resembling a plover s egg), even in the months of May and June, while, in October, a few good days made ones mouth water for a further introduction during the colder weather, oevenu very good oorial heads were also secured on the Palang Koh, during the month of September, notwithstanding the heat, tramping at so unseasonable a period. Pigs swarm in the guz jungles and swamps, and the shrill howl of the jackal nightly proclaims his presence. There are three species of reeds :— xCt&lt; C Nai—a short broad reed with fronds or leaf like a palm (a coarse cattle fodder, the young sprouts being regularly grazed after burning), hence the name Naizar, or place of N ai. 2. Tutor—a long reed over 10 feet, also broad, from which are made the boats, mattings, &amp;c. 3. Haz—long thin reed, tufty flowery bunch on top, resembling a bulrush. Mosquitoes, midges, gnats, &amp;c. These pests abound in numbers. I he rav ages of Thes ami the pestilential horse-flv (Sabzdang), like the wind of 120 days, is a bit exaggerated. WO rriters. This largish pale green coloured fly is certainly, however, very much en evidence and a bit of a pest; it attacks animals fresh from the country, particularly along the verdant fringe of the Hamun. On one memorable occasion, when marching without guides too close to the southern end of the Hamun, and while caught in a blinding dust storm, these flies settled on our camels and my mare, and literally devoured them. My poor mare was covered with weals and blood from ear tip to hoof, and not till 1 had overtaken the camels and got a large rug could they be kept off; the poor thing suffered so that she44 repeatedly lay down and rolled in her pain and endeavoured to shake the obdurate brutes off. The camels too were trickling with blood in exposed parts, yet with all we lost none of them ; occasionally a mild abdominal cellulitis follows, but soon passes off. The horses, camels, and cattle of the country seem to get used to these flies, as I repeatedly saw them grazing along the Hamun bank and trans-Parian. If animals are rugged up they are protected, but they are seldom much out of their stables during the Bad-i-Lawar. The Pushagirak, a large fly-catcher, resembling the dragon-fly, is also a trifle annoying in the fall of the evening, they come in swarms, darting in and around your head and face after midges. During the Bad-i-Lawar all these are regularly on the war path. A small red worm (Julu or mirk) frequent the Hamun waters at this period of the season; it sticks in the body of those who are engaged in aquatic pursuits, leaving a small weal that frequently forms into an ulcer. 1 J Fish&gt; ^ ish in lar ge numbers abound in the Helmand, Bud-i-Parian, and Eud-i-Seistan of a superior quality ; they are up to 8 or 10 lbs. in weight, in size like a salmon, with soft white flesh and good eating, though bony. In the Hamun itself a dark, dirty, muddy brown coloured fish is caught, in weight up to 2^ lbs.; these have a nasty, muddy taste by no means palatable, but are largely consumed by the inhabitants. An unprecedented flight of locusts visited the country in June, which swept over the country devouring and stripping everything. Inhabitants state they visit the country every third or fourth year. They have arrived this year later than usual and have done much damage to the Kharif crop. Their arrival was too late to do much damage to the Eabi crop. One is rather inclined to be incredulous when they hear the stories related of the ravages of these pests. AVe had every opportunity of judging for ourselves as they simply stripped in a few hours the large garden by our encampment belono-in^ to the Deputy Sartip. Millions settled on all the fruit trees, lucerne and vegetable beds and from a previously spring-like appearance everything soon presented a wintry bare’ and weird aspect. J 9 Willow, mulberry, apple, and pomegranate trees seemed to be specially appetising the branches being weighted down with them. As seen on the ground, the myriads of newly- hatched locusts appeared like a yellow mass covering everything and banking up the foot paths, so much so that the horses would not face them till spurred on and ridden up to their bits; they hop about, the younger being unable to fly, and the elder, from want of space, spread their wings, jostle, and are unable to rise and are crushed in masses beneath our horses feet. Across the plain they appear like a floculent cloud of varied tinted hue scudding along. As they advance towards maturity, they change their bright yellow hue and become pink and finally brown. The inhabitants do not destroy them and are prejudiced about killing them. They do not know that the destruction of their eggs alone will get rid of them. It is reported that at Farrah in Afghanistan, and at -Dam-JN armshir, locusts also did great damage to crops and trees.45 CHAPTER IV. Exploration of the District in the West and South. Early in September we left the main camp at Kosha Pain, having as our ( J b J? ct th ® IhTSt- exploration and survey of the mountainous country on the west and south. Mistortun ^ lag in doLed our steps the entire journey ; on the third march we were literally devoured by a sahne miSTons of the “ Sabzadang ” flies, consequent on the advance party going too dose a ong san the swamp at the south-east end of the Hamun. . ,, The horses being so exhausted (and in a frenzied state from the flies) after a gallop of 6 miles to intercept a gang of robbers who had attacked my Girdi post on the nig i of 25th August, an unforeseen consumption ot water took place. , ,, We had brought sufficient water to carry the party four marches across the salt desert, but, to add to our discomfort, a blinding saline sandstorm arose and delayed us. It was impossible to march in the teeth of so violent a blinding and choking storm, so we had to bivouack that night and next day on the barren, saline-swept plain. As ma} be imagined, mid-day in this climate was fairly warm, so we were forced to cook our cofiee and drink the intensely salt water at this part of the Hamun. The following day, having made a forced march into the insterstices or the mils, where we were led to believe we should find sweet water, the supply, though c ear, sparkling, and inviting (and liberally partaken of by all), in a few days turned out to have a most disturbing influence on both human and equine members ot the par y. , . . f The geological stratum of these hills (chiefly limestone) causes the springs at their rau tio, of base to be highly charged with alkaline and other salts, and the further we penetrated into the heart of these hills the more poisonous and unpalatable became the water, it was not only surcharged with the above-noted salts, but also polluted with animal am bird excreta who frequent these parts. . ,, . ... i * i T One well was so bad several of the party got choleraic attacks, which comp e e v prostrated us for 36 hours. We cast ahead a few more marches to complete the recon naissance, but fared no better in our water supply. Being now five long marches from Neh, the nearest town, and eight from our depot, I decided to return and leave nothing to chance in the matter of further supply, though we were forced to drink this horrible stuff on the return journey. Five rapid and intensely cold night marches (to avoid t ie inevitable thirst by day) brought us in an exhausted condition to our depot, where we ay prostrate with low fever and dysentery for 10 days. . . . , Q , n . The general character of the country trans-Hamun, i.e., intervening between Seistan Charaeter and Dash-i-Kerman, consists of innumerable parallel ranges rising to altitudes varying couutry&gt; from 3,000 to 9,920 feet approximately. The general trend of tne ranges is north-west and south-east, and they are chiefly composed of barren limestone with an outcrop ot black trap and schists. , 1 Harrow torrent beds tortuously wind their way through the hills, the ranges m the interstices being separated by narrow valleys of low spur hills, and again by broad saucer- shaped plateaux liable to inundations during rains, leaving saline crustatious-like deposit after evaporation and desiccation, mapping out well-defined miniature Hamms, bcatteie throughout the valleys and plateaux are numerous springs and wells (vide Appendix hr and Map Ho. 2); there are no villages or settled habitations. &gt; . Homad Baluch frequent the vicinity of springs and wells, pasturing their flocks The routes intersecting these hills along the dry beds of the Butak, Kundi, Turshab, Routes. Baluchad, and Hurmak rivers are practicable for horsemen and laden camels. At reasonable distances water is procurable from springs and wells, and can be relied on during the winter months. Supplies are not procurable, excepting sheep (from nomads), fuel, and camel grazing. ^ „ . . j o i i These hills command the roads leading to and from Heh, ISasrabad, and Sarhad. The month of September was not unpleasant in these hills, nights cold, the hot stagnant air in the confines of the valleys during the warmer months rendering them unsuita b e for occupation. * Two kafilas, respectively consisting - of 54 camels and 23 donkeys, and 29 camels and 18 donke\s, with grain, were also mixed up in this storm ; they were on their way to Ghain.

Ziarat-i- Malik-i- Siah. “ Langars.” The sporte- mau’s stone Up the Radar Nala is a well-known Ziarat Baba Radar, elevation 3,926 feet; here on the left bank of the Uala is a good spring. There are here two Sian Khanas of Narai Baluch—headman, “ Murad 14 people, having two good ramahs (flock); camel grazing and firewood plentiful. Tip Darwazgu Nala, by a spring of the same name, is Ziarat-i-Sultan, which is another much-frequented spot. On this range, Darwazgu, and on Chehal Dakhtaran, fine oorial heads are to be obtained. Some half-way between Robot Thana and Hurmak spring, situated on a slightly raised plateau on the right side of the Wavaila Nala, is the Ziarat-i-Malik-i-Siah, the most notable shrine throughout Baluchistan. This shrine, it is reported, was dedicated to one Malik Balach, a pious follower of Pir-i-Sultan, who was buried here, having died, some say, while on his way to Seistan, and by others it is stated while shooting on the hills surrounding, which were much frequented by him. The Ziarat is very neatly kept and well looked after by a fakir, it is tastefully covered with stones of varied hue, snow-white predominating, large sticks surmounted with horns and streams of cloth are placed at the head, tidy paths surround it, and votaries of all sorts are strewn on the lengthy grave. The three large sacrifical stones outside the entrance path and the ground in their vicinity show that the constant stream of travellers and pilgrims on this much frequented highway, leading from Makran and Sarhad to Seistan, make frequent sacrifices of sheep and goats here, and it now somewhat resembles a shamble. On the north side of the Ziarat are eleven langars of Malik, and on the south are seven langars of Pir-i-Sultan. The mass of mountains on the east and south are collectively called Koh-i-Malik Siah, but several of the prominent individual peaks have different names. The ran^e on the west is called Nascat. The real Koh-i-Malik range is very distinct but is not visible at all from the Ziarat, being shut out by the intervening lower ranges, viz., Koh-i-Anjir, Koh-i-Malik-i-Loap, &amp;c. The Rud-i-Malik is really a continuation of the Wavaila Nala which is styled Rud-i-Malik or Malik Siah Nala, from the Ziarat onwards till joined by the Rud-i- Garajarog, it bears the saintly name Malik Siah like the surrounding hills. This nala does not join Hurmak Nala, as noted by Major Jennings, it joins the Rud-i-Madan, vide map No. 2 and Appendix G, No. 259. Across the nala, opposite the Ziarat, is a large black stone hurled down from the 'hill top by the departed saint, this stone is called the Shikar-ta-Khal, or sportsman’s stone, and it is related that the great Saint Malik, himself a great sportsman, gave orders that none should shoot in these hills till he could hit the stone from the Ziarat, or if he did he would have no luck in his shooting. This conspicuous stone is now a target for all desirous of fame as marksmen. Proceeding up the nala to the east, about a mile, is a fresh spring called Malik-na- Loap-na-dir, its position is localised being at the foot of a conspicuous conical hill styled Koh-i-Malik-i-Loap (loap being Baluch for conical and dir for water). It is indeed curious how a kindly Providence fits in the natural requirements for so many pilgrims as to supply their wants in the all-important matter of water in this other wise arid spot. Situated to the south-east from this conical hill is the Malik Siah range, shut out completely from view at the Ziarat, to the north and south of the aforenamed springs are two low hills, on the northermost of these is a langar to the Malik, it is quite visible on the top from the Ziarat below. I cannot help thinking this must be the peak climbed by Major Jennings, R.E.*, and not the actual peak of Koh-i-Malik Siah which overlooks the desert, and not the Ziarat, and is a conspicuous land mark from the Shelag desert. I cannot account for Major Jennings having missed the Ziarat in the nala and found it on the top of a hill hard by. On page 8 of Colonel Bell’s report is mention of having passed the Ziarat, and having made a detour a few miles back to pass Malik Siah Koh. This is quite correct; a few miles up the Wavaila nala from the Ziarat the high peak of Malik Siah with Boundary Pillar 186, planted on it by Captain McMahon, is visible to the naked eye. There is also some misapprehension about Koh-i-Robat, or Koh-i-Malik Robat, which it is as well to clear up. It is not a separate range, the Siah range has two well- defined peaks, a northern called Malik Siah Koh, and the southern is Koh-i-Malik Robat, at the foot of which is now placed our frontier outpost called Robat Thand. Some good heads of oorial are also to be got on this range. * Report on a journey through Western Baluchistan and Eastern Persia, by Major Jennings, R.E, page 80. See also Captain McMahon’s report on Boundary Conamission.—B.-C.CHAPTER V. Land System—Revenue and Production, &amp;c. When the country came under the rule of Sartip Mir Alam Khan, he assessed the I i aras - revenue at a uniform rate, at one-third of the production, and also introduced the system of making ijaras of the villages with contractors. The system of land ownership is quite different from that of India, in fact there is ri ®^f and no real owner or proprietorship, other than the Rad Khuda, or head man, of each village. re gpon- The inhabitants in and around each village are considered as tenants under him. sibilities. The land is measured by the quantity of seed sown in area at the rate of 22 maunds 20 seers per pagam* of land. The position and responsibility of a tenant will be seen from the following :— Out of the entire production of each pagam of land one-third is stipulated Government share; out of the other two-thirds the tenant has to give 50 maunds (equal to 7 maunds, Indian scale) to the Kad Khuda, besides the contingent expenses attendant on sowing, reaping, saving, &amp;c. The production of a pagam is stated to be 400 maunds (equal to about 600 maunds, Indian scale), and it takes at least five or six men, the Zemindar states, to cultivate a pagam. The entire expenses are estimated as follows, viz.:— Divani revenue .. Mds. .. 200 S. 0 Ch 0 Kad Khuda • • 7 0 0 Narozi .. • # .. 5 0 0 Labourers • • • • 12 0 0 Barpar .. • • .. 2 0 0 Mistie .. • • • • 1 0 0 Seeds .. • • • • 22 20 0 Total .. .. 249 20 0 From the above it is seen that, after deducting the contingent expenses from the estimated product, all that remains to the tenant is 350 maunds 20 seers for his yearly labour and that of the Qulbars. There are many hardships and taxes that also fall on the much-oppressed Zemindar, Hardships such as quartering a few soldiers on them to watch the crops for two months before the of tenants, ripening. These are a great source of trouble to the Zemindar, for, in addition to their own requirements, they generally have a horse or donkey and perhaps a servant, all of whom have also to be provided for. These gentlemen, too, if not given “ palm oil,” either in specie or kind, prefer reports against “ these much to be pitied people,” stating they graze the standing crops, &amp;c., which brings down official wrath and the attendant train of consequences. The revenue is collected in kind by Ijaras, and bataing the crops by Government Revenue, officials. The Mushrif makes his round on the completion of the threshing and winnow- how ^ in^, when the corn is made up in heaps in the open, as is the custom, and not infrequently CU1 ecte ' ‘ loss in sale results, consequent on delay in bataing; but those who have craftily secured the favour of the head Mushrif have their crops bataied without any delay. Yet another illustration of hardships to the hardy sons of toil during harvesting, Mullahs and mendicants make a practice of riding round the country on their asses, and return home heavily laden. Indeed, the constant wail throughout the country during the harvesting was: “No one hears the cry of the toiling peasantry or lends ear to their just complaints.” Indeed, the peasant rarely has more than one-third or one- quarter of the production for his own use, and it was repeatedly stated they had often * Pagam is a measure of land ploughable in a day by a pair of oxen.48 Cultivable area. Annual yield. not sufficient to maintain their families till the next season’s crop. Their constant prayer was that the British Sarkar would occupy the country as soon as possible, and give them relief and proper government. The cultivable area of Seistan, excluding Burd-i-Baramabad (temporary lands), is estimated to be 20,110 pagams. 1 he yearly production of wheat, barley, and other grains, at average rate of 35 maunds per pagam, is 703,850 maunds. Ihe Government revenue out of this, realized at the rate of one-third* by hatai system, comes to 234,616 maunds. Making the following deductions, the balance for Imperial revenue can be ascertained:— Maunds. 600 soldiers at 12 maunds per head .. . # 7,200 Civil officials (devani), 50 as pieshkidmats, minas, &amp;c., at 36 maunds 1,800 Wazifs and mantis 10,200 Total 19,200 This sum, deducted from the Government revenue (i.e., 234,616 — 19,200) gives a balance of 215,416 maunds, and this is kept as a khalsa revenue for sati and credit to Imperial treasury. * . .Rupees.

A\ e must assume that these particulars which were obtained from the revenue books are faked, as it is naturally to the interest of the officials to show as deplorable a state of revenue as possible. J he particular point worthy of note is that after making the remittance of 45,000 rnpees to Khorassan, the balance, 312,254 rupees, is supposed to be expended in the administration of the country. 1 he items below, of expenditure, based on local information, will give an idea of the expenditure against a considerable amount of Imperial money kept for administration:— * Above-noted nominal Government assessment is hardly a fair test of the resources of a country, for considerable more in the way of press work, illegal extractions, both in cash and kind, &amp;c., are enforced.(907) 49 Military salaries.

Consequent on the bursting of the Band-i- Hohuk, and neg lect to repair it for some considerable time, there was a scarcity of water all along the south, affecting most the villages further west. It is stated that the apathy in repairing the Band was the chief factor in causing this year’s scarcity in many parts. From July onwards up to October, in many parts of the country, there is always a scarcity of water as the canals are all dry. During this period wells are sunk in the bed of old canals or close to the villages, and water is always found at from 4 to 6 feet below the ground surface. At Kosha Pain and other standing camps I sank wells for my own and my transport supply. The ill-constructed and temporary banding of the canal, which is annually carried away at Hood time, and the delay to repair it, is a source of great loss to the Zemindar. There are no water rates, and no action appears to be in force to prevent any one local authority from monopolizing the sources of water supply of the community. YYest of Kimak, &amp;c., reckless waste and insecurity of tributary feeders causes an insufficiency of water as far west as Warmal,* in consequence of which there is a considerable difference in the area under cultivation, fertility of ground, and general character of the produce. The cry in several parts was : “ Oh, if we had water and it were only brought in time, then the crops would not be so poor and our labour in vain.” * The water was over a month late this year in reaching the outlying villages to the west.51 The Government officials, for some reason best known to themselves, delayed batais this season, and the Zemindars having run short of their last year’s stock, there will be a great scarcity of grain later on, and the people will be impatient for the new grain next Not till a pacca head band is made at^Kahuk can Seistan ever be what it might: ' ‘'“TV most^noticeabl'e ^eTture^hich^atches the eye of the traveller in these parts Ancient are the gaunt, glaring, mute ruins which are scattered all over tne country, beanng silent testimony to the former prosperous and populous kingdom ot ^ ei stan. In addition to those previously referred to (lying m a stretch north and south from that very ancient obelisk called Mil-i-Tapa or Mil-i-Kassimabar, so distinguishable a landmark in the otherwise featureless landscape), extensive rums are to be seen at Killah-i-Takghazi, Aswar Shah, Killah-i-Zero, Jazinak, Kundarak, Shahnstan, Chunj-i- Muro-ha Chardari, Burj-i-Muhammad Khan, on Koh-i-Khawaja, and at Dushak; but it is still further south, in the vicinity of Gudar-i-Shah,* that the most ancient and extensive ruins of all are to be seen. ^ i -i A few farsakhs north-east from Gudar-i-Shah or Ziarat-i-Shah-i-Mardan are the Angi ancient ruins of Shah-i-Gul Shun-i-Zar Nagar (city of the shining flower). History . relates that this was a splendid city in bygone ages : “ Here was the king s throne, and it was the capital of all the country round.” ^ „ , . , . t, , , • , The ancient manuscripts containing a history of Seistan, now in lehran, which were obtained by an agent of the late Shah some four years ago, makes mention of this city as the ancient “ Angil Shahr.” A few of the grey-beard elders called it by this name also when describing to us its former glories, which he had read of in the books a ove n ° te Due west from Deh Lutuf-Ullah and separated from the mainland by a broad and Kuh-i- deep sheet of water is the modern Kuh-i-Khwaja, or historic Kuh-i-kok Kohzad. is ^ neculiarly-isolated hill, elevated some 400 feet above the level of the plain and 2, Jb Ataah feet above sea level, having about an area of 1 square mile of broken ground on lts Khana (the summit, was surrounded by water during our stay in the country, and could only be fire house Tradition relates that this commanding hill has only been called Khwaja since about 1057 Hiirah (1647 Ch. era), when a pious man of Khw^aja family, then living m ^ ic village of Kod, near Deh Jahanjir, was buried here at his own request In the ancient times of Kok Kohzad this hill, it is reported, was called the Kuh-i-Atash Khana and inhabited by people who kept themselves apart from the other inhabitants of the Khwaja’s pretentious mausoleum is situated on the summit to the north-east, inside which is the tomb ; all round are seen the usual profusion of votive offerings, lo the south, opposite the shrine, the plateau is covered all round with graves; the people of the country consider it the highest type of respectful burial to be planted up here, and on Nauruz the Deputy Governor, officials, and local quality, make a pilgrimage here. Alono- the east face also are many ancient tombs, both on the skirts of the hill, an hi-h up along the cliff sides, indeed, at first sight, I took these to be some sort of defence works, as they looked like old substantial Sangars; they must be, I think, ot very ancient To the south-east, nestling under the hillside and along its slope, are the extensive Rash Kak. ruins of the ancient town of Rash Kak, which extracts from the Nama-i-Qadim ul Aquam (book of the old days of Seistan) show to have been one of the strongholds in tne earlier days of Zal, father of Rustam. The remains of other ancient military defences are seen at various points on the summit. From the buildings and legends it would appear that these buildings and the city belonged to a period prior to the Arab conquest. In addition to the ruins there are large reservoirs (Haoz) for the collection of surface water after rain, and there seems to have been a scarcity of water in those days when the Hamun was not surrounding the hill. Our guide pointed out the site of an ancient spring to the left of the pathway leading down to the rums of Rash Kak. This requires but sinking, when a supply ot water could be tapped. Water could easily be got, too by sinking a well in the plain, but an inexhaustible hot weather supply is obtainable during the time the Hamun surrounds it. T&gt; . . , This hill completely commands the approaches to Seistan from Birjand and ^ ch &gt; ^ te ^ ca and could be made a strong defensive position as well as of great strategic importance. oJ — — Khwaja. * In Captain the lion.

Birjand is an entrep6t, second only in importance to Turbat-i-Haidari, of those in Khorassan south of Meshad, and is only eight stages from Herat. # Amir—Haji Ismail Khan Shank-ul-Malk. Sartip—Mahommed Ibraham (younger brother of aboye). Naib—Mustufi Mahommed Baza. Darogha—Baharam Beg. Rais (postmaster)—Haji Misza Mahommed Ali (Tabrizi). Kalantar—Mahommed Kuli Khan. Wazier—Haji Nsaf Beg. Pesh Kidmat—Shazad Beg. Amir Panj—Haji Perrohz Khan. The Naib is reported by all the inhabitants to be “ eating the country up, and the Shauk-ul-Mulk is not cognisant of his tyranny.” The Postmaster, Haji Mirza Mahommed Ali, who is a Tabrizi, and is well-known to the Russians at Tabriz, has been settled here by Russian influence as their accredited agent; he speaks Russian and has visited St. Petersburg and Moscow. This appointment is of significant importance, and is one of the reasons why I carefully sent no despatches through this office to Colonel Yate, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Meshad {vide Report on Mission to Seistan, p. 14). Amir Khan (Khandahari), who lives in the bazar, late musician to Mir Alum Khan, father of Haji Ismail Khan, is very kindly disposed to all Indian travellers and helps them in every way, he has been in India himself and claims to be a British subject. He rendered my people considerable aid during their stay in Birjand. For description of Birjand, see Captain Napier’s report. The fort, the residence of the Amir, is situated about a couple of miles south of the city under the slopes of Kuh-i-Mahomed Bagarim. Present garrison consists of— 600 infantry. 100 cavalry. 6 new pattern guns (description not known). 6 old „ 50 horses of artillery. All the horses are now out in the villages grazing (22nd August 1897); no grass, and forage very scarce in Brijand now. Brijand is not a fertile spot, and is almost dependent on Buzard and Seistan for all grain and forage. Ibriham Khan of Julga, who is reported to be a large landed proprietor, and who has lately built a new residence, is stated to have under his command 400 sowars and 500 infantry; there are some 1,000 Sunni Khanas on his property. Mir Hassan Khan, a cousin of the Amir’s, is reported to have 500 irregulars and footmen. There is a weekly dak (post) from Meshad to Seistan, via Birjand, kept by sowars and runners. I got our advances of several hundred rupees by this post from Colonel Yate when we ran short. It was escorted from Birjand to Meshad by my own cavalry escort. My people stayed, by leave of the Amir (which had to be obtained before they could even enter the town) in the Amir’s caravansari, situated in the centre of the city. It is a large building, containing 24 lower rooms, and a similar number of rooips on upper story. A nominal charge of ^ to 1 kran per diem is made for rooms. * Stages to Herat.—(1) Bust Gaz, 8 farsakhs; (2) Gazik, 9 farsakhs; (3) Shoral, 8 farsakks- (4) Yazdan, 5 farsakhs; (5) Kaland, 5 farsakhs; (6) Moghal Bacha, 8 farsakhs j (7) Kak-i-Herat 'Tahrah 6 farsakhs; (8) Herat, 6 faraskhs.—B.-C.53 Bazar prices.

The prices of all supplies had gone up considerably since the closure of the routes on plea of plague, and the people were much troubled by the restrictions and closing ot all routes, as also by the actions of the Eussian officers, who niade tehuma Khanas (house to house visitation) till stopped by the clamour ot the inhabitants. The people complained bitterly of oppression and discontent, and all are adverse to Feeling of Russia gaining possession of the country and occupying it; they desire British protection, and were all pleased on hearing that the British Grovernment had caused the beistan routes on the south to be opened, and those on north to Herat.56 Appendix A— continued.
