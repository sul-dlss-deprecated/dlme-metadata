H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. beraorandum;- I have the following comments, to make on the Report of Inspector Crowe forwarded to me under your Printed Letter No. C/105 dated the 24th January 1946, and on his previous report dated September 1945, to which he refers in his letter. !• The candidate who was first chosen for the post of Inspector of Police in charge of the Detachment seconded for service in Bahrain wps not Inspector Crowe but another man who unfortunately failed to pass the medical examination prior to leaving England. 2. Arrangements for Inspector Crowe’s voyage from the United Kingdom to Bahrain were made by the authorities in England. He and the other British Police were ex pected to reach B ahrain by steamer from Basra in about the middle of September. Inspector Crowe with two other men arrived by air on 29th August and a telegram announcing his arrival, which was sent from Iraq, was received on the day after he reached Bahrain, consequently arrange ments had not been completed for their arrival. The three new rooms which had been added to the Fort Bungalow, w hich was allotted to the British Police, were still in the hands of painters and carpenters when the Police arriv ed. 3. Inspector Crowe was told by me that he could occupy the Inspector’s quarters in the Fort Bungalow or the flat in His Highness's building adjacent to the Public Relations Office, which was fully furnished. He decided that he would prefer to live at the Fort where he could share the expenses /-3/--- - 2 - &lt; V Hoi' $+1 CV* , expenses of messing and servants with the other British Police. 4. The Detachment arrived at a time of the year when the climate was at its very worst, the weather was hot and excessively sticky. Inspector Crowe and the men who arrived with him were entertained by me in my house until Inspector Crowe said that they could carry on independently at the Fort. At the time I was waiting for an air passage to England, proceeding home on leave after seven years without home leave, and I was extremely busy. I did not take my meals with the British Police in my dining room. I understand that this created an unfortunate impression in Inspector Crowe’s mind. I had several long talks with him and with Sergeant Cochrane before I left Bahrain and I explained to him the work and the duties which the Police were to undertake. 5. The Police were provided with eight new bicycles . and one motor bicycle, the Police pick-up and lorries were also available. Inspector Crowe was authorised by me to use taxis when necessary for duty, these were available. 6. Inspector Crowe stated to me that he was told in England that all Bahrain Government buildings are air conditioned. This is not so, no buildings are air conditioned but a few A.C. units, suitable for small rooms, exist, though as no spares have been obtainable during the war only three or four of these machines were in working order, most of them being in use in the hospital. 7. A quantity of china, kitchen equipment etc., etc., which had been ordered from India many months befoi*e, did not arrive be fore the Police reached Bahrain. No electric refrigerators could be obtained in Bahrai''' so two ice boxes were made by the State Engineer's Department by my orda'anfor use at the Fort.-3- 8. Various other statements in Inspector Crowe's letter of 10th September 1945, are inaccurate and mis leading, the laundry at the Fort was available for the British Police, no gas exists in Bahrain and the oil lamps were issued to the Police for Use while the electric power was not working, the office previously used by the commandant of Police was arranged for the British Police and additional fans, from my house, were installed there, on 7th October 1945, the living allowance was increased by Rs. 100/- per month. On the day after the Police arrived I arranged with the O.C. Troops that they should be supplied with British Army rations, these are paid for by the Bahrain Government and cost approximately Rsyl,160/- per month. Thus within four weeks of their arrival the British Police were granted Rs.245/- in additional pay and rations. In addition to this the Bahrain Government waived the recovery of the cash advances which had been made to the British Police by the authorities in England beforethey embarked, this amounted to £30/- in the case of each Police Officer and £50/ T in the case of Inspector Crowe. 9. Regarding Inspector Crowe's letter of 19th November 1945, written presumably on his return to England, on 31st October, as a result of reports received by me in England regarding Inspector Crowe's behaviour in Bahrain I tele graphed to Mr. G.W.R. Smith, the Acting Adviser, and instructed him to discharge Inspector Crowe. The telegram was received by Mr. Smith at 4.30 p.m. on 1st November. The following day, Friday, was a holiday. On Saturday, first thing in the morning, Inspector Crowe arrived at Mr. Smith's Office with a letter of resignation in his hand. The fact that Inspector Crowe was on very friendly terms with some of the staff of Cable and Wireless leads one to think it possible that his resignation coinciding with/--4- with his dismissal may not have been altogether a coin cidence . 10- Inspector Crowe’s letter of 19th November consists mainly of complaints against Shaikh Khalifah, the Super intendent of the StateePolice, who during my absence on leave v/as in-charge of the Police Force. It must be ad mitted that it was unfortunate that I left Bahrain a few days after the arrival of the British Police which result ed in Shaikh Khalifah having to deal with the complaints and difficulties of the new detachment but as far as I c^n ascertain he did his best to improve their conditions and to familiarize them with their duties* If Shaikh Khalifah had not ’’assumed control' over the detachment it would have been impossible for them to learn to undertake the duties for which they were enlisted. The degree of usefulness which, on my return from leave, I find they have now attained reflects well on Shaikh Khalifah's direction of their duties. 11. Regarding Inspector Crowe himself, it is my consid ered opinion from my personal knowledge of him before I left Bahrain and from the reports about his conduct which I received while in England, that he was an entirely un suitable man to be appointed to this post. From the moment that he arrived in my office, straight from the flying boat he was full of complaints, not complaints % abQtitlthe ,! 6onditlons of' hi&amp; men but complaints about his 'loss of prestige' by having been sent out second class, i at not having had an official welcome on the peir and about the cut of the uniform with which he v/as provided. On the day after his arrival I had a long talk with him and he objected strongly to having to shake hands with 'natives', these being in fact the Arab Police Officers, who, like everybody else in Bahrain use this form of greeting. He attahhffid more importance to his own social position and-5- personal prestige than to his duties and implied that he knew more than* me about what things could or could not be done by Britishers. He told me that he held a position equivalent to a Major in the British Army,which I doubted, though I had no definite information on this point, and he objected to the type of rank badges which were in use in Bahrain, these being based on the Indian style, he was much concerned as to how to style himself on his visiting cards. A day or two days before I left, without orders or authority from anyone, he paid a visit to the Brothel Area where he summoned a number of ladies of the town and gave them a talk through an interpreter which caused a consider able commotion in the town next day. He appeared to be under the impression that his mission in Bahrain was to re-organise entirely the existing Police and he resented the presence of the Arab Police Officers, with the exception of Shaikh Khalifah who he appeared to accept mainly because Shaikh Khalifah was His Highness's first cousim. After my departure I learned that he was associatigg with various un desirable members of the community. It was reported to me that he was on bad terms with some of his men and that he was stirring up others to make complaints. I decided that if he remained in Bahrain there would be serious ^rouble and therefore I telegraphed to Mr. Smith telling him to discharge Inspector Crowe and to appoint Sergeant Cochrane in his place. I informed Mr. Harrison, at the India Office, of all the facts on his suggestion I had an interview with / y UAAA\UL' Mr.Witney of the Home Office and then with Sir Drummond of Scotland Yard. At the last two Offices I gained the impression that there seemed to be some doubt as to who had actually decided that Inspector Crowe was suitable for the post* Sd/- C.Dalyrymple Belgrave Adviser to the Government.Of the eight men whom we recruited for the Bahrein State Police, Inspector Crowe has resip^ned (before he was asked to go) and P.C,Robinson has apparently returned to duty in this country. The Bahrein Government have not asked us to recruit any police officers to replace them nor I think should we entertain an irregular application such as the one below.

With reference to your letter of the 18th December to Witney about a request you have received from Inspector Cochrane of the British Detachment of the Bahrein State Police for an increase of basic salary for the Detachment, I enclose herewith a comparative table of scales of pay for constables and sergeants in this country before and after the 1st April, 1945, and a note of the rates in force for the same periods for the rank of Inspector in the Northamptonshire County Police Porce, which is Inspector Cochrane’s home force. We are, of course, not in a position to assess the value of the pay which members of the Detachment are receiving when it is looked at in the light of conditions in Bahrein and therefore do not feel able to express an opinion on the merits of the claim for an increase. An increase in the pay of the British police is clearly not in itself any reason for an increase in that of the Detachment, but those who volunteered would certainly have taken into account a comparison of the two rates, in existence at the time, and if the Bahrein people would like to see them renew their contracts they would probably be well advised to allow at least an increase corresponding to the English one. We should have no objection to an in crease being given. 1 - IN INDIA 'You LETTER RECEIVED ' I s sincerely, F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., I «£Ca. pa.
