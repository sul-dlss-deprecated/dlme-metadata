The memorandum records a number of proposals for debt relief put forward by the Government of India, the Foreign Office and the Chancellor, made on the basis firstly that the majority of the debt consisted of war loans against which it was feared the Persian Government might have grounds for a counter-claim, and secondly that a number of concessions might thereby be won. The memorandum was written by John Gilbert Laithwaite, India Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Debts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001bc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
