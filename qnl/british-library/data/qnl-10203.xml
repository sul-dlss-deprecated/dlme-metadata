Respected Sir, We beg to submit herewith, a Memorial, to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, praying that our claims to the Gadi of Baroda will receive the favourable consideration of His Excellency in Council, if it is found necessary to effect a change in the administration of Baroda ; and we shall feel extremely obliged by your kindly forwarding it to its destination, with such observations as you may be pleased to -offer thereon. We trust that your own personal knowledge of the conduct and general bearing of the different claimants and their families, coupled with that derived from the Residency Records, will no doubt go to form a correct opinion about them. Hoping the accompanying Memorial will meet with your cordial support, We beg to remain, Respected Sir, Yours obedient and obliged Servants, GUNPATRAO and KHANDERAO, GAIKWADS. [True Copy.]To His Excellency the Richt Hon. THOMAS GEORGE BARING, Baron NORTHBROOK, of Stratton, Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. The Humble Memorial of GUNPATRAO and KHANDE- RAO, GAIKWADS, Residents of Baroda, Most Resi'ectfully Siiewetii,— That your Excellency's Memorialists are lineal descendants of Mhalaji, the brother of Pillaji, who both first raised to eminence the family of the Gaikwads in Guzrath, as will appear from the Gcncological Table herewith annexed. 2. 'That yonr Memorialists are the sons of Gopalrao Gaikwad, whose close relationship with the reigning GaikWads, and whose loyalty to the Para- monnt British Power, has already secured them a guaranteed allowance from the Gaikwads of Baroda. 3. That your Memorialists are aware of the claims to the Gadi of Baroda, set up by Sadashivrao alias Rao Saheb, whose open hostility to the British Go vernment during the stirring times of the Indian Mutiny of 1857-58, near Ahmedabad, is alone sufficient to set aside all claims, as the British Govern ment cannot but view such claims with disfavour. It may also be mentioned here, that Sadashivrao alias llao Saheb, who was born in the Samvat year 1895, was no minor, when he took up arms against the British Government,^ pp. 39G, 281, 307, 581, by Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace, and was eventually re moved by British Authorities, first at Surat, and afterwards at Ahmedabad, on account of his ' turbulent spirit ' and ' reprehensible conduct.' Lieutenant- Colonel Wallace thus speaks of him in his work, pp. 581 :—' Govindrao Guikwad is now in the custody of the Durbar and is well treated ; he is im becile, has lost the greater portion of his extremities from the ravages of Indian leprosy, and has in all probability nearly coma to the close of his restless and unfortunate career.' 4. That your Memorialists are also aware of utterly novel and cleverly patched-up claims set up by Gabajirao, Baburao, Kashirao, Ookhajirao, and Sakharamrao bin Bhikajirao Gaikwad, residents of Laval a ne, Talooka Malli- gaum, Nassick District, who were never before recognized as the near relations of the reigning Gaikwads of Baroda. They having never received any Nem- 4) fc-i. irtaic4y ( 2 ) uoolcs or allowances from the Baroda State is itself a strong proof of their permanent disconnection with the Gaikwads of Baroda. 5. That your Memorialists most respectfully submit that it is needless to mention here of the claim of the infant-child of Laxmibai, as it is on all hands declared, that the marriage of Laxmibai being utterly illegal and without any precedence, the issue of such marriage (being a full-grown child of nine months), after five months from the date of the marriage, cannot necessarily be legitimate. / 0, 1 hat ^ oui Lxceliency s Memorialists most respectfully beg to refer for the correctness of this, their Memorial, to Sir Lewis Felly, who has always show n them marked consideration and kindness, ever since his arrival as your i xcellency's Agent and Special Commissioner at Baroda. /. That your Memorialists most respectfully submit and pray that their claims to the (xadi of Baroda will receive the favourable consideration of your Excellency in Council, if this found necessary to effect a change in the adminis tration of Baroda, And your Excellency's Memorialists, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.
