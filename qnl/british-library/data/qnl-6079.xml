The 14th. March, 1945. I &amp; I enclose copies of telegrams seen in censor ship for your information. ?• . I tried without disclosing the source of my information — to find out from Holmes what concessions were referred to; but he treated me to a long rigmarole on the iniquities of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and tried to give the impression that he was trying to buy back certain alienated interests in the oil concessions for the sea-bed areas round Bahrain; but the telegrams would appear to indicate that he was trying to sell something possibly the interest in that concession that remains to him and his partners. He wanted to see Hamilton in Bahrain, but instead met Ed. Skinner of the Bahrain Petroleum Company in Basra by appointment. 3. I am not aware of Holmes’ remaining interest in the Bahrain or Qatar oil concessions and these telegrams do not convey much to me. I trust, however, that wiey are more intelligible to you.
