All the guests were then introduced by the aides-de-camp to the; Viceroy and his wife. ’ he n these form alities were completed the guests were invited to taiee lunch and took their places in the great dining hall in the seats which had been allotted to them* All the servants were Indians and most of them GiAhs* They xffore long red clothes with cummer bund and red turban and in accordonqe with custom performed their duties barefooted. One servant waited on three guests and attended them with the utmost care. After lunch a small bell which had be?en placed on the table near the Viceroy was rung and complete silence /prevailedLord Willing don made a opeech in IngliBh in which he y alluded to the good relations and friendly connections existing t between Iran and India and expressed his pleasure at the journey of the Minister for Foreign Affairs adding that such journeys and contacts were the cause of strengthening the relation ships between the two countries Iran and India* He welcomed the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the capital of India and in conclusion raised his glass and drank to the health of His Imperia Majesty. All the guests at once raised their glasses and applauded and the music of the Iranian national march was played in an adjoining room. During the playing of the national march all the guests stood to attention. After a few moments the bell was rung again and after a silence the Minister for Foreign Affairs speaking in Fnglish thanked the Viceroy for his friendly feelings and warm and sincere reception and at the end of a note worthy speech drank the health of the King of Ingland, whereupon all stood up and applauded* After lunch in accordance with the usual formalities the guests were conducted into an adjoining room where they engaged in conversation. The numerous and magnificent rooms each beautifully decorated and containing costly objects and furniture, some with carvings and marble stones, some with valuable paintings and pictures, drew the attention of those present. In one of the rooms near the fireplace this piece of Persian poetry was writtenj- W A God who devised the throne of heaven has power to create such a palace”. Kvery room was furnished with the objects and ornaments of a particular country and one room was resplendent with costly Persian treasures. Over the mantlepiece of this room the following lines of poetry were carved in large Persian characters on a marble stone:- /”The sky N'The sky has never seen on earth a palace of such grace and beauty and elegance'. After some minutes the aides-de-camp of the Viceroy showed the guests round all the buildings of the Palace and the reception rooms and the assembly hall used by the Viceroy on official occasions when the Ministers and high officials are present and gave the necessary erplfmations* They also brought to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affaire and his companions all the details of the buildingBt gardens and apartments and at 3 p.m. the reception terminated.' I feel that you should have a record of the conclusions we reached, as far as we were able to go, regarding possible discussions with Kazemi and his delegation. The subjects were 1. the troubles of British subjects in East Iran and the difficulties of our Consuls. 2. the possibility of Kazemi raising the subject of frontier definition. 3. The Duzdap Railway. 4. Commercial Questions. 5. The Vice Consular rank of Major Pyper. 6. Visas for Lorry Drivers operating on the international Lahedan Nok Kundi Road. As regards point 1 I suggested that we should take the line that, anxious as we were to be friendly and helpful on any matters which Kazemi wanted to raise, we felt very strongly that before anything could be done we must ask them to remedy these grievances. We indicated this in . a telegram to the India Office No.3141 of November 20th, I enclose a copy. I asked the Viceroy to rub this in when he saw Kazemi and I drew up a note for him for the purpose. I enclose a copy for record: it is much the same as the letter I wrote to Soheily (see my despatch No.570 of 26th December).

But Lord Willingdon told me afterwards that he had spoken about the difficulties of our Consuls. 2. Frontier definition. I enclose a note (enclosure 3) showing the line we decided to take. You will see that we intended to head him off the Northern section by appearing to think that the Southern undemarcated section was much the most important but that owing to the fearful expense and difficulty of such an undertaking it seemed best to leave matters as they are. 3. Duzdap Railway. See enclosure 4, which is a minute of our decisions drawn up by Metcalfe. I think it speaxs for itself. 4. Commercial Questions. See enclosure 5. You will see that it was realised that we could not commit ourselves on major commercial questions and in particular as to the future after the termination of the present Tariff Autonomy Treaty, a matter which concerns His Majesty’s Government as much as the Government of India. Certain minor commercial questions were also discussed, actually the Nok-Kundi Road, Tea imports and the duty on turquoises. We found that we could do nothing to meet Kazemi on any of these points. The Nok Kundi road is akin to the Duzdap Railway question and moreover it is not in point of fact a road at all. (Loxley who came back via it says incidentally that on the whole the going is not too bad). We could do nothing to lessen the tea restrictions of which the Persians complain, without breaking our engagement with /otherother tea producing countries e. g. the Dutch; and as regards the duty on turquoises we could do nothing as the duty on ,, stones ,, and on ’’precious stones” is the same and to degrade turquoises into the ”stone” class would make no difference, 3o that in some ways it was as well that Kazemi refused to discuss anything, otherwise he would have gone empty away, A conversation did take place between Motamedy, Garoe and Loxley in which many of these points were brought up (including others besides the commercial ones, but of course not frontier demarcation) but it was only in very general terms to give Motamedy an idea of what was being thought in India, 5, Major Pyper. See enclosure 6, We decided that the Persian arguments could not be contested and that the functions of Vice-Consul and doctor must be separated, Motamedy was informed of this and asked if the Iranian Government would agree to allow the present position to continue until some new arrangement could be made, 6. Visas for Lorry Drivers. I enclose a minute by Metcalfe and another by Garoe. Subsequent information obtained by Loxley on his return journey via this road shows that the solution proposed has certain dangers. The enclosed minutes are therefore only for record. We are awaiting a further expression of views from Daly, after which we shall have some more to say about it. Yours ever, (Signed) H.M. KNATCHBULL-HUGES3ENEnclosure 1. Telegram XX No. 3141 dated 20th November, 1935. From Viceroy, F and P. Department, New Delhi. To Secretary of State for India, London. Important. Your telegram No. 3705 of 18th November. In conversations with Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which will be entirely informal, it is proposed in the first place to draw His Excellency’s serious attention to the unsatisfactory position in East Tran as regards both treatment of British Indian subjects, pilgrims etc. and difficulties in relations between His Majesty’s Consuls and Iranian local authorities. It will be explained to him that there are serious financial and practical difficulties regarding settlement of concrete questions such as Duzdap Railway and commercial relations and that it is in any case impossible to make any serious progress until general position in East Iran has been remedied. We shall of course emphasise our anxiety to improve our commercial and general relations with Iranian Government if above mentioned difficulties can be overcome. 2. Viceroy will speak in above sense at opening interview with Kazemi. Considerations in paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 3705 are being kept in mind. 3. Hugessen has seen and agrees with sense of this telegram.Enclosure No. 2. Note on questions affecting the relations 'between the Government of India and the Iranian Government. The Government of India are most anxious to cooperate in removing any misunderstandings and difficulties which may exist. They have already given proof of their goodwill in the proposals made to the Iranian Government for measures to he taken in British Baluchistan to facilitate the action of the authorities on the Iranian side of that frontier in dealing with disaffected tribesmen, thefts and so forth. Many of these proposals have actually been put into force although the Iranian Government have not as yet given their final reply to suggestions first put to them over six months ago. It is understood that Mr. Kazemi desires, during his visit, to discuss certain points and in particular those connected with the commercial relations between the two Governments. The Government of India are quite prepared to examine the possibility of improving commercial relations and indeed of improving Indo-Iranian relations in general. But they feel strongly that an essential preliminary to any real progress is that an improvement should be brought about with regard to the position of the many British-Indian subjects living in East Iran. The reports which they receive and have received over a long period cause very serious concern. Briefly they cover cases of expulsion of British subjects without cause or at least explanation, illegal arrest, arbitrary domiciliary searches carried out without proper warrant or authority, punishments inflicted without statement of the charge. Even in cases where the individuals concerned are guilty this involves a departure from usual procedure and an/Rn injustice. Other cases have occurred where persons have been waken to police stations, harshly used and questioned and then released with no explanation. Frequent complaints reach New Delhi also from Mahomedan pilgrims of the treatment accorded to them by customs officials in Iran. It has been shown that these pilgrims are subjected to continual customs visits even in the interior of the country when they have passed the frontier customs posts. On several occasions their belongings and personal wearing apparel have been confiscated 8n d only recently a wealthy Bombay merchant returning from Iraq with a large party, after passing the frontier customs post, had all the saris belonging to the ladies of the party confiscated at Damghan in the interior although they had evidently been worn and were in personal use. No attention was paid to his statements and he was finally forced to sign a paper in Iranian although he did not understand it. A further serious matter has been the action of the local military authorities in forcing British Indian lorry drivers to operate in disturbed anr 1 dangerous zones. Last December there were cases in which inadequate escorts had been provided, drivers had lost their lives or been wounded, one was publicly beaten for refusal to serve, many have received inadequate payment for their services. A claim for compensation in many of these cases h' s been before the Iranian Government for the last six months and more. This claim has been admitted by the local military authorities to be fair. Nevertheless it has so far proved impossible to dispose of the matter. Another point is the refusal of the Iranian authorities to give visas to British Indian lorry drivers to work on the international Zahedan-Nok kundi road, much less in Iran, although the Iranians are now trying to corner all the traffic for a subsidised company of their own. The/The accumulation of these points creates a situation which is viewed very gravely here and it is inevitable that in course of time it will react on public opinion and quite possibly provoke comment in the Press or questions in the Legislative Assembly. But there is another and still more serious matter, which is to a great extent responsible for this evil state of affairs namely the fact that our Consuls are completely cut off from communication with any of the local authorities except the Governors and Governor General. The effect of this is that all social and friendly intercourse is impossible: this estrangement produces misunderstanding and suspicion which is aggravated by the fact that the only occasions on which our Consuls have any contact at all are when they have some complaint or grievance to bring up. The Government of India feel that they have already given proof of their desire to meet the Iranian point of view by the proposals they have made in the matter of the Baluchi tribesmen and that before any further progress can be made it is essential that the Iranian Government should remedy this very unsatisfactory state of affairs by ensuring proper treatment for British Indian subjects, remedying the grievances enumerated above and in particular making it possible for British Consuls to live on terms of friendship and confidence with local officials and others and carry on their duties in the normal manner. (N.B. It might be well to mention the satisfaction caused by the action of the Iranian Government in paying over £500 for the losses and expenses incurred by J/r. and Mrs. Hart owing to the shooting affair last year on the Meshed-Zabul road and also their action in modifying the recent order for the expulsion of all Berberis from Meshed so as not to include British subjects).Enclosure 3. Iranian-Baluchistan Frontier. It was considered in consultation with Minister, Tehran, what should be the attitude of the Government of India if Monsieur Kazemi were to suggest in Delhi the demarcation on the ground of the two undemarcated sectors of the Indo-Iranian frontier. The three sectors are: (a) The portion from Kuh-i-Malik Siah to Boundary Pillar No. 11. Northern undemarcated sector. (b) The portion east of Kuhak from Boundary Pillar No. 1 to Boundary Pillar No. 11, which was demarcated on the ground by Colonel Holditch in 1896. (c) The long stretch from Kuhak south to the sea at Gwattur- Southern undemarcated sector. 2. The position as regards (a) is that a correct map has been drawn by Captain Bomford. The Holditch line as drawn on this map (blue line) in the straight northern sector passes right through our posts of Piran and Lar and only just west of the important post of Robat. We actually patrol a good way west of this line and the frontier which we require is what is known as the McMahon red line. This, however, cannot be supported by agreements and our position therefore is to main tain the status quo , and not raise the question of demarcation on the ground, and if the Iranians raise it to endeavour to put them off. 3. The southern undemarcated sector rests on the Goldsmids delimitation of 1871. It is verbally defined in Minister, Tehran's (Mr. Alison) letter No. 131 of the 5th September 1871, enclosing a copy of his letter to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and is marked on a map prepared by a subordinate/subordinate commission in the following year under the orders of Major St.John. As far as we are aware there is no later map than Major St.John's of 1872, and it is probable that it is not very accurate. It has therefore been suggested that if the Iranians raise the question of demarcation of any part of the common frontier on the ground, we should endeavour to divert them to this sector. We can point out that frontier delimitations of the northern sector was sufficiently arranged by the joint commission attended by Captain Komford in 1932, and that if any work is now required it should take place on the southern undemarcated sector, particularly as we have no later papers than 1872 dealing with this sector. At the same time we may add that the whole frontier is covered by written agreements and that in view of the sparsely inhabited character of the terrain and the few incidents which take place, we deprecate the heavy expenditure which would be entailed by boundary demarcation in this difficult and desolate country. 20.11.35.——Enclosure No. 4. Duzdap Railway. The question of* the attitude to 'be adopted tov/ards Monsieur Kazemi’ on the subject of the Nok Kundi-Zahidan Railway was discussed with the Minister and it was agreed that we should put the position to Monsieur Kazemi on the following lines: (a) explain that the re-opening of the Railway would, in present circumstances of international trade between India and Iran, inevitably cause considerable financial loss to the Government of India. They could not therefore be expected to consider incurring this financial loss, unless the Iranians on their part undertook to accord much better treatment to Indian subjects in Persia than they had recently been giving. (b) if the Iranians gave us clear evidence of their determination to accord reasonable treatment to all Indian subjects in Persia, we should be prepared to consider on their merits the financial and other difficulties which beset this question. Apart from the financial difficulties referred to above, Indian trade at present suffers under grave disabilities owing to the monopoly system and vexatious and excessive duties which the Iranian Government have recently imposed. Some relaxation of these restrictions would certainly be required before a valuable concession of this kind can be made by the Government of India, but it will be time enough to consider the &lt; actual desiderata of the Government of India when the first condition mentioned in (a) has been satisfied: (c) it might also be pointed out that there are certain technical obstacles to be overcome as regards separate stations etc., which would have to be settled by negotiation before any general agreement could be reached; and (a)/(d) the final position of the G. of I. therefore is that they must first insist on (a) and would be prepared to take up the matter with regard to (b) and (c) only when (a) is out of the way. (Sd) H. Metcalfe. 21.11.35.Enclosure 5 Commercial Questions. Tehran telegram and despatch from Chargd d f Affaires dated the 1st November on the subject of the Iranian Govern ment’s decision to terminate the Tariff Autonomy Treaty next May was shown to Minister. It was observed: (a) that India was not receiving the benefits to which she was entitled under Article II, in that the Iranian Government under their Foreign Trade Monopoly Law had declared cotton piece-goods as a Government monopoly and had imposed monopoly tax on such goods. They had also levied surcharge on the rates 'of the Iranian minimum tariff to meet the fall in the value of their currency. Article II of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty therefore had not been a safeguard for Indian exports to Iran. Moreover, Article IV which forbids prohibitions with certain exceptions has not been observed by Iran as she applied prohibition not covered by this article, and has given exemptions to the Soviet Union from prohibitions. (b) That even if this Treaty disappears, India would be entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment for her commerce in Iran on terms of reciprocity under Article 9 of the Treaty of 1857 and Article 2 of the Treaty of 1903. (c) That India therefore need not be greatly concerned with the termination of this Treaty, and we need not in any case press for a new treaty. If Monsieur Kazemi raises the matter, our attitude should be non-committal. (d) That the Treaty is not between India and Iran only, but between Great Britain, India, and Iran. Obviously therefore we cannot commit ourselves in any way to M. Kazemi. 20.11.35.Enclosure 6. Major Pyper. Decided after discussion with the Minister that it is impossible to continue the present arrangement by which the Surgeon to the Consulate-General also acts as Vice-Consul at Sistan. It is obvious from Foreign Office telegram No. 110, dated the 12th November, 1935, addressed to Tehran and repeated to India, that H.M.G. also share this view. The best plan therefore appears to be to attempt to overcome the isi and other objections to the restoration of a senarate Vice-Consul at Sistan. Meanwhile, if, as is anticipated, the question is discussed with Mons. Kazemi at Delhi, we should take the line that we intend to separate the two functions and to restore the /ice—Consul at Zabul; that there are, however, certain financial and practical considerations involved which maKe it impossible to do this at once and we shall therefore be grateful if the Iranian Government will agree to allow the present system to continue for a short time until some other arrangement is made. 19.11.35.Enclosure No.7. Note on discussion regarding treatment of Indian Lorry Drivers on Zahidan-Nok Kundi road. This matter was discussed with the Minister, Tehran, on the basis of a note prepared by Mr. Caroe. It was generally agreed that the best line to take with Monsieur Kazemi was as follows; (2) to refuse at present to grant long term visas for Iranian drivers of lorries belonging to the new subsidised Iranian Company. The reasons for this refusal being (l) that the Iranian officials at Zahidan are at present causing great loss and annoyance to Indian drivers by various methods detailed in Mr. Caroe^ note, (2) that until some reasonable transport rates are fixed by agreement between the Iranian local authorities and Indian Consular authorities at Zahedan, there is an inevitable prospect of rates being undercut by the subsidised company and Indian drivers and lorries being driven not only off the Iranian stretch of country between Mirjava and Zahidan but also off the Indian stretch between Nok Kundi and Mirjava. (b) to explain that we were anxious to achieve an understanding between ourselves and the Iranian Government for the future regulation of this traffic as between Iranian and Indian competing lorries. The lines on which we should like an agreement would be those set down in paragraph 7 of Mr. Caroe’s note, which could be explained generally but not in detail, to Monsieur Kazemi. If he considers these to be generally reasonable we should suggest that/that steps should be taken after consultation with our consular authorities in Iran to negotiate an arrangement of this kind through H.M. Legation at Tehran, and (c) it should be made plain to Mons. Kazemi that, if the present attempts of the local Iranian authorities at Zahidan to force Indian drivers and Indian owned lorries not only off the Persian roads, but also off the Indian road as far as Nok Kundi continued, we on our side should be compelled to adopt more stringent measures, such as refusing visas altogether to Iranian Lorry Drivers to proceed beyond Mirjava. We fully realise that this would be met with reciprocal action and that Indian drivers would not then be allowed to proceed beyond Mirjava in the direction of Zahidan. But this we were prepared to face, since it would at any rate secure for Indian drivers a monopoly of the Indian stretch of the road. Such an arrangement would however cause great dislocation of traffic and inconvenience to the public and we were therefore very loath to impose such restrictions, if the Iranians on their part were disposed to be reasonable and to agree to an arrangement such as is suggested above. 2. The question was also briefly discussed whether restrictions of this kind would be effective for preventing Iranian owned lorries driven by Indian drivers from plying on the Indian side of the Frontier. Mr. Caroe explained that there were considerable legal difficulties about this and that it was best at present not to raise the question. It may be hoped that a withdrawal of visas for Iranian drivers would, if it had to be adopted, induce a more reasonable frame of mind and render further action against Iranian owned lorries unnecessary. (Signed) H.Metcalfe. 2.11.35.Enclosure No. 8. LORRY TRAFFIC ON NOK KUNDI - ZAHIDAN ROUTE. In 1931 a reciprocal arrangement was made for the grant of long term visas to Indian and Iranian drivers and cleaners on this route. The visas were available for three months for any number of journeys. British visas to Iranian drivers were issued by the Vice-Consul, Zahidan, while Iranian visas to Indian drivers were issued by the Iranian authorities also at Zahidan. 2* As part of the Iranian policy for preventing foreign artisans from working in Iran, the Iranian authorities have recently obstructed the working of this arrangement. This has been done by the following means. Under the reciprocal arrangement the Indian driver has to get to Zahidan to obtain his long term visa. As Zahidan is in Iran, he is not permitted to cross the frontier until he has obtained an Iranian entry visa in India. When there was an Iranian Visa Officer at Quetta, this could be done at Quetta, but now the nearest point is Karachi. Such entry visas are not granted, so that no new Indian driver can get to Zahidan to obtain a long term visa. Simultaneously every obstacle is placed in the way of those already working at Zahidan by cancelling their long term visas if they go back to India beyond Nok Kundi. If therefore they wish to remain working on the route, they can never visit India. 3. At the same time the Iranian Government are seeking to increase the difficulties of the Indian driver even on the Indian section of the road by introducing lorries/^ * lorries worked by a subsidised company known as the East Iran Company, Owing to its subsidy the Company can operate at uneconomic rates and is in a position to oust private lorries. The Governor General, Khorasan, asked for long term visas on the 1931 arrangement for 15 lorries of this Company. In view of the fact that Iranians were placing every obstacle in the way of Indian drivers working in Iran and that subsidised lorries would drive Indian lorries even off Indian roads, these visas were refused. The latest development is that the Company are seeking to circumvent this refusal. (1) by employing some Indian drivers, and (2) by employing Iranians who have already obtained long term visas for driving privately-owned lorries. 4. we have heard that the Government of India’s refusal to grant visas to the Company has considerably perturbed the Iranian Government, and it is understood that the matter will be raised by M. Kazemi at his forthcoming visit. We have now to decide on what our attitude should be. 5. The above summary shows that there are two sides of the problem : (a) Obstruction to Indian drivers operating in Iran beyond the frontier. (b) Attempt by the Iranians to oust Indian drivers even on the Indian side of the frontier by subsidised competition. The Government of India’s desiderata are to obtain a full/full and free reciprocal agreement whereby both Indians and Iranians may work over this international route on equal conditions and at rates wnich are economic* The history of the case shows that the Iranians have adopted every expedient to prevent a fair working of the long term visa arrangement of 1931 and to cut out Indian drivers not only in Iran but on Indian section of the route. It therefore seems unnecessary to bring them up short by the adoption of methods of retaliation as being the only means which may in the end lead to a reasonable compromise. In support of our attitude we may also cite the serious ill- treatment by Iranian officials of Indian lorry drivers during the recent disturbances in Iranian Baluchistan. 6. The method by which we should proceed might be as follows. Colonel Daly’s despatch of the 17th April 1935 suggests that he should be granted full authority to apply retaliatory measures without delay, the present difficulty being that unjust action by the Iranian authorities leads to voluminous correspondence and no decision for many months. As the first step therefore we may grant him this authority. The best means of applying retaliatory methods would seem to be as follows : (1) We should maintain our refusal to grant visas to the East Iran Company. (2) We should withdraw all long term visas issued to Iranian drivers. This course of action will no doubt be met by the Iranians/Iranians withdrawing all long term visas from Indian drivers in Zahidan, and the result will he that Indian drivers will work between Nok Kundi and Mirjawa, while the stretch from Mirjawa to Zahidan will he in the hands of Iranian drivers, hut, as pointed out by Baluchistan and Colonel Daly, the exclusive right to Indian drivers to carry on their section of road will at least give them a certain assurance, and may well incline the Iranian Government to he reasonable. It will at least defeat the present attempt to 'drive Indians even off roads in India. 7. We may inform Monsieur Kazemi that this is the action we are forced to take and at the same time add that we are at any time ready to negotiate a fair agreement. The terms of such agreement might he somewhat as follows (1) Indian and Iranian drivers will have full and equal rights to work over the whole route between Nok Kundi and Zahidan. (2) The rates of transport should he fixed by agreement by consultation between His Majesty’s Consul-General and the Governor-General to be accepted by the Government of India and the Iranian Government. The owners and drivers should be consulted on the rates which should be fixed at a scale which will allow of economic working. (3) Long term visas, which might be for 6 months rather than for the old period of three months, should be granted on a reciprocal basis. If so desired, the local authorities on each side may fix in consultation the number of visas to be issued by each authority. (4) No other entry visas should be required either into India or Iran. (5)/(5) Visas will not be cancelled during the term of their validity, if the drivers leave the route for any pui pose, without consultation with the Governor-General or the Consul-General as the case may be. (6) When a long term visa falls due for renewal it should ordinarily be renewed, and issue of a fresh visa will not be refused without consultation with the Governor- General or the Consul-General as the case may be. (7) Until and unless the Iranians permit Indian lorry drivers to work beyond Zahidan, Iranian drivers will be restricted to Nok Kundi. The above should be regarded as a rough outline only of a possible agreement which might be negotiated. 8. I have two further suggestions. These are :- (a) That the effect of adherence to the International Motor Vehicles Convention of 1926 should be examined. Iran has adhered to this Convention, and India has been a member for some time. It may be found that Iranian action on this international route is in direct contravention of the terms either of the Convention itself or of the Traffic Rules thereunder. But this point should not be mentioned to M. Kazemi, as it has not yet been examined or Legislative Department consulted. (b) Baluchistan have suggested that maintenance of the Iranian attitude in this matter might be met by the with drawal of the rebate on railway freight on goods booked to Nok Kundi. This suggestion raises big issues which would require further examination. Such action might recoil on Indian traders. But it may be borne in mind. (Signed) 0. K.

Department. :{939 5000 7 35 As on this question the S. of S. may not see quite eye to eye with the G. of I., this procedure has its disadvantages, though there is, I think, no need for us to object to it. The feeling of both official and public opinion in India, referred to by Sir A. Metcalfe, that India ought not to contribute as she does at present to the Persian posts seems to leave out of account the important consideration that her contribution gives her a degree of influence on policy in regard to Persia which she would probably not otherwise have; as regards public opinion, it is in a way paradoxical that those who look forward to obtaining control of the G. of I.’s foreign relations should be willing to whittle down the sphere of the G. of I.’s present influence. bor' &amp; / &lt;■ ^ 4 . ’ * o/ 'C+ ^ Oy yr - ^ J (j ^ ^ w ^ fetu.

Oi oj ately to be expected that the ^'•0#, and oerhaps also the Persian Govt., would oppose this. The alternatives therefore appear to be either to continue more or less as at present, or to face the sacrifice or impairment of India's very real interests(especially in East Persia) for the sake of getting rid of the contribution and the comparatively small saving that that would involve. It is doubtful whether adequate protection of Indian traders and residents in East Persia could be secured through Levant Service officers unfamiliar with their language and problems. .India also has a very important interest in that country as one of her buffer states. Copy is attached of an unofficial note which Mr. Laithwaite recorded on the F. &amp; P. file m India, andof an i i extract of a personal letter which I have sent to Sir A. I/etcalfe on the subject. ^ it. ^Extract from private and personal letter from Mr. Walton to Sir A. Metcalfe, dated 21st February, 1936. XXX Laithwaite has shown me a copy of the unofficial note which he gave you about questions (c) and (d) in your letter. My personal opinion is in agreement with his about the transfer of the Residency from Bushire, but we shall see what Fowle has to say. as regards (d), it seems really imoortant that in East Persia the consular posts should continue to be manned by officers from India, in order that their occupants may be able to deal efficiently with the interests of Indian traders and residents, and the interests of India generally on her eastern frontier. And one is not at all attracted by Hugessen’s compromise suggestion that officers should be supplied from India to work in subordination to members of the Levant Service. In view of India's great interest in Persia (especially East Persia) as a buffer state, and the additional influence on H.M.G.'s policy in Persia which she obtains by paying half the expenditure in that country, it has always seemed to me (personally) unwise for the Indian public to jib at the contribution. Perhaps, if it were possible to man the posts with Indians, the opposition to the contribution would disappear/disappear, bat unfortunately it is to be feared that such a proposal would be resisted by the Foreign Office, and by the Persian Government also. It seems doubtful, therefore, whether there is any course compatible with India’s interests excent to continue the nresent arrangements. The financial saving on the contribution hardly seems worth the sacrifice or impairment of those interests. (Moreover, would the saving be as big as it looks? We should have presumably to find employment for the displaced Politicals elsewhere; but perhaps there would be no difficulty about that.) These are my personal views, and there is perhaps a further important consideration - viz .. that m considering any change m Persia we should have to look at it as part of a wider question, because, if India's share in the manning of the Persian posts were given up, we might find Afghanistan and Nepal less satisfied to continue under existing arrangements.^ rnk Foreign Secretary. I am sorry to have kept these very interesting papers so long and very grateful to you for allowing me to see them. I do not think that there is very much that MX I can say. I agree entirely with the criticisms of the Foreign Office proposals contained in the notin vand more particularly in your letter to Mr. Walton of - December. I would* however* venture to urge a suggestion which I have made in conversation* both with the Foreign Office and Mr. Hugesepn* that action on the lines proposed is exceedingly short-sighted from their point of view. As the file points out they are very anxious to exclude Indian personnel altogether* and they have not been prepared in the past to admit Indians into their consular service or the like. They do not fully realise in the case of £ast Persia the nature and extent of Indian commercial and other Interests* and the extent to which familiarity with Indian languages* Indian administration and the working of the Government of India is necessary for their satisfactory disposal. There has always seemed to me to be a very serious risk from the Foreign Office point of view that the exclusion of Indian5' from Kast Persia* followed by half a dozen cases in which the Persian attitude was indefensible* might lead to some political awkwardness here* and to a demand that Indian^ should be re-instated in these posts or that Indians should be sent to Meshed* and possibly to Tehran* to represent India. This is* of course* an argument which it is difficult to pursue in official correspondence* but I feel sure that there is some force in it. As regards finance* I feel little doubt that the Foreign Office are so anxious to establish themselves without competition in Persia that they would be prepared to make some financial sacrifice* though if they think that the battle of the consuls is more than half won already they will drive a harder bargain. I would make no concession except on own terms. As regards difficulties with the Persians over individuals* these are familiar* and the Persians are naturally anxious to eliminate officers who* by their knowledge of the country and language and their political training* are in a position to see rather too much. The allegations of Hugesson are* however* unduly apprehensiveof the Persians making difficulties over exequators and this is recognised by the Kastern Department. Hie trouble which arose over Captain Woods Ballard is a case in point. And we were advised (c.f. papers on the Persian Treaty file) that even if the Persians made difficulty about one or more individuals they could not maintain objections to a series of Officers on purely personal grounds. As regards Bushire, I agree entirely with the noting. Hor do I think that any special difficulty will be seen at home to a move if the Government of India are satisfied as regards its financial aspect. But I venture to suggest that in the event of a move we should either (a) make it a condition that the Officer to take the place of the Consul-General, Bushire, should be a political, or (b) if it hay-been decided in principle not to send politicals to South Barela, that the Resident should have the right to communicate direct with the Consul, to call for reports within certain defined limits, and to receive automatic repetitions of his intelligence reports and diaries. making any concession there. In the first place I under- stand, it is an Intelligence centre of great importance - importance from the Indian standpoint. We are likely to encounter much more considerable difficulties in main taining our organisation if the post is handed over to the levant Service. Secondly, the events of the last two or three years have emphasised the need for experienced and ^ tactful Political Department personnel at Meshed and Seistan. It is unnecessary to labour this point. It will be remembered that we have had three or four incidents in which, while we were in the right, there was the making of very serious trouble. With increasing Persian control in £ast Persia this frontier seems to me likely to become of much greater importance. It is obviously essential ths Lro~i^ JLxauhM^a.

This seems most unlikely to be secured if he comes from the Levant Service. I agree finally to the objections to representing the Government of India in Persia merely by an occasional junior officer working under Levant superiors. Ihere is, I think, also great force in the suggestion that if India loses Bushire and Meshed, or one of them, and withdraws her personnel from Persia, it must inevitably affect the degree of 1HS&amp; influence on Persian policy, even if she does still continue to make some contribution to consular expenditure. /And, while it is ^perhaps no longer the case, 0-7 djUAjUl*+-4Ar4- ^ Ua JXjff ^Up to the time of the ^k.P.O.C. concession ^our relations with Persia were of importance primarily because she bordered on India, the Indian aspect is still of very great importance indeed. ^(/i.

Kazemi f s impressions regarding their visit to Delhi. You will also have received by now demi-officially a copy of the note which Caroe recorded on the 22nd Novr. after his discussions with Loxley and Mons.Motamedy regarding a number of questions in issue between the Iranian and Indian Govts. That note however does not cover all the ground which was traversed in conversations between the Viceroy, Hugessen and myself and I enclose a few other notes on the following subjects: (a) Border delimitation between Baluchistan and Iran. This question was not actually raised by Mons. Motamedy in his discussions with Caroe and as you know Mons.Kazemi himself declined to discuss any official business^. We thought it however as well to be prepared against a dis cussion on the point if raised by the Persian Foreign Minister and Caroe T s note represents our general position 3 QD! with regard to this question. You may like to have a copy for record in case the question comes up again. ' ' (b) Iranian objections to the continuance of Colonel Daly in his present appointment as Consul-General,Khorasan. You■ You will remember the private and personal correspondence which took place between Hugessen and the Foreign Office while I was on leave on this subject. Hugessen told me that although the matter had not again been referred to by the Persians, he thought it most unlikely that they would acquiesce indefinitely in Daly f s remaining at Meshed, and therefore thought that from the point of view of general relations it would be wise to move him when an opportunity occurred, but not just at present. I am examining the question further, but do not think that it will be at all easy to shift Daly from Persia, where almost his entire service has been spent, so that he is hardly qualified for employment elsewhere. (c) The proposed removal of the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrain. This note was recorded by the Minister who ; like all his predecessors^is extremely anxious to get the Political Resident ohifrbsd out of Persia. We realize that the India Office had&amp;never favoured the pro posal and that there are very grave objections of a financial kind to its being carried out. We have therefore not in any way committed ourselves on the subject and have merely agreed to the Minister raising it again with the Foreign Office if he wishes to do so. Before he does so, we are writing to u // r ^ Fowle asking him for his views in the light of developments since the question was last raised. I think that a copy of our letter with this note has already gone to the India OfficeOffice by Weekly Letter. Personally I find it rather difficult to produce valid arguments apart from the financial issue against the proposal, but perhaps Powle if he still feels strongly on the matter will find some ___ (d) Employment of Officers of the i 1 or. &amp; Pol. Dept, at Consular posts in Iran. This note was also recorded by Hugessen after a discussion which had taken place with the Viceroy. As you will see we have here also merely agreed to the Minister raising the question with the foreign Office. There is a great deal in my opinion to be said on both sides. On the one hand there is, as you know, a strong feeling here headed by H.E. the Viceroy and supported both by official and public opinion that India ought not to contribute as she does at present to diplomatic and consular representation in a Foreign country. Public opinion also of course goes further and considers that, if India is to continue to pay, a proportion at any rate of the more important posts should be given to Indians, and that is a solution which would be definitely unacceptable to the Iranians. On the other hand, we here feel strongly that Members of the British Consular Service are net equipped either by training or by language qualifi cations to deal with the difficulties that arise in Iran over Indian subjects resident in Iran. ». e think therefore that■ I Sit eiU© 'i*' ^ in &lt;MClc**rH+. -4- that the substitution of British Consular Officers for Officers of Indian Services would result in a definite deterioration of conditions of life for Indian subjects in Iran which are at present none too good. It would also result to a great extent in loss of knowledge here as to conditions in Persia which would re-act unfavourably on Indo* Iranian Trade and other relations. Hugessen f s suggestion that the Govt, of India should supply subordi nate officers to work under Members of the British Consular Service does not seem to us at all practicable or desirable, though there might be no objection to a Member of the For. &amp; Pol. Dept, being included among the staff •of H.M. T s Legation at Tehran. My general feeling is that the only condition upon which we could consent to a change in the present arrange ments would be that we should be relieved entirely of all charges for diplomatic and consular representation in Persia except possibly for a few remaining posts for which we might supply personnel. This would mean a considerable addition to H.M. T s Govt. T s expenses and I am doubtful whether this would be acceptable. However we shall be addressing you officially on bhe whole subject when we see Hugessen T s suggestions. &lt;«e are at present examining the question whether it would be possible for Military Political OfficersOfficers to drop their military titles while employed in Persia. This presents considerable practical difficulties since their pensions depend upon their continuing to hold actually employed in Persia, but they would still retain their military rank and a camouflage of this description might merely increase Persian suspicions of their true character. You may be also interested to have a few general observations regarding Hugessen T s and Kazemi's visit. Both were I think / impressed with what they saw of India and it is all to the good that Kazemi should realize how great an influence is exercised at present in India by prominent Indians. Although no official conversations took place with Kazemi, the Viceroy had a long private interview with him at which H.3. complained of the treatment accorded in Iran to our Consular Officers and also Indian subjects. It seems doubtful whether this conversation produced much effect upon Kazemi, and even if it did ( Kazemi is probably too weak by nature and too frightened of the Shah to express his real opinions. However on the whole I think that we may be satis fied tnat the visit produced valuable results in clearing up a certain number of disagreements^,which were largely based Secy.,Pol.DeptIndia Office, London. on misunderstanding of the other’s point of view J.C .Walton,Esqr. ,C.B. .M.C., • )\J • U • j f/i • V • fExtracts from no r f £ + | 9327 ' tes on. File ^^«£06-N/3 Q^uest ion of demarcation of Iran Bal uchistan frontier . It was considered in consultation with Minister, Tehran, what should he the attitude of the Govt* of India if M. Kazemi were to suggest in Delhi the demarcation on the ground of the two undemarcated sectors of the Ind^-Iranian frontier. The 3 sections are (a) The portion from Kuh-i-Malik Siah to Boundary Pillar No.11 - northern undemarcated sector. (h) The portion east of Kuhak from Boundary Pillar No.l to Boundary Pillar No.11, which was demarcated on the ground by Colonel Holditch in 1896. (c) The long stretch from Kuhak south to sea at Gwuttur - southern undemarcated sector. 2. The position as regards (a) is that a correct map has been drawn by Captain Bomford. The Holditch line as drawn on this map (blue line) in the straight northern sector passes right through our posts of Pi ran and Lar and only just west of the important post of Robat. We actually patrol a good way west of this line and the frontier which we require is what is known as the McMahon red line. This, however, cannot be supported by agreements and our position thereforeis to maintain the status quo , and not raise the question of demarcation on the ground, and if the Iranians raise it to endeavour to put them off. 3. The southern undemarcated sector rests on the Goldsraid’s delimitation of 1871. It is verbally defined in Minister, Tehran’s (Mr.Alison) letter No. 131 of the 5th September 1371, enclosing a copy of his letter to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and is marked on a man prepared by a subordinate commission in the following year under the orders of Major St. John. As far as we are aware there is no later map than Major St. John’s of 1872, and it is probable that it is not very accurate. It has therefore been suggested that if the Iranians raise the question of demarcation of any part of the common frontier on the ground, we should endeavour to divert them ^ this sector. We can point out that frontier delimitation of the northern sector wag sufficiently arranged by the joint commission attended by Captain Bomford in 1932, and that if any work is now required it should take place on the southern undemarcated sector, particularly as we have no later papers than 1872 dealing with this sector. At the same time we may add that the whole frontier is covered by written agreements and that in view ofr the sparsely inhabited character of the terrain and the few incidents which take place, we deprecate the heavy expenditure which would be entailed by boundary demarcation in the difficult and desolate country. (Sd.) O.K. Caroe. 20- 11- 35.Extract from notes Subject Disturbances at Meshed in 1935, and Iranian allegations against Col. Daly. I discussed this question with Mr.Hugessen yesterday and he told me he would be grateful, if we would bear in mind the possibility of transferring Tol. Daly when an oooortunity arises. He is particularly anxious that no such transfer should take olace in the near future, since that would aopear to be due to the Persian complaints. He would also like the transfer, if possible, to appear to be in the direction of promotion. I told him that I anticipated great difficulties in transferring Col. Daly to a better post, since his experience had been entirely in Persia and owing to the large allowances paid at Meshed and the comparatively independent nature of the post, there were hardly any more desirable posts anywhere in India or the Persian Gulf. X on Pile NO.307-N of 1935. Sd/-H.A.P.Metcalfe, 22-11-35.Enclosure (b)» Political Residency at Bushire. H.M’s Minister represented the view strongly held by himself and the Foreign Office that the Residency should be transferred to Bahrain. The evacuation of the naval bases at Hen jam and Basidu had introduced a new factor. The importance of Bushire as a centre had declineo practically to zero, it was difficult of access by sloops of the Persian Gulf division, the Political Resident was far removed from the Arab Coast where his presence was necessary,he was in many respects a hostage in the hands of the Iranian Government who refused to recognise him and who could make his movements difficult and his position undignified at any moment. His transfer to Bahrain would put him in close touch with the Persian Gulf Division and on the Imperial Airways route between London and Delhi, it would also have the advantage of increasing our prestige on the Arab side of the Gulf. H.E. the Viceroy favoured the proposed transfer on general grounds. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India pointed out that in 1934 the proposal to transfer the Residency to Bahrain had been dropped mainly on financial grounds. The financial considerations involved were very serious and he doubted whether either the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to find their share of the estimated £100,000/-. There might be subsequent economies in travelling and telegraphing by the Pol. Resident, but the initial outlay was calculated to be very heavy. Moreover it would entail giving up a post at Bushire where some officer ought to be maintained in case of collapse at any time of the present regime in Iran. H.M’s Minister said that, this last point was a distinct matter. There would be no question of leaving Bushire without a British official. In the present state of affairs a Vice-Consul would quite possible be sufficient, but the question of the organisation of our Consulates in South Iran was one requiring examination. Bushire was now almost a dead city whereas Abadan had grown and was continuing to grow into a large and important centre, Mohammerah was an active commercial centre and so was Ahwaz which alsc-k- also had the railway and is the residence of the Governor General of the Province. As to the importance of keeping some British official at Bushire as a safeguard in the event of a collapse of the present regime H.M f s Minister entirely agreed* but he thought that this was a master for which the Legation at Tehran should be responsible: it did not seem to concern the question where the Pol. Kesident should live* as his responsibilities lay on the Arab Side. In general it appeared that there was a measure of agreement that from the political and administrative as distinct from the financial point of view the transfer was desirable, but it was thought necessary before proceeding further to obtain the views of the Pol. Kesident himself. Mr. Metcalfe undertook to do this.* • u I Jl v/* K*. I'fy ,u Employment of officers of the Por.&amp; Pol.Dept.- at Consular posts in Iran. AIa^v^vy^ h l fas,. J His Majesty’s Minister raised this question and suggested the desirability of all Consular posts in Persia hitherto filled from India being taken oYer by the Foreign Office and filled from H.M* s Consular Service. He explained that although the objections raised in 1934 by the Iranian Govt.hare not been persisted in and although all recent requests for the acceptance of nominees from India hare been acquiesced in f he did not consider that the difficulty had been finally disposed of. Trouble was almost certain to revive when the time came for changes of H.M’s Consuls General at Meshed and Bushire. Bushire would Moreover be complicated by considerations of maintaining the Political Resident there,to which the Iranian Govt.had in the past objected. The present system no doubt contriouted to the difficulties experienced by our Consular Officers in dis charging their duties and,though H.M f s.Minister was far from wishing to suggest that a change should be made merely for the sake of pleasing the Iranian Govt.,he felt that a change was desirable and he knew that the Foreign Office were strongly in favour of it. He made the personal sugges tion, subject to reference in due course to the Foreign Office that the best so&amp;ution would be for the posts all to be filled from the Consular Service but for the posts concerned to have,where necessary in some subordinate &amp;&amp;&lt;$£ capacity,an officer from the F.&amp; P.Dept. equipped with the expert knowledge of the Indian side of the work which was absolutely necessary at these posts. H.E.the Viceroy expressed himself in favour of this solution as it would relieve the Govt.of India of the expense of their present contribution to the maintenance of these posts. H.E. had also suggested that the question of filling subordinate posts from the F.&amp; P.Dept. and of any necessary financial or other readjustments might with advantage be examined oy a Committee. The\ « (59 (*) The Foreign Secretary to the Gort.of India pointed out certain objections to the suggested change. In the first place the Govt.of India might be reluctant to abandon posts which they had filled for a considerat&gt;le time. This consideration might oe partly sentimental and as such of no great wight but it also included the necessity,in the interests of the Govt.of India,of maintaining their influe nce and organisation in those parts of Iran in ease of any collapse of the present regime. As to this it was felt, after discussion, that the main responsioility lay with H.M.G. through H.M’s Minister at Tehran. A more important point was that the Govt.of India would expect to be reliev -ed of their quota of the expenses of these posts and ther« was a danger that they would thus forfeit their right jto oe consulted as closely as at present on matters of policy affecting Persia. Tt was suggested that this last con sideration would be met if the Govt.of India continued to pay the salaries of the subordinate officers whose expert knowledge of local problems would still render them indis- pensible. It is also for consideration whether it would not be desirable for a Member of the F. % P.Pept.to be included in future among the staff of H.M*s Legation at Tehran,where knowledge of Indian matters(which form so large a proportion of the daily work of the Legation) would be of great value. It was finally agreed that if the Govt.of India could be assured that they would be relieved of a substan tial portion of their present financial contribution the event of the proposed change being introduced,they would probably be prepared to agree, and that with this proviso H.M f s Minister might put his proposals before Seuy.of State for Foreign Affaires. It was thought that if any such change were to be introduced the present moment would be the most favourable as the introduction of the Constitutional Reforms in India would inevitably in time open the way to pressure from the Indian side for admission of Indians to Consular0 » -1- • ^ Consular posts which, in view of the attitude adopted by the Iranian Govt, in 1934,would threaten to create still further difficulty. H.M* s.Minister then raised a further point which he hoped could be dealt with independently of the JJU general question,namely the military rank at present by the Consuls from the F. p c P. Dept, in India. The objections to this from the Iranian point of view were well known and it certainly gave the impression that a niecleus military organisation was being kept up in Iran. The Foreign Secy, to the Govt.of India explained the administrative reasons for which this arrangement existed but on further exami nation it appeared possible that the question of abolition of military titles for officials employed might be feasiole Mr.Metcalfe undertook to look further into the matter.

I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, 3d/- W • K. Fras er- Tytl er • The Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, GCSI.,GBS.,CMO., &lt;le«, c•, do•^maRA'wm fhe Iranian Minister for foreign Affaii^s arrived at Hew Delhi from Poshawar on the morning of rfOveia&amp;er 21st. He wns met at the station toy the Military Secretary to the Viceroy and an A.D.C* I was alao present. M.Fazomi am M* Mo tamed y stayed nt the Viceroy*s House till the afternoon of November ?,i&gt;rd. I called on His tixcellency in his rooms shortly after his arrival in order to take him to present to Hia Excellency the Viceroy. M. y^iremi expressed himself as most grateful for and highly pleased by the reception and hospitality accorded to him but took the opportunity to state that his visit wrs purely one of courtesy to the viceroy and that he did not wish to discuss any business. He subsequently made the same statement to the Viceroy. I nea somewhat surprised at this for the reason that the mi*ga8tion that commercial affairs should be discussed had originally emanated from M.Fazero! himself. He had moreover, in accordance ,/ith his original proposal, actually brought with him experts in the persons of H.lfotamecy, M.Kcyhan and M*Mcftnh. Realising however from discussions which I had previously had with the Foreign Department of the Government of India that there was little prospect at present of any of the Iranian desiderata being met I did not press the point. I suggested however that it woulc be unfortunate if the opportunity were not taken- 2 - ' r \ sftvantare of at loaet for a general aieousalon of crnttere of mutual interest and said that preparations had in fact been ~mde for such a conversation. M*K&amp;z«ni said thet M.Motamedy could attend fjuch a discussion but thf t he himself preferred to iceep away. A conversation subsequently took pl^ce Detween Mr* Garoe, Deputy Foreign Secretary, -'r. Loxley and M*Fotamedy on certain outstandln#i: matters, of sfhieh a record is enclosed herewith* I am inclined to think that Juraaemi’s reluctance to talk business way have been due to certain rather definite statements which had appeared in the Indian pi'ess to the effect that while in Delhi he would negotiate an agreement regarding the 2&amp;nedan Railway and the ]fok Fundi Road* A similar statement is to be found in the London 'Times'* of November 7th, page 13, column 4* These statements, which may have scared His Kxcelleney, were clearly without authority am at M.K&amp;aemi*e request steps were subsequently taken to correct them ana to present ?Tis Bbccellency*s visit in its proper light* M^'agemi ms received by the Viceroy on the morning of his arrival and was greatly touched and pleased by His Kiccelleney*s cordiality. He conveyed to Lord Willing?!on a personal message of friendship from the Shah, to which His jCxcellcnoy returned a suitable reply. In the ensuing conversation Lord willingdon touched upon the unsatisfactory position with regard to British subjects in-o- iSast Iran and on fcho diffioultiee exparienoed by Hi© Majesty’s Conmilar uffleers in those districts owing to th ir inability to associate with local Iranian authorities with the exception of the (Mnremore. on the evening of Wovewber 21et M.Karemi ainad with Sir C •P«E&amp;naswaafti Aiyer who entertained fheir Excellencies the Viceroy and Lady willi?igdon at a dinner of some one hundred mu fifty people. In replying to his own toast Lord willingaon took the opportunity to say a few worus of welcoae to the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affair* am to express the friendly feeling felt in India for Iran, on the following night iUKasserai and M*Motamedy were present at Viceroy’s House at a farewell dinner given by the viceroy to the Comm end 8r-in-»Chief in India. On Saturday, Hovenber 23rd, Lord and Lady fillingdon gave a luncheon party in honour of MvF&amp;semi at v/hich the health of His Imperial Majesty the Shah was drunk, some fifty persons being present. M.Kazerai made a speech in English expressing in the friendliest terras his appreciation of his reception and his desire for increased good feeling between India ana Iran. The same evening I attended a dinner given in M*Kazeml v s honour by the Iranian Conmil-aen ral at Delhi. The remainder of M.Kaxeml 1 e time was spent in sightseeing. He left for Simla with his staff on the night of Noveiabor 23rd intending to return to Tehran by boat leaving Bombay on December 5th for Moharamerah. In the interval he proposed to visit Simla, Kapurthala4&lt; (having been invited by His Highness the Maharajah to stay for a night), Agra, Caloutta, Benares, and Hyderabad. He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying his visit p-nd informed 6ie that he had postponed his return to Iran for a week in order to see more. The (Jovernnont of India were showing hia every possible courtesy in arranging facilities for him at all places which he might wish to visit. As I shall in all probability be joining the same boat at Karachi on December 8th I shall have every opportunity of ascertaining his subsequent impressions on our journey up the Persian Gulf to Mohammerah. In so fpv as M.Kazemi’s visit to Delhi is concerned I pm satisfied that it has been highly successful. Both he and M*Motamedy were deeply impressed by what they saw and, I think, distinctly flattered by the courtesy shown to them* 5:hey both assured me that the visit had been an experience of the deepest interest and that previously they had hod no idea whatever what India was like: they had never imagined that it was as they found it. I fear that they must have supposed that the India of today and the India of Clive were identical. But any such in ression must, I hope, have vanished for ever and in my opinion one of the most valuable factor* consisted in their meeting prominent Indians such ns Sir C«P» Ramaswami Aiyer, Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai and others and realising the relations of equality which prevail between British and Indian. in his capacity as actiiMember of Council for jSducation* Health and Lmde, Sir Oirja Bajpai waa able to offer to telegraph on M.Kazemi T s behalf to Agra to arrange special facilities for hira to be shown the Taj Mahal and other nomunents and to Benares for him to risit a Hindu temple, which he was anxious to do» The fact th? t these froilities could be arranged by an Indian rather than an :cngliahnen made, I think, so^o impression on Hi» excellency# M*Kazemi took leave of Their Excellencies on the afternoon of November 23rd and insisted, as X am told, on being photographed vrith them# &lt; hen I met him the same evening at dinner with the Iranian consul-aeneral he again expressed his gratification at the courtesy shown to him# He informed me th t he had telegraphed direct to the Shah in this sense. H.K-H# Kabul, November,29th, 1935#Minute by l r r« Caroe of conversation with M*Motai»i«dy ana Mr.Loxley on certa in pending questions between the Govornraent of India and the Iranian Government• I met this morning in ray room M*‘iotanedy f the head of the jin'Xish section in the Iranian Foreign office. The mooting was also attended by ?fr• Loxley, the Second Secretax*y of the Tehran Legation, nntl M.Hourgiad, the Consul-Gon ral for Iran in In^ia • M.KOtminedy spoke French throughout and I spoke iingllsh* The following is a brief account of our discussions. 2. M» totamedy referred to an article in yesterday^ statesman*, which he thought gave M.K&amp;eerai's visit to India undue significance, am askad that some sort of dementi should be issued to make clear that the visit was entirely informal. I said, that there seemed no objection to this, and I thought something could be done. Ha then raised the question o the road between Nok Kundi ana the frontier, which he stated was in an appalling condition. I said that this was not really a road st all, but only a track over the aesert. It would cost many lakhs to make a road, and we could not consider this unless the transport arrangement* on the international route between Nok Fundi and zahidan were placed on a more satisfactory footing then at present. 4* ?e then discussed the difficulties experience! by Indian lorry drivers on this route. I said tlv t we could not grant visas to the lorries of the Iranian company until a fair and reciprocal arrangement for$ working lorry traffic on this route had been concluded, rnd this agreement would have to include some 3)rovi9lon for fixing the number of lorry drivers on each side and also fixing the rates• He said that fixation of rates vv&amp;s out of the question. I adhered to the position that some rate tariff was esaenti&amp;l. From this the conclusion emerged that until an agreement had been reached, it v;oulo be necessary to limit traffic on the Indian side of the frontier' to Indians, and on the Iranian side of the frontier to Iranians. Mr. Loxley suggested he should exnmine details when he went through zahidan on his return to Iran, find we left it at that. 5. I then raised the question of failure to pay compensation for Indian lorry drivers killed and wounded in Mekran, and told if.Motamedy frankly that we took a very serious view of this case. In response to a question whether there \ms any chance of getting any satisfaction, he informed me that he thought there was. were subjected. I said that we had always to remember that our good regions might be seriously disturbed if complaints of this kind were to get in o the India® press. I doubt, however, whether M.Motamedy took this argument very seriously. 7, e then proceeded to ctisouss the consular position in zabul. I said thrt the Iranian objections to a consular and medical charge being combined in one person could noteasily be refuted, anc the O^rreyiBaant of Inriia, admitting the ^uetiee of the Iranian contention, interv ed to separate the two ftmotions and appoint a separate Viee Couptul at zabul. fhere were, however, naturr lly financial difficulties involved in the creation of a now post, and I said we should be fateful if his Government would agree to the present system continuing for a short time while these were being examined* He lid not demur, and asked for how long, in answer to which it was suggested two months might suffice* He took a note of this* He then raised the question of the Jdahiaan railway* I attempted to make it quite clear that we could not in any case consider this on merits until The atmosphere had been cleared by the Iranian Government giving an earnest that Indian sublets in Eastern Iran would receive better treatment than they had hitherto. After that I said we were not ooponed to extension on principle, but in the present state of Inbo-Irsnian trade, the railway would inevitably v/ork at a considerable loss, so thst we would have to be assured that a definite financial or commercial advantage elsewhere could be obtained either by improving the prospects of Indian exports to Iran, or by other means. I also made it clear that technical difficulties as regards such natters as the erection of two stations at Mirjawa remaine for consideration* For our station we should no doubt re uire a lease of land from the Iranian Government* I reitoreted that the ouestion could not in any case be consider-*d on its merits un^il the position as regards the-4- tror t of In-Uons had cleared. /*\ g # v/a then o^lecusaod the tee control over the land frontier, and I explain© the ayatem which had been adapted. M#Motanedy seeded to think th; t we had rone waa to impose an export tax on tea, I explf ined to him, after consulting ‘'r.Stewart.Secretary, Commerce Department, on the telephone, that this wee not the case at all* e now require licensee for ell exporte of tea over the lend frontier or by sea, the fee for license being only a maa four per hundred pounds and being Intended to cover the cost of administration of the 3!«a Kestx’ietion Scheme# I also explained to him, :fr#Loxley translating, the system on which the control had bean imposed and the reasons for its imposition, on the lines of the notes which have been recently recorded on the relevant file. He gave the following statistics to show that over the period from 1930-51 to 1933-54 the total imports into Iran of Incian tea had not been greatly increased, the only difference being that most of the tea which p eviously went by sea now went by land: 1950-51. via zahidan. 290,160 mms. Via other routes. 1,197,244 mans. 1933-54. Via zahidan. 1,622,700 mans. Via other routes. 164,^36 mans* (1 man - 6* pounds)* I undertook to show this to the Commerce Department* 10. He then asked whether the duty on turquoises could not toe reduced. I pointed out that as preoiouastones they ware subject to a duty of 25/! ad valorem * Their removal from the category of precious stones would not lead to any reduction of duties, and as now precious stones and articles not specifically mentioned in the tariff were also liable to a duty of 25^, nothing therefore could be done* Similarly duty on Iranian wine could not be decreased as this would involve granting a preference to Iran. At this point he asked whether natural products of Iran, e*g. wine, spices, wool, etc., vould be subject to the tariff when l?Jid cue tons were imposed* After telephonic consultation v/ith the Central Board of Revenue I replied that this line had not yet been set up, but as far as could be seen at present the tax*iff would not include such articles, and would be chiefly directed ag inst piece goods* 11* At the close of the interview he again reverted to the question of the zahiaan Railway, and asked if all difficulties would be removed provided we obtained satisfaction as regards treatment of Indian subjects in Iran* Mr*Loxley and I, I think, together succeeded in explaining that although this was the first desideratum, we could not, if we secured it, consider the construction of the railway further until the whole position was most enrefuiiy examined on fin noicl ana commercial grounds. 12* The interview then concluded with a short lecture by M*Kotamedy on the advantages of collaboration and equal treatment.

I have the honour to be with the highest res set, iir f Your most obedient, humble servant,) 7' Copy of a record of an interview with M. Motamedy. I met this morning in my room M. Motamedy, the head of the English section in the Iranian Foreign Office. The meeting was also attended by Mr. Loxley, the Second Secretary of the Tehran Legation, and M. Nourzad, the Consul General for Iran in India. M. Motajj(edy spoke French throughout, and I spoke English. The following is a brief account of our discussions. 2. M. Motamedy referred to an article in yesterday’s ’Statesman', which he thought gave M. Kazemi’s visit to India undue significance, and asked that some sort of dementi should be issued to make clear that the visit was entirely informal. I said that there seemed no objection to this, and I thought something could be done. 3, He then raised the question of the road between Nok Kundi and the frontier, which he stated was in an appalling condition. I said that this was not really a road at all, but only a track over the desert. It would cost many lakhs to make a road, and we could not consider this unless the transport arrangements on the international route between Nok Kundi and Zahidan were placed on a more satisfactory footing than at present. 4. We then discussed the difficulties experienced by Indian lorry drivers on this route. I said that we could not grant visas to the lorries of the Iranian company until a fair and reciprocal arrangement for working lorry traffic on this route had been concluded, and this agreement would have to include some provision fixing the number of lorry drivers on each side and also fixing the rates.

In response to a question whether there was any chance of getting any satisfaction, he informed me that he thought that there was. 6 . From this we passed to the treatment of Indian subjects generally in Eastern Iran. Mr. Loxley explained the vexatious customs searches to which pilgrims to Meshed were subjected. I said that we had always to remember that our good relations might be seriously disturbed if complaints of this kind were to get into the Indian press. I doubt, however, whether M. Motac^edy took this argument very seriously. 7. We then proceeded to discuss the consular position in Zabul. I said that the Iranian objections to a consular and medical charge being combined in one person could not easily be refuted, and the Governnent of India, admitting the justice of the Iranian contention, intended to separate the two functions and appoint a separate Vice Consul at Zabul. There were, however, naturally financial difficulties involved in the creation of a new post, and I said we should be grateful if this 'Governnent would agree to the present system continuing for a short time while these were being examined. He did not demur, and asked for how long, in answerto to which it was suggested 2 months might suffice. He took a note of this. 8 . He then raised the question of the Zahidan Railway. I attempted to make it quite clear that we could not in any case consider this on merits until the atmosphere had been cleared by the Iranian Government giving an earnest that Indian subjects in t Eastern Iran would receive better treatment than they had hitherto. After that I said we were not opposed to extension on principle, but in the present state of Indo-Iranian trade, the railway would inevitably work at a considerable loss, | so that we v/ould have to be assured that a definite financial or commercial advantage | elsewhere could be obtained either by improving ! the prospects of Indian exports to Iran, or by other means. I also made it clear that technical difficulties as regards such matters as the erection of two stations at Kirjawa remained for consideration. For our station we should no doubt require a lease of land from the Iranian Government. I reiterated that the question could not in any case be consiaered on its merits until the position as regards the treatment of Indians had cleared. 9. We then discussed the tea control over the land frontier, and I explained the system which had been adopted. M. Motamedy seemed to think that what we had done was to impose an export tax on tea. I explained to him, after consulting Mr. Stewart on the telephone, that this was not the case at all. We now required licenses for all exports of tea over the land frontier or by sea, the fee for license being only As. -/V- per 100 lbs. and being intended to cover the cost of administration of the Tea Restriction Scheme. I also explainedto him, Vx. Icxley translating, the system on which the control had been imposed and the reasons for its imposition, on the lines of the notes which have been recently recorded on the relevant file. He gave the following statistics to show that over the period from 1930-1931 to 1933-34 the total imports into Iran of Indian tea had not been greatly increased, the only difference being that most of the tea which previously went by sea now went by land:- 1930-31. Via Zahidan. ..o 290,180 mans. Via Other routes. 1,197,244 ' 1933-54. Via Zahidan ... 1,622,700 mans. Via Other routes. 164,836 ' (l man = 6 £ lbs.) I undertook to show this to the Oommerce Department. 10. He then asked whether the duty on turquoises could not be reduced. I pointed out that as precious stones they were subject taa to a duty of 25% ad valorem . Their removal from the category of precious stones would not lead to any reduction of duties, and as now precious stones and articles not specifically mentioned in the tariff were also liable to a duty of 25%, nothing therefore could be done. Similarly duty on Iranian wine could not be decreased as this would involve granting a preference to Iran. / At this point he asked whether natural products of Iran, e.g. wine, spices, wool etc. aould be subject to the tariff when land customs were imposed. After telephonic consultation with the O.B.R. I replied that this had notnot yet been set up, but as js far as could be seen at present the tariff would not include such articles, and would be chiefly directed against piece-goods. 11. At the close of the interview he again reverted to ihe question of the Zaliidan railway, and asked if all difficulties w r ould be removed provided we obtained satisfaction as regards treatment of Indian subjects in Iran. Mr Loxley and I, I think, together succeeded in explaining that although this was the first desideratum, we could not, if we secured it, consider the construction of the railway further until the whole position was most carefully examined on financial and commercial grounds. 12.

P.S. D.S*(P.) J.S. A.J.S. &amp; U.S.J OR.2621 6000 3 34 Minute Paper ?.2-, politxcal Department. iiw The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs is visiting Delhi this month on his way back to Persia from a visit to Kabul (previous submission on P.Z.6530/35). In connection with this he suggested that the opportunity might be taken for discussions on commercial matters with the Government of India. His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran this suggestion to the Government of India in his telegram of August 30th, (P.Z.6260). In view of the fact that joint commercial negotiations at Tehran on behalf of the United Kingdom and India have for some time been envisaged (E. &amp; 0. 2917/35 and other papers on the attached E.&amp; 0. file) it was felt that formal discussions at Delhi might be a mi stake, and the Government of India were asked for their views - which they gave in their telegram of the 1st October (P.Z.7000/35). They said they would not mind discussing specific subjects but they would be very doubtful about discussing general commercial relations over a wide field - and in any case they reserved their opinion till they heard the actual subjects the Persians had in mind. This was obviously reasonable and the Foreign Office telegraphed on 8th October to His Majesty’s Minister asking what specific questions they lad in mind. ho. lav The list was eventually produced in Tehran t elegran of the 28th October at P.Z.7814/35. We have heard no more from the Government of India and presumably they see no objection to hearing what the Persians have to say on the points mentioned. There appears to be no reason why these points ( should^be discussed in a preliminary kind of way, provided the Government of India do not allow themselves to be committed/2 committed to later and more formal discussions at Delhi, which would not be consistent with the idea of* joint negotiations at Tehran. Probably the Government of* India will be on their guard, but a telegram might be sent, to make sure. Throughout the correspondence the Zahidan Railway has figured as one of the subjects likely to be raised. The last decision in regard to this matter was taken in February of this year (P.Z.1096/35), when it was felt it would be well to avoid discussions on the Railway, if possible, unless and until a satisfactory position had been reached in regard particularly to our relations with Persia in regard to the Persian Gulf. Times have, of course, changed since them. Henjam and Basidu have been evacuated, Cable and Wireless are withdrawing from the Persian coast, and we have really no desiderata left in the Gulf except perhaps the retention of the Residency in Bushire (which in any case we shall no doubt move to Bahrein before very long). There may therefore be something to be said for bartering some concession in regard to the Zahidan Railway, which after all is primarily an economic question, against some substantial economic quid pro quo . However, this is a matter which will need further consideration. An addition to the telegram is suggested to meet this point.Draft Paper.

Mr. Knatchtull Hugessen's telegram no .186. Motamedy today elaborated tiie subjects which Minister for Foreign Affairs wishes to discuss at Delhi. (1) Most important is Zahedan railway, or failing reopening of line at least improvements to road from Nokkundi. Persian government will endeavour to show that this route is absorbing increasing proportion of trade with India. (2) Tea quota, via Zahedan considered insufficient. One fifth more than last year is required by merchants to counter-balance similar decrease of imports through Gulf ports. Persian statistics show that 500,000 mans, more (? grp. orrrtdo) than four yearsy were imported last year from India but it is argued that all this is consumed in Persia and none re-exported. (5) Persian turquoises are classed by Indian tariff as 'precious stones '. Minister for Foreign Affairs hopes that it may be possible to place themI2 0 ® in category entailing lower duty, (4) 'ersian government consider Indian duty on imported wine excessive and will probably suggest some reduction for Persian wines.

Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs was inclined to agree that opportunity would not be afforded for detailed commer cial discussions and that Kazemi could do little more than pay a formal visit, 'R” ends. You will probably wish me to ascertain what points Persian Government want to raise (see second paragraph of your telegram above me nt ione d). In doing so I could easily discourage too detailed a programme on tne grounds stated in preceding paragraph. Repeated to Foreign Office.Minute Paper, Department P.Z.1453/35 in the attaciied file. ! Secretary, E. &amp; Q. Department The Government of India have now replied to our telegram of 14th September regarding the suggestion that Kazemi might bring commercial experts v/ith him when he visits Delhi about the end of November next. You will see that while the Government of India think that M it will be necessary to consider very carefully' whether discussions could suitably be held at Delhi about the wider questions of commercial treaties etc., they see no objection to di scussion s a bout such specific matters as the Zahidan Railway, land customs or the tea e^qjort restriction scheme. The position as regards the question of reopening the Railway is that the Minister at Tehran has instructions (sent last February) to endeavour to head the Persian Government off further discussion but to report any definite proposals they may make. The reason underlying these instructions was that we did not want to surrender in advance to Persia one of the very few things which the Persians want from us until we had made some progress towards obtaining from Persia our own desiderata elsewhere. In the present situation as regards Anglo-Per sian relatione I doubt if we should mind the question being disposed of separately on terms satisfactory to the Government of Indie or even if we should mind direct negotiations between the Government of India and Persian officials on tne matter subject to confirmation through the diplomatic channel of any agreement reached, but the whole question would have to be submitted for instructions. The other two questions mentioned by the Government of India (land customs and tea restriction) are E. &amp; 0. questions, and I should be grateful for your views on the subj ect/ 3436b 5000 1/35subject of direct discussions between the Government of India and Persian experts on these matters. Possibly if the Government of India confined themselves to explaining the reasons for imposing land customs and for the tea restriction scheme there might be no objection. Our telegram to India was not repeated to Tehran but the Government of India have repeated their reply to the Minister. The latter should not take action without instructions from here, but it might be desirable to get the Foreign Office to telegraph to him just in case he does approach the Persians on the basis of the Government of Indian telegram. The Foreign Office would, I understand, see no objection to doing this. If it is to be done it should be done at once.

Department * Mr, Crombie, With reference to the papers you brought up to me yesterday afternoon about the visit of the Persian Foreign Minister to Delhi, I have looked upland attache^ the papers in this Department which seem to me to be relevant, as follows: In E. &amp; 0. 1606, India suggested initiating conversations with the Persian Consul-General on commercial matters. As they were at the same time associating themselves with joint representati*aj&amp; at Tehran on like subjects, the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, discouraged them from opening discussions with the Consul General at this stage, (E. &amp; 0. 2507)^and in E. &amp; 0. 2917/35, they accepted this view. 3436b 5000 1/35 It seems to me that the same reasons make conversations of the kind indicated in Tehran telegram Do.282 of doubtful wisdom. In the case of any other country we should take the view that proposals for discussions of this kind with India should be made through His Majesty's Government., Indo-Persian relations are rather stPftinod, and His Majesty's Ministerias recently sent direct to India a despatch (E. &amp; 0. 5795/35) on matters arising out of Indo-Persian commercial relations, that might perhaps more suitably have been sent to the Foreign Office. Unless you have strong views to the contrary, it seems best, on principle, to discourage direct^ dealings of this kind. It would, perhaps, be well to cable India with reference to the Tehran telegram, and say that subject/2 . subject to to any strong views they may entertain, we should doubt the wisdom of opening separate discussions with the Persian Foreign Minister on commercial subjects, particularly in view of the recent joint representation made at Tehran.Draft Paper.

Government tf India readily agree that there..is advantage in offering facilities and hospitality to Kazemi. They presume he will travel via Peshawar to Karachi, and if so have no doubt that invitation would be extended to him to stay with Governor at Peshawar. Special facilities for railway journey through India can also be arranged at charges of Government of India. Should he extend his visit to Eelhi he might achieve contacts tending to remove misconceptions regarding Government of India 1 s officers. In the event cf his visiting Delhi HtE, the Viceroy would invite him to stay at Viceroy f s House* His excellency however will be absent from Delhi on hi.* winter tour between the 27th November and 25th January inclusive, and could extend no invitation between those dates. 2.

D. 9.20 p.m., 10th August, 1935. R. 9.30 a.rn. , 11th August, 1935. No. 256. Addressed to India No. 142. Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that he will visit Kabul towards the end of November and intends to return via India. He does not appear to contemplate visiting Delhi. Visits of members of the Persian Government to India are rare and I feel they should be encouraged as helping to remove misconceptions. Would you agree to authorise me to convey to His Excellency some offer of hospitality or special facilities wherever he proposes to go including Delhi if he can extend his visit to that place? Visit to Kabul is in connexion with Turkish frontier award which my Afghan colleague tells me is still subject to discussion between the two Governments.
