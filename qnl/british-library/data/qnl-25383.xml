I address— 'he Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. ) Foreign Office 1916. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir S. Grey to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter which has been received from Mr. W. Barker of Stretford, near Manchester, relative to trade in the Persian Gulf after the War. Sir E. Grey proposes to reply, if Mr. Chamberlain concurs, that “there is no intention at present of creating a post such as Mr. Barker suggests, but that his application will be noted. I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, 'he Under Secretary of State India Office.junior to be Manager and Director of the firm in question. During the whole of th&amp;t period L oarne into close touch with the principal who was a native of Baghdad, and in addition to business relations, I often visited him at his residence, thus having full opportunity of studying the pecularities of the Baghdad people. After the death of this gentleman, which occurred 1911, I was responsible for the carrying on of the business for his widow (the two sons being at the time, minors) and in November 1912, I was appointed Director. In the year 1913, I was requested by them to go out to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf ports on behalf of the firm, but for, various reasons, I refused the offer, and eventually left them the same year. At present, I am in the Java and China trade. I have mentioned the above in order to show that I thoroughly understand the requirements of these markets and also the people as well. I was, before the war, well known in Baghdad, having had correspondence with friends there as well as meeting them over in England. The principal centres are Busrah w r hich is a centre itself, and also the port where ocean steamers discharge their cargo dor same to be transhipped to river steamers of either the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Coy., be longing to Messrs Lynch Bros. Ltd., LONDON, or The Nahriah Coy. belonging to the Turkish Government; these river steamers pi]/ between Busrah and Baghdad in normal times taking cargo to Kut-el-Amara and other smaller towns en route. Thms of course would be much improved upon if the proposed railway from Mohammarah to Baghdad is built. The other centres are Bushire for Shiraz, Mohammerah, Bunder Abbas, Bahrein, Koweit, etc. etc. Lastly there is Baghdadi, which in addition to being a large city, is the centre Iran which goods are sentL by caravan to Kermanshah and Hamadan in Persia; it is customary for the Baghdad houses to have agents or re presentatives in the last named towns in Persia. Prior to the war, there were direct lines of steamers plying between Manchester and London and the Persian Gulf; the Hamburg American Line also had steamers regularly sailing from Hamburg Antwerp to the Gulf;, and this German company was making headway - it being evident that our trade in these parts would have suffered if war had not intervened. Some of the shippers here forward their goods by the Indian liners, the goods being transhipped at Bombay or Karachi, and taken from there to Busrah. The principal exports from our Country to the Per sian Gulf ports are:- Bleached Tanjibs. White Shirtings. Printed Cottons. Shawls. Fancy Cotton Goods. Dyed Cotton Goods. Also! Copper Bottoms and Sheets. We import from the Gulf:- Gum Tragacanth. Galls. Wheat. Wool. Dates. It is customary for Manchester merchants who ship their goods to these markets to buy their Cotton cloth in the Grey state from the Lancashire manufacturers: they can have same bleached, dyed, or printed as required. Bleached Taniibs. These are produced from American yarns woven into plain Grey cloth in the width of 28 inches to 42 inches, same counting under the one inch Counting G1 as from 56 to 62 threads in the Reed by 48 to 58 threads in the w§ft according to quality of Tanjib required; and the weight of the yarns varies from 34 to 38 in the twist, and 24 to oG hanks7 hanks in the weft* These are then bleached white and made up in pieces of 19 to 19i yards, fine pieces being parcelled together and packed in bales of 300 to 350 pieces per bale. The pieces are usually given an Arabic name (same being written in Arabic character) such as “Zehoar el Busrah M , i.e., “Blossom of Busrah”, and also bear a distinctive number. finishes, some quite pure, others filled finish. They are produced from American yarns woven into plain cloth of, say, 28 to 35 inches in width, and after bleaching are sent abroad in pieces of 4-0 yards, packed in bales of, say, 80 to 100 pieces per bale; these also have an Arabic name and a distinctive number - in fact, both styles are sold under their distinctive name and number. American yarn woven into plain twill or satteen cloth and are usually bought in 'Splits', i.e., grey cloth of, say, 48 to 52 inches in width with a perforation in the centre which after printing issplit; this, as is well known here, makes the cost of printing much cheaper and at the same time the cost of production is lessened. The prints are supplied in various finishes and styles, in soft finish for Summer wear and filled or back finish for Winter. 3 DYED CQTfQh GOODS again; - these are produced from American yarns woven into plains, twills or satteens; after wards they are dyed, reds, blacks, greens and other colours. SHAWLS (Woven) These are manufactured in Scotland also dyed there and are supplied in indigo blue and red in the sizes of 51 x 51 inches, a.lso 42 x 42 inches, made up qsually 12 shawls in a piece and packed in bales of, say, 100 to 150 dozs per bale. WHITE SHIH TI MGS . These are shipped in various PRINTED CQTTODS . These again are produced from AsAs to imports . GUM TRAGACANTH . is exported from Rusrah, etc. in large quantities, same being sold in London. Dates also are largely taken by this country, arriving here packed in large boxes as a rule, and are also sold in London again as previously stated. GALLS . WOOL and WHEAT are imported by us. FINANCE Payments are made through the medium of Bills o of Exchange (mostly trade bills) drawn at three or four months’ date on good London or Manchester houses. Bank bills are usually drawn on The Imperial Bank of Persia and The Imperial Ottoman Bank, London; occasionally, bills in both rupees and francs are seAt here as in normal times; such bills can be easily sold or discounted by the bankers in this country. COINAGE . Although under Turkish rule, in Baghdad they have their own coinage, viz: the ’’Bechlek” which is nominally about 22i to the pound sterling. My object in placing the above facts before,you 1 $ respectfully to suggest that you kindly consider the advisability of appointing an adviser on matters relating to the Persian Gulf and Baghdad, and that you will please consider my application for the position. I am prepared to do my utmost to further British trade with the above men- t ^ tioned countries and to keep in tou^h with His Majesty’s Consuls; also, if required, to go out to the East periodi cally and visit the various centres with a view to the ex tension of British trade and any other matters. I shall feel greatly obliged if you will kindly fa vour me with an interview entirely at your convenience. Thanking you in anticipation, I am &amp;c., (Signed W. BARKER.

I have the honour to submit for your consideration the following particulars regarding Sritieh versus German tra ding in a ersia, together with a sug eation in connection there with* it is a matter of common knowledge that within comparatively recent years German Can crcial houses have, with the support of their Governtont established them selves in Persia and become serious competitors to British firms, while at the same time exercising considerable political influence in favour of their own country both prior and subsequent to the tar* To the notorious case of the firm of Gonckhaus and Company, 1 need not refer and 1 propose confining myself to that of the i ersische Teppich Gesellschaft, about whose activi ties in North and ral Persia I am thor ughly well infoim The Company in question was founded in Berlin somesome six years ago by a very influential group oi German bankers and fir t made its appearance in l ersla in 1911, when 1 'it commenced the building of an immense factory at Tabriz and speedily organised a business that acquired the lion's share in the trade of that Important carpet centre. An existing Austrian house ms bought out and the Company gradually exten ded its operations to Oultanabad, Hamadan, hirnz, Kerman, Khorassan, etc., until the outbreak of the war found it firmly established in every carpet-producing district. During this time the organisation for selling purposes was not neglected, branches of the Company were opened in London, and at farsaw, Constantinople and ' ew York in direct competition with british and other houses which had supplied those markets previously. The Company's enterprise was remarkably success ful and its progress was (as 1 am in a position to affirm) to sane extent due to a Judicious system of bribery and cor ruption; it must also be admitted that thoroughly efficient | business organisation, good financial support and sound hare, work had a groat deal to do with it. i In short, at the outbreak of hostilities the lersiche lepplch Gesellschaft of Berlin, etc., whose operations were then brought to a dead stop, was well on the way to capture aIV -3- 6 -p a very important*, not* t»o say, cor*t#rollpart* of ta© r^rsiau Carpet trade all over the world - not excluding Great Britain, When the war commenced the Company’s role as a political agent at once began. In Tabriz its activities were quickly checked fay Hussian influence, but in Central and South** ern Bersia the various branches were used i‘or the circulation in the bamars )f lying reports supplied by the QeittM Legation inTeheran and calculated to influence the natives unfavourably against Great Britain and Russia. 1 may merely mention, as examples, that the downfall of saris and London as well as revolution in 1- Industan and Kgypt were reported to nave taken place, with the object of prejudicing the Persian mind against the Allies. Further the chief director oi who Company in Persia,(Lerr Btnmemann) who is also German Consul, was un doubtedly instrumental in organising the Turkish expedition which some few months ago raided Persian territory, while this individual is reported to have incited the natives to murder * British and Russian subjects and his advent at various places has resulted in the closing of British Consulates and the br nehl of the British owned Imperial Bank oi £ersia. 1 venture to think that the foregoing coiioiuera- tiuns put it 3 aid cuo- Uon th. t e presence of the I orc-iche Teppich4- Teppich uesellschal’t In Persia is not healthy for British ^intere. ts, either from a political or commercial point of view, and that.it is highly desir hie that the cotapany's opportuni ties for mischief in both spheres should be curtailed as ranch as possible.ior tHe future* This subject has seriously engaged the attention of a group of influential business men in Russia, who nave appointed the writer ( i n cons ideration of his special know ledge and long sojourn in Persia) to represent than in this country. Trio object of this group is to effectually cr.eck German and Austrian enterprise in the carpet trade by obtaining from the Shah's Government, for a long term, tnc exclusive rights for the exportation of carpets from Persia. It is proposed that a group of British business men should be formed to work in partnership with the Russian group, and that the concession should be obtained and worked on joint account of tho two groups. 1 an informed that the Russian Government regard the proposal with favour and it is improbable that the bhah's Ministers are likely to look at the schane differently. But it is not desired to proceed with the project until tne matter has been put before the British Foreign Office and your opinion obtainedobtained.

In continuation of ray letter No. Cf.-222 of 8th instant, forwarding copy of a telegram received from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, with reference to the import of German drugs to Persia, I have the honour to forward a note which has been prepared in this office on the subject. Note on Drugs. The term drugs, as interpreted by the Persian Customs Department, covers roughly all pharmaceutical products prepared without sugar and alcohol. The official returns also contain a heading “ Chemical Products ”, but, as imports under it are almost exclusively Russian or Indian, it may be neglected for the purposes of this note. During the last three years the import of drugs to Bushire from India has averaged about £4,000 that from the United Kingdom £1,100, while Germany claims a mean of some £250. No drugs are supplied to Lingah and Bandar Abbas from Germany, the Basrah Trade Report only mentions the United King dom and India as exporters of drugs to that port, and, though no information as regards Mohammerah is immediately available, the situation is probably the same at that port. A demand for drugs hardly exists in Bushire itself. Orders are generally sent by up-country merchants to India direct. The following products have been imported spasmodically in German ships from Hamburg, gf nerally one case at a time, and the number of cases in any one consignment has rarely exceeded three .“ — Veseline ... Boracic Acid ... Magnesia ... ••• Cod Liver Oil ... Glycerine ... ••• Salammoniac ... ••• It is however probable that much of the stuff imported to Persia from India is 'of Germa’n^origin. The Royal Proclamation of August 5th will presum- IbW drive Sn exporters to seek such products as they cannot procure locally in more legitimate markets. Any steps taken by the Commercial au rities in India will naturally react on the Persian market. Thn tntnl imnort of drugs from Germany to Persia is, however, considerable, and Tn^rgi'z-/^actually^e^iceeded that fr'om India, the values being £t 2,049 and / 11,623 respectively. . a'. 1, rwS: g xrd“™,.i „u ..j „,.,*„i,»i apothecaries of all kinds are said to flourish. The matter of drugs has been mentioned to Bashire firms but no steps taken by Consular Officers in the Gulf Ports are likely to be of much avail. Failing soecifiic recommendations from His Majesty’s Minister it is only possible to suggest that the Commercial Intelligence Department o e ov ment of India should inform firms in India, particularly those in Bombay, ot Gelatine. Sulphuric Acid. Nitric Acid. Chlorate of Potash. Tartaric Acid. Castor Oil.2 t 6 new opening, a.nd recommend them to address His Majesty s Consular Officers at the larger towns of Western and Central Persia, viz. t Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd, Kermanshah, sending to each a supply of price lists and other literature for distribution. In the interests of the exporters it is almost essential that business should be conducted through a forwarding agency having branches in Bushire and the large towns, e g., Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co. or Messrs. H. C. Dixon &amp; Co. Two possible methods of doing business suggest themselves A. —A Tehran retailer, for instance, sends an order to a Bombay exporter. The exporter ships the goods to Bushire and posts the documents to, say, Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., requesting them to take delivery of and forward the goods to Tehran. On hearing from his Tehran branch that payment has been made by the Indentor, Ziegler’s Bushire Agent would take delivery of the parcel and remit the exporter his due. This method is perhaps the simplest and most suitable. Intending exporters should communicate in advance with the forward ing agents in Bushre, with reference to terms, etc. B. —Alternatively, arrangements might he made with the up-country branches of the forwarding agencies for orders to be given through them. Parcels weighing less than 5 kilogrammes and not measuring more than 60 centimetres in any one direction can be sent by post. Postal parcels should, however, be addressed in the first place to agents in the port of entry, where the ordinary inland rates have to be paid for their despatch up-country.No. 2680 of 1914, British Residency and Consulate-General, % Bushire, 80th September 1914 &lt;k From To Major S.

Primary one is that all the merchants. Doth in Ahwaz and Moharamerah, follow Implicitly the lead given hy Haji Peis-ut-TujJar, who favours the German firm for two reasons, (l) he has an interest in the business to the extent of £T 3,000 and (2) he gets what we may for euphony call 'presents' from the firm. The secondary reason is that the German firm con sider their clients, their convenionce and their foibles.

Any shortage in consignment they pay up liberally and without question or delay. Their rates are favourable and lastly, but by no means least among reasons, they treat their clients with politeness and even go out of their way to suit their convenience, as per example the picking up of wool en route to Mohammerah as already reported in my DiaryTel 9 gram from /ice Consul Ahw&amp;z to Mohanraerah Dated May 18th, 1914.

Hertslet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Jidy 17.) (No. 60.) Si r&gt; Antwerp, July 16, 1914. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 39, Commercial, of the 1st instant, forwarding a copy of a despatch from the acting consul-general for Ears, enclosing a report from the commercial adviser in the Persian Gulf. I have caused enquiries to be made on the point specially referred to in your despatch, viz., the extent of German interest in the Belgian sugar refinery known as La Baffinerie Tirlemontoise. I have received information through one of the leading sugar export merchants at Antwerp, who himself forwards sugar to the Persian Gulf in the vessels of the Hall Line, that so far as he is aware there is no German interest, either direct or indirect, in the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, which is purely a Belgian firm. It may be of interest for me to state that the sugar refineries of this country do not, as a general rule, deal with the forwarding of the sugar which they manufacture. This work is undertaken by merchants or brokers, who select the means of transport by which the sugar is despatched. It would consequently be a matter of indifference to the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise whether the sugar produced from that factory was despatched to the Persian Gulf by British or German vessels. I gather that the best means for fostering this trade in British bottoms would be for the actual buyers, many of whom are British firms, to indicate to the merchants from or brokers thiough whom they make their purchases their desire that the sugar for their order should be sent in British ships to the Gulf, and consigned on through bills of lading by the river companies working in conjunction with the British steamship companies. In regard to Major Knox’s suggestion that there should be British bills of lading from Antwerp to Ahwaz, involving British carriage throughout the joumej, I understand that this is possible, since a consignment of 58 tons of glassware was shipped from Antwerp to Ahwaz on through bills of lading by the British steamship “ Merton Hall,” which sailed from Antwerp for the Persian Gulf on the 21th January, 1914. The Antwerp representative of the Hall Line has courteously supplied me with particulars, which are given below, of the shipments of sugar to the Persian Gu )y the steamers of that company from Antwerp since the beginning of the present yeai. It should be observed that all these orders have been booked m Antwerp, and none of them appear to have been instigated by British firms exporting sugar to the Gull. The following are the shipments of sugar by the Hall Line vessels to the 1 ersian Gulf during 1914 :— 1914 —* By the steamship “ Merton Hali,’ sailed January 24, 1914 For Bushhe For Mohammerah For Bagdad via Basra By the steamship “ Seistan,” sailed February 17, For Bushire For Mohammerah For Bagdad .. • • • • : - By the steamship “ Tangistan,’ sailed March 16, 19 For Bushire For Bagdad .. • • w ’ By the steamship “ Manica,’ sailed April 20, 191 For Bushire For Bagdad .. •• •• By the motor-ship “ Arum,” sailed May 22, 1914- For Bushire .. * * _ By the steamship “ Anatolia,” sailed June 20, 1914 For Bushire For Mohammerah Fnr Basra .. • • Tons of Sugar. 355 139 14 253 73 60 170 61 164 122 130 200 5 29 * Also small quantities of general cargo [2192 i —3] G SEPl2lLi£1 +w n pprtain proportion of the sugar shipped from The above figures show tl a ed b P Br ftish ships since the inauguration of Antwerp to the t,ul£ is now h 0 ^ W0U J seem not unreasonable to imagine that a regular service by the Hall L • .

Perh ps it might be useful if I summarized here the principal developments in shipping which occur to me as des- -irable for our national interests in the Gulf,without going into detail or giving reasons,which would taKe up a great deal of space.

But a general agreement among all British companies is needed at Bushire,Bandar Abbas,Lingeh,Bahrein etc,by which all steamers would unload into the lighters of a single company,in which all were interested. The requisite number of lighters is needed at e^ch rort, and-most importav^f- steam haulage in order to marK the necessary advance on the present sy: tem,and save shins time in discharging. It is presumably always or©n to the H.A.L. to secure a concession for exclusive lighterage at particular Persian ports,and the consolidation of British interests in the w-y suggested shou d forestall any future move of that nature* III.

Holderness which you were kind enough to enclose. I also haste had two or three interviews with Mr. Chick on the subject of his Repor^and I think I can best explain our attitude on the subsidy question by sending you the accompanying copy of the letter we have sent to the Foreign Office today. It is impossible for us to support the suggestion as to a subsidy on any commercial grounds. The howl from India which you seem to- anticipate in the event of a subsidy being granted is only one of the howls which would be raised both Toy grain shippers and by shipowners, and I fancy that there would be considerable objection at home to public money being used in the manner Mr. Chick proposes. Of course if the Foreign Office take the' matter up on pol itical grounds 7 that is their affair; but if they do they will certainly have to arrange so that any grant they may make shall be kept secret.A- © COPY. Board of Trade, (Coranercial Department C.5448. n COBPIDYKTIAL AND URGENT 17th July, 1914. Sir I am directed hy the £oard of Trade to refer to your letter of the 1st July (No. 23035), and its enclosures, relative to a proposal that His Majesty’s Government should place British ship ping companies in the Persian Gulf in a position to quote freights at a rate which would enable British purchasers of corn to compete with their German rivals in securing the expected harvest from Arabistan and the Persian Littoral. As has already been indicated in the Board’s letter (C. 4173) of the 25th May, the suggestion is not one which can be supported on purely commercial grounds. If, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, such a subsidy is necessary or desirable on polit ical grounds, the Board would suggest, for his consideration, that the question of taking steps to obtain the sanction of the Treasury thereto is one for the Foreign Office - unless indeed it should be possible to make a grant for the purpose from any fund which -the Foreign Office may have at disposal. I am, however, to point out that, in the Board’s estimation, an outlay of £4,000 might n itiO 1 ST^ffSc^t the object 24 JUL1914 aimed aimed s Under Secretary of State,r - aimed at if the German interests concerned (which are 'believed to 'be acting with political motives) are determined to secure and retain the trade in question by over-bidding in the purchase price of the grain or by undercutting in freight rates. There is some risk indeed that if His Majesty’s Government should em bark on the course x^roposed they might find themselves committed for the next few years to an annual competition for which no commercial necessity could be shown, which might give rise to claims from British traders and shippers in other quarters, and which might conceivably fail to effect the desired object.

(J\rt k^k)oM My dear Holdemess 4 n ■X$ &gt;L. 'UiilM Very many thanks for letting me see Chick 9 s report on German trade in the Persian Gulf for 1912-13 and his suggestions. There are one or two comments I would like to make* It is admitted that the backbone of German trade outwards consists of Railway material and sugar* The former naturally goes in German bottoms* As to the second, Messrs Tate &amp; Sons have explained their reasons for not competing in the manufacture of the special class of sugar demanded by the Gulf, I understand that British Merchants are arranging for their Antwerp purchases of Sugar going by British vessels - other things being equal . I believe British direct steamers now call at Lingah on the outward voyage when cargo offers, but Bahrein requires too great a deviation, t ... 4 0*/ \ The British India S, N. Co, have established a 9jULlbi4£-J Lighterage service embracing Bushire, Lingah, bunder Abbas, Bahrein and Dubai, and this may develop as time goes on, but I question Mr chick's assertion as to its particular V'S' &lt;ntvalue qua the German competition. Mr Chick's idea of a subsidy of say o6 3 4,000 to British Merchants in connection with their purchases of grain, and his suggestion as to the method of administering it are, I am afraid, unworkable. Even if the idea of a subsidy in any shape were entertained, it would be much simpler and have an equally good effect, if the Government guaranteed a rebate of say 5/- a ton on every ton of wheat and barley shipped by British firms in British bottoms to U.K. from Bushire and Mohammerah for a fixed period, say 1st July to 31st December 1914. This would, of course, greatly assist these firms buying in competition with the Germans, in which they have failed in previous grain years for reasons which the Government will appreciate. The Diver service on the Karun is capable of improvement and I hope to bring this about in the near ^ future, as soon as vje get fixed up with the Turks and into alliance with Lynch. Mr Chick finishes his suggestions with a*constructional one in regard to Ports on the Persian Coast and Railway Lines from, the Coast to the Interior. As to the latter a Syndicate has been in existence for som.e years with this object in view, but I question the feasibility of the former. With regard to the general policy to be adopted3. 1 fear we cannot, under present conditions, compete with the German Sugar trade unless Tate &amp; Son, or the French Refineries cf Farseilles^ ere prepared to manufacture at a loss, and we cannot prevent the Germans buying grain. Their commercial operations in the Gulf are based, without a doubt ; on a political policy. Yours sincerely, F.S. I return your papers as desired.

Foieign Secret. ^ our telegrams of 5th January and 11th May 1914 German trade competition in the Persian Gulf generally and in Arabistan’ It appears to ixs that our general commercial position has been considerably unproved of late by passing of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company into the control of the. British India Steam Navigation Company and by entry of Ellerman Line into the Antwerp and Persian Gulf trade; and we see no leason to modify view that it is undesirable to grant subsidies t° British lines trading to the Gulf As regards proposed subsidy to Euphrates and Tigris Company on the Karim, His Majesty’s Government are in best position to estimate present urgency of the matter ; should they decide to give it, we are still ol opinion that Indian interests are not sufficiently affected to justify payment of this subsidy wholly or partly from Indian revenues. Moreover we understand that there is an inclination on the part 1 of German Government to reduce subsidies paid to their shipping companies in respect to foreign trade ; there is consequently a danger that renewal of subsidy in question may even provoke Germans to more aggressive action. We hold same view in regard to proposed rebate on cereals exported from Arabistan and cannot support the recommendations of local officers in this matter. With these exceptions we support in principle Chick’s suggestions as tabulated in Bushire letter No. 16 of 2nd May to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. We should, however, wish to be afforded such details as would enable us to form an opinion of merits of any particular item before any definite steps are taken which might involve any charge on the revenues of India. In our opinion we must look to natural methods of development rather than to State subventions for further improvement. The development of the * Arabistan oil-helds, the construction of Mohammerah-Khoremabad railway, the pacification of trade routes in Southern Persia, and the construction of railways from the coast to the plateau seem to offer the best promise for the progress of British trade. We understand that Mr. Chick is on his way home and suggest that his services should be utilised for discussing informally with British firms concerned, possible openings and natural means of promoting British trade.'N [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesfersuovernment] PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

Analysis of Import Cargoes.

Results of the next few months will show whether there is any appreciable quantity of the Belgian loaf sugar carried in these vessels. If this is not the case, it will clearly be necessary for representations to be made to the British firms in England, through whom the bulk of the sugar shipped to the Gull ,s ordered, that, they should ask for shipments of consignments sent out by them to be made by British vessels from Antwerp in preference to shipment by Hamburg-Amerika vessels. All signs point to a very rapid increase of consumption of sugar m the regions fed from the Persian Gulf during the next few years. The year March 1913 14 saw the import of 11,559 tons to Bushire alone—a record; and the import to Basra and Mohammerah was similarly far in excess of former standards. The Germans seem bent on pushing the import of sugar not only m Turkish Arabia, but also via Bagdad into Western Persia, which will provide with a very large market. When as may well be anticipated, in a few years’ time the import of sugar m German yessek to the Gu f has reached 60,000 tons and is worth over 1 , 000 , 0001 ., the interest that Germany will have in the trade of this region will be little less than that which is claimed by Great Britain on account of cotton goods. . . , , For this reason it is important that the German acquisition of the sugar trade to the Persian Gulf should be contested as far as possible (1) by endeavouring to obtain for British-refined sugars a share in the trade, (2) by diverting shipments of foreign- refined sugars to British vessels. . J , , Messrs. Henry Tate and Sons’ sales for the Persian Gulf of crystal sugar have fallen off in the past year. Apparently unknown to them, the prices of Austrian crystal delivered at Gulf ports had been underselling by a large margin their own prices for a considerable part of the year. 1 1 ons. March, 1911-12 „ „ 1912-13 .. .. •• •• •• •• „ 1913-14 .. .. •• •• *• •• 1 ’ 200 Experimental orders for the same British firm’s cube (loaf) sugar have been made recently, but locally in Bushire buyers could not be found, and it is to be feared that unless the grain of the cubes can be changed to something resembling the Belgian loaf sugar it will be impossible to find a sale for the British style of sugar in this region. The Persians and the Arabs set such store by the shape of the Belgian and French cones that the possibility of making cube sugar popular seems unlikely in any case. Messrs. Henry Tate and Sons have more than once stated that it would not pay them to erect new plant for refining in cones ; that a large additional amount of space, a wasteful expenditure of time, and an antiquated system of manufacture would be involved ; and, lastly, that trade in the shape affected in the Gulf is a dying one. Ihe tendency to expansion in the sugar trade in the Persian Gulf region (which will before long represent a very large market) has been so marked within the last three or four years, and the estimated quantity of loaf sugar in cones landed in the Gulf during the past year (30,000 tons) is so large, that it is hardly to be believed that Messrs. Tate are correct in their opinion as to the future of trade in this line of sugar. It would be very advantageous for British trade in this region if such a firm as Messrs. Tate and Sons could be induced to produce loaf sugar for this market, and it is to be hoped that they will be willing to re-examine the question of special refining plant after consideration of the quantity of sugar now in demand. General Cargo, Persian and Arab Ports .—The relatively small proportion, particularly in the year under review, of general cargo in comparison with the sugar brought out by these German vessels will be seen from the following figures :— }la' for Coi fei Li&lt;j An Iro Turkic Anal; ir ^eraThe 35,950 packages of miscellaneous goods landed in 1912-13 were chiefly made up as follows (in comparison with similar figures in previous years) :— 1910-11. 1911-12. • 1912-13.

This may be compared with some 33,037 tons twelve vessels during the previous year 1911 12. ofatistics oiven Proportion of Antwerp and Hamburg Cargoes.--According to the e ^ r in the memorandum by Mn Vice-Consul Kearney of Antwerp dated the 1913, 42,400 tons (metric) of cargo would appear tu have been pp the vessels of the Hamburg-Amerika Lime covered by tins report. This would leave an approximate quantity of 47,000 tons shipped from Hamburg. ou t war d PP The Hamburg-Amerika vessels were, as shown above, fully loaded outwara 12133 z—ll6 throughout the year under report, and it must have been a most prosperous year for the line as far as the Gulf service is concerned. If 150,000 tons, the quantity not exceeding which the Societe des Transports fluviaux contracted with the Bagdad Railway Company to forward to Bagdad within four years, represents the maximum total quantity that the railway company will need^ to ship to Bagdad, then another two years at least of full outward cargoes to the Gulf^ in the Hamburg-Amerika vessels may be expected. But Lord Inchcape has mentioned in a letter to Sir T. Holderness “ something like 400,000 tons of railway material from Hamburg to Basra.” This figure would presumably include the material for the Basra-Bagdad section, possibly also for the Bagdad-Khanikin section as well. In this case the«period during which the German shipping line will be in a privileged position, as regards the quantity of outward cargo falling to its share in the trade via the Persian Gulf, seems likely to be extended to five or six years at least. Export Cargoes. Homeward cargoes shipped in the Persian Gulf Ports during the year October 1912-13 and previous years were made up as follows :— 1909-10. 1910-11. 1911-12. 1912-13.

General Remarks. Before referring to the various issues at present involved or impending, it may be of interest to summarise the estimated value of the trade carried from and to Continental Europe and the Persian Gulf in these steamers during the year under review, most of the details of which will be found in the separate statements concerning each port at the end of this report.

In export trade the value carried in the German steamers in the year under report was only a small fraction of the whole, due to the total failure of the harvest; but the current year, October 1913-14, may see the German proportion reach very considerable dimensions. Combination between British Shipping Lines in the Gulf Trade. Twelve suggestions, made in the report on the year October 1911-12 for improve ment of the position of British shipping companies and British trade generally in competition with the German shipping line and its methods in the Gulf, have been recently reviewed in a letter from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office dated the 16th March. The information therein given, that the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company (Limited) (Strict Line), Bucknall and Ellerman Lines (Limited), and Sir Marcus Samuel’s Company have combined as regards sailings and rates of freight (and presumably general policy) in connection with the direct trade between Europe and the Gulf, and that they have also been joined by the British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited), certainly marks a great advance in one respect on the situation in recent years. A combination between Lord Inchcape, Sir J. Elleiman, Sir M. Samuel, and Mr. Strick places British shipping between Europe and the Gulf in a stronger position to resist German attacks, and to make provision for future developments, than has ever existed before. Now that.regular monthly sailings from Antwerp by British vessels belonging to this combination have been arranged, the Hamburg-Amerika Linie will no longer have the monopoly of Belgian trade to the Persian Gulf; but, on the other hand, it will not be possible for another year to see if these British vessels obtain a reasonable share of the carriage of loaf sugar from Antwerp, which should not be less than one-half if the number of German sailings from Antwerp is not increased beyond the total for the year reviewed above. It does not transpire from the letter of the Board of Trade if the arrangement now concluded between the British and German companies provides for British and German vessels being alternately and indiscriminately loaded with all sugar from the Belgian refinery available at the time for shipment. Until that point is made clear it appears not unlikely that private arrangements between the refinery and Hamburg-Amerika Linie may give the bulk of this sugar to the German steamers and leave British vessels calling at Antwerp with a very small share in the trade. If this should prove the position, it will be necessary to get the buyers and shippers of sugar—British firms in England for the greatest part—to give instructions for all their purchases for the Gulf from Antwerp to be despatched in British steamers calling at that port, and not by the German line. Regular Calls at Bahrein and Lingah. One other point in connection with the new combination of British shipping companies, to which prominence has been given in the reports for 1911—12 and previous years, has not been alluded to in the letter from the Board of Trade. Though a certain standard of regularity of sailings seems intended, it is not stated whether these vessels will include Bahrein and Lingah in their itinerary. The importance with which this matter is viewed locally in the Gulf might be impressed by the Board of Trade on Lord Inchcape and his associates. At the present time the direct trade between Europe and these two ports is entirely in the hands of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie; and, as aconsequence, the German firm of Wonckhaus and Co. is maintaining German agents 1 there who are constantly making trouble for His Majesty’s representatives, ^ and besides attempting to make these places strongholds of German trade, make political capital out of their position, inevitably in a sense hostile to British interests. It is ^anticipated that, if British direct steamers from Europe (United Kingdom and Antwerp) were to make regular calls at Lingah and Bahrein, not only would the cargo in German vessels decrease to a very small figure, which would probably cause the Hamburg- Amerika Linie to cease calling at those ports, but also Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. j would withdraw their German agents. Lighterage. The statement made in the letter from the Board of Trade would seem to indicate that greater attention will now be paid to this matter. Before further developments occur in the Persian Gulf, where lighterage is an_ important link in trade communications owing to the long distances at which ships lie off the shore, pt is indeed of great importance to British political as well as to British commercial interests that the lightering of cargo from all British ships should be under the sole control of a special British company, which would, in fact, become the lighterage company of the port in question. Our maritime interests in each port, particularly the Persian ports, _wid be greatly enhanced if this is done. At Bush ire the British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited) are now introducing a launch, which will, in addition to carrying the mails, serve as a tug for the three sailing lighters which they already possess. But they need to own at least eight such lighters before they can cope with the cargoes ot all the British vessels discharging at Bushire. At Bahrein, under the new arrangemen negotiated by the Government of India and the political agent with the ruler, the British India Steam Navigation Company have undertaken to land all cargo brought by their own vessels. Here, again, they will want a launch-tug before the lighterage service is placed on a proper basis. There remain Bunder Abbas, Lmgah Koweit, Muscat, and Dibai, at some of which ports the British India Steam Navigation Companv own lighters for use with their own vessels only, but m all of which hghterag is still in its primitive state; but there is no outward and visible sign of the entire landing arrangements being in the hands of a British company. , . , It is much to be desired that a comprehensive scheme for each pOTt, m whic provision for launches would be essential, should be decided upon by the British India Steam Navigation Companv, and participation of the various shipping interests tie obtained; this should iiot be so difficult a matter in view of the recent agreement m London between the various British lines interested in the Gulf. Export of Grain from Persian Ports. The comments in the letter from the Board of Trade on the recommendations that have been constantly made in previous reports from this office, m respec o owr r of freight being charged by British shipping companies, hardly appreciate t 8 7 of the situation for British interests locally in the ports and districts of Southern Persia concerned, though they may represent the strictly commercial view of 10 de The Board of Trade state that British shipowners and traders consider the gra (by the German (?) or by all arms, including British (?) pohav^een of an unremunera i e character ; that the German steamship line and Messrs. Wonckhaus have incurred losses or been otherwise recouped ; that British shipownera and traders are reluctate engao-e themselves in the trade on such lines ; and that the Boa ■ ‘'‘ ■ r r. P o rt , a. anxiety on the score of the grain trade from Persian ports falling into the hands of German firm, supported by the freights of the . H ^ m p r g- Ame y k % to lo harvest was a total failure, and nearly all vessels, both German and British had to go to the Indian coast for homeward cargoes. The prospects confronting us summer and autumn of 1914 are, on the contrary, very serious, in view of the bump harvest expected from Arabistan and along the 1 ® r ^ an h J tc ff a ' • . Messrs There will be a large surplus of gram, and British firms-m Bush re IVIessrs H. C. Dixon and Co., Gray, Paul, and Co., Malcolm (agents of Messrs. n k and Co. may be instanced ; in Mohammerah : Messrs. Stnck, Scott, an . ( [2133 z—1] DGray, Mackenzie, and Co., Lynch Brothers)—want to buy and export grain to the United Kingdom, and are making preparations like the German nrm. Perhaps the position will be clearer if put m this way : 40,000 to 50,000 tons of wheat and barley are expected to be available for export from the two Persian ports of Mohammerah and Bushire from June 19 L 4 onwards. The Hamburg-Amerika vessels^, will want to load in the Gulf as far as possible, and they will no doubt offer every* assistance to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. in the way of freight and facilities; owing to the heavy shipments of railway material there should be at least three available every two months. Messrs. Wdnckhaus will endeavour to secure every ton they can; previous history of the relations between Messrs. Wonckhaus and the line show that the German firm do not lose by purchasing at apparently unremunerative prices. If the British firms refrain from competing, as the Board of Trade seem to recommend, the German firm will be in a position to secure unchallenged the bulk of the 40 000 to 50,000 tons estimated. If British firms locally compete, as they intend to do,’ they expect that the Germans will force prices up to a level which will not pay shipment, on commercial lines, to London, and will drive British firms out of the market, ’in 1911, it will be remembered, the Germans did this in the most arrogant fashion at Bushire and Mohammerah ; it was chiefly through the friendly relations between the khans along the Persian coast and the residency that the British firms secured the quantity they did. The Germans are in a far stronger position in 1914 ; it is generally agreed that the Hamburg-Amerika Linie will give a rebate that will -enable them to overbid the British firms by an even larger margin than in 1911. We have now to consider the political consequences—the damage to British interests in general—should nothing be done to enable the British firms to match the German prices, when and where necessary, and the Germans, as anticipated, be left to capture nearly all the quantity available for export. Purchase and export of 40,000 tons of grain, valued at, say, 200,000L to 250,000L, would give Germany almost as large a stake in the export trade of Arabistan and the province of Bushire as that held by Great Britain. The German shipping line would become the most in evidence in the eyes of the population; the German launch craft and barges on the Karun would have a virtual monopoly of the traffic; the prestige of Wonckhaus and Co.—who are known to the natives as the “Germans”—would be enormously increased. They would outwardly be the most powerful trading firm in the region. Persians and Arabs, who know nothing of the money being expended by the German Government to create German interests in the Gulf, and merely judge by results, will see that a single German firm has far greater funds at its disposal than a number of British firms, and is able to crush all competition by them. The predominant position acquired by the German firm, so apparent in the towns, will be spread far and wide in the districts by the tribesmen selling grain, who have been thrown into touch with the German office or agents, and the latter will impress on all that the Germans are a stronger force than the British. His Majesty’s consul for Arabistan has clearly pointed out the effect that a growth of influence of the Germans will have on the Sheikh of Mohammerah and on his relations with us. Not only would the practical monopoly of the grain trade for the Persian districts put Messrs. Wonckhaus in a much stronger position to extend their business in all directions inland, but it will be an encouragement to other German merchants to establish themselves. It will lead to more German consular representatives in Southern Persia; to further attacks on British preserves, such as the quarantine service ; and to the undermining of the British official position in many ways. The one German consul at present in Southern Persia at Bushire makes a point of causing the British representatives as much trouble as possible. Finally, any loss of influence of British commercial interests will inevitably entail a loss of prestige of the representatives of the British Government in the eyes of the local Government and population, as contrasted with the gain in prestige by another European State and its nationals. That any attempt by the Germans to drive the British firms out of the Southern Persian market for the export of grain by means of their shipping rebates can be, and should be, defeated by the British shipping companies being enabled to grant secretly similar rebates is urged by all British representatives in the Gulf as the only method of preventing the political consequences outlined above. Solely for political reasons, it is suggested that His Majesty’s Government should incur small financial expenditure for reimbursing the shipping companies for specially low rates of freight on grain, not, as objected in the Board of Trade letter of the 1st March, 1913, “ in order to support private British traders.” We must either reconcile ourselves to losing the trade in grain from the Persianports, with the influence which accompanies it, and suffer from the consequences, or else adopt extraordinary measures to retain that trade and influence. And in this connection the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office and Board of Trade, dated the 6th August, 1913, may be quoted : “ . . . The political interests of India in those regions in large measure depend on British commercial supremacy, and everything that weakens ^ that supremacy weakens also the position and security which India has hitherto enjoyed.” It may be that the German firm will not overbid the British firms, and will keep to limits which make the trade commercially profitable to British firms ; but once it becomes evident at Mohammerah and Bushire that the prices offered by the Germans will not permit British firms or buyers for the United Kingdom to purchase, arrange ments for reduced freights, previously made between His Majesty’s Government and the British shipping companies, should come into operation, and be communicated confidentially to beneficiaries. If His Majesty’s Government would allocate a sum of 4,000Z. for this purpose, it would, I estimate, amply suffice, and very possibly not nearly as much would actually be required. From this sum the shipping companies in London would be reimbursed for any difference between their rate of freight and the rate^ of freight which would permit exporters in Mohammerah and Bushire to pay similar prices for grain as Wonckhaus and Co. The limits of prices of purchase of grain, above which it will pay firms to ship at the current rates of freight, are always well known. Lower rates of freight would only be applicable when prices of purchase had to exceed those limits m order to compete with German prices ; and the extent of the lower rate of frieght would be determined by the excess of current German prices above those limits. This suggestion refers, it will be noted, to the two Southern Persian ports, Mohammerah and Bushire, only, and not to Basra and the Mesopotamian gram tl'cLcl.O The reasons for this are not only the very large quantity of grain likely to he exported from Basra, and the consequent heavy expenditure which would fall on His Majesty’s Government, but also the very different position m which British Government interests now stand in the Persian littoral and Arabistan, as compared wl th their position in Turkish Arabia. The agreement with Germany in connection with the Bao-dad Bailway and the construction of the ports at Basra and Bagdad admit certain definite interests of Germany in that region. jUp till now neither Germany noi any other continental Power has made good any particular interest on the strength of whic she could contest British claims to sole and exclusive exploitation of Arabistan and the coast. The particular anxiety of His Majesty’s representatives m the Gulf is to forestall any acquisition of interests or undue influence by Germany in these Peisian regions. Shipping on the Karun (Lower and Upper). A separate report, under cover of the late Mr. Lorimer’s despatch No. 4 of the 8th Februarv, 1914, regarding the situation which has arisen owing to German intrusion into the British sphere of activity in Arabistan, is already before His Majesty s Govern ment, as well as despatches from Major Haworth on the subject. , , ,, It is noted from the letter from the Foreign Office to the Board of Trade, dated 30th March, 1914, that the new company, Messrs. Mackay, Lynch, and Go., have ta over Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ trade on the Lower Karun. In view of the situation that will arise during the height of the gram season in the surnmer and autumn o , “to the greater number of craft at the disposal of Messrs Wonckhaus and Co (craft owned apparently by the Hamburg-Amenka Lime) and their advantage m. the matter of freights, it is urgently necessary that Messrs, ^ckay, ^ l ^ h ’ ^ ^ be sounded as to their intentions regarding a remedy for the defects m the oniy Br steamer service on the Karun, and the inadequate number of British vesse . Tor Any reasons I confer that the British India ^eam Navngat.on Com a n y (Limited), who would be probably in a positron to produce suitable craft * short notice, should be asked to institute a service independently of, if not in conjuncti with, Messrs. Mackay, Lynch, and Co. Bills of Lading to Ahwaz from Antwerp. In connection with the sailings by British ^iP^^B^TT^-ATTfNartUtn it should be suggested to the Hall Line (Limited) and the British India Steam Naviga12 Company (Limited) that they should arrange at Antwerp for all goods carried by their vessels to be transhipped to Ahwaz by the British steamers on the Karan, and thus Counter to some extent the effect of the circular by the Hamburg-Amerika Limbs agents at Antwerp, translated in the memorandum of the 8th February, enclosed in despatch No. 4 from Bushire. % Dominant position held by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie and prospects before British Shipping interests. The situation as described in Lord Inchcape’s letter of the 29th December, 1913, to Sir T. Holderness is very serious, coming from such an authority and ^written after his company had combined with Sir J. Ellerman and the other British shipowners. . . . The British shipowners have been obliged to come to terms with the Hamburg-Amerika Lime and to agree rates of freight, and also to give up direct loading fiom Hamburg and Antwerp .... If the British lines had not come to terms with the Hamburg- Amerika Linie it would have been impossible for them to maintain a position in the This is tantamount to saying that the Hamburg-Amerika Linie (and the powers behind it) are masters of the situation in the Persian Gulf. In view of this opinion, and the situation as British officers in the Gulf see it on the spot, the opinion expressed in the Board of Trade’s letter of the 16th March, that the shipping arrangements now made “ will place the British companies sufficiently strong to enable them to meet any possible German competition in the future,” can hardly be justified. As indicated in the first part of this report, the Hamburg-Amerika Linie will continue in a position of independence for at least the next five years, until the material for the Bagdad-Basra portion of the railway is all landed at Basra. They will benefit by the material necessary for the construction of ports at Basra and Bagdad, of which Germany gets the largest share. By that time the Bagdad Bailway itself will be working, the Khanikin branch be under construction, and their position still further assured. During this period the German Government and the channels through which it is working in the Persian Gulf will be searching for new openings for the establishment of German “interests”—particularly in the hinterland of the Persian coast, it is apprehended. Finally, as to the position after the completion of the railway, even Lord Inchcape—though the British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited) enjoy a large mail subsidy from Government—is disturbed. “We may find an attempt on the part of the Germans to oust British vessels from the trade from Basra to India. . . . Of course, if the German Government are determined to force their way into the trade with India by means of subsidies, it may go hard with the British lines.” As matters stand at present, during the next few years there is no likelihood of the British shipping companies or financial interests being able to fortify themselves against, and free themselves from, the domination of the German line to any appreciable extent, since the normal trade of the Persian Gulf ports is not likely to expand beyond its present very restricted limits. British shipping and influence in the Gulf, in fact, requires a set-off against the power now afforded to Germany by the construction of the Bagdad Bailway, and this can only be provided by the construction of ports on the Persian coast and railway lines from the coast to the interior by British enterprise exclusively, and the material for such works being carried in British vessels. The early construction of railway lines from Mohammerah to Dizful and from Bunder Abbas to Dizful and Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and some mechanical provision for the route from Bushire to Shiraz, are urgently needed, just as greatly in order to replace British shipping and financial interests in the Gulf in a position far superior to that of the Germans as to provide a substitute for the present totally inadequate supply of transport animals for the southern ports to the interior, and a check to the spread of Bussian commercial influence southwards. The more the effects of the developments in the Gulf and Southern Persia are studied and worked out on the spot, the firmer does the conviction become that the construction ol railways for the Persian ports should be taken in hand without delay.

Hew, previous to his departure from Lingah. It is satisfactory to note that the general tmde through that port continues to increase, though slowly, and that caravan traffic with lar during the year in question showed an improvement, which lias since been maintained, particularly on the section between Lingah and Bastak. As the expedition of Kawam-ul-Mulk has reached Lar, it is to be hoped that he will make adequate arrangements for protecting trade on the Lingah road: and, should security on the road be esuhlished in a sufficient degree, a visit by His Majesty's representative at Lingah to Lar, a^d ohe eeuc&lt;.bli6iineiit of a Native Agent or Trade Correspondent there might ie Right Honourable Sir EoGrey, Bart., K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c;, ug . render Itrender useful service to our interests in the import and export trade via Lingali. I would also draw attention to Mr. New's reiarks regarding the decrease in the number of calls by British vessels, particularly by those lines trading direct between the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf. That the Girick and Bucknall lines' vessels made only two calls outward bound as against 13 calls by the German, and 4 calls by the Russian Line, seems to argue an inadequate appreciation of the importance of Lingah on the part of the British Lines concerned, and I trust it will be found possible to urge r. v. G. Strick to arrange for more frequent calls by his Company's steamers. The above despatch was drafted by the late Mr. Lorlmer, and was delayed in transmission owing to corrections having to be made in the Shipping Statistics, and reference made to Lingah. ^ I have, esc., (Signed) L.

Annual Series. Reference to previous Report, Annual Series No. 5032. O Report on the Trade and Commerce of Lingah fur the Persian Official Year March 21, 1912, to March 20, 1913, By Mr. Vice-Consul B. H. New. Introduction .—Despite considerable disorder in the interior, par ticularly in the Bar district, where robbers abound, the trade of Lingah for the year under review shows a marked increase in imports and exports. In regard to imports this is attributable to a generally flourishing condition of the coastal districts and a good pearling season. The increase of exports is of more interest, being largely due to a revival of the caravan trade between Lar and Lingah, carrying products of the country, which shows some improvement in the state of the road. These caravans are able to travel south in comparative safety, because robbers have little use for the goods carried, but the caravans invariably return empty, and very few of them risk taking back piece-goods, sugar, and other coveted mer chandise to Lar. The northern districts are capable of assimilating a considerable quantity of, principally, piece-goods, sugar and kerosene oil, if it were possible to forward these to Lar with any degree of safety. During the year prices of sugar and kerosene oil at Lar were 100 per cent, more than the bazaar rates at Lingah. The coastal districts, locally known as Shib Kuh, are productive only of limited supplies of dates, wheat and barley, and are more dependent on the import of rice as a staple food, this being eaten with fresh, or preferably, dried fish. The following table is of interest in showing the variation of the trade of Lingah during the past 10 years :— ft Year. Imports. Exports. Total. £ £ £ 1903 684,521 653,111 1,337,632 1904 307,690 248,956 556,646 1905 102,900 66,564 169,464 1906 163,440 95,088 258,528 1907-08 124,440 134,981 259,421 1908-09 127,823 91,611 219,434 1909-10 .7 116,500 116,763 233,263 1910-11 131,895 194,340 326,235 1911-12 143,709 120,775 264,484 1912-13 164,324 193,895 358,2194 L1NGAH. It lias been explained in previous reports that the introduction of the revised customs tariff of 1903 crippled the trade of Lingah, which port was previously of considerable importance as a distributing centre of all kinds of merchandise to the Arab coast, the new tarifi being par ticularly burdensome on goods imported for re-exportation. The effect was not immediate, but the full force of the change was felt in 1905, since when a gradual revival has taken place. But the above total* figures will not convey a true comprehension of the actual trade r. general merchandise unless we eliminate pearls and specie from the total values of exports and imports, both of which run into high and misleading figures. Omitting these two items, pearls and specie, we obtain the following totals for the past five years, which give a more accurate view of the actual consumption of the ordinary commercial products :— Year. Imports. Exports. Total. £ £ £ 1908-09 114,481 25,334 139,815 1909-10 99,522 32,018 131,540 1910-11 85,834 47,463 133,297 1911-12 125,364 36,102 161,466 1912-13 141,246 56,225 197,471 The marked increase in imports during the year under review was mainly due to crystal sugar, cotton piece-goods, yarn and twist, kerosene oil, rice, ghee, and, to a lesser extent, to a growing demand for enamelware, porcelain and chinaware, glassware and haberdashery. Exports show increases chiefly in mother-of-pearl shells, assafoetida, carpets, tobacco, rosebuds and oil of poppy seed, all of which, except ing shells, are products of the interior. Of the total imports, India contributed 82 per cent, (including 34 per cent, of Manchester piece-goods), Oman 5 per cent, and Germany 3'8 per cent., showing a gradual increase year by year from the latter country. The United Kingdom is credited with 1'5 per cent., which, represents only imports by direct shipments. Turkey, the United States and Russia shipped about 1 per cent. each. Exports to India were TO per cent, (including 49 per cent, of pearls and specie), Oman took 37 per cent, (including 23 per cent, of specie only), while Aden and the United Kingdom stand next with 5| and 4| per cent, respectively. Industries of Lingah.—As at Bahrein, pearls are the chief staple, and, in addition to the catch by the Lingah pearling fleet, pearls are brought here from the Shib Kuh and the Arab coast for sale. The past season was a good one, inasmuch as the catc h was above the average. A few Arab pearl merchants managed to dispose of large parcels in Bombay early in the season (September, 1912), after which the market became stagnant, owing to the Balkan war, and the majority were unable to dispose of their parcels for cash even at a | great loss. The trade is a great gamble, and some of the_ bigger | Arab merchants gain or lose as much as 25,000/. in a season. flit YC cU~&gt;U U OdhGO'ij 8 &amp; UVOCfB rut * bna .itm’i f zxt . i • hif-U fil»J Oo i'. ; b&amp;i ' v'U . X (£•*'.LINGAH. 5 (519) There was a revival of the pearl-shell trade during the year. More than half of the quantity of shells exported consisted of sadafs and mussel shells for London. A considerable quantity of cotton sail-cloth is woven on hand looms in the Lingah district. It resembles canvas, but is softer and more flexible, and is used for sail making and awnings. It is made narrow strips, 18 inches in width, and, in varying lengths up to .3 yards, in three qualities—ooarse, medium and fine. Much of it is exported to ports in the Persian Gulf , and the cloth also finds a ready sale at Aden and Jeddah. Products of the interior .Some 2,000 to 3,000 Persian carpets of an average quality come to Lingah in a year from the Jahrum district, in most of which aniline dyes have been used, to the presence of which, however, local people seem to be indifierent. They are chiefly shipped to Aden and Jeddah. In addition to carpets, the Jahrum district supplies rosebuds, which are shipped dry to Jeddah for the manufacture of ottar. Gums, arabic and tragacanth are collected, and cotton, fruits, almonds and raisins are also brought to Lingah for export. Assafcetida is collected in the Bastak district, while in the westward districts, inland, tobacco, flax seed, wheat and barley are extensively cultivated. Customs .—The smuggling of arms and ammunition has greatly diminished during the year owing to the very active measures adopted by the British Government in suppressing the trade. Smuggling of tea and coffee continues on a large scale, and no scheme for its sup pression has yet been evolved. It would automatically cease if the duty were reduced to a reasonable amount commensurate with, or even slightly higher than the expenses and risk of smuggling. The Persian Government decided not to prohibit the export of aniline-dyed carpets, but to impose an export duty of 3 per cent. ad valorem for six months, from June 21, 1912, to be raised to 6 per cent, for the succeeding six months, to enable merchants to clear stocks. Advantage has been taken of this concession, and the value of exports of carpets has consequently more than doubled during the past year. Shipping .—The following steamship lines called at Lingah during the year. The numbers of vessels shown against each company in cludes all their vessels actually calling at the port, and therefore includes those entering as coasting vessels as well:— British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited Bombay and Persia Steam Naviga tion Company Arab Steamers, Limited ... Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company Bucknall Steamship Lines, Limited The weekly fast mail service was main tained up to the end of 1912. The fort nightly subsidiary service from and to Bombay was changed to a weekly service from Bombay from January 1, 1913, when the fast steamers ceased to call at Lingah.

They are unreliable in regard to the kind and origin of certain goods, particularly sugar. These discrepancies have been corrected, where necessary, in the accompanying remarks on imports and exports of items of note, which are dealt with separately. Imports. Cotton piece-goods .—The import is valued at 56,91$., or 34 per cent, of the total imports, which is a slight increase on the previous year s abnormally high figure. Local prices, which have increased a little during the year, were as follows :— Loin cloths— s. d. 8 to s. d.

Cotton yarn and twist .—The statistics are misleading, because almost the entire quantity, valued at 6,015d, consisted of hemp for rope making, rope being greatly in demand for pearling and trading vessels. Enamdware shows a steady increasing demand, not to the detri ment of porcelain, china and glassware, all of which have increased considerably in recent years. Enamel bowls, 6 to 10 inches in dia meter, are mostly used, which sell at an average price of 6s. per dozen. Rice .—The import of 43,514 cwts. is small compared with that of Debai and Bahrein, but the demand shows a tendency toLINGAH. 7 increase. In addition to ordinary supplies from India, the British India Steam Navigation Company send annually three or four of their largest steamers, with full cargoes of rice, from Calcutta to the Gulf. Rice is the staple food of all people engaged in pearl diving. Oil, kerosene .—The import shows a marked increase to 3,295h, compared with only 1,521Z. in the previous year. With the exception of 2,000 cases of Russian oil, the entire quantity imported was American “ Tiger ” brand, and very little “Snowflake/’ The demand is for the cheapest oil procurable, and there is practically no sale for superior qualities. The consumption of oil increases tenfold during the month of Ramazan. The average price during the year of both American “ Tiger ” and Russian was 5s. lOd. per case. Silk 'piece-goods .—A rising demand, the value of the import stand ing at 1,524Z., compared with 878Z., 628Z. and 583£. respectively in the three preceding years, shown as all emanating from India. But the market is stocked with Japanese silks also. Sugar .—The correct quantity, value and origin of imports of sugar from Europe during the year, and local prices, are as follows :— Loaf Sugar.

The total quantity of 23,206 cwts. shown in the statistics seems to be excessive. At the beginning of the year (March, 1912) there was practically no loaf sugar on the market and stocks did not arrive till the middle of June, which accounts for a jump in the price, particularly of U Z. J. and “ St. Louis.” On the other hand large stocks of crystal sugarI al^cia .'V 1 a i i30 ^an g lingah. were on hand at the commencement of the year, and the market has been flooded throughout, which, with the fall of prices in Europe, accounts for the very low rates which prevailed. Exports. Cotton piece-goods—The export is valued at 5,3001., com pared with only 1,4041 in the previous year, three-fourths of which went to Oman, indicating Lingah’s partial revival as a distributing centre of goods carrying comparatively little duty. The cotton good^* described as exported to Aden, valued at 905Z., consisted of sail-clotE mentioned in the remarks under industries of Lingah. Assafoetida. —A distinct revival, the export being valued at 5,750Z., compared with only 1,702/. in the preceding year, due to stocks being on hand at the close of 1911-12, and also to a slight improvement in the state of the Bastak district, where it is collected. It is cleaned and sorted into two qualities before shipment. The entire quantity goes to the London market. Oils, other than kerosene. —These consist chiefly of tallow (fat) and fish oil (extracted from shark’s liver), both used as preservatives for boats instead of paint. Sesame oil, which is used for cooking, is also exported. Pearls. —The declared value, 67,856/., is greatly under-estimated. The merchants contend, with reason, that the local value is perhaps 100 per cent, or more below the sale price in India, where there is sometimes no market, as in the present year, which justifies a very low valuation. Nearly the whole of the pearls exported to Bombay were brought back to Lingah and remained on hand at the close of the year (March, 1913). Shells .—Shipments were approximately as follows :— Mother-of-pearl shells (small)— To Hamburg (via Odessa) ... Bags 3,400 Mussel shells (long shape)— To London ... ... ... ... Cases 700 Sadafs (large, round)— To London ... ... ... ... ,, 900 In spite of the bad state of the Hamburg market for small mother- of-pearl shells, the local price for new shells continues to rise year by year, and was approximately 2s. per cwt. for uncleaned shells without delivery. The shells are dumped by pearling boats on the Shib Kuh coast and the islands adjoining. The collection and cleaning of the shells is costly. Tobacco is exported almost entirely to Aden, and shows a steady increase every year. Local prices are :— Price per Cwt. £ s.

I am directed hy the Board of' Trade to refer to your letters of the 7th and 15th May, (Nos. 19383 and 21443), relative to German commercial activity in Arab!stan. The principal suggestion contained in the dee- patch of the 8th April from the Acting Consul-General at Bushire to the Government of India is that British firms should be assisted to meet German competition in the buying of grain by a subsidy from His Majesty's Government in respect of all grain shipped by them in British vessels. However desirable it may be, in the interest of British prestige in the Gulf, that the grain trade should not fall entirely or mainly into German hands, the proposal to subsidise the import of grain from a foreign country appears to the Board to be open to grave objection, ^uch a subsidy could not be Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.be kept secret, end would be very difficult to defend, especially against the criticism to which it would be certain to give rise in India and those Self-Governing Dominions which are large exporters of grain to the United Kingdom. The Board have learned with satisfaction from your letters of the 20th May (Noe. 19948 and 21916), with their enclosures, that Sir E. Grey has acceded to the application of the Euphrates and Tigris Company for the renewal and increase of the assistance previously accorded by His Majesty*s Government in respect of their Karun services, and that the Company appear to be talcing action with a view to meeting the competi tion of Messrs. Wonckhaus on that river. I am to ex press the hope that such action may take the form not only of a reduction in raues, but also of an endeavour to remove any grounds for criticisms of the kind men tioned in Major Knox’s tele gran of the 13th May (21443).

I observe in the first paragraph, commencing on p. 2 of the Board of Trade letter, .a statement that arrangements have been made for a regular monthly sailing of a Bucknall lane or British India vessel from-Antwerp to the Gulf. So far as 1 can .ascertain at Antwerp this arrangement is unknown. There is, as I have previously reported, a legulai service recently started of the Hall Line from Antwerp to Gulf ports, with monthly sailings, and it is possible that this service may have been confounded with the Bucknall Line, since both are under the direction of the same group, viz., the Ellerman Lines. It is, of course, possible that a new service of the Bucknall Line is contemplated, particulars of which have not yet been divulged. As regards a sailing by the British India Line from Antwerp to the Gulf, nothing is known by the agents of the company here. Hitherto the British India have never had a direct service trading between Antwerp and Gulf ports, but have carried goods from this port -consigned to the Persian Gulf by transhipment .at Karachi into vessels of the same line. I gather that the Hall Line has come to an understanding with the Hamburg- America Line as to freight rates between Antwerp and the Persian Gulf, which are identical by both . the British and German services, the lines concerned working in (Complete harmony, but I was unaware that there had been a similar arrangement in regard to a service of the Bucknall Line or the British India.

B. H. Haworth, His Maiesty’s Consul for in AraMstan . 11 C0nne0tl011 Wlth German competition against British interests 2 . Major Haworth’s present letter deals with the danger which may W'ell be antopatednnder existing eenditiens, of German interests, by t^ means afforded them by their subsidies and rebates, in monopolising the purch“e of Arabistan grain this summer, and thus greatly strengthening their position in the Shaikh of Mohammerah s territories. All reports point to a bumper harvest to be reaped in a month or two from now, and unless we can take steps to secure for British buyers, those firms m Mohammerah and Ahwaz buying for export to the United Kingdom, rates of freight enabling them to purchase at level prices with the Germans the Germans will be able to carry all before them. ., 3 * ^l ov Haworth views this prospect with the more alarm as he con siders that the arrival of the Germans in strength will not only adversely affect i m f^bistan, but will also undermine the influence and authority of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, inasmuch as it will be the policy of the Germans to refer matters of interest for arrangement between their Legation in .Tehran and the Persian Government. 4. Major Haworth therefore urges that His Majesty’s Government should follow German tactics in regard to the support of purchase of grain by their firms, and grant confidentially as a temporary measure until our position, in Arabistan is more sure against German attack, a rebate of 2s./Qd. per ton on. grain shipped by British merchants in British ships to the United Kingdom. The expenditure involved by such a measure, which in practice would come to mean that British buyers could purchase at similar prices to those of their German rivals, confident that the rates of freight charged by British lines would not be against them, is estimated by Major Haworth at £ 6,000, supposing that every ton of grain coming down the Karun were purchased by British firms—whereas in actual fact the quantity purchased and expense involved would be far less. 5. The proposal that His Majesty’s Government should make good any difference between the freight charged on grain shipped in British steamers from Arabistan and Bushire and the freight charged on the German vessels has been put forward more than once in the Annual Beports on German Trade issuing from this Eesidency. The matter needs serious reconsideration this summer, if further damage to our position is not to be felt in this region. A copy of this letter has been submitted to the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. No. 24 C., dated Mohammerah, the 21 st March 1914 (Confidential). Trom— Major L. Haworth, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To^—The Political Resident irr the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In my letter No. 16 C., dated 12th February last, I ventured to state what appeared to me to be the situation in regard to the question of the German commercial invasion of the Karun and Arahistan and gave what seemed to be the most desirable strategical steps to be taken with a yiew to meeting the attack which had been made on our interests. IF' . ' _ . ! ' hua;,, F ® ^ ' Go ' /l dated2 Since the date of that letter, in connection with which this despatch should be read, the season has advanced and with it the prospects of the gram season have become clear. I have accordingly the honour to forward herewith some further remark upon the situation together with suggestions which appear the logical sequence of the position. There has been practically no cold weather this year and no frosts, thus the crops are more advanced than is normal, and it is assured that the season, failing untoward accident, will be one of the greatest on record. More rain is hardly necessary, but should we have another rainfall, the year will exceed in prosperity the bumper season of 1911. This is a question which has a great hearing on the one we are discussing, since a prosperous year for the Germans will make the Germans independent for the next few years and will enable them to carry forward a reserve which will render them immune to all the steps which we may otherwise take against them. In addition, they will he independent of outside cargoes since the grain which they purchase will give them all that they require for their steamer and barges on the Karun. In the min trade foreign firms like the natives ot the country live on the fat years which follow the lean. A good season produces probably 50,000 tons of wheat and barley. This amount is not declared in the Customs owing to the frauds which take place, but it is probable that this estimate does not exceed the actual produce. All of this, or practically all, has to be carried down the Karun. The combined fleet of ships and barges carry about 900 tons per trip. Making an allowance of some 10,000 tons to he carried in native boats there remains some 40,000 tons for the steamers. At one trip a week, uhich is about the average run, it would take more than ten months of regular sailings, with full cargoes, to deal with the grain alone. In actual fact the boats would he run at a profit with smaller cargoes and the grain trafiic would be sufficient to induce Messrs. Wonckhaus to keep their steamer on the river. A further point to be noted is the smuggling to which I made a passing reference. British firms have refused to take part in the wholesale defrauding of the customs which takes place in grain exports from Mohammerah. The Germans are notoriously one of the worst offenders and shipping, as they so frequently do, in hulk, it is the more difficult to check them. The problems before us then are— ( 1 ) To take steps to see that the Germans are not able to smuggle as they have been doing in the past since what they gain in this manner enables them successfully to offer greater prices for grain than can profitably be offered by British firms. (2) To take measures by which they will be unable to purchase sufficient grain to fill their steamers and so make their year a loss to them and prevent them carrying forward reserves for future years. To meet the first case I have already taken steps which, I trust, will be effective. It was suggested that if the manifests of all steamers, whether for export or for import, were deposited in the Customs, it would make it extremely difficult to make false declarations. It appeared to me that if at the same time it were necessary to make a declaration of the draught of all ships on arrival and departure it would he an additional check of the amounts loaded. Local British firms have agreed to these checks being imposed and I have accordingly addressed the Director of Customs with a view to having regulations to this effect brought into force. Some time ago I initiated a Chamber of Commerce in Mohammerah and local firms have now agreed to keep a clerk who will he at the disposal of this Consulate, so that I shall he able to issue weekly returns of exports and imports. We shall then be able to check German imports very thoroughly and may be of some assistance to the Customs without openly appearing in the matter.* Firms have also agreed to send to the information bureau slips of any news which may come to their ears. These tactical measures should be useful, but the main defence cannot lie in local measures. The main defence and attack must at all times he strategical and not tactical. At the risk of repeating what was said in my previous letter I would wish to point to the value of Arabistan to us politically and commercially. Unchecked the Germans will purchase largely and will build up a large business as they have done in Basrah. They oper\ly express their intention of pushing their interests on the Karun and driving Messrs. Lynch off the river. Should we think the preservation of our own interests dearly purchased with an expenditure of some 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 or even 10,000 pounds, especially if we believe that that money is laid to our future gain ? We are giving money in loans to Persia for her gendarmerie in order to quiet the country. Our object in this is to prevent Persia from disintegration. Our object in Arabistan is similar. The power of the Shaikh is one of our greatest assets. The arrival of the Germans in strength will not only have an effect on our position, but it will gradually undermine the power and position of the Shaikh. As it has been and will be our policy to support the Shaikh wherever possible, so it must and will be the policy of the Germans to refer all matters to Tehran, whenever it is possible to do so. Our position on this question has already been the subject of a part of despatch No. 3713, dated 7th December last, from Sir Percy Cox to the Gov ernment of India in the Foreign Department and upon the decision of Lis Majesty’s Government in this respect must depend very largely the steps which we are prepared to take. As a matter of continuity with cur policy in the past it will not, however, be a great stretch of imagination to consider that we do value our position here at more than either 5,000 or 10,000 pounds. I have in a previous communication suggested that this position is worth more, and vastly more, to the tax-payers of India or Great Britain than the sums named whether as insurance or calculated as a commercial transaction in hard cash. The Germans are attacking the situation by means of rebates of some nature. The only reply possible is to resort to the same means, as a temporary measure. It is only in a year like the one now anticipated that this really conn s and as already stated the Germans are depending largeiy on this season s profits to establish them firmly in Arabistan, a statement which I make on the authority of the German agent himself. It is calculated that the Germans receive a rebate of a bou t j 1 and six pence per ton of grain shipped. Vf tfe s^me term to our Sor ms year only, we must offer, very confidentially, the same terms firms where purchasing through British Agents. . , . + The total sum involved were British firms to succeed which came down the Karan, would not exceed , &gt; sum would necessarily he very much less. ,. l am aware that in suggesting excep- S”—, Z , e -i.S . 1 ] — fis my opinion too strongly that, whidlan expenZra question in Arabistan will assume formidable of a few thousand pounds would inadequately expies&amp;. . + The tendency, and a necessary tendency, of all officia s 1 * ut 0 havia =° made the importance of the interests to which ey ar^a^ are ° worth due allowance for this it appears to me that thmany times tlie expenditure which I am asking may be undertaken. I n conclusion, I would state that I only suggest that such steps should be taken until such time as we haye consolidated our position in Arabistan and have rendered innocuous any commercial measures which the Germans may desire to take. Once our position is determined, commercial undertaking of the Germans, though not to be neglected, will have lost the great importance * which they have assumed. ■y fttnerx &amp; Pofesl Dept, p IOS ,_ No , S 9 .U-i.U~ 49 .CONFIDENTIAL. cv Getp^mtr-Birdwood to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 13, 7*30 p.m.)[ Bushire, May 13, 1914.

B. H. Haworth, His Majesty’s consul for Arabistan, in connection with German competition against British interests in Arabistan. . 2. Major Haworth’s present letter deals with the danger which may well be anticipated under existing conditions of German interests, by the means afforded them by their subsidies and rebates, in monopolising the purchase of Arabistan grain this summer, and thus greatly strengthening their position in the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s territories. All reports point to a bumper harvest to be reaped in a month or two from now, and unless we can take steps to secure for British buyers, i.e., those firms in Mohammerah and Ahwaz buying for export to the United Kingdom, rates of freight enabling them to purchase at level prices with the Germans, the Germans will be able to carry all before them. ^ 3. Major Haworth views this prospect with the more alarm as he considers that the arrival of the Germans in strength will not only adversely affect our position in Arabistan, but will also undermine the influence and authority of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, inasmuch as it will be the policy of the Germans to refer matters of interest for arrangement between their legation in Tehran and the Persian Government. 4. Major Haworth therefore urges that His Majesty’s Government should follow German tactics in regard to the support of purchase of grain by their firms, and grant confidentially as a temporary measure, until our position in Arabistan is more sure against German attack, a rebate of 2s. 6d. per ton on grain shipped by British merchants in British ships to the United Kingdom. The expenditure involved by such a measure, which in practice would come to mean that British buyers could purchase at similar prices to those of their German rivals, confident that the rates of freight charged by British lines would not be against them, is estimated by Major Haworth at 6,000Z. supposing that every ton of grain coming down the Karim were purchased by British firms ; whereas in actual fact the quantity purchased and expense involved would be far less. 5. The proposal that His Majesty’s Government should make good any difference between the freight_ charged on grain shipped in British steamers from Arabistan and Bushne and the freight charged on the German vessels has been put forward more than once in the annual reports on German trade issuing from this Residency The matter leTtt “r“ rati ° n thlS SUmmer lf fUrther damage t00Ur not to be [2133 6—1]2 A copy of this letter has been submitted to the Secretary of State for Foreigr Affairs and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.^ ^ S. G. KNOX, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major Haworth to Major Knox. (Confidential.) Mohammerah, March 21, 1914. ^ IN my letter dated the 12th February last I ventured to state what appeared iuy aci/uo +r . xi nuestion of the German commercial invasion of tTe Karun and Ambistan, and gave what seemed to be the most desirable strategical steps to be taken with a view to° meeting the attack which had been made on our interests. ^ ^ conneotion with which this despatch should be read, the season has advanced and with it the prospects of the gram season have become clear. ^ tQ forward herewit h some further remar^ upon the situation, together with suggestions which appear the logical sequence of the position. There has been practically no cold weather this year and no frosts; thus the crops are more advanced than is norma), and it is assured that the season failing untoward accident, will be one of the greatest on record. More rain is hardly necessary, but should we have another rainfall the year will exceed in prosperity the bumper season This is a question which has a great bearing on the one we are discussing, since a prosperous year will make the Germans independent for the next few years and will enable them to carry forward a reserve which will render them immune to all the steps which we may otherwise take against them. . . ,. , In addition, they will be independent of outside cargoes, since the gram which they purchase will give them all that they require for their steamer and barges on the Karun. In the pain trade foreign firms, like the natives of the country, live on the fat years which follow the lean. r . 1u . , * A good season produces probably 50,000 tons of wheat and barley. Ip 18 is not declared in the customs owing to the frauds which take place, but it is proba e that this estimate does not exceed the actual produce. ATI of this, or practically all, has to be carried down the Karun. _ The combined fleet of ships and barges carry about 900 tons per trip. Making an allowance of some 10,000 tons to be carried in native boats, there remains some 40,000 tons for the steamers. At one trip a week, which is about tne average lun, it won take more than ten months of regular sailings, with full cargoes, to deal with the gram alone. In actual fact, the boats would be run at a profit with smaller cargoes, and the grain traffic would be sufficient to induce Messrs. Wonckhaus to keep their steamer on the river. _ I A further point to be noted is the smuggling to which I made a passing reierence. British firms have refused to take part in the wholesale defrauding of the Customs which takes place in grain exports from Mohammerah. The Germans are notoriously one of the worst offenders, and shipping, as they so frequently do, in bulk, it is the more difficult to check them. The problems before us then are :— 1. To take steps to see that the Germans are not able to smuggle as they have been doing in the past, since wffiat they gain in this manner enables them successtui y to offer greater prices for grain than can profitably be offered by British firms. 2. To take measures by which they will be unable to purchase sufficient gram o fill their steamers and so make their year a loss to them and prevent them carrying forward reserves for future years. To meet the first case I have already taken steps which I trust will be effective. It was suggested that if the manifests of all steamers, whether for export or import, were deposited in the Customs, it would make it extremely difficult to ma false declarations. It appeared to me that if at the same time it were necessary to ma ea declaration of the draught of all ships on arrival and departure, it would be an additional check of the amounts loaded. Local British firms have agreed to these checks being imposed, and I have accordingly addressed the Director of Customs with a view to having regulations to this effect brought into force. Some time ago I initiated a chamber of commerce in Mohammerah, and local firms have now agreed to keep a clerk, who will be at the disposal of this consulate, so that I shall be able to issue weekly returns of exports and imports. We shall then be able to check German imports very thoroughly, and may be of some assistance to the Customs without openly appearing in the matter. Firms have also agreed to send to the information bureau slips of any news which may come to their ears. These tactical measures should be useful, but the main defence cannot lie in local measures. The main defence and attack must at all times be strategical and not tactical. At the risk of repeating what was said in my previous letter, I would wish to point to the value of Arabistan to us politically and commercially. Unchecked the Germans will purchase largely and will build up a large business as they have done in Basra. They openly express their intention of pushing their interests on the Karun and driving Messrs. Lynch off the river. Should we think the preservation of our own interests dearly purchased with an expenditure of some 4,000L, 5,0001., 6,0001., or even 10,000Z., especially if we believe that that money is laid to our future gain ? We are giving money in loans to Persia for her gendarmerie in order to quiet the country. Our object in this is to prevent Persia from disintegration. Our object in Arabistan is similar. The power of the Sheikh is one of our greatest assets. The arrival of the Germans in strength will not only have an effect on our position, but it will gradually undermine the power and position of the Sheikh. As it has been, and will be, our policy to support the Sheikh wherever possible, so it must and will be the policy of the Germans to refer all matters to Tehran, whenever it is possible to do so. Our position on this question has already been the subject of part of a despatch dated the 7th December last from Sir Percy Cox to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, and upon the decision of His Majesty’s Government in this respect must depend very largely the steps which we are prepared to take. As a matter of continuity with our policy in the past it will not, however, be a great stretch of imagination to consider that we do value our position here at more than either 5,000L or 10,000/. I have in a previous communication suggested that this position is worth more, and vastly more, to the taxpayers of India or Great Britain than the sums named, whether as insurance or calculated as a commercial transaction in hard cash. The Germans are attacking the situation by means of rebates of some nature. The only reply possible is to resort to the same means, as a temporary measure. It is only in a year like the one now anticipated that this really counts, and as already stated, the Germans are depending largely on this season’s profits to establish them firmly in Arabistan, a statement which I make on the authority' of the German agent himself. It is calculated that the Germans receive a rebate of about 2s. 6d. per ton of grain shipped. I have no hesitation in saying that, for this year only, we must offer, very confidentially, the same terms to our firms where purchasing through British agents. The total sum involved, were British firms to succeed in taking every ton which came down the Karun, would not exceed 6,0001. ; in actual fact the sum would necessarily be very much less. I am aware that in suggesting the above I am suggesting a mode of action very foreign to our natures, but exceptional circumstances demand exceptional measures, and, while speaking with all due deference, I cannot express my opinion too strongly^ that, unless we take steps of the kind, the German question in Arabistan will assume formidable dimensions which an expenditure of a few thousand pounds would inadequately express. The tendency, and a necessary tendency, of all officials is to exaggerate the importance of the ^ interests to which they are attached ; but having made due allowance for this, it appears to me that the interests at stake are worth many times the expenditure which I am asking may be undertaken.4 In conclusion, I would state that I only suggest that such steps should be taken until such time as we have consolidated our position in Arabistan and have rendered innocuous any commercial measures which the Germans may desire to take. Once our nosition is determined, commercial undertaking of the Germans, though not to be neglected, will have lost the great importance which they have assumed. I have, &amp;c. L.

According to the financial statements furnished by the Euphrates a Tigris Company it appears that the service on the Lower Karun has been carried on at a constant loss, in spite of the annual subsidy received until three years ago; whilst the trading profit of Messrs Lynch Bros, has been small. The Company consider that *here is no sufficient reason to anticipate that this particu lar service will he markedly more successful, from a commercial point of view, when ?nanaged by the new firm of Sfaekay, lynch &amp; Co., having regard to (1) the shortness of the rout© and the consequent fact that, for downward traffic (mostly loc.a produce) the steamer service offers little advantage over the service by native craft; ( 2 ) Hie Und^r Secretary of State, Foreign Office141 (2) the new German competitioni and (3) th« adverse effect of such a r^L Iway that now contemplated from Moh&amp;mmerah to Khoramsliad. As regards the services between Ahwas and Ispahan the Company state that the road was constructed by Messrs Lynch for the account of the dakhtiari chief*i that the amount actually expended by the firm was £3,000 more than tie sum (£5,500) recoverable from the chiefs in respect of such construetioni and that Messrs Lynch do not enjoy any exclusive ri^ht to ant as forwarding agents on the road. The Board are informed that, apart from their charges for acting in this l^st-mentioned c&amp;pacit , the firm derive no receipts from the road beyond the interest on the sua advanced by them to the chiefs (at a rate considerably below the normal rate in Persia)i that they maintain a service of road inspection at a cost of about £300 per annum, and recoup themselves for this by an additional charge on packages forwarded by them; but that though this charge is very small, it has given rise to complaints from the consignees, ».5,nc&lt;&gt; other f rwarders using the road, who do not ©hare the cost of road inspection, do not levy the additional v charge. tfesere Lynch contend that thia portion of their buslneea haa for aome time paat yielded bo a i' rofit that the desirability of withdrawing from it haa bean under their consideration. In the llrht of the information contained in the documents furnished by Messrs Lynch, and the supple mental ataterenta Bade by Mr Lynch personally, the Board feel that the comprehonsiTe strictures passed upon the firm by Mr Vice-Consul Chick and aajor Haworth probablyprobably need some qi,alitlcation. it is doubtlese possible that &amp; more energetic firm, on better terms with the natives Generali} f tslght have been nor© aucceee- ful&gt; the Board doubt if the present trade conditions and prospects of the particular region now under consideration are / taken by themselves ( such as to ancourame any firm to adopt a very enterprising policy* It may well be that lossrs Wonckhau© (the danger of #hoss activities Messrs Lynch fully recognise) have entered upon a course of ] action similar to, and ins ired by the same motives as their action elsewhere in the Persian Gulf* and if that be the case, the Boar&amp;^noi think that British firms oan reasonably be expected to depend solely upon their own resources in endeavouring to meet the German aggression.

Sir ’ r a tvt j x 11 1 -r^ Board of Trade, March 16, 1914. d I AM directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letter of the 7th November/ ; transmitting copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, with a report by Mr. H. G. Chick on German trade and shipping in the Persian Gulf during the Y ear October 1911-12, and to offer the following observations thereon for HP ! bir it. Grey s consideration. J As stated in their observations on previous reports furnished by His Majesty’s consul-general on this ^ subject, the Board have always been of opinion that German enteipuse m the Peisian Gulf, and particularly the action of the Hamburg—America Line, has been determined primarily not by economic considerations but by political mteiests,^ and has been possible only because of some form of State encouragement, diiect or indirect. On the other hand, some of the criticisms directed m these reports against British shipowning and other firms engaged in the Gulf trade have appeared to the Boaid to be due in some measure to an incomplete appreciation of the actual position, and m any event the Board have not seen their way to endeavour to induce such films to enter into a competition which, in the absence of active support from His Majesty’s Government, would have little prospect of success. The Board have not doubted, however, that more vigorous action would be taken by British firms so soon as it appeared likely that some economic advantage would be derNed therefrom. They are now informed by Lord Inchcape, with whom they have been in communication in accordance with the suggestion contained in your letter under reply, that in consequence of recent developments in connection with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, steps are being taken by British shipping firms which will, it is believed, do much towards reasserting British commercial predominance in the Gulf trade. The proposals summarised in paragraphs 1-12 on pp. 16-17 of Mr. Chick’s report above-mentioned fall into three groups :— 1 . Action with regard to Shipping Companies. —It is suggested that His Majesty’s Government should induce the Bucknall Line to send vessels regularly to Antwerp, and the British India Line to institute direct sailings between the United Kingdom and Gulf ports, in co-operation or combination with the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall Lines. As this would probably involve a conflict with the Hamburg-America Line, it is further suggested that an effort should be made to bring about some form of combination of the various British shipping lines engaged in the Gulf trade, and that fuller support should be obtained for them from British and Indian trading firms. 2. Action with regard to British and Indian Trading Firms. —The support mentioned in the preceding paragraph might, it was suggested, take the form of (a) inducing firms which ship Belgian sugar or other products to insist that such goods shall be shipped from Antwerp only in British vessels ; (b) securing that the contracts for the carriage of Manchester goods should be retained by Mr. Strick, thereby depriving the Hamburg-America Line of the chief inducement for their proposed calls at United Kingdom ports; and (c) encouraging British firms importing wood (for date boxes or other purposes) into Gulf ports to take Mysore wood instead of Swedish, this encouragement to take the form of cheaper freights by the British India Line, granted at the instigation of the Government of India. . 3. Miscellaneous Suggestions. —These include regular sailings provided by the British steamship lines for grain exports from Persian ports and the reduction of freights whenever German agents are overoidding, a comprehensive collection by His Majesty’s consular officers of foreign goods selling in Southern Persia, and the formation of Persian Gulf sections of the London and Manchester Chambers of Commerce. With regard to the first group of proposals, the Board understand from Lord Inchcape that an agreement has now been entered into by the British India Company, the Anglo-Algerian Company, the Bucknall Lines, and Sir Marcus Samuel, as to the [2063 r—1] A- - c 1 /t ' ’ i Oi 4 * 16 :7 AP 11914 p i 14 7 7 PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. [March 17. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. ■7 L 1914__, ' 01926] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received March 17.)2 a s m Gulf services (sailings and freights) between Europe and the Gulf ports. The British India Company has recently incurred heavy expenditure in respect of the construction and equipment of five vessels for the service between Bombay to Karachi and Gulf ports, and three vessels of larger tonnage for a service between the United Kingdom and the Gulf. These vessels will all have a speed of 15 knots, and be fitted with wireless apparatus, which is also established, or to be established, at several places on the Gulf. Further, arrangements have been made for a regular monthly sailing of a Bucknall Line or British India vessel from Antwerp to the Gulf, with intermediate calls at United Kingdom ports. The possibility that this would be followed by the call of German vessels at British ports has been obviated bv an agreement between the British group of companies and the Hamburg—America Line, under which the rates of freight charged from Antwerp by the British and German vessels will be identical, and the latter will not call at ports in the United Kingdom. Finally, in this connection, it may be mentioned that the British India Company have lighters for their own use at Bush ire, and have established a lighterage service at Bahrein. It is hoped that similar facilities may be provided by the same company at other ports in the Gulf, and that all the lighterage services may then be transferred to - special British company, in which the various shipping interests shall participate. In the opinion of the Board the arrangements outlined above are likely to result a more efficient service to and from the Persian Gulf, and will also place the uritish companies in a position sufficiently strong to enable them to meet any possible German competition in the future. As regards the second group of suggestions contained in Mr. Chick's report, it will, under the new arrangement, be possible for British firms desiring to ship Belgian products to do so by British vessels sailing from Antwerp, and the competition of the Hamburg-America Line for the contracts for the carriage of Manchester goods will be obviated. The encouragement of the substitution of Mysore wood for Swedish wood would appear to be a matter for the consideration of the Government of India, but the Board have some doubt as to the practicability of the proposal. With regard to the miscellaneous suggestions put forward in Mr. Chick’s report, the conditions which have prevailed in recent years in the Persian Gulf grain trade are well known to British shipowners and traders, who are definitely of opinion that that trade has been of an unremunerative character, and that Messrs. Wonckhaus and the Hamburg-America Line have either incurred heavy losses in this respect or have been recouped in some manner not at present ascertained. They are reluctant to engage themselves in the trade on such lines, and the Board are not disposed to urge them to do so. I he improvement in the British services to the Gulf may, however, modify the situation to some extent. Ihe Board will be glad to arrange for the exhibition of any samples of foreign goods sold in Southern Persia which His Majesty’s consular officers may think useful to procure at any time, hut they doubt if, in the existing conditions of Persian trade, much active interest would be taken by British traders in such samples. They further desire me to point out that any action by His Majesty’s Government in respect of systematic collections of such samples, and of the formation of Persian Gulf sections of the London and Manchester Chambers of Commerce, would probably be interpreted as an invitation to British firms to take a more active interest in Persian trade. Having regard, however, to the difficulties encountered by firms now engaged in such trade—• difficulties caused mainly by the insecurity of the roads in the British and neutral zones ana by Russian commercial and political policy in Persia—the Board do not feel able to ta e t e responsibility of recommending any action of the kind until there has been such an improvement m the prevailing conditions as shall afford British trade with Persia a reasonable measure of security. 1 he Board desire me to add the expression of their appreciation of the valuable reports on the commercial position in the Gulf which have been furnished by Sir Percy ox an r. Chick, and of the care and attention which they have given to the whole matter. I have, &amp;c. H.

S.-57, of 14th January 1914, to submit my views on Mr. Chick’s report on German trade and shipping in the Persian Gulf during the year ending in autumn 1912. lam aware of, ; vh &gt;- j and will endeavour to give full weight to the principle, laid down in the letter of the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated 6th August 1913, that the security of In dian political interests in the Persian Gulf depends largely upon the maintenance of British Commercial supremacy in that region. A copy of despatch No. 56, Commercial, Confidential, of the 10th December 1913, from Sir C. Hertslet, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Antwerp, to the Foreign Office (print No. 55973) has opportunely come to hand as I was on the point of writing. 2. It is generally recognised that German Commercial competition in the Persian Gulf has been inspired from the first by a political idea, and that its object is to create material interests which will in the end enable Germany to claim a voice in political questions. The German policy directly challenges that British Com mercial supremacy which it is considered essential in the interests of India to pre serve ; and it has already, as can easily be shown, and as will appear to some extent from what follows, achieved a considerable measure of success. German trade and shipping have come into being during the last eight years in a field where pre viously they did not exist; the representatives of British Commercial interests have had their scope of action curtailed and in some directions are hard pressed ; and the growth of German commerce, and with it German prestige, still continues. 3. In this connection, I would draw particular attention to restrictions which German shipping interests seem already to be imposing on the working of British lines. In 1908 Mr. George Lloyd, M.P., explained how Mr. Strick and the management of the Bucknall and West Hartlepool lines had been brought to agree to the terms of Herr Balhn ; and now Mr. Kearney mentions, in an enclosure to Sir C. Hertslet’s despatch already quoted, that Sir J. Ellerman consulted the Hamburg-Amerika Line before the recent establishment of a Hall Line service to the Gulf, adding “ It is a moot point as to what view the Hamburg-Amerika Line would adopt, were the Hall Line at some future date to increase its regular sailings from Antwerp to the Gulf beyond one a month ”. It further appears from Mr. Kearney’s report that the British India Steam Navigation Company are precluded by “ un fortunate agreements ” from taking cargo from Antwerp for certain ports in the Near East on condition that the Hamburg-Amerika Line does not take cargo for the same places from London; and it would be useful if His Majesty’s Govern ment could ascertain for certain from the headquarters of the British India Steam Navigation Company in London whether the ports of the Persian Gulf are among those to which this arrangement refers. An announcement in Reuter’s news tele grams which has appeared in the course of the last few days regarding a Persian Gulf Agreement between the Hall and the Hamburg-Amerika Lines does not re move the impression that the British Navigation Companies have already to some extent parted with their freedom of action m the Persian Gulf. 4. There is another fact which bears evidence to the growing power of German interests. Mr. Kearney’s figures show that 17 German vessels in 1912-13 carried from Antwerp alone to the Persian Gulf 49,574 metric tons of cargo, whereas Mr. Chick estimated at 33,000 British tons only the whole of the cargo carried from Hamburg and Antwerp in German bottoms during the preceding year. 5. The strength of the German movement seems to lie in foresight and com bination of forces, the weakness of British resistance in narrowness of view and lack of organised action. The isolated British shipping companies and small firms working in the Gulf have no national cohesion. They are not conscious of enjoy- C712FD II APR 19:4 India, Se:ketarys i No J 3 .Vi, dated 26 MAR 1914t 7 ing Government guidance or support in the same measure as their German rivals. They also, perhaps, do not realise the importance to all of them of the maintenance of the general British position of superiority, and are therefore prone not to look beyond their separate interests and immediate profits. These defects can only be remedied by His Majesty's Government giving them a lead and influencing them to act in combination as their German rivals are already doing. 6. There is now a strong consensus of opinion in favour of measures for con solidating British interests and co-ordinating British action in the Gulf. Sir C. Hertslet, from his despatch already quoted, evidently agrees with Sir Percy Cox in thinking that there is room for official aid ; and I venture to believe that, if any line of action free from serious drawbacks can be pointed out, His Majesty's Govern ment will be ready to adopt it. There appears to be such a line, for His Ma jesty's representatives in the Persian Gulf are well placed for reporting each fresh development of German shipping and trade to the Home Government and to the Government of India as it occurs, and for suggesting means to counter it; while authoritative advice tendered by the Foreign Office and Board of Trade, after con sidering the reports from the Persian Gulf, could hardly be disregarded by mer chants. According to my information the direct trade from Europe to the Persian Gulf is in the hands chiefly of a few firms in England who make a speciality of it. Pat differently, the recipients of orders for goods, whether coming through British agencies in the Gulf or direct from Persian and Arab merchants, are nearly all of them well-known houses in London, Manchester, etc. These firms are mostly under obligation to His Majesty’s Government. Messrs. Gray Dawes and Company, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, Messrs. Lynch Brothers and Messrs/F. C. Strick and Company, Limited, are interested in concessions and undertakings that constantly require Government support; while others, such as Messrs. David Sassoon and Company, Limited, Messrs. E. D. Sassoon and Company, and Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar and Sons, Limited, look to the British representative to support their agencies in Persia and recover their local claims. The shipping companies running to the Gulf are similarly specialised and similarly amenable to Govern ment influence. In these circumstances the British firms and companies controll ing the Persian trade cannot but receive attentively advice from Government as to their general policy and other relations with each other, and they should be prepared to enter into schemes of co-operation that may be devised for their common good. I will now touch on some practical points. 7. One of Mr. Chick's suggestions in his Memorandum of September 1913, was that regular British sailings between Antwerp and the Gulf should be arranged in order to prevent the Hamburg-Amerika line from obtaining a monopoly of the carriage of sugar between Europe and the Persian Gulf. Mr. Kearney's report shows that Sir J. Ellerman, who manages the Hall Line, has arranged for a monthly service between British ports and the Persian Gulf, calling at Antwerp. (Parenthetically it may be remarked that this does not necessarily imply any in crease in the number of British vessels visiting the Persian Gulf, for other British sai ings may be reduced in view of the new Antwerp service, inasmuch as the Bucknall Line is under the same control as the Hall Line, and the West Hartlepool Line has dropped out). r i M r -Kearney states that no Belgian sugar has yet been shipped from Antwerp i 6 &amp; v an ^ accor d ln g manifests of those vessels seen at Bushire no loaf sugar has been brought here by them. This is unfortunate, for the chief ^ f &amp;vnur of Entxsh sailings from Antwerp was that they should make Hip Vmdr&gt;PQ ° Tft u ^P a ^ tli e sugar cargoes on which, after railway materials, Thp surrar n ° * , e , Line to the Gulf at present chiefly depends, a basis^nr ^ erman .^me is always increasing and forms as it were a few weTks ^ T ' ot , her °P eratl ™ s - ^ Chick ko P es to be able to submit in 1913 durin g th e year ending October of German sfpam ^ b as been a considerable increase in the number reauiied at BasTa^ 8 ^ 18 ^ 11 ^^^ j r» n ^ dou bt in consequence of materials being amount of snonr ,° r m ^ a ^bdad Railway, and an astonishing inciease in the amount of sugar brought by the Hamburg-Amerika Line.

Ziegler, iron for Hindu merchants at Bandar Abbas, etc If Sir J LUerman and those associated with him could enlist the support of the susar brokers m London and of the firms whose merchandise is in question, the Hall Line could probably secure a proportion of the sugar and a larger amount than at present of the other goods shipped from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf. The above seem to be matters in which Govemment intervention with the Hall Line and between the Hall Line and merchants might be welcome and useful - and this .Residency would endeavour to facilitate action on the part of the Board of JLrade by supplying lists of the British firms consigning goods from Belgium by Geiman steamers. Mr. Chick would be willing, when on leave, to interview the firms chrefly concerned, most of whom are already known to him. 8 . The question of grain exportation from the Persian Gulf is a serious one for British firms. In 1912-13 the number of German steamers coming to the Gulf was larger than before, on account of the cargoes of railway material and sugar offering , and if there had not been a general failure of crops and consequently no trade, it is highly probable that the firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Com- pany and the Hamburg-Ameiika Line, working together on a system of freight rebates, could so have manipulated the prices of grain as to prevent the purchase of any by British firms. It may be possible for His Majesty’s Government, without the grant of a subsidy, to induce British shipping lines to give such terms to British grain purchasing firms as will enable the latter to persevere in competition with Messrs. Wonckhaus. The matter is one which derives very careful attention, as otherwise the total elimination of British houses from this line of business may be the result. It is desirable that anything that is done should be done early, as the grain season will begin about June and the present year’s harvest premises to be a good one. 9. The wcod and timber trade of the Persian Gulf is already large and must ex- - pand with the growth of industry and enterprise. Hitherto the Government of India have not seen their way to urge the Mysore State to enter into this trade, as the commercial organisation attached to the Mysore Forest Department would enable it to do. I respectfully suggest that the time has now airived when, in the interests of British and British Indian Commercial supremacy in the Persian Gulf, the Darbar might be invited to give special attention to the matter and even to incur some moderate outlay on an experiment. The first step would be nothing more serious than to depute a qualified agent to study the Gulf markets, which he could do on an absence from India of about six weeks. I enclose extracts from a letter which I wrote lately to Sir Hugh Daly, Resident in Mysore, with reference to this question. 10 . My experience of Bushire is short; and besides endorsing Mr. Chick’s suggestions for ensuring the carriage of all Manchester goods by British steamers for regular calls by British steamers at all Gulf ports, for the foimation of a British Lighterage Company, and for the institution of Persian Gulf sections in the Chambers of Commerce which he mentions, I have only the above remarks and recommendations to make on his memorandum under consideration.4 I shall submit, in continuation of this letter, a note by Mr. Chick on a sudden and menacing development of Geiman enterprise in the navigation of Karun River. Extract from a letter, dated 24th January 1914, from J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Hugh Daly, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Resident in Mysore. Before coming to Bushire I had finished four years at Baghdad, where also the wood question is important, and you will not mind if I try to cast a little new light on it. The question has been treated too much, I think, from the standpoint of the Basrah demand for date-boxes. Date-boxes are the biggest item in the wood trade of the Gulf trade at present, but by no means the whole of it, and there are other large items only now beginning to develop, such as the Baghdad Railway demand at Baghdad, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s demand at Abadan, etc. The former of these concerns requires a great quantity of timber, the latter wood for hundreds of thousands of oil cases per annum ; and there is also the ordinary demand for timber for house and boat-building at all the places in the Gulf region from Masqat up to Baghdad. The whole of this region used to be served by India, as appears from the timber found in the Sassanian ruins of Ctesiphon (sixth century) and the Arab ruins of Samarra (ninth century) being Indian teak ; and it would be strange, even with the modern means of support, if it were to be permanently served to any great extent from Europe. Enclosed is an abstract, very incomplete but giving some idea of the present dimensions of the Gulf wood trade. That trade might increase in various ways independently of the Baghdad Railway and Oil Company. At Baghdad, for example, on account of the difficulty of getting wood, steel beams are now largely used in house-building. At Baghdad I brought Meissner Pasha, the head of the Railway, into relations with Mr. Strickland, and the result has been three orders as the Mysore Durbar per haps know. If the stations, etc., of this German Railway could be built through out with British Indian timber, we could look at them with more complacency. The Oil Company’s requirements, and those of the house boat-builders every where in the Gulf have still to be studied and the date-box industry, which for some time to come may remain the most important of all, has not yet been examined on the spot by an expert. The following is an extract from a private letter which one of the most experienced and successful British merchants at Baghdad has written me since 1 came here. He was and is the medium between Mr. Strickland and the Baghdad Railway Company, so perhaps it would be better not to quote him in such a way as to make his identity appear. The extract is apropos of the fulfilment by the Mysore forests of the Railway Company’s orders. There are all sorts of reasons for these delays, everyone of them perfectly good, but the result is, from a commercial point of view, very unsatis factory and illustrates the difficulty of dealing direct with a distant source of supply and not with a middleman or dealer who holds stocks. Under these circumstances and until I get more experience of these woods and how we can handle them, I am not prepared to order for sale or to encourage the idea that we will do so. I feel sure at the same time that there is an opening, and if the Mysore people really want to open up the market they might open small depots at the various ports of the Gulf which seem to promise well and include Baghdad. They would then be able to supply these depots with wood at the most favourable seasons for same to be sold in the best selling season. I suggested some time ago that they should adopt this plan at Baghdad, but nothing came of it. Once the business is veil established, the depot system could be allowed to lapse as orders could then be passed.”Possibly the additional information now given might induce the Mysore Durbar to look favourably on the proposal that Mr. Strickland should visit the Dulf He could take up the Baghdad Railway question at Baghdad, the date-box question at Basrah, the oil case question at Muhammareh, and the question of general demand at these and at other places. His tour would not cost much, and he would be helped by all officers under Residency in every possible way and like wise, I have no doubt, by the Resident at Baghdad and His Britannic Majesty's , Wif' r , e , gar ? * 0 t W °° T d for da * e - b ^ S n I als0 &lt; l U0te the following from a letter of Mr. Strickland, dated January 3rd, 1913 :— I have all along fully realised the great importance of securing for this Government (or if that be impracticable from consideration of carriage, etc.) then for some other districts of South-West India a business worth some £63,000 annually and which finds an outlet for some 70,000 cubic feet of timber, which is worthless for other purposes.'

In continuation of Mr. Lorimer’s letter No. 135, dated 17th January 1914, 1 have the honour to enclose a copy of a Memorandum by Mr. H. G. Chick, Commercial Adviser to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, on German activity on the Karun and in ’Arabistan. 2 The facts which it brings to notice are of great interest and importance, especially at a time when the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have many difficulties and uncertainties to contend with, and when the recent loss of their most influential director may have temporarily paralysed initiative on their • part. 3. The arrangement under which the Hamburg- Amerika line will henceforth, in the absence of special instructions to the contrary, transfer all cargo brought out by them for the Karun to the German river line established by Messrs. \\ onc- khaus in preference to the British Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Companv may, as Mr. Chick points out, have far-reaching effects.^ It emphasises the necessity that all British firms purchasing goods on the continent for export to Karun ports should be induced to ship them by a British line which would give the preference to a British Company in the matter of onward transport from Muham- march, and not by the Hamburg-Amerika. 4 It is much to be hoped that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Companv, if not too greatly hampered at the moment by internal difficulties, may be persuaded to modernise and improve their Karun service without delay or otherwise that some new British Company will step into the breach and under take the task of combating the German enterprise. As soon as the statistics required have been collected, I hope to be able to submit Mr. Chick’s report on German Trade and Shipping in the Persian Gulf for the period October 1912-1913. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Government of India. MEMORANDUM ON GERMAN ACTIVITY ON THE KARUN AND ’ARAB- J bavp. flip, honour to forward, for thp information of tho flnATornmont. of India noted, which Mr. Lorimer addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in regard to German activity on the Karun and in ’Arabistan. No. 4, dated like 8th February 1914. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Bushire, To—His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. ISTAN. Development op Messrs. R, Wonckhaus &amp; Co.’s Business. C713ED07 It r i “ Traun, Sturcken &amp; Co. have a capital of some 2,000,000 marks and a Mr. Zillow (? Z^innow), a nephew of Mr. Alfred Beit, is a commanditaire partner in the firm for 500,000 marks. ” Sir W. Ward notified the Foreign Office in April 1913 that a Director of the Hamburg-Amerika Line was proceeding to the Gulf, in order to study the possibili ties for the development for his company. It does not appear whether Herr Zinnow is a Director of the German line, and, if so, the Director referred to. Herr Zinnow visited Muhammareh, and then proceeded to Ahwaz, where he spent some days, being engaged with Mr. Randall, Messrs. \ onckhaus’ agent in Muhammareh, in trying to arrange for the lease of a wharf. According to reports from Muhammareh, he was due to go on from Ahwaz to Shush tar “ on a tour of inspection ”, and it is stated on good authority that Messrs, u onckhaus &amp; Co. intend to open agencies at both Shushtar and Dizful. In July a Persian named Agha Muhammad Baqir was appointed agent for Messrs. vVonckhaus’ steamers (see note below) at Ahwaz. A German assistant has been placed under Mr. Randall at Muhammareh. Thus the firm would appear to have :— At Muhammareh Ahwaz Shushtar and Dizful Two Europeans. Office with Persian Agent. Prospective Agencies. (It may be remarked in this connection that Messrs. Lynch keep a Persian at Diz ful, an Indian at Shushtar, as agents on about £ 7 per mensem, but do very little business, as they are too understaffed at Ahwaz to give serious attention to out-offices.) German Steamer craft on the Karun. The twin-screw steam-tug “ Pionier ” was brought out to Basrah by Messrs. R. Wonckhaus as agents of the Hamburg-Amerika Line early in 1913, and com menced running between Muhammareh and Ahwaz (Nasiri) on the 15th July. It will be remembered that, according to Despatch No. 2 Commercial of 22nd Feb ruary 1913 from His Majesty's Consul at Basrah to Sir Edward Grey, this vessel was to tow barges of special form for lightering the vessles of the Hamburg- Amerika Co. from and to the bar of the Shatt-al-'Arab. Its draft was reported too great for the Karun, and the “ Samara ”, a single screw tug, was introduced, but towards the end of 1913 both the “ Samara ” and the “ Pionier” were working frequently. Between July 15th and December 31st, 1913, twelve journeys were made by these two vessels, between Muhammareh and Ahwaz. Barges have been utilised in addition by the German firm, each steam-tug towing two barges m nine cases out of twelve. The tonnage of these vessels is given by His Majesty's Consul at Muham mareh as follows :— S. S. Pionier S. S. Samara Barges —5 1 130 75 110 85 tons, tons, ton each, tons. Information as to the tonnage of cargo actually carried from Muhammareh to Ahwaz in these German vessels is not yet to hand, but the return cargo from Ahwaz to Muhammareh is known to have .scaled 458 tons (during the last quarter of 1913, 294 tons, whereas Messrs. Lynch's vessel “ Malamir '' had carried 595 tons in the same period). Messrs. Wohckhaus ^ and Co. began by cutting the prices charged by Messrs. Lynch as freight, and their tugs went from wharf to wharf at Muhammareh collect- ing cargo, and thus saving merchants hire for small lighters. Through cargo was also reported to have been shipped from Bushire. 6 ffote.—The partnership between Traun. Strucken and Co. and Herr Wonckhaus was after- wardstosolved and earned on by Herr Wonckhaus as sole partner, but it was reported that Mi. Otto Beit ‘had agreed to lend the firm £ 50,000 for 10—12 ~ 03 \ Regular running, accessibility and attention to business, combined with the fact that the Samara is well suited for work, have, it is said, given the Germans a fair amount of freight. Their agent is a keen business man. Messrs. Wonckhaus 4 * are said to be running the “ Samara ” at a profit, and with such greater eco~ ▼ nomy than in the case of S. S. “ Malamir ” (Messrs. Lynch’s boat) that they could afford to reduce freight by nearly 50 per cent, without actually losing money. .Leases of wharves by Messrs. Wonckhaus at Muhammareh and Ahwaz. ' Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. obtained from the Shaikh of Muhammareh in 1909 the lease of a site on the banks of the Karun on the strict terms current in ’Arabistan, for a period of 8 years only. Major Haworth reported in September 1913 that . German firm were about to approach the Shaikh with reference to a ten years’ lease of the wharf, and intended to erect buildings thereon. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphed on October 19th that Mu’in-ut- Tujjar had shown him a telegram, which Messrs. Wonckhaus had sent to him, desir ing the lease of a wharf at Ahwaz. Mu’in-ut-Tujjar agreed to instruct his agent to consult His Majesty s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, and to act in accordance with his advice in the matter, and to conclude no lease that had not been approved by Mu’in-ut-Tujjar himself. Major Haworth subsequently saw the Shaikh of Muhammareh and obtained a guarantee that no other wharf would be leased to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. Later the Mu'in’s agent, fearing that the Persian Customs would lease part of their wharf to Messrs. Wonckhaus, got nervous and temporised with the Germans ; then, recovering his courage, tele graphed to Mu’in-ut-Tujjar in Tehran to refuse a lease. Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, playing his usual game, represented to His Majesty’s Minister (telegram No. 3 of 10th January 1914 to Muhammareh) that the Germans were offering him a large price, and that their suspicions were likely to be aroused by his dalliance, whilst he was losing £700—£900 per annum owing to his refusing such a lease to the Germans. Major Haworth further apprehended that the Persian Government, if pressed by the German Legation to facilitate the lease of a wharf, might be able to force the Shaikh of Muhammareh to grant a lease. Up to the latest reports, the German firm had been unable to lease a wharf at Ahwaz. Warehouse. According to a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister No. 3, dated 10th Jan uary 1914, the Germans had concluded a lease for a warehouse (at Ahwaz ?). Barges. Major Haworth telegraphed on 14th January that Wonckhaus &amp; Co. had placed an order for SjMotor Engines with the Torbinia Company at Ipswich. Two barges had been already despatched (from Europe) for erection by the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd., and the engines will be fitted into the barges (in May 1914, it is expected) by the Company. The British Firms’ position in ’Arabistan. Messrs. Lynch Bros .-—The British company most concerned and the only British shipping company working on the Karun, have an office at Muhammareh, where an ex-master of the “ Malamir ” acts as their agent, and an office at Ahwaz with an Englishman in charge. As already stated above, their so-called “ agencies ” at Shushtar and Dizful are in the hands of an Indian and a Persian respectively, both poorly paid, and doing little business, partly for the reason that the office in Ahwaz is understaffed, and unable to pay attention to business in those directions. Messrs. Lynch Brothers have the S. S. “ Malamir ” of 120 tons carrying capacity on the Lower Karun river, and the “ Shushan ” of 25 tons capacity, which has sailed under the Persian flag on the Uppei Karun since 1890. Both of these vessels have been running more than 20 years and are out of date, and, as already stated above, the working of the “ Malamir ” cannot be conducted with sufficient economy to permit of rates of freight being much reduced to meet German competition.4 In addition to their work as Managing Agents for these steamers, and to the activity which they should display as general importing and exporting merchants, it will be remembered that Messrs. Lynches office at Ahwazhas had to deal with the forwarding of nearly half the merchandise arriving at Ahwaz in transit for Isfahan, j and are also largely responsible for perfecting arrangements for traffic on the Ahwaz-Isfahan road. It may safely be said that Messrs. Lynch Brothers have signally failed to take advantage of the opportunities afforded them by this combination of openings for promoting their own and British interests. In a position where Messrs. Wonckhaus would have employed four or five German assistants, Messrs. Lynch have under staffed their offices, and been niggardly in their efforts to develop the business. Persian merchants dislike their careless, irregular methods of running the '‘Malamir,” and “ Shushan ”, as much as His Majesty’s Representatives and European firms ; while their mal-administration of the forwarding business from Ahwaz to Isfahan and the Bakhtiari road has been so far a byword, that the transfer of Messrs. Lynch’s responsibdlites to other hands, or the appointment of a Royal Engineer Officer has been urged before now on His Majesty’s Government. With affairs in such a condition, no partial measures by Messrs. Lynch, such as the permission recently given by their London office to keep their rates offt reight 5 per cent, lower than those of the Germans, will enable their representatives in 'Arabistan to check German competition. The death of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch has probably disorganised the firm still further. The situation demands a thorough change of policy—a larger staff in ’Arabistan, better paid to do better work, coupled with willingness to develop their business and spend money,—if Messrs. Lynch’s firm is to be of any assistance to His Majesty’s Government in checking German ulterior motives in ’Arabistan. Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited. This firm, Managing Agents at Muhammareh and Ahwaz for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, and also agents for Messrs. P. C. Strick’s steamers, take no share in river transport. They have no agencies in Shushtar and Dizful, and their office at Ahwaz is understood to do no general import and export business. They have however powerful financial support behind them and possess a numerous staff of keen business men. Their directors are greatly interested in the Luristan railway project, and by reason of the special footing on which they stand with the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, they are in a strong position to manage shipping between Muhammareh, Ahwaz, and Shushtar, Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company. They are also powerfully supported, having behind them the British India S. N. Company, Limited and Lord Inchcape, but they have never developed the business of their agency at Muhammareh, and have no connection with Ahwaz. As the leading steamer agents up the Shatt-al-Arab, their interests are injured by the encroachment of the German steamers on the carrying trade from Europe. Ahwaz is considered a Persian Gulf port and there is no apparent reason why the British India S. N. Company should not extend their ramifi cations up the Karun, by means of small river steamers, launches and barges. At the same time they need to be galvanised into more activity as importers and exporters of grain and produce from the Karun. Dangers arising out of German competition. Up till the autumn of 1913 the British position of commercial predominance in ’Arabistan was exposed to the same dangers by the operations of the Ham burg-Amerika Line, and Messrs. onckhaus and Company as other Persian and Arab ports in the Gulf. But it is clear from all that has happened since last July that the German politico-commercial combination have focussed their chief attention on ’Arabistan, and for British interests the situation has suddenly become acute. Looking not very far ahead the following are the eventual resultso! the German attack and energy behind it, if no measures of resistance are devis ed from the British side :— 1. Capture of nearly all the transport by steamer between Muhammareh, Ahwaz and Shushtar. Through cargo from Europe to Ahwaz.—{a) The circular (given in the last page of the Memorandum of Mr. Vice-Consul Kearney of Antwerp) issued by the Agents of the Hamburg-Amerika Line at Antwerp in December 19 1 3 ( a similar statement would undoubtedly be issued at Hamburg) runs translated “ Gentlemen, “ The Hamburg-Amerika Line asks us to inform you as follows f&lt; Re-forwardinqs from Muhammareh to Ahwaz.—Up to the present these re-forwardings have been made by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. The firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Company of Muhammareh has just inaugurated a, new (rerman river service, by which it will accept goods under the same condi tions as the British Line. Henceforth Bills of Lading and Lading Permits must make mention of selected by the consignor.

Messrs. Lynch of a large portion 0I *■ Md m L l /6 telegram No. 40 of November 8th,“ Lynch has less than half of total goods pass ing over road.” We may, therefore, be prepared to find the Germans actively interested in the fortunes of the Bakhtiari road, and owing to the insufficiency of transport animals on the Bushire-Isfahan road, and consequent tendency of the imports to Isfahan to use the Bakhtiari road almost entirely, they would have a great opportunity for interesting themselves in trade between the Gulf and Isfahan. 3. Expansion of German trade in Ahwaz, Dizful and Shushtar, and acquisi tion of a definite commercial interest in Arabistan trade. —If Wonckhaus and Com pany open agencies at Dizful and Shushtar, as well as at Aliwaz, their organisa tion will be as complete us that of Messrs. Lynch Brothers and better than that of any other British firm ; while Messrs. Wonckhaus 5 methods of business, lavish, as is well known to the Board of Trade, adventurous and keen, will place them in a position to do all the business there is to be obtained by a European firm at these places. At Dizful and Shushtar there is probably not room for two really enterprising firms, and the first established and best supported will have the ad vantage. In the export of grain from Ahwaz and the Karun district to Mohammareh, the possession of their own launches and barges on the river will enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to pursue their policy of outbidding all other buyers by obtaining rebates of freight for themselves, and also to get far larger quantities down to Mohammareh than in past years, while the higher rates quoted for the Euphrates and Tigris Company’s steamers will not permit other British firms to compete. The Germans have shown a disposition at Bushire to extend this method of crush ing British competition in seeds and gums and other Persian exports, and they are keen buyers of produce. If the summer of 1914 turns out well, the British firms will be placed in a disastrous position with regard to exports from up the Karun. Suggestions. —His Majesty’s Consul for ’Arabistan puts the position quite clearly in his letter of November 1st, 1913:— “ Our action to stop German competition depends upon the political action . we are prepared to take at the present time, rather than in com- mercial steps which can be jfut supplementary to our general pro- cedure. If the Germans are determined on coming into the Karun no commercial measures, as such, will stop them. It is then for us to see that our political measures should either make it difficult for them to expand in Arabistan or make our position so strong as to render their expansion innocuous. “ These political measures must be taken before the Germans are in a strong enough position to say, with any force, that their commercial in terests are sufficiently great to demand recognition”. His Majesty’s Consul mentions temporary subsidies to a British firm or British firms; but, subject to the opinion of His Majesty’s representatives in ’Arab istan, who are better able than I to judge as to their probable efficiency, the follow ing measures appear likely to check German commercial activity in ’Arabistan, if His Majesty’s Government agree that the present state of affairs in ^Arabistan is unsatisfactory:— A. The adoption of the desiderata expressed at the end of the Memorandum enclosed in Sir P. Cox’s despatch No. 13-Commercial of 21st Sep tember 1913. B. To meet the sugar trade now carried in German vessels from Antwerp, it is essential that the British firms ordering sugar in England and the sugar-brokers should be recommended through Government, or by intermediary, to insist on all shipments on their account from Antwerp being carried by the new Hall Line, or in other British vessels. To meet the circular issued by the Hamburg Amerika line at Antwerp (and Hamburg) all firms in Great Britain exporting to, or trading\ with, the Persian Gulf should be warned of the nature of the circu lar, and its object, and recommended to stipulate (if their goods ever go by Hamburg Amerika vessels from Antwerp or Hamburg) for transhipment to the British line in the Karun. C. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company now has, or will have shortly, it is understood, Lord Inchcape as one of its directors. His \oice on the board might make the company will ing to undertake the necessary action. In any case, the position, as outlined in this memorandum, might be ex plained to Lord Inchcape, and he be asked to interest himself in checking German shipping competition in the Karun. If he could persuade the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to reorganise their service thoroughly, the following changes seem necessary :— (i) Two new vessels of smaller draught to replace the f Malamir J and constructed to work as economically as the German vessels. (w) A proper supply of barges (it appears that the Germans are ordering barges to be self-propelled). (in) Two Europeans in tshe Company’s office at Mohammaieh, two at Ahwaz (shipments to Shushtar by S. S. “ Shushan ” have also to be looked after). A sufficient native staff would also be necessary. • (w) The Company to give their staff definite instructions to be as keen as the Germans to remove all former and present grounds of com plaint by the local population, and to compete in rates with the German vessels. If the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company cannot be got to undertake the reforms indicated, then an alternative course would be for Lord Inchcape as a director of the British India Steam Navigation Company to arrange for that company to extend its Gulf service to Ahwaz by providing as in (i), (ii), (in) and (iv), and to work specifically in competition with the Germans. The Eu phrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, Limited, and the ‘ Malamir ’ could then be left to do what they could up the Karun. Failing the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited, and then* friends, Messrs. F. C. Stiick and Com pany, Limited (ship-owners, the Strick Line), might be asked to fill the breach. D. Staffs of firms at Ahwaz, Shushtar and Dizful.- —Messrs. Lynch Brothers might be recommended, if they wish to retain the forwarding busi ness to Isfahan, to have two Europeans always at Ahwaz (this would work in well with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany’s business) and one at Shushtar. They require to aim at better arrangements for forwarding to Isfahan, at active participation in the general commerce of Ahwaz, Shushtar and neighbourhood ; and particularly in the export of grain from ’Arabistan. In view of the importance of Dizful on account of the railway, Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company might permanently post an English agent there to get a firm hold of the general trade of the town and sales to Luristan. E. The question of enabling British exporters up the Karun to compete in the purchase of grain, if the Germans quote high prices and make use of shipping rebates, will need consideration if the harvest of 1914 is good, as seems likely. The only solution appears to be a reduction of freight by the British vessels. H. G. CHICK, Commercial Adviser to the Political Resident and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Bushire. January 31st, 1914. G.

From— Major L. Haworth, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 3923, dated the 23rd December 1913, forwarding me a copy of a letter No. 3713, dated the 7th December 1913, addressed by Sir Percy (Cox to the Officiating Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, on the subject of our interests in Arabistan, and inviting Government to consider whether some steps were not now called for with a view to making our predominant position in the Province more definite and secure. Sir Percy Cox has, under six headings, dealt with the various questions which present themselves at this moment. In my present communication I propose :— 1st .—To go further into the subject of the latter part of the 6th heading, i.e., German activity on the Karun and in Arabistan, a question which has become more critical in the last two months. 2nd .—To propose some steps which would appear necessary at the moment to assist in the consolidation of our position. 2. Before going into the question of German activity it may not be out of place to summarise some of the reasons why it is so important that Arabistan should continue under our influence and control. Sir Percy Cox has pointed out, in his letter above referred to, that the tendency is for our commercial interests to centre and consolidate in Arabistan. I have already in the memorandum forwarded with the above letter, and which should bear the date August 2nd 1913, referred to the grain and cotton possibilities of the country. Sir Percy Cox in his letter stated “ Incidentally I may mention that I am convinced that apart from the political aspect the subject of irrigation is bound to come to the front before long as the natural result of the general commercial development in Arabistan.’’ There is much food for thought in the above statement. At the present moment the grain crop of the province is, except for certain limited districts, entirely dependent upon the rainfall, with the result that, while in a good year the value of the exports run^into several hundred thousand pounds, in a bad season the crop practically only suffices to feed the population of the country. A glance at the map will show that Arabistan is, to all intents and purposes, a smaller Egypt, but watered by a series of rivers in place of the one Nile. Since the matter with which I am dealing is chiefly connected with our position on the Persian Gulf I will in this letter refer only to the country under the jurisdic tion of the Shaikh of Mohammerah and which we can, through him, control. In saying this I do not wish to minimise the importance to us commercially of the country above, i.e., the country around Shushtar and Dizful, to which occasional reference may be made. The railway which we propose to build in Arabistan has focussed the attention of other powers on this fertile land with its valuable oil products, its annual crop of C.724F.D.dates and its great possibilities for the growing of cotton and grain. There is noth ing to prevent the land being developed to the prosperous condition of Egypt. The Shaikh realises as well as anyone else that he is incapable of developing this country for himself and, though heat present turns to us, it is certain that, if we do not mark the possibilities and grasp the situation, other nations will avail themselves of our missed opportunities. In the memorandum above referred to so recently as August 2nd I wrote ‘ 4 Up to the present interests in Arabistan have been absolutely British, and the onlv foreign firm, that of Messrs. \\ onckhaus, has been of no importance; With the opening 0 up of the country, however, and the arrival ^of the railway foreign firms will arrive in force and complicate the situation. vvhile I was writing Messrs. Wonckhaus were commencing their steamer service and six months later we have reached the phrase 4 4 German competition on the Karun. 3. It is frequently difficult to separate politics and commerce in determining the cause of our political actions since each reacts on the other. • In a case like the present, however, it is essential that we should reach first causes since it is upon first causes that we must base the line of action to be followed. More often perhaps, in foreign countries our political intervention follows on our commercial necessities, indeed our very interest may be due to our com mercial undertakings. In the South-West of Persia, though large commercial interests exist which react on the political situation, I think it will be admitted as an axiom that it is because of the political importance to us of Persia, situated as it is on the threshold of India, that we attach so much importance to our commerce m that country, indeed commerce is the outward and visible sign of our inward and political state. In India, German competition, though perhaps it may excite our interest commercially, is not a question of the first importance, because our political con dition is stable, in Persia on the other hand the position is different and German competition is feared, not on commercial, but on political grounds, since a too extended commercial activity in Arabistan would produce the ground for a poli tical interest^which does not otherwise exist and which we have no desire to see arising anywhere on the shores of the Persian Gulf of which Arabistan is the fron tier post in Persia. In 1903, Lord Lansdowne made a declaration of policy and announced the principle which has formed the basis of our action since that date. Our predominant position in these waters, combined with a recognition of the above announced principle and the reasons which led up to it, have been the origin and cause of constant diplomatic representation in connection with the Baghdad railway and have influenced the determination of the details of the recent Turkish Convention. Up to date our position has been unchallenged, and I presume that with the situation as at present existing we should have no difficulty in inducing the Ger mans to admit our political position in Arabistan. Should, however, we allow German commercial interests to grow and should Germany obtain a large commercial holding on the Karun and in Arabistan she would be in a position to state that her large interests demanded political recog nition. r Should we supinely allow these interests to increase and to accumulate we shall very soon find it difficult to maintain the position we now hold, and we shall have allowed the outer line of our outworks of defence to be sapped. &gt; I have in a previous despatch, No. 151-C., dated November 1st 1913, said that commercial measures as such cannot stop the Germans from advancing into Arabistan, if they wish to do so. By assisting commercial measures, however, we can prevent them attaining any great commercial advantage, and to do this it is necessary that we should see that commercial firms work hand in hand with Government, but the main defence must be political, and if the assurances which we gave to the Shaikh are openly communicated to the Persians and the Pviissians we shall have taken the sting out of the German movement and shall have forestalled any political intentions which they may have. In the meantime it will be necessary to study the methods which can be used to prevent their com- piercial success, ..........4. How far then have the Germans advanced and what further steps do they appear to be taking ? r ^ The firm of Messrs. M onckhaus and Company have for some time past had a gram-purchasing agency at Mohammerah. During the last six months, however they have shown much greater signs of activity They have placed a steamer with barges on the Karun and have commenced a regular service, their agent has hired a warehouse at Ahwaz and has been in treaty to hire a wharf, they have now definitely placed an order for motor barges tor the Karun which will be ready for traffic within the next few months. Their agent has offered the Imperial Bank of Persia in Mohammerah to carry specie between Bushire and Mohammerah and Mohammerah and Ahwaz at half the rates charged by the British India or by Messrs. Lynch and Brothers Herr Zwinnow, one of the Directors of the Company, has just been visiting Mohammerah and Ahwaz. When at the latter place he desired to visit Shushtar on a trip, so it was stated. He was unable to fulfil his intentions owing to want of transport and left for Baghdad. _ He is on his return from Baghdad again going to Ahwaz with a view of proceeding to Shushtar. k There is very little doubt that the firm intend to open at Shushtar and Dizful, and it appears possible that the very fine water power at Shushtar has not escaped their attention. r ■ There is also a strongly supported rumour that they intend to take up the question of transport on the road between Ahwaz and Isfahan in opposition to Messrs. Lynch. In this connection I may state that the agent of Messrs. Wonck- haus remarked to me that Messrs. Lynch were gradually losing all the traffic on that road. It will be seen that Messrs. Wonckhaus appear to be throwing a fairly exten sive net over Arabistan. This firm are now the most important Company at Basrah, they are the representatives of the German Government at that town, which is but 19 miles from Mohammerah, and various contracts in connection with the Baghdad rail way are in their hands. Their extension into Arabistan can only be viewed with great concern and as greatly detrimental to our position in that province. To the north the section of the railway, commonly called in Baghdad the Ger man railway, will reach Khanikin and must in due course be extended into Persia. German activity at Tehran during the past few years has been sufficiently marked and it is to be presumed that its latest form, its appearance in Arabistan, will have the support, if it is not the result, of German diplomacy. It is not necessary for me to go into detail regarding our position with the Shaikh in Arabistan, but I would remark that this position could have been at tained with difficulty had there been a strong Foreign element, represented per haps by a Consular functionary. The arrival of the Germans at this moment is very inopportune, at least until our political position is placed on a firmer basis. 5. Lord Lansdowne, in his speech in 1903, in answering the noble Lord who had interrogated him, said “ I do not think that he suggests, or that we should suggest, that these efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legiti mate trade of other powers Where, however, such trade is admittedly to further political ends a certain relaxation of the principle, whch is founded on our national ideas of free trade, may be permitted. Indeed it may be asked whether by the term “ legitimate trade ” Lord Lansdowne did not confine himself to trade for ordinary commer cial purposes. While then I would not suggest that we should take any steps to exclude foreign trade once our political position was assured, it would be desirable that for the moment, and perhaps for the next few years, we should take any measures in our power to determine that German commerce does not assume undesirable proportions.To imagine Germans with a strong position in the province and bargaining with us over matters in the Gulf is in itself sufficient to make us realise that it is necessary for us to maintain our predominance and to admit that a few thous and pounds spent with that object would fully compensate us from a political point of view. It will also be my object to show that any such expenditure would be a very sound investment on purely commercial grounds. f 6. The first natural question to ask is—Why with the position we hold in Arabistan and with firms already established there, is it necessary to suggest the expenditure of mmey in order to meet competition from a German firm who have hitherto had no footing on the river ? fcfince writing my original draft I have had the advantage of a conversation with Mr. Randall, who though the agent of the German firm, is an Englishman. He has confirmed the ideas whch I had with reference to the causes of the success which his company has met with, and I will accordingly give the gist of his remarks, all of which have my complete agreement. He first said that it r had been remarkably easy to enter the field against a firm of the nature of Messrs. Lynch and added that he had felt no compunction in stepping in and taking business from them, they had lost a great part of their trade on the Ahwaz-Isfahan road, and would in time lose their trade on the Karun for he felt convinced that, with his new motor barges against their ancient steam ship the “ Malamir ” he would drive them off the river. He then referred to the fact that Messrs. Lynch’s employes had no idea how to treat Persians with any decency and were far too rough and abrupt with them, with the result that they preferred to do business with him where it was possible. They so disliked the firm of Lynch that he had no need to undercut their rates and had only done so on one occasion. He found that Shushtar and Dizful merchants would always deal with him for choice. To confirm this I may give the example of the house in which Messrs. Lynch’s agent now lives in Mohammerah. The rental being asked for this house was, in my opinion, too high. I asked Haji Rais to be more reasonable, but he refused to consider the question. I think it is the only occasion on which he has failed to meet me half way. He replied that in any other matter he would do what I asked him, but that where the firm of Messrs. Lynch were concerned he had seen too much of the company to have any spirit of conciliation in matters dealing with them. Mr. Randall’s next contention was that British firms in Arabistan never took the trouble to mix with the natives of the country and remarked that he frequently took business out of their hands through his social intercourse with local merchants; he stated that he had not come out to Persia to be a “ burra sahib ” but to make money and consequently did not keep natives standing at the door till he wished to see them. He pointed out the fact that, of the British firms established in Mohammerah, there was hardly one person who could speak 10 words of the language and no one who could follow an ordinary conversation which went be yond the veriest platitudes. This is true ; with the exception of the Manager of the bank there is no Englishman in Mohammerah, an employe of a British firm, who is capable of anything but the mildest of conversations in either Persian or Arabic. To return to Messrs. Lynch brothers: I have shown that the general reputation of the firm is bad and it is worthy of note that the wages they pay are about half those paid by Messrs. Strick or Messrs. Wdnckhaus for similar work. Their Agent at Ahwaz was receiving Rs. 280 per mensem or £ 224 per annum for work for which Messrs. Strick and Messrs. Wonckhaus pay £ 500 and upwards. Of the four employes who have served in Arabistan in?my time two have been confirmed drunkards. A similar remark applies to their Mesopotamian staff. The above indictment,is strong, but I think that from our point of view a still stronger one remains. Messrs. Lynch always appear to regard His Majesty’s Government as a rival commercial firm from whom they should obtain as much as possible but to whom they should give as little information as they can. They appear incapable of working with a common object with Government and I have never met an official with a good word for the company.68 7. This, then, is the firm which man advance. we are at present putting up to meet the Ger- Unless Messrs. Lynch change their methods, which would also, with few excep tions, necessitate changing their staff there is little hope of any success in our efforts, while a new staff would mean men who woul d require to learn the situation and the country and who would have lost too much ground and too much time at the start to be able to compete until the Germans had established themselves firmly. I would accordingly suggest that we should transfer our support to another company. I have already laboured the point that our objection to the German advance is political in its essence so that, were the event taking place in Peru, instead of in Persia, we should not be greatly concerned with it. This being the case it is evident that to succeed in our object we must have a company which will work hand in hand with His Majesty’s Government to a com mon goal. There are two firms who could be used : Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company, the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and^ Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, the agents of the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company and of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The fact that Lord Inchcape, of the British India Steam Navigation Company, is the new Director of Messrs. Lynch Brothers and will largely direct their policy* would seem to suggest that the firm of Gray, Mackenzie and Company is the best for the purpose. There are, however, two objections to this company. The Hamburg-Amerika, with Messrs. Wonckhaus, are now advertising through cargo, on one bill of lading, from Hamburg and Antwerp to Ahwaz. It is very unlikely that the Britfeh India will come into competition with the Hamburg-Amerika, firstly on account of their agreements and secondly on account of the influence such competition would have on their trade elsewhere, where their actual profits are greater than in the Persian Gulf. A second objection is that owing to the headquarters of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie being in Basrah, in Turkey, they have not the tradition of working through Government officers which prevails in Persia. Government control is the most essential point to be maintained. Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, are accustomed to working in complete unison with the officers of His Majesty’s Government, indeed I may say it is the tradition of the firm. Their connection with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would enable them to purchase fuel at a cheaper rate than any competitor, German or British. A further important point is that the Algerian Steamship Company (F. Strick and Company) already runs to the Persian Gulf and thus the firm would be in a position to issue through bills of lading to Ahwaz in the same manner as the Ham burg-Amerika, and Messrs. Wonckhaus, an important point if we propose to compete in the sugar trade. I would accordingly suggest their selection as the firm to be employed, as being the most fitted for the purpose. It is to be remembered that our concern in the matter has largely been roused by the fact that we believe Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company are working with the assistance of the German Government. Were the firm working alone as a commercial company we should look upon them with very different eyes. Herein lies their danger, and to meet the danger with similar weapons appears the correct solution to the problem. It is then necessary to have a company who will comply with our requests, a company who will take up any definite business should we so desire it and who will deal openly with us so that we can be assured they are making no business arrangements with the Germans for their own interest. 8. There is, I would venture to submit, only one way of acquiring this control, only one way by which we can require a company to listen to our suggestions and that is by means of a subsidy. The word subsidy is one which is not very acceptable to our free trade ears, and it is for this reason that I have laid such stress upon the fact that the fight which we69 have with the Germans is political, not commercial, commerce being merely the weapon of attack and defence. To grant a subsidy in this case is no betrayal of free trade principles, but is to use the best weapon with which to meet the political situation. It is a form of insurance, though I hope to prove that, like all sound insurance, it should hear interest making it a good commercial investment. It was, presumably, with such an object that our subsidy of £1,000 per annum was given to Messrs. Lynch Brothers for so many years for their work on the Kanin, a payment which ceased only three years ago. The time has now come to renew the principle, for to fail to do so would be to throw away the many thousand pounds which we have paid just at the very time when we hope to recover the value of the previous expenditure. For Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, to take up this work would mean that they must come into competition with Messrs. Lynch Brothers. This should be avoided. The solution would evidently be for Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, to buy out Messrs. Lynch on the Karun, and I am led to think that if the former firm were approached on the subject by His Majesty's Government they would welcome the idea. With the re-organization of Messrs. Lynch this would seem the moment for this to be arranged. 9. I now come to the question of subsidy. The amount paid to Messrs* Lynch Brothers was £1,000 per annum. The capital required to place new steamers and barges on the river capable of dealing with all the business coming forward would amount to about £15,000- £1,000 per annum would provide a return of 0' 66 per cent, on a capital outlay of £15,000, and should enable the company to take all possible business on the river* including business which is very often left on account of the small profit on it and which goes to swell the volume of the trade done by the Germans. In such matters the attack has the advantage from a political point of view since settled firms will not take business which a firm making a position will be only too glad to handle. Indeed, it is this fact which has enabled the German company to attain so quickly the position it has acquired. Two years ago Mr. Knight, the Manager of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company’s general branch at Mohammerah, suggested to his firm the business which the Germans are now doing. Though he was convinced that good profits could be made his firm would not accept the idea since the profits could not be proved in advance and accordingly the project was not tried. Messrs. Wonckhaus, who did not de mand proof in advance in what appeared to be an opening, stepped in and have seized the opportunity. Had there been any question of a subsidy at the time this easy road would not have been left open for the German advance. Had we the right to insist, which a subsidy would give us, we should be able to demand that the firm to whom we were paying it should see that its members spoke the language of the country or acquired it. We should be able to suggest with greater force than at present methods of action which appear necessary. I hope that I have made out my case for the necessity of a subsidy which would appear to be required for but a few years at most* 10. The next point of importance is that we should attack the cargoes carried on German ships. This is a subject which has already been receiving attention at the Bushire Residency, and I need only touch on it in so far as it afiects Arabistan at the present moment. Sugar is an important article of this cargo. British sugar can now, owing to representations which have been made from the Residency, be obtained at the same rate as German sugar.There are, however, two reasons for which German sugar is still being shipped. O ne that the mam supply is being booked through middlemen in Bombay, notably Haji Sultan Ah Shustari and a Kazaruni, who order the German article; a second is that the sug^r when placed on board in London does not sail direct for Persia but is carried to Glasgow and Manchester where ships complete their cargo, thus a delay amounting, in some cases, to a fortnight or three weeks, is entailed. Sugar placed on board at Hamburg or at Antwerp sails direct to the Gulf, These two points must be met. _ ^he main supply of British sugar despatched to the Gulf consists of Messrs. Tate s Britannia crystals. The brokers in Bombay must then be approached to quote this sugar, and I have already taken up this subject with reference to bookings to Mohammerah. What would be still more satisfactory would be for Messrs. Tate to allow the manager of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company to be their agent and so to book orders on the spot. Mr. Knight has addressed his firm in London to approach Messrs. Tate, and I trust some result will accrue, but if His Majesty’s Government could explain to that company their desire to see the sale of their sugar extended it would no doubt assist considerably in attaining the end desired. The further mention of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company suggests a monopoly, but I have given my reasons for preferring this firm, and a monopoly, which we can control, would appear to be the most scientific method of meeting the situation. If this is considered objectionable, however, it would perhaps be possible to induce other local firms to get into immediate touch with the refiners. So far for actual commerce. 11. A favourite move of the Germans is the establishment of schools and hospitals to extend their influence. The value of education for the production of Anglophils or Germanophils is self- evident. The Shaikh of Mohammerah has already placed the management of the local school completely in my hands, and it would be easy to make this school into a first class institution, training the budding merchants to be English-speaking and to look to England for their supplies, while suitable clerks would be provided to fill the many offices which must spring up. English can be made the commercial language of Arabistan. A hospital is a first class advertisement appealing to all, and like a school has also the advantage of advancing the cause of humanity. With the appointment of a Consular Surgeon for Mohammerah I am putting up estimates and proposals for a hospital. These two subjects will form the matter of separate communications and I only mention them briefly in this letter to express the principle that to attain our end we must be prepared to spend some money in the country. The money required annually for subsidy for the Karun, for the school and for the hospital would not represent more than the monthly expenditure of a rich company on advertising. The money we spend is supplied by the tax-payers. I would venture to state that considering the British Empire as a commercial concern the amount disbursed in the few years during which our assistance would be profitable or necessary should bring in to the tax-payers a return of very many times annually the total of the expenditrue we should make. Mohammerah is bound in time to be the Karachi of Persia. The waters of Arabistan will be stored and used, its rich fields will be cultivated as its oil fields are already being exploited. The future of the place is great. Already we have the good will of the Shaikh and by carefully cultivating this and by keeping the development of the country in our hands we shall be in a posi tion to see that the first opportunity to exploit the products and future markets of this rich country shall be reserved for our own people, and so by building up our commercial prosperity we shall, while strengthening the Shaikh, also strengthen the defences of the outworks of our Indian Empire.I &gt;1 f !

With reference to the subject of German competition, I have sent a copy of a letter, through the Hesidency at Bushire, in which I have stated my ideas of what steps are necessary to meet the question. In this letter I have stated that I consider that it is necessary on political grounds to renew the subsidy for the Karun and have given my reasons for regarding this as urgent. I have also given my reasons for stating that the subsidy should be transferred to the Agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, who, I suggest, should purchase Messrs. Lynch’s interests in this province. In noting on the question I have drawn special attention to the point that the danger is not really a commercial but a political one and that in consequence it is necessary that the company who are fighting the Germans should be under our control. The firm of Lynch is not one upon whom reliance can be placed while even if the company should be reconstituted it will be too late for our purpose to be served. I have further shown that a subsidy should he a sound commercial investment on behalf of the tax-payers though political in its object. The total amount so expended annually would not exceed that which a big company would expend on advertisements monthly. FoifiJH &amp; Political Dept.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 23rd December, 1913, forwarding me a copy of a letter, dated the 7th December, 1913, addressed by Sir Percy Cox to the officiating secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, on the subject of our interests in Arabistan, and inviting Government to consider whether some steps were not now called for with a view to making our predominant position in the province more definite and secure. Sir Percy Cox has, under six headings, dealt with the various questions which present themselves at this moment. In my present communication I propose :— (1.) To go further into the subject of the latter part of the sixth heading, i.e., German activity on the Karun and in Arabistan, a question which has become more critical in the last two months. (2.) To propose some steps which would appear necessary at the moment to assist in the consolidation of our position. 2. Before going into the question of German activity it may not be out of place to summarise some of the reasons why it is so important that Arabistan should continue under our influence and control. Sir Percy Cox has pointed out, in his letter above referred to, that the tendency is for our commercial interests to centre and consolidate in Arabistan. I have already in the memorandum forwarded with the above letter, and which should bear the date 2nd August, 1913, referred to the grain and cotton possibilities of the country. Sir Percy Cox in his letter stated :— “ Incidentally I may mention that I am convinced that apart from the political aspect the subject of irrigation is bound to come to the front before long as the natural result of the general commercial development in Arabistan.” There is much food for thought in the above statement. At the present moment the grain crop of the province is, except for certain limited districts, entirely dependent upon the rainfall with the result that, while in a good year the value of the exports run into several hundred thousand pounds, in a bad season the crop practically only suffices to teed the population of the country. A glance at the map will show that Arabistan is, to all intents and purposes, a smaller Egypt, but watered by a series of rivers in place of the one Nile. Since the matter with which I am dealing is chiefly connected with our position on [2063 3 —l] B2 the Persian Gulf I will in this letter refer only to the country under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and which we can, through him, control. In saying this I do not wish to minimise the importance to us commercially of the country above, i.e., the country around Shuster and Dizful, to which occasional reference may be made. The railway which we propose to build in Arabistan has focussed the attention of other Powers on this fertile land with its valuable oil products, its annual crop of dates, and its great possibilities for the growing of cotton and grain. There is nothing to prevent the land being developed to the prosperous condition of Egypt. The Sheikh realises as well as anyone else that he is incapable of developing this country for himself and, though he at present turns to us, it is certain that, if we do not mark the possibilities and grasp the situation, other nations will avail themselves of our missed opportunities. In the memorandum above referred to, so recently as the 2nd August I wrote : “ Up to the present interests in Arabistan have been absolutely British and the only foreign firm, that of Messrs Wonckhaus, has been of no importance. With the opening up of the country, however, and the arrival of the railway foreign firms will arrive in force and complicate the situation.” While I was writing Messrs. Wbnckhaus were commencing their steamer service and six months later we have reached the phrase “ German competition on the Karun.” 3. It is frequently difficult to separate politics and commerce in determining the cause of our political actions since each reacts on the other. In a case like the present, however, it is essential that we should reach first causes since it is upon first causes that we must base the line of action to be followed. More often, perhaps, in foreign countries our political intervention follows on our commercial necessities, indeed our very interest may be due to our commercial under takings. In the south-west of Persia, though large commercial interests exist which react on the political situation, I think it will be admitted as an axiom that it is because of the political importance to us of Persia, situated as it is on the threshold of India, that we attach so much importance to our commerce in that country, indeed commerce is the outward and visible sign of our inward and political state. In India, German competition, though perhaps it may excite our interest commercially, is not a question of the first importance, because our political position is stable, in Persia, on the other hand, the position is different and German competition is feared, not on commercial, but on political grounds, since a too extended commercial activity in Arabistan would produce the ground for a political interest which does not otherwise exist and which we have no desire to see arising anywhere on the shores of the Persian Gulf of which Arabistan is the frontier post in Persia. In 1903 Lord Lansdowne made a declaration of policy and announced the principle which has formed the basis of our action since that date. Our predominant position in these waters, combined with a recognition of the above announced principle and the reasons which led up to it, have been the origin and cause of constant diplomatic representation in connection with the Bagdad Railway and have influenced the determination of the details of the recent Turkish Convention. Up to date our position has been unchallenged, and I presume that with the situation as at present existing we should have no difficulty in inducing the Germans to admit our political position in Arahistan. Should, however, we allow German commercial interests to grow, and should Germany obtain a large commercial holding on the Karun and in Arabistan, she would be in a position to state that her large interests demanded political recognition. Should we supinely allow these interests to increase and to accumulate we shall very soon find it difficult to maintain the position we now hold, and we shall have allowed the outer line of our outworks of defence to be sapped. I have, in a previous despatch, dated the 1st November, 1913, said that commercial measures as such cannot stop the Germans from advancing into Arabistan, if they wish to do so. By assisting commercial measures, however, we can prevent them attammg any great commercial advantage and to do this it is necessary that we should see that commercial firms work hand in hand with Government, but the main defence must be political, and if the assurances which we gave to the Sheikh are openly communicated to the Persians and the Russians we shall have taken the sting out of the Geiman movement and shall have forestalled any political intentions which they may have. In the meantime it will be necessary to study the methods which can be used to prevent their commercial success.4. How far then have the Germans advanced and what further steps do thev .appear to be taking ? r j' The firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. have for some time past had a oram ^purchasing agency at_ Mohammerah. Curing the last six months, however they have shown much greater signs of activity. ’ J They have placed a steamer with barges on the Karun, and have commenced a regular service their agent has hired a warehouse at Ahwaz, and has been in treaty to hire a wharf, they have now definitely placed an order for motor barges for the Karun which will be ready for traffic within the next few months. Their agent has offered the Imperial Bank of Persia m Mohammerah to carry specie between Bushire and Mohammerah, and Mohammerah and Ahwaz, at half the rates charged by the British India or by Messrs. Lynch Brothers. J Herr Zwinnow one of the directors of the company, has just been visiting Mohammerah and Ahwaz. When at the latter place, he desired to visit Shuster on a trip, so^ it was stated. He was unable to fulfil his intentions owing to want of transport and left for Bagdad. He is on his return from Bagdad again, going to Ahwaz with a view of proceeding to Shuster. There is very little doubt that the firm intend to open 3&gt;u Shuster and Dizful, and it appears possible that the very fine water power at Shuster has not escaped their attention. There is also a strongly supported rumour that they intend to take up the question of transport on^ the road between Ahwaz and Ispahan in opposition to Messrs. Lynch. In this connection, I may srate that the agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus remarked to me that Messrs. Lynch were gradually losing all the traffic on that road. It will be seen that Messrs. Wonckhaus appear to be throwing a fairly extensive net over Arabistan. This firm are now the most important company at Basra, they are the representatives of the German Government at that town, which is but 19 miles from Mohammerah, and various contracts in connection with the Bagdad Railway are in their hands. Their extension into Arabistan can only be viewed with great concern, and as greatly detrimental to our position in that province. To the north the section of the railway, commonly called in Bagdad the German railway, will reach Khaniqin, and must in due course be extended into Persia. German activity at Tehran during the past few years has been sufficiently marked, and it is to be presumed that its latest form, its appearance in Arabistan, will have the support, if it is not the result, of German diplomacy. It is not necessary for me to go into detail regarding our position with the Sheikh in Arabistan, but I would remark that this position could have been attained with difficulty had there been a strong foreign element represented, perhaps, by a consular functionary. The arrival of the Germans at this moment is very inopportune, at least until our political position is placed on a firmer basis. 5. Lord Lansdowne, in his speech in 1903, in answering the noble lord, who had interrogated him, said : “ I do not think that he suggests, or that we should suggest, that these efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legitimate trade of other Powers.” Where, however, such trade is admittedly to further political ends a certain relaxation of the principle, wnich is founded on our national ideas of free trade, may be permitted. Indeed, it may be asked whether by the term “ legitimate trade ” Lord Lansdowne did not confine himself to trade for ordinary commercial purposes. While then I would not suggest that we should take any steps to exclude foreign trade once our political position was assured, it would be desirable that for the moment, and perhaps for the next few years, we should take any measures in our power to determine that German commerce does not assume undesirable proportions. To imagine Germans with a strong position in the province and bargaining with us over matters in the Gulf is in itself sufficient to ma.ke us realise that it is necessary for us to maintain our predominance, and to admit that a few thousand pounds spent with that object would fully compensate us from a political point of view. It will also be my object to show that any such expenditure would be a very sound investment on purely commercial grounds. 6. The first natural question to ask is: Why with the position we hold in Arabistan, and with firms already established there, is it necessary to suggest the expenditure of money in order to meet competition from a German firm who have hitherto had no footing on the river ?4 J Since writing my original draft I have had the advantage of a conversation with Mr. Randall, who, thougn the agent of the German firm, is an Englishman. He has confirmed the ideas which I had witli reference to the causes of the success which his company has met with, and I will accordingly give the gist of his remarks, all of which have my complete agreement. He first said that it had been remarkably easy to enter the field against a firm of the nature of Messrs. Lynch, and added that he had felt no compunction in stepping in and taking business from them ; they had lost a great part of their trade off the Ahwaz-Aspahan road, and would in time lose their trade on the Karun, for he felt convinced that, with his new motor barges against their ancient steamship the “ Malamir,” he would drive them off the river. He then referred to the fact that Messrs. Lynch’s employes had no idea how to treat Persians with any decency, and were far too rough and abrupt with them, with the result that they preierred to do business with him where it was possible. They so disliked the firm of Lynch that he had no need to undercut their rates, and had only done so on one occasion. He found that Shuster and Dizful merchants would always deal with him for choice. To confirm this 1 may give the example of the house in which Messrs. Lynch’s agent now lives in Mohammerah. The rental being asked for this house was, in my opinion, too high. I asked Haji Rais to be more reasonable, but he refused to consider the question. I think it is the only occasion on which he has failed to meet me half-way. He replied that in any other matter he would do what I asked him, but that where the firm of Messrs. Lynch were concerned he had seen too much of the company to have any spirit of conciliation in matters dealing with them. Mr. Randall’s next contention was that British firms in Arabistan never took the trouble to mix with the natives of the country, and remarked that he frequently took business out of their ham Is through his social intercourse with local merchants; he stated that he had not come out to Persia to be a “ burra sahib” but to make money, and consequently did not keep natives standing at the door till he wished to see them. He pointed out the fact that, of the British firms established in Mohammerah, there was hardly one person who could speak ten words of the language and no one who could follow an ordinary conversation which went beyond the veriest platitudes. This is true j with the exception of the manager of the bank, there is no Englishman in Mohammerah, an employe of a British firm, who is capable of anything but the mildest of conversations in either Persian or Arabic. To return to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. I have shown that the general reputation of the firm is bad, and it is worthy of note that the wages they pay are about half those paid by Messis. St rick or Messrs. W onckhaus for similar work. Their agent at Ahwaz was receiving 280 rupees per mensem, or 224L per annum, for work for which Messrs, tv.rick and Messrs. YV onckhaus pay 500L and upwards. Of the four employes who have served in Arabistan in my time two have been confirmed drunkards. A similar remark applies to the Mesopotamian staff. Ihe above indictment is strong, but I think that, from our point of view, a still stronger one remains. Messrs. Lynch always appear to regard His Majesty’s Govern ment as a rival commercial firm from whom they should obtain as much as possible, but to whom they should give as little information as they can. They appear incapable of working with a common object with Government, and I have never met an official with a good word for the company. 7. inis, then, is the firm which we are at present putting up to meet the German 8.Q V8.I1C6. Lmess Messrs. Lynch change their methods, which would also, with few exceptions,, necessitate changing their staff, there is littie hope of any success in our efforts, while a new staff would mean men who would require to le-.rn the situation and the country, and who would have lost too much ground and too much time at the start to be able to compete until the Germans had established themselves firmly. I would accordingly suggest that we should transfer our support to another company. Jrr i have already laboured the point that our objection to the German advance is political m its essence, so that, were the event taking place in Peru instead of in Persia, we should not be greatly concerned with it. Iht.s being the case, it is evident that to succeed in our object we must have a goa]^ 0 ' ^ 11C W1 W ° ri&lt; liant ^ hand with His Majesty’s Government to a common There are two firms who could be used; Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company,the agents of the British India Steam Navio-ation Comm™ i\/r „ ° f ,h ' ingl “- ile ™' s, “~“p w. S fi.h,/sltLjTh tt^JSftSrsais?- &lt;!?&gt;*'* z ^ „ gg ,„ 0„j, Mackeozie There are however, two objections to this company The Hamburg-Amerika with Messrs. Wonckhaus, are now advertising throno-h cargo on one bill of ladmg, from Hamburg and Antwerp, to Ahwaz 8 8 It is very unlikely that the British India will come into competition with the Hamburg-Amerika, firstly, on account of their agreement, and, secondly on account of their influence such competition would have on their trade elsewhere where their actual profits are greater than in the Persian Gulf. A second objection is thaTowW to the headquarters of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie, being in Basra, in Turkey they havf not the tradition of working through Government officers which prevails in Persia Government control is the most essential point to be maintained. P Messrs. Strick, bcott, and Co. are accustomed to working in complete unison with “r-° f HlS M a J est .y. s Government; indeed, 1 may say it is the tradition of the Durchase ffiel C ° nne&lt; { tlon wltl J the A uglo-Persian Oil Company would enable them to purchase fuel at a cheaper rate than any competitor, German or British. Cn ) nlr 111 ' 1 ! 161 ' Un P ort l nt P oint is ^ h ^ the Algerian Steamship Company (F. Strick and thr ’ I nii luns to t he lers ( lari Gult ; »id thus the firm would be in a position to issue !nd M bl w° f ?n lng t0 ^ hwaz ln the Same manner as the Hamburg-Amerika, trade” ^ onckha us, an important point if we propose to compete in the sugar I would accordingly suggest their selection as the firm to be employed, as being the most fitted for the purpose. n j &gt; s It is to be remembered that our concern in the matter has largely been roused by the fact that we believe Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. are working with the assistance of the German Government. Were the firm working alone as a commercial company we should look upon them with very different eyes. Herein lies tlieir danger, and to meet that danger with similar weapons appears the correct solution to the problem. It is then necessary to have a company who will comply with our request : a company who will take up any definite business should we so desire it, and who will deal openly with us so that we can be assured they are making no business arrangements with the Germans for their own interest. 8. there is, I would venture to submit, only one way of acquiring this control, only one way by which we can require a company to listen to our suggestions, and that is by means of a subsidy. Ihe word subsidy is one which is not very acceptable to our free trade ears, and it is for this reason that I have laid such stress upon the fact that the fight which we have with the Germans is political, not commercial, commerce being merely the weapon of attack and defence. To grunt a subsidy in this case is no betrayal of free trade principles, but is to use the best weapon with which to meet the political situation. It is a form of insurance, though I hope to prove that, like all sound insurance, it should bear interest, making it a good commercial investment. It was presumably with such an object that our subsidy of 1,000Z. per annum was given by Messrs. Lynch Brothers, for so many years for their work on the Karun, a payment which ceased only three years ago. The time has now come to renew the principle for to fail to do so would be to throw away the the many thousand pounds which we have paid just at the very time when we hope to recover the value of the previous expenditure. For Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co. to take up this work would mean that they must come into competition with Messrs. Lynch Brothers. This should be avoided. The solution would evidently be for Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co. to buy out Messrs. Lynch on the Karun, and I am led to think that if the former firm were approached on the subject by His Majesty’s Government they would welcome the idea. With the reorganisation of Messrs. Lynch this would seem the moment for this to be arranged. 9. I now come to the question of subsidy. The amount paid to Messrs. Lynch Brothers was 1,000Z. per annum. [2063 q —1] CThe capital required to place new steamers and barges on the river capable of dealing with all the business coming forward would amount to about 15,000L One thousand pounds per annum would provide a return of 6‘66 per cent on a capital outlay of 15,000L and should enable the company to take all possible business on the river, including business which is very often left on account of the small profit on it and which goes to swell the volume of the trade done by the Germans. In such matters the attack has the advantage from a political point of view since settled firms will not take business which a firm making a position will be only too glad to handle. Indeed it is this fact which has enabled the German company to attain so quickly the position it has acquired. Two years ago Mr. Knight, the manager of Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co.’s general branch at Mohammerah, suggested to his firm the business which the Germans are now doing. Though he was convinced that good profits could be made his firm would not accept the idea since the profits could not be proved in advance and accordingly the project was not tried. Messrs. Wonckhaus who did not demand proof in advance in what appeared to be an opening, stepped in and have seized the opportunity, Had there been any question of a subsidy at the time this easy road would not have been left open for the German advance. Had we the right to insist, which a subsidy would give us we should be able to demand that the firm to whom we were paying it should see that its members spoke the language of the country or acquired it. We should be able to suggest with greater force than at present methods of action which appear necessary. I hope that I have made out my case for the necessity of a subsidy which would appear to be required for but a few years at most. 10. The next point of importance is that we should attack the cargoes carried on German ships. This is a subject which has already been receiving attention at the Bushire Residency and I need only touch on it in so far as it affects Arabistan at the present moment. Sugar is an important article of this cargo. British sugar can now, owing to representations which have been made from the Residency, be obtained at the same rate as German sugar. There are, however, two reasons for which German sugar is still being shipped. One is that the mam supply is being booked through middlemen in Bombay, notably Haji Sultan Ah Shushtari and a Kasaruni, who order the German articles ; a second that the sugar when placed on board in London does not sail direct for Persia but is carried to Glasgow and Manchester where ships complete their cargo, thus a delay amounting, in some cases to a fortnight or three weeks, is entailed. Sugar placed on board at Hamburg or at Antwerp sails diiect to the Gulf. These two points must be met. The main supply of British sugar despatched to the Gulf consists of Messrs. Tate’s “ Britannia ” crystals. The brokers in Bombay must then be approached to quote this sugar, and I have already taken up this subject with reference to bookings to Mohammerah. What would be still more satisfactory would be for Messrs. Tate to allow the manager of Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co. to be their agent, and so to book orders on the spot. Mr. Knight has addressed his firm in London to approach Messrs. Tate, and I trust some result will accrue ; but it His Majesty s Government could explain to that company their desire to see the sale of their sugar extended it would no doubt assist considerably in attaining the end desired. I he further mention of Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Co. suggests a monopoly, but I ieasons ^ or P re fbrring this firm, and a monopoly, which we can control, would appear to be the most scientific method of meeting the situation. If this is considered objectionable, however, it would perhaps be possible to induce other local firms to get into immediate touch with the refiners. So far for actual commerce. H^ favourite move of the Germans is the establishment of schools and hospitals to extend their influence. *d ^t 6 Va ^ Ue e( l uca ^ on f° r production of Anglophils or Germanophils is self- The Sheikh of Mohammerah has already placed the management of the local school completely m my hands, and it would be easy to make this school into a first-class institution, training the budding merchants to be English-speaking and to look toEngland for their supplies, while suitable clerks would be provided to fill the many offices which must spring up. English can be made the commercial lano-uage of Arabistan. &amp; 8 A hospital is a first-class advertisement appealing to all, and, like a school has also ^the advantage of advancing the cause of humanity. With the appointment of a consular surgeon for Mohammerah I am putting; up estimates and proposals for a hospital. r &amp; r These two subjects will form the matter of separate communications and I only mention them briefly in this letter to express the principle that to attain our end we must be prepared to spend some money in the country. The money required annually for subsidy for the Karun, for the school, and for the hospital would not represent more than the monthly expenditure of a rich company on advertising. ' 1 J The money we spend is supplied by the taxpayers. I would venture to state that, considering the British Empire as a commercial concern, the amount disbursed in the few years during which our assistance would be profitable or necessary should bring in to the taxpayers a return of very many times annually the total of the expenditure we should make. Mohammerah is bound in time to be the Karachi of Persia. The waters of Arabistan will be stored and used, its rich fields will be cultivated, as its oil-fields are already being exploited. The future of the place is great. Already we have the good-will of the Sheikh, and by carefully cultivating this and by keeping the development of the country in our hands we shall be in a position to see that the first opportunity to exploit the products and future markets of this rich country shall be reserved for our own people ; and so, by building up our commercial prosperity, we shall, while strengthening the Sheikh, also strengthen the defences of the outworks of our Indian Empire.

Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum by Mr. Chich on German Activity on the Karun and Arabistan. Development of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Cods Business. HERR Z1NNOW, June., arrived at Basra at the end of 1913. He is described as a moneyed “ command!taire ” partner in Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co., and is no doubt the person mentioned in the Confidential letter from the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade of the 22nd July, 1913 :— ‘ Traun, Sturcken and Co. have a capital of some 2,000,000 M., and a M. Zillow (? Zinnow), a nephev of Mr. Alfred Beit, is a ‘ commanditaire ’ partner in the firm for 500,000 M.” Sir W. Ward notified the Foreign Office in April 1913 that a director of the Hamburg-Amerika Line was proceeding to the Gulf, in order to study the possibilities for the development Lr his company. It does not appear whether Herr Zinnow is a of the German line, and, if so, the director referred to. Herr Zinnow visited Mohammerah, and then proceeded to Ahwaz, where he spent some days, being engaged with Mr. Randall, Messrs. Wonckhaus’s agent in Mohammerah, [2063 g —2] / B Copy to k * c-*&gt;- § 7 MAH 19142 in trying to arrange for the lease of a wharf. According to reports from Mohammerah, he was due to go on from Ahwaz to Shushter “ on a tour of inspection,” and it is stated on good authority that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. intend to open agencies at both Shushter and Dizful. In July a Persian named Agha Muhammad Baqir was appointed agent for Messrs. Wonckhaus’s steamers (see note below' ::: ') at Ahwaz. A German assistant has been placed under Mr. Bandall at Mohammerah. Thus the firm would appear to have— At Mohammerah : Two Europeans. At Ahwaz : Office with Persian agent. At Shushter and Dizfui: Prospective agencies. (It may be remarked in this connection that Messrs. Lynch keep a Persian at Dizful, an Indian at Shushter, as agents on about 71. per mensem, but do very little business, as they are too understafied at Ahwaz to give serious attention to out- offices.) German Steamer Craft on the Karun. The twin-screw steam-tug “ Pionier ” was brought out to Basra by Messrs. R. Wbnckhaus, as agents of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie earl) 7 in 1913, and commenced running between Mohammerah and Ahwaz (Nasiri) on the loth July. It will be remembered that according to despatch No. 2, Commercial, of the 22nd February, 1913, from His Majesty’s consul at Basra to Sir Edward Grey, this vessel was to tow barges of special form for lightering the vessels of the Hamburg-Amerika Company from and to the bar of the bhatt-el-Arab. Its draught was reported too great for the Karun, and the “Samara,” a single screw tug, was introduced, but towards the end of 1913 both the “Samara” and the “ Pionier ” were working frequently. Between the 15th July and the 31st December, 1913, twelve journeys were made by these two vessels between Mohammerah and Ahwaz. Barges have been utilised in addition by the German firm, each steam-tug towing two barges in nine cases out of twelve. The tonnage of these vessels is given by His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah as follows:— Steamship “ Pionier ” .. „ “ Samara ” .. Five barges (each) .. One barge Tons. .. 130 75 .. 110 85 Information as to the tonnage of cargo actually carried from Mohammerah to Ahwaz in these German vessels is not yet to hand, but the return cargo from Ahwaz to Mohammerah is known to have scaled 458 tons (during the last quarter of 1913, 294 tons, whereas Messrs. Lynch’s vessel “ Malamir’’ had carried 595 tons in the same period). Messrs. ^ Wonckhaus and Co. began by cutting the prices charged by Messrs. Lynch as freight, and their tugs went from wharf to wharf at Mohammerah collecting cargo, and thus saving merchants’ hire for small lighters. Through cargo was also reported to have been shipped from Bushire. Regular running, accessibility, and attention to business, combined with the fact that the Samara is well suited for the work, have, it is said, given the Germans a f^r amount of freight. Their agent is a keen business man. Messrs. Wdnckhaus are said to be running the “Samara” at a profit, and with such greater economy than 1I tf 6 CaSe s ^ eams ^ L ip * £ Malamir ” (Messrs. Lynch’s boat) that they could a ord to i educe fi eight by nearly 50 per cent, without actually losing money. Leases of IT harves by Messrs. Wdnckhaus at Mohammerah and Ahwaz. Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. obtained from the Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1909 the lease of a site on the banks of the Karun, on the strict terms current in Arabistan, for a period of eight years only. Major Haworth reported in September 1913 that the German firm were about to approach the Sheikh with reference to a ten years lease of the wharf, andmtended to erect buildings thereon. Ihe partnership between Traun, Sturcken, and Co. and Herr VVbnckhaus was afterwards dissolved and carried on by Herr Wonckhaus as sole partner, but it was reported that Mr. Otto Beit had agreed to lend the firm 50,000Z. for ten to twelve yearsHis Majesty s Minister at Tehran telegraphed on the 19th October that Muin-nt- Tnjjar had shown him a telegram, which Messrs. Wonckhaus had sent to him desiring the lease of a wharf at Ahwaz Mmn-ut-Tujjar agreed to instrnet his agent to consult His Majesty s vice-consul at Ahwaz, and to act in accordance with his advice in the matter, and to conclude no lease that had not been approved by Muin-ut-Tuiiar fiiimself. Major Haworth subsequently saw the Sheikh of Mohammerah and obtained a guarantee that no other wharf would be leased to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. Larer the Mum s agent, feaung that the Persian customs would lease part of their wharf to Messrs. Wonckhaus, got nervous and temporised with the Germans • then recovering his courage telegraphed to iluin-ut-Tujjar in Tehran to refuse a’ lease’ Muin-ut-i ujjar, playing his usual game, represented to His Majesty’s Minister I'teWn.-im No. 3 of the 10th January,1914, to Mohammerah) that the Germans were offering him a large price, and that their suspicions were likely to be aroused by their dalliance^ whilst he was losing 700Z.-900L per annum owing ,o his refusing such a lease to the Germans. Major Haworth further apprehended that the Persian Government if pressed by He German Legation to facilitate the lease of a wharf, might be able’ to force the bheikh of Mohammerah to grant a lease. Up to the latest reports the German firm had been unable to lease a wharf at Ahwaz. Warehouse. According to a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister, No. 3, dated the 10th January, 1914, the Germans had concluded a lease for a warehouse (at Ahwaz ?). Barges. Major Haworth telegraphed on the 14th January that Wonckhaus and Co. had placed an order for three motor engines with the Torbinia Company at Ipswich. two barges had been already despatched (from Europe) for erection by the Anglo- rersian Oil Company (Limited), and the engines will be fitted into the barges (in May 1914. it is expected) by the company. The British Firms’ Position m Arabistan. Messrs. Lynch Brothers, the British company most concerned, and the only British shipping company working on the Karim, have an office at Mohammerah, where an ex-master of the “ Malamir ” acts as their agent, and an office at Ahwaz with an Englishman in charge. As already stated above, their so-called a agencies” at Shushter and Dizful are in the hands of an Indian and a Persian respectively, both poorly paid, and doing little business, partly for the reason that the office in Ahwaz is understaffed, and unable to pay attention to business in those directions. Messrs. Lynch Brothers have the steamship Malamir” of 120 tons carrying capacity on the Lower Karun Biver, and the “ Shushan” of 25 tons capacity, which has sailed under the Persian flag on the Upper Karun since 1890. Both of these vessels ! have been running more than twenty years and are out of date, and, as already stated i above, the working of the ££ Malamir” cannot be conducted with sufficient economy to permit of rates of freight being much reduced to meet German competition. In addition to their work as managing agents for these steamers, and to the activity which they should display as general importing and exporting merchants, it will be remembered that Messrs. Lynch’s office at Ahwaz has had to deal with the forwarding of nearly half the merchandise arriving at Ahwaz in transit for Ispahan, and are also largely responsible for perfecting arrangements for traffic on the Ahwaz- Ispahan road. It may safely be said that Messrs. Lynch Brothers have signally failed to take ! advantage of the opportunities afforded them by this combination of openings for promoting their own and British interests. In a position where Messrs. Wonckhaus would have employed four or five German assistants, Messrs. Lynch have understaffed their offices, and been niggardly in iheir efiorts to develop the business. Persian merchants dislike their careless, irregular methods of running the ££ Malamir” and “Shushan” as much as His Majesty’s representatives and European firms, while their maladministration of the forwarding business from Ahwaz to Ispahan and the Bakhtiari road has been so far a byword that the transfer of Messrs. Lynch’s I responsibilities to other hands, or the appointment of a Boyal Engineer officer has been j urged before now on His Majesty’s Government.4 With affairs in such a condition, no partial measures by Messrs. Lynch, such as the permission recently given by their London office to keep their rates of freight 5 per cent lower than those of the Germans, will enable their representatives in Arabistan to check German competition. The death of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch has probably disorganised the firm stdl further. The situation demands a thorough change of policy—a larger sta® v in Arabistan, better paid to do better work, coupled with willingness to develop their business and spend money—if Messrs. Lynch’s firm is to be of any assistance to His Majesty’s Government in checking German ulterior motives in Arabistan. Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Go. (Limited). —This firm, managing agents at Moham- merah and Ahwaz for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), and also ao-ents for Messrs. F. C. Strick’s steamers, take no share in river transport. They have no agencies in Shushter and Dizful, and their office at Ahwaz is understood to do no general import and export business. They have, however, powerful financial support behind them, and possess a numerous staff of keen business men. Their directors are greatly interested in the Luristan Railway project, and by reason of the special footing on which they stand with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and Haji Hais-ut-Tujjar, they are in a strong position to manage shipping between Mohammerah, Ahwaz, and Shushtar. I Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie, and Co .—They are also powerfully supported, having behind them the British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited) and Lord Inchcape, but they have never developed the business of their agency at Mohammerah, and have no connection with Ahwaz. As the leading steamer agents up the Shatt-el-Arab, their interests are injured by the encroachment of the German steamers on the carrying trade from Europe. Ahwaz is considered a Persian Gulfport, and there is no apparent reason why the British India Steam Navigation Company should not extend their i ramifications up the Karun by means of small river steamers, launches, and barges, j At the same time they need to be galvanised into more activity as importers and exporters of grain and produce from the Karun. Dangers arising out of Gemnan Competition. a ^ au ^ umn 1913 the British position of commercial predominance in Arabistan was exposed to the same dangers by the operations of the Hamburg-Amerika Lime and Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. as other Persian and Arab ports in the Gulf. ! Ut lfc ls . c J ear fr ? m all that has happened since last July that the German politico- : commercial combination have focussed their chief attention on Arabistan, and for British interests the situation has suddenly become acute. Looking not very far ahead, the following are the eventual results of the German attack and energy behind it if no measures of resistance are devised from the British side Capture of neatly c dl the transport by steamer between Mohammerah, Ahwaz^ and bnushter. through cargo from Europe to Ahwaz.

To the best of our knowledge, British firms or Persian merchants have no contracts with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company for carriage of goods to Ahwaz. Continental shippers will no doubt be well canvassed in favour of opting for the Wonckhaus service. Through bills of lading—a convenience-will no doubt be issued by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, and probably private rebates of freight. More cargo from Europe for Ahwaz and Ispahan now comes in German vessels than in British steamers, on account of the German monopoly of carriage of sumar, and combined with the other causes mentioned, the tendency will naturally be ^for the German vessels on the Karun to get the bulk of through cargo freight out to the Gulf m Hamburg—Amenka steameis. (Ahwaz reported on 16th December that the German steamship “ Pionier” had brought up 1,800 packages of sugar, 370 for transhipment to Shushter, and the “ Samara, ” on the 23rd took 800 packages for Shushter). (b.) Local ^ Cargo from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, Shushter, Dizful.—Owing to Messrs.^ Lynch’s unpopularity and unbusinesslike methods and to probable keen competition in lates by the Germans, the tendency will be for consignees in Mohammerah of goods from India arriving in British India Steam Navigation Company’s vessels, or from England in British steamers, which are resold for Ahwaz, Ispahan, or Luristan, to favour Messrs. Wonckhaus’s service. (c.) Downward Transport from Ahivaz to Mohammerah. —In the last quarter of 1913 Messrs. Wonckhaus already were carrying one-third of all goods shipped, as against two-thirds m Messrs. Lynch s vessels. For these reasons, and others, everything at present favours Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. for reducing the Euphrates and Tigris river service to a very secondary position. 2. Capture from Messrs. Lynch of much of their forwarding business from Ahwaz to Ispahan. The next step for Wonckhaus and Co., with an office and German agent at Ahwaz, would be, as agents of the Hamburg—Amerika Line to contract to forward sugar and other merchandise from Ahwaz to Ispahan, so that exporters in continental Europe and consignees in Ispahan, &amp;c., would be free of all trouble. Shippers and consignees at present go largely to Messrs. Lynch Brothers in Ahwaz for the forwarding of the goods, but simply because there is no other proper forwarding agent in Ahwaz, and many whose goods suffer by long delays, partly owing to Messrs. Lynch’s mismanagement, would no doubt be glad to go to a rival firm. These two factors would suffice to deprive Messrs. Lynch of a large portion of their present forwarding business, and even now, as Captain Grey stated in his telegram No. 40 of the 8th November, “ Lynch has less than half of total goods passing over road.” We may therefore be prepared to find the Germans actively interested in the fortunes of the Bakhtiari road, and owing to the insufficiency of transport animals on the Bushire-Ispahan road, and consequent tendency of the imports to Ispahan to use the Bakhtiari road almost entirely, they would have a great opportunity for interesting themselves in trade between the Gulf and Ispahan. 3. Expansion of German trade in Ahwaz, Dizful, and Shushter, and acquisition of a definite commercial interest in Arabistan trade. If Wonckhaus and Co. open agencies at Dizful and Shushter as well as at Ahwaz their organisation will be as complete as that of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and better than that of any other British firm; while Messrs. Wonkhaus's methods of business—- lavish, as is well known to the Board of Trade, adventurous, and keen—will place them in a position to do all the business there is to be obtained by a European firm at these places. At Dizful and Shushter there is probably not room for two really enterprising firms, and the first established and best supported will have the advantage. In the export of grain from Ahwaz and the Karun district to Mohammerah the possession of their own launches and barges on the river will enable Messrs. Wonckhaus to pursue their policy of outbidding all other buyers by obtaining rebates of freight for themselves, and also to get far larger quantities down to Mohammerah than in past years, while the higher rates quoted for the Euphrates and Tigris Company’s steamers will not permit other British firms to compete. The Germans have shown a disposition at Bushire to extend this method of crushing British competition in seeds and gums and other Persian exports, and they are keen buyers of produce. If the summer of 1914 turns out well the British firms will be placed in a disastrous position with regard to exports from up the Karun. [2063 y —2] C6 Suggestions. His Majesty’s consul for Arabistan puts the position quite clearly in his letter of the 1st November, 1913:— “ Our action to stop German competition depends upon the political action we are prepared to take at the present time rather than in commercial steps which can be but supplementary to our general procedure. If the Germans are determined on coming into the Karun, no commercial measures, as such, will stop them. It is then for us to see that our political measures should either make it difficult for them to expand in Arabistan or make our position so strong as to render their expansion innocuous. “ These political measures must be taken before the Germans are in a strong enough position to say, with any force, that their commercial interests are sufficiently ^reat to demand recognition.” His Majesty’s consul mentions temporary subsidies to a British firm or British firms; but, subject to the opinion of His Majesty’s representatives in Arabistan, who are better able than I to judge as to their probable efficiency, the following measures appear likely to check German commercial activity in Arabistan, if His Majesty’s Government agree that the present state of affairs in Arabistan is unsatisfactory : (a.) The adoption of the desiderata expressed at the end of the memor;indum enclosed in Sir P. Cox’s despatch No. 13, Commercial, of the 21st September, 1913. (b.) To meet the sugar trade now carried in German vessels from Antwerp, it is essential that the British firms ordering sugar in England and the sugar brokers should be recommended by Government, or by intermediary, to insist on all shipments on their account from Antwerp being carried by the new Hall Line or in other British vessels. To meet the circular issued by the Hamburg-Amerika Line at Antwerp (and Hamburg ?), all firms in Great Britain exporting to or trading with the Persian Gulf should be warned of the nature of the circular and its object, and recommended to stipulate (if their goods ever go by Hamburg—Amerika vessels from Antwerp or Hamburg) for transhipment to the British line in the Karun. (c.) I he Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company now has, or will have shortly, it is understood, Lord Inchcape as one of its directors. His voice on the board might make the company willing to undertake the necessary action. In any case, the position, as outlined in this memorandum, might be explained to or Inchcape, and he be asked to interest himself m checking German shipping competition in the Karun. ^ If he could peisuade the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to reorganise their service thoroughly, the following changes seem necessary:— 1. Two new vessels of smaller draught to replace the “ Malamir,” and constructed to work as economically as the German vessels. 2. A proper supply of barges (it appears that the Germans are ordering barges to be self-propelled). ” &amp; 3. Two Europeans in the company’s office at Mohammerah, two at Ahwaz (ship ments to Shushter by steamship “ Shushan ” have also to be looked after). A sufficient native staff would also be necessary. ,,, r ^^ ie com pany to give their staff definite instructions to be as keen as the Germans to remove all former and present grounds of complaint by the local population, and to compete in rates with the German vessels. ^ the Euphiates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company cannot be got to under take the reforms indicated, then an alternative course would be for Lord Inchcape, as irec or o e ntish India Steam Navigation Company, to arrange for that company o extend its Gulf service to Ahwaz by providing as' in 1, 2, 3, and 4, and to work specifically m competition with the Germans. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi- ga ion ompany ( united) and the C£ Malamir ” could then be left to do what they could up the Karun. Failing the British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited), the Anglo- ersian i ompany (Limited) and their friends, Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. (Limited) (shipowners, the Strick Line) might be asked to fill the breach. • liC &lt;L - j Ahwciz, Shushter, and Dizful— Messrs. Lynch Brothers might be recommended, if they wish to retain the forwarding business to Ispahan, to have two Europeans always at Ahwaz (this would work in well with the Euphrates and Tigrisf'X *^5 Noii Cl| ; r ' fc K«5 nocuous, ^ strouo 1 lc ientlr ° 6 Steam Navigation Company’s business) and one at Shushter. They require to aim af better arrangements for forwarding to Ispahan, at active participation in the aeimral commerce of Ahwaz, Shushter, and neighbourhood, and particularly in the exnort nf grain from Arabistan. ^ ^ L Ui _ In view of the importance of Dizful on account of the railway scheme Messrs Stock Scott, and Co. might permanently post an English agent there to get a firm hold of the general trade of the town and sales to Luristan. &amp; (e.) The question of enabling British exporters up the Karun to compete in the purchase of grain, if the Germans quote high prices and make use of shipping rebates will need consideration if the harvest of 1914 is good, as seems likely The onlv solution appears to be a reduction of freight by the British vessels. y January 31, 1914.

CONFIDENTIAL. [February 16.] Section 5. [6971] No. 1. Consul-General Sir C. Eertslet to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received February 16.) {No. 15.) Sir ’ WTTTJ r* x .. . _ _ Antwerp, February 14, 1914. . VV 1111 reierenee 1° my despatch No. 56, Commercial, Confidential, of the 10th December last^ forwarding a memorandum, prepared under my instructions by Mr. . ^ce-Consu! Kearney, on the trade between Antwerp and ports in the Fersian Cull, I have the honour to call your attention to a paragraph on this subiect which appeared in the “Shipping Gazette” of the 12th instant, which paragraph 1 enclose herewith for your information. The newspaper points out that an arrangement has been come to between the Hall Lines (Limited), of Liverpool, and the Hamburg—America Line for the working in common of a steamship service between British and continental ports and the Persian Gulf, alleging that monthly despatches are contemplated, to be carried out by the two companies alternately. The “ Shipping Gazette ” also reproduces _ an article from the German “ Fremdenblatt, ,r commenting, with^ apparent satisfaction, on the friendly relationships now existing between the British and German lines, which is the more remarkable when the criticisms made at the time the German line first opened its trade to Gulf ports are called to mind. r This statement in^the “ Shipping Gazette ” appeared to me to be at variance with the contents of a certain portion of the memorandum above referred to, in regard to the number of departures monthly from the continent to the Gulf. I have consequently caused enquiries to be made, and beg leave to report the following particulars :— The Hall Lines (Limited) have in no measure departed from their intention of despatching one vessel each month from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf. One vessel each month is being now, and will henceforth be, despatched by the British service. The Hamburg-America Line will continue, as previously, to despatch one vessel a month from this port to the Gulf, with occasional additional vessels if required. To this extent the article in the “ Shipping Gazette,” so far as the port of Antwerp is concerned, is erroneous. So far as the reference to friendly relations between the Hamburg-America Line and the Hall Lines is in question, the article is absolutely accurate. I understand that the most complete harmony exists between the two companies, and that everything possible is being done to prevent anything occurring which could give rise to dissension regarding the trade from Antwerp to the Gulf. There is, it is true, an understanding between the companies upon the matter of freight rates and upon the question of the number of British departures, which are limited to one a month. The departures of the German vessels being virtually fixed ones, the British company is endeavouring to despatch its vessels at evenly-distributed periods between the German departures, so that there may be no possibility of competition for the goods offered for freight. Both companies carry the same class of goods, and I am informed that several hundred tons of sugar for Gulf ports have already been consigned by the Hall Line vessels, though at the time I sent in the memorandum on the subject, on the 10th December, no Belgian sugar had been carried in the British vessels. There are thus signs that the arrangement will continue satisfactorily, and in any case one of the points raised in the despatch from the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf (viz., that a regular service of British vessels from Antwerp to the Gulf should be encouraged) has been met.

That if His Majesty’s Government decides to take up this matter with a view to promoting British interests as opposed to German interests in the Gulf, it would be advisable for a representative well acquainted with shipping matters in Europe to visit the ports of the Persian Gulf there to acquire local knowledge of the conditions existing. I have, &amp;c. CECIL HERTSLET. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum by Vice-Consul Kearney on Shipping Trade from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf. 1. Volume of Trade to Persia from Antwerv. (Confidential.) VS commenting on the able report by Mr. H. G. Chick, commercial adviser in the Persian Gulf, forwarded to the Foreign Office by the Political Resident at Bushire in his despatch of the 21st September, it is necessary, in the first place, to confirm the fact of the undoubted encroachment by German shipping in the carrying trade in goods of Belgian origin sent to the Gulf during the last few years from Antwerp. The total of German trade in the Gulf is a subject on which I am not competent to give an opinion, and this memorandum only refers to trade to the Gulf from Belgium, and Antwerp in particular, since this port is the only one in Belgium affected. Mr. Chick’s figures on p. 4 of the report show that trade to Gulf ports from Antwerp and Hamburg is in a pioportion of about 5 to 1 in favour of the former, the exports from Antwerp in the sixth year of sailings (i.e., 1912) being 90,669 packages. This quantity, though showing the relative importance of the trade from the two ports, does not convey a definite impression of the volume of trade according to the European idea, which is usually estimated in tonnage in this country (metric tons of 1,000 kilog.). [1967 m —2] : Y f/i. \ B Copy vo 9 JAN 1914The Belgian customs statistics show that during 1912 19,750 tons of goods were shipped at Antwerp destined for Persia, and during the same year 8,683 tons of goods ^re landed at Antwerp from Persia. No mention is made of the actual destination of die goods exported, but, since they were sent by sea, it may be presumed that they ^^DurinTthe sam^^afthrexporteof Belgian-produced goods to Persia (again the Gulf h not mentioned) reached 11,653 tons, valued at 202,8801. It may be concluded from these figures that the difference of some 8,000 tons m the volume of goods shipped to Persia from Antwerp in 1912 in excess of the Belgian exports to Persia m the same tear is due to shipments at Antwerp of goods emanating from other countries than Belgium probably Germany. Almost the whole of the export trade from Antwerp to Pefia in 1912 must have been carried in German bottoms, as none but German vessels ran regularly from Antwerp to the Gulf in 1912, and there were but few irregular departures. A certain proportion of the goods may have reached lersian Gulf ports by transhipment in London or elsewhere, but it is doubtful whether Be gian exports for transhipment would be included in the returns for Persia, in view of the method of compiling international trade statistics in force in Belgium. _ For general purposes the total trade to Persia from Antwerp and from Belgium may he taken as shown above, viz., 19,750 tons shipped at Antwerp and 11,653 tons of Belgian-produce, the difference of 8,097 tons being goods shipped at Antwerp pioduced The Belgian export statistics make no special detailed mention of the exports to Persia, the quantity being doubtless deemed too small, hut from other official returns it is gathered that the following were the principal items of export to lersia of Belgian-produced goods in 1912 :— Bnroasted coffee.. *. Loaf sugar Candles.. *» _ . • Mixed cotton and silk tissues Cotton tissues Iron and steel (joists, &amp;c., principally) Nails .. .. .. . • Machinery Kail and tramcars (detached parts) .. Kiver boats .. .. .. Arms .. .. .. Tons. 222 8,062 67 1 83 1,194 35 48 225 50 19 10,006 Alimentary pastes (vermicelli) 51 Candles .. 65 (Dutch) Mixed cotton and silk tissues .. 2 (German) Cotton tissues .. 46 ( „ ) Iron and steel joists 1,014 ( „ ) „ (other) 1,602 ( „ ) „ (tubes) 216 („ ) Nails .. 37 ( „ ) Machinery 417 ( „ ) Rail and tramcars (detached parts).. .. Ill (French) Arms .. .. .. ., .. 30 (German) C? By far the greater part of the Belgian exports to Persia is composed of loaf sugar, but I understand that at the present time there is an appreciable quantity of sulphuric acid for shipment. This acid is being purchased by British firms on the continent as British suppliers are not able to forward in sufficient quantities. The trade in arms and ammunition is a special matter needing no reference in this memorandum. There would appear to he every reason to suppose that this considerable quantity of Belgian sugar, consigned as it is principally to British firms trading in Gulf ports, might he conveyed by British steamers instead of German. The sugar is entirely Belgian and has no German connection. There seems to be indications of an increase in the sugar exports, and it is a matter of interest that, after Great Britain, Persia consumes more Belgian sugar than any other country. In respect of goods in transit through Belgium, shipped at Antwerp for Persian Gulf ports, the following are the principal items, so far as I can ascertain without reference to the actual manifests of all vessels, which would be a difficult matter in a port such as this. The indication after the quantity of goods shows the country of origin thereof:— Tons. 3,591It may be accepted as a basis for discussion that the goods of German origin shipped to the Gulf from Antwerp would be sent in German bottoms whatever vessels offered, German exporters being certain to favour shipment by vessels sailing under their own flag, under like-conditions as to freight. This would apply except in the ■c^ of goods bought f.o.b. to Antwerp, the purchasers of which would choose their own line for shipment. The figures given in the foregoing remarks are, as stated, compiled from Belgian official returns. They are of little value for the purposes of this memorandum, but they are given for wdiat they may be worth. There is every indication that these official figures do not show, in anything approaching its real importance, the volume of the trade from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf either in Belgian-produced goods or in goods produced elsewhere and shipped at Antwerp. This is particularly obvious since the trade to Persian Gulf ports only is mentioned, and the Turkish and Arab ports of the Gulf are not referred to. In order to obtain a more definite idea of the actual trade, I have procured particulars prepared from the manifests of a number of the regular German vessels sailing from Antwerp to the Gulf, which show that during the last six months—May to October inclusive—the cargo shipped at Antwerp for Gulf ports in German vessels amounted to some 3,000 tons per vessel, or at the rate of 17 vessels a year (which was the number of sailings from October 1912 to October 1913) a total of, roughly, 50,000 tons. It is necessary to know r in a general manner the quantity of cargo which offers from Antwerp to the Gulf in order to form an idea of the ^position of a British shipping company engaged in the trade, and as a basis on which to work. From various sources of information it may be estimated that at the present time there are on an average some 4,500 to 5,000 tons of cargo a month requiring shipment to Gulf and Arab ports from Antwerp, composed of general cargo, principally Belgian sugar. I have obtained copies of the manifests of tw T o German vessels of the Hamburg— America Line which sailed respectively in August 1912 and October 1913. The former shows a total of 1,951 tons shipped at Antwerp for Gulf and Arab ports, the latter 5,486 tons. Copies of the manifests are given at the end of this memorandum. As they show particulars of the class of goods carried, and indications (by the marks on the packages) of the firms to w r hich they are destined, they may be of interest. Particulars have also been procured of the total cargoes carried from Antwerp to ports in the Persian Gulf during the twelve months from October 1912 to October 1913, and they are produced in a table at the end of this memorandum. During the period mentioned seventeen vessels of the Hamburg-America Line loaded 49,571 tons of general cargo for Gulf ports, the largest quantity taken in any one steamer being 5,754 tons by the steamship “ Persepolis ” on the 20th June, 1913. The quantity of goods to be carried is clearly on the increase. It may be estimated that at the present time the total quantity of merchandise available for shipment from Antwerp to ports in the Persian Gulf is in round figures some 60,000 tons a year, or an average of 5,000 tons a month. Almost the whole of this quantity (nine-tenths as an estimate) is carried by German vessels. Belgian sugar forms a large part of the trade, and recently a quantity of railway material has been carried, consigned to Basra. Having thus in a general manner given an indication of the extent of trade between Antwerp and ports in the Persian Gulf at the present^ time, I will pioceed to make some observations on the remarks contained in Mr. Chicks icpoit, based upon information gleaned from local sources at Antwerp. 2. General Remarks. At p 2 of the report Mr. Chick gives particulars of the several steamship lines callino- at Gulf ports regularlv in 1912. Of those mentioned only the Hamburg- Amerfca Line had regular sailings from Antwerp during the period under review. The Anglo-Algerian Steamshipping Company (Limited) (Stnck), does not sail from Antwerp to the Gulf. The Bucknall Line has never had regular sailings from this port to the Gulf at any time. The West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company (Limited) no longer exists so far as Antwerp-Gulf traffic is concerned, the service havino- been acquired by the Hall Lines (Limited), managed and principally owned by Sir J &amp; Ellerman Bart. The Bucknall Line has also been incorporated under the samemanagement. In fact Sir J. Ellerman is now the moving spirit in, and directs the policy at the present time of, these two as well as of other steamship lines. Both Lientenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox (p. 2) and Mr. Chick (p. 17), suggest that the British India Steam Navigation Company should be induced to take up the cause of BritH interests in competition with the Hamburg-America Line for the traffic from AntweJp to the Persian Gulf and Arab ports, which for the past few years has been left entirely in German hands, to such an extent that it has been impossible for British firms in Persia to import goods from Belgium at advantageous rates by other than German ships. The British India Company has never had direct sailings from Antwerp to Gulf ports, but has carried goods hence by transhipment at Bombay, and conveyance thence by its local lines to the Gulf. I am given to understand that the agreement come to some years ago by the British India, at the time of the termination of the freiffit war between that company and the Hamburg-America Line, precludes the British India from taking cargo from Antwerp to certain ports in the Near East, on condition that the Hamburg-America Line does not take cargo for the same places from London. Under this agreement the British India are apparently prevented from shipping caro-Q at Antwerp direct for Gulf ports, and were they to do so the whole question which was settled under the agreement would be reopened. It seems doubtful wdiether it could be to the interest of the British India to risk a new rupture with the Hamburg-America Line on the consideration of Antwerp traffic with the Gulf, wffiich could under the most advantageous conditions form only a very small portion of their considerable carrying trade. It is true that the policy of the principal German shipping lines appears to be to consider Antwerp as, practically speaking, a German port. This has frequently been pointed out, not only with regard to the Gulf, but in respect of much more important trade routes—notably to the Far East, Australia, India, and the East Coast of Africa. British lines in most instances appear to have relinquished Antwerp to German^ shipping upon condition that German ships would not take cargo from London. This does not mean that British ships are absolutely precluded under all circumstances from loading cargo here for the destinations referred to—and the particulars of agreements are too lengthy and complicated to permit of detailed explanation in this memorandum—but as a general principle the policy of German lines is undoubtedly to reserve Antwerp as a German preserve, to the exclusion of British steamship lines for certain trades, and in some instances the British lines have given way under coercion, thus giving the appearance of acquiescence in this policy. Fiom what is stated above, it seems unlikely that the British India Company could, even if they would, enter into competition with the Hamburg—America Line for the conveyance of Belgian produce to the Gulf, on account of their unfortunate agreements. The information procurable at Antwerp on this subject is naturally not “v em detailed, and could doubtless be substantiated and completed by the head office of the company in London, wdiere the views of the directors would be available, and fuJl particulars of the agreement might be disclosed. Cn the assumption that the British India w r ould not enter into the Antwerp- Gu f trade, there remain but the two possibilities of the resumption of the service by t ic \\ est Hartiepool Lines, or the establishment of another and independent service by some other company. As shown, both the Bucknall Line and West Hartlepool- Antwerp-Gulf service have been absorbed under the Ellerman Lines (Limited), in the name of the Hall Lines (Limited). , A^ ie . (Limited),'' has recently started a regular service from Antwerp to e ersian Gulf, and will have monthly sailings shortly. I understand that monthly sailings are to begin in December 1913, though no vessel for that month is yet advertised, and the agent has not yet been informed. The Hall Line is, as stated, under the management of Sir J. Ellerman, and forms part of the Ellerman Lines. In ±act, from the point of view of policy, the Ellerman Lines, Bucknall Line, and Hall Line aie o a intents and purposes synonymous, since they are under the same management am direction, and it would seem that this company is the one to fill the requirements mentioned by Mr Chick for a regular British service from Antwerp to Gulf ports. Having established its service, the Hall Line, with the powerful backing of the Ellerman mes^would seem to be the one to meet the requirements of the Antwerp-Gulf trade m British interests. I gather that the management of the Hall Line is fully alive to n 1 ; 116 sh + ° nld u 1 be confuse . d with the West Hartlepool Line, which ran vessels a U ' | !n ffi a t u ‘ Po j ts until some little time ago. The Hall Line vessels have the suffix “HaH’ r aame— thu^ ^EdeiffiaH^’ ' L ° ckslej Hal1 ? the West Hartlepool Line vessels incorporate the “ Hail ” in thethe importance oi Gulf traffic being regained to British shipping, and to the important future or that traffic. Line has already despatched four steamships from Antwerp with cargo ^ GlllE “ Locksley Hall” sailed on the 28th May, 1918, the Merton Hall sailed on the 26th July, 1913, the ‘' Anatolia” sailed on the 23rd August, 1913, and the Locksley Hall” sailed on the 1st November, 1913. The company advertises as follows: “ Persian Gulf service, Antwerp to Bunder Abbas, Bus hi re, Basra, and by transhipment to Bagdad, calling at Jibuti, Aden, and Muscat if sufficient inducement offers. I understand from the local agent of the Ellerman Lines that, so far, the amount of cargo carried for Gulf ports from Antwerp has been moderate in amount, ranging from some 400 to 900 tons per vessel, but that in view of the recent establishment of the line this is far from unsatisfactory. The bulk of the caigo so far has been sulphuric acid in drums. No Belgian sugar has as yet been shipped by the British service. No real effort has as yet been made to capture from the German line any portion of the cargo it now carries, but I gather that there is no feeling of uneasiness by the Hall Line as to the attitude of the Hamburg—America Line when the new service is actively established. It is doubtless to this, the Hall Line, service that Mr. Chick makes reference in the paragraph headed “ (A) Belgian trade, and exports to the Belgian [? Persian] Gulf ” at p. 8 of the report. I understand from the Antwerp agent of the Ellerman, Buchnall, and Hall Lines that a berth has been secured in the new docks at Antwerp (which are to be opened to traffic early in 1914). This berth has not been specially taken for the new service to the Persian Gulf, but has been reserved by the Ellerman Lines for its Hall Line and Bucknall Line services, running respectively to the Persian Gulf and to South Africa. The securing of a berth at Antwerp in the docks or at the river quays merely means that a particular berth will be available whenever vessels of the line or lines for which it is reserved call at this port. The berth may be used for general purposes when no vessels of the regular line are at Antwerp, but should one of the regular vessels arrive, any other ship occupying the reserved berth is moved elsewhere. By this means the regular line with a secured berth can concentrate cargo at the particular berth, and thereby avoid unnecessary delay in loading and despatch. Both the Bucknall Line South African service and the Hall Line Persian Gulf service will use the regular berth allotted by the Antwerp port authorities when it becomes available. So far, the Hall Line vessels sailing to the Gulf have used another regular berth belonging to the Ellerman Lines in another part of the docks on four occasions, as shown. As already said, when the new berth reserved is available to traffic, it will be used by the Hall Line vessels. It is true that before establishing this new regular service to the Persian Gulf the / Hall Lines (or rather the Ellerman Lines with Sir J. Ellerman who own it) consulted with the Hamburg-America Line on the subject. This appears to have been done as a matter of expediency and policy rather than through fear of any action which the Hamburg—America Line might take. Naturally the number of departures by the British service was discussed, and the Hamburg-America Line appeared desirous of limiting the departures of the Hall Line service to six per annum, i.e., one vessel every two months. The ultimate arrangement was for a regular vessel of the Hall Line to sail every month, Antwerp being the chief port of departure. 4 he vessels of this company will therefore, when the service is properly established, run from : Antwerp to the Persian Gulf regularly each month, calling for cargo at London. There will be no freight war with the Hamburg—America Line, as an understanding has been come to that the rates by both the British and German services will^ be the same. The reason for a conference before the establishment of the new British line was doubtless to avoid the possibility of excessive competition in freight weights. It is a moot point as to what view the Hamburg—America Line would adopt weie the s Hall Line at some future time to increase its regular sailings from Antwerp to the I Gulf beyond one a month. ... . i i In a measure, Mr. Chick’s point as to a British line running legularly from Antwerp to the Gulf has been met by the establishment of this Hall Line seivice. It remains to be seen what can be done to foster the trade by the British line as opposed to the German. At present, as previously shown, by far the principal part of the carrying trade between the points in question is in German hands. It would seem that it is now possible for the suggestion contained on p. 12 of the report to be carried out, viz., for British firms purchasing Belgian sugar for shipment to the Gulf to insist that the shipments should be made by the British Hall Line. 4 he sugar trade [1967 2] Cundoubtedly forms tbe bulk of the permanent traffic from Antwerp, and it seems that most of this sugar is for the order of British firms. Therefore, under similar condi tions of freight, it is reasonable to suppose that British firms would support the British line. There is no hint in the report that the Hamburg-America Line gives rebates on freights to the Gulf, so that the British and German lines can henceforth work in amicable competition on an even basis. In regard to return freight from the Gulf, were the suggestion of a subsidy con tained at p. 14 of the report to be materialised, the British company would be in an advantageous position vis-d-vis the German company. There is a statement at p. 9 of the Report under the heading “ (B) Position of the British Shipping Companies trading direct between Europe and the Gulf” to the effect that Mr. Strick sold a number of his vessels to the Hamburg-America Line for their Gulf service at a large profit. This, I am given to understand, was certainly the case, and Mr. Strick’s profit from his sales was a very considerable one, but I am assured that the reasons prompting him to make the sale were purely business ones. A number of new vessels were on order, there was a great demand for ships at the time owing to the flourishing condition of the shipping trade, and Mr. Strick was able to sell his older vessels for a very satisfactory price, and naturally clid so. That certain of these vessels were subsequent!) 7 used for the Hamburg-America Line Gulf service does not necessarily infer that the seller was unmindful of British interests in the Gulf in making the sale. This is merely a repetition of the view expressed to me by well-informed persons in the shipping trade at Antwerp. At p. 16 of the report Mr. Chick states that upon a relatively restricted business connection in the Gulf the Germans have recently advanced important claims, among which (4) is one “to participate in the navigation of the Karun from Mohammerah to Ahwaz in competition with Messrs. Lynch Brothers.” That this claim has already materialised is evident from a circular to exporters which has just been issued in Antwerp by Messrs. Tonnelier and Schepens, agents here for the Gulf service of the Hamburg-America Line. A copy of this circular is annexed^ It appears that the German firm of Wonckhaus and Co., who have branches in most Gulf ports, have established a river service from Mohammerah to Ahwaz in competition with Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and the circular points out that all goods shipped by the Hamburg- America Line for the destination mentioned will in future be transferred to the new German river service, instead of to Messrs. Lynch’s service as heretofore, unless precise instructions to the contrary are given by the sender. This would appear to be one more indication of the manner in which German interests are fostered. 3. Suggestions. (a.) Owing to the fact that all the British steamship lines which ever ran from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf are now under the management of Sir J. Ellerman, and that the newly established line is also managed by that gentleman, who works in harmony with Messrs. Strick, and who has “ squared ” matters with the German line, it would seem advisable that Sir J. Ellerman might be invited to confer with repre sentatives of His Majesty’s Government with a view to establishing some definite means of fostering British trade interests in the Persian Gulf, and placing British shipping and shippers in a more satisfactory position. (b.) Unless some assistance is given to the newly-established British line it is difficult to see how it is to succeed in obtaining more than a relatively small proportion of the carrying trade from Antwerp to Gulf ports, the trade being already in German hands. It would therefore appear to be in the interests of British prestige generally and in the Gulf in particular for a full measure of support to be given to the Hall Line service from Antwerp. (c.) Should His Majesty’s Government decide to offer any direct or indirect assistance in this connection, it would doubtless be advantageous, as suggested by Mr. Chick at p. 16 of the report, for someone well acquainted with the conditions of of the shipping trade from Europe to the Gulf to visit the various ports in the region mentioned with a view to obtaining knowledge of local conditions and requirements which could be assimilated with the knowledge already possessed of the conditions of the European trade.

Resident in Mysore, The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Dated Bangalore, 6th December 1913. Sir, With reference to your letter Ho. 1974 E.A., dated the 23rd August 1913, I have the honour to say that the decision of the Government of India on the question of exporting wood and timber from the Mysore State to ports in the Persian Gulf and on the Tigris, was explained to the Darbar and their attention invited to the advisability of taking further action in the direction recommended in paragraph 4(1) and (3) of the letter of the Political Resident in the Persian Gull, No. 1709, dated the 31st May 1913. 2. The Darbar now report that, having regard to the small volume of the trade anticipated, they do not consider it necessary to depute any to the Persian Gulf. I have informed Sir P. Cox accordingly. I have etc., Sd. H. Daly, Resident.. Ihdia, Foreign SECRETARY'SI cm extremely sorry I have been so long in letting you have a note about the Germans in the ■Persian. Gulf, but as you Know, I have been extrernel busy for some months past. I now enclose it. Yours sincerely, V bir Thos: Hold erness K.C.S.I. India Office V/hitehall . S .V/.E.C. There is no doubt that the Hamburg-Amerika Line entered the -Persian Gulf Trade under Government auspices with a. view to establishing a footing for the Germans in the Persian Gulf in c onnecti on with the Bhagdad Bailway, It ho.s been an impossibility for British Ship owners to compete successfully with the Kamburg-Ameriha Line, subs id i 2 ed as tha, t C ompany is ei the r d i rec tly or indirectly by the German Goverment, and the British Shipowners have been obliged to come to terms with the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and to agree rates of freight, and also to give up direct loading from Hamburg and Antwerp, If the British Lines were notwto start loading in Hamburg and Antwerp there is no doubt that the Hamburg-Amerika Line would attack the trade from Gt, Britain to the Gulf, If the British Lines had not come to terms with the Hamburg-Amerika Line it would have been impossible for them to maintain a position in the Trade. I understand that a contract was made with the Hamburg-Amerika Line to carry something like 400,000 ton of railway material from Hamburg to Busreh at something like ll/- per ton, a rate which vjould, never have paic.0$&amp;tA then, unless they had secured assistance in some other way. Prior to 1907, the Shipping Trade in the Persian u-ulj was practically exclusively in British hands, the sugar export trade to the Gulf was then almost entirely from Bo.rse ill es and was served by British Lines', the advent of the Hamburg Amerika brought the German sugar manufacturers into competition with the French refineries and the former are gradually monopolising the trade. Attempts have aeen mode to bring the Belgian sugar from Antwerp, transhipping it to British steamers here, but this proved too expensive. Messrs % Samuel &amp; Co are at the present moment building some Diesel Engine Steamers to run from England to the Persian Gulf. They recognise, however, that success can only be obtained by combination, and have c omb ined. As regards Mr. Chick*s proposal to get the cultivat ors to grow wheat rather than Barley, so that the wheat would come to England instead of the Barley going to Germany, I am very much afraid that this would be an impossibility. The Cultivators will naturally grow --what pays them best. In regard to a Lighterage Co to be formed for loading the ships at Busreh, Mahomerah, and the Bar, at the r- 3 - m a the) present time, as far as my information goes, there are ample Lighterage facilities on the that-efr-Arab, but I look fora great improvement in Busreh when the Port Commission gets to work. In regard to the suggestion that the Euphrates and Tigris should be c onverted into a British Company, this, as you know, is already the case, and arrangements have now been completed whereby the Turkish steamers on the Tigris will be managed by what will practically be a British Company, The criticisms regarding Ltricks' halving sold steamers to the Germans scarcely require any remark. If Messrs. Strick found a German buyer ready to give them a good pfofit on vessels which they find they con dispose of without disadvantage to their general trade, of course no one can blame them for this. I am. glad to say that as far as the British India Trade is concerned in the Persian Gulf from Bombay, j which is really the chief trade of the Gulf, everything ^ is working very satisfactorily. We have recently put a number of new large fast steamers into the trade, and within the next few months we shall have several more, end results so far have been most gratifying. I am a little nervous about what m.ay happen when tne Bjfagdad Railway is completed. We may find an-4- (m: an) attempt on the part of the Germans to oust British vessels from the trade from Busreh to India, hut we have • u,a tms me 11 in view, and have been preparing for it by laying out a very large amount of capital in improved and up to date vessels which I hope will be able to hold ineir own against any legitimate German competition; but oj course, ijthe Germ.an Government are determined to force their way into the trade with India, by means of subsidies, it may go hard with the British Lines.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100035251855.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/366/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035251855.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/366/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1283/1913 Pt 2 'Persian Gulf and Arabistan: German competition'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1913/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-29T12:00:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (195 folios)</extent><extent>This item is part of a larger physical volume and is located towards the front; it occupies folios 3-198.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This is part two (of two) of a larger volume IOR/L/PS/10/366; it concerns increasing German competition experienced by British firms trading in the Persian Gulf region, and contains discussion between British officials as to possible action to strengthen the latter.Specific issues predominantly discussed in this part include:the abandonment of Antwerp and Hamburg by British shipping lines, and the current monopoly held by the Hamburg-America Line;agreements made between British shipping companies and the Hamburg-America Line;the establishment of a regular shipping service from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf by the Hall Line to compete with the Hamburg-America Line;the establishment of Messrs Robert Wonckhaus and Company on the Karun River and its success in competing with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and a possible subsidy for the latter from the British Government;a query from Paul, Gray and Company (see ff 28-33) as to whether they may continue to represent a German merchant, Mr Roever at Shiraz, following the outbreak of the First World War (1914-18);British-Russian proposals to use the war to take the Persian drug import trade away from the Germans.The following reports by Henry George Chick (Commercial Adviser and Vice-Consul at Bushire) can be found within: a memorandum on the development of Messrs Robert Wonckhaus and Company's activity on the Karun River (see folios 152-155 and 168-171, two copies), and a report on German trade and shipping in the Persian Gulf for the year 1912-13 (see folios 86-94).
