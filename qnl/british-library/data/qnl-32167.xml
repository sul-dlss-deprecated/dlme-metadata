E. &gt;» ard.Thirty ChprchnStreest, NW Yofrkv, J December 11th, 1942* Gentlemen, May I be permitted to submit in support of the application of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. a personal plea for your consideration in respect of providing exchange facilities for payment of my share of the Bahrein royalty income in New York. * I am a citizen of the United States, resident in New York. It has been determined by the U.S. Treasury Department,. Bureau of Internal Revenue, that my interest in the royalty, which has not been registered with the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. by the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. in accordance with customary procedure in this country, is an economic interest in all royalties which issue from the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. under terms of an option agreement which I negotiated and executed in behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. in New York, November 30th, 192'. The royalty income covered by this agreement is paid to the Eastern add General Syndicate, Ltd. London, by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., New York. Under the terms of an accommodation agreement dated November 9th, 1937, made between the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. and the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. in New York, one-tenth of the royalty income was paid by the Bahrein Petroleum Company Ltd. to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. at the Chase National Bank in New York in dollars, so making it possible for the Syndicate to secure payment to me in dollars in New York of my share of the royalty income without it being remitted to London by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. This mode of payment was approved by Mr. H. H. Surfleet, Chief Inspector of Taxes, Somerset House, London, W.C.2, as per his ruling dated August 12, 1937. Payment of one-tenth of the royalty income in New York is predicated upon the undertaking in the option agreement oated November 30, 1927 that the royalty issuing fro the Bahrein Petroleum Company Ltd. be paid in dollars in New York at the current rate of exchange. For the convenience of the ^astern and General Syndicate, Ltd., a British Corporation, the receiving agency was transferred from New York to London. Due to exchange restrictions and a desire to conserve dollar exchange, the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. commencing with the royalty income due and payable May 15, 1941, has paid the entire royalty income to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. in sterling in London. /It Foreign Exchange Control Bank of England, London, E.C. England.It is my ore-tenth share of this income for which dollar exchange in New York is now being sought. The Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. deplores the situation which has arisen and following a personal plea to the president of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., Mr. Howard M. Herron,^ he has kindly agreed to arrange for payment in New York of one—tenth of the royalty income in accordance with the aforementioned accommodation agreement dated November 9th, 193V provided that dollars are made available on the application of the Syndicate. I venture to hope that the application now before you will merit your favourable consideration. Yours very truly, (Sd.) Thomas E.
