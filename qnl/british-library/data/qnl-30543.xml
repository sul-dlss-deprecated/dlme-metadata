I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, ( 3gd.) r • GUHLIS’Fii-LISTKK • TICK HOHOULJUIU2 THj£ POLITICAL RESORT IN THE PERSIAN GULP.necent events in Saudi Aidsia, more particularly the Ibn Rifada incursion and the revolt in Asir, have suggested the desirability of reviewing the position generally, and it seems convenient to take this opportunity of re-stating the main lines of the policy which His Majesty’s Government in the United King dom are pursuing in regard to Arabian affairs, with special reference to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Trans-Jordan. 2. Briefly, this policy may be described as the maintenance of the status quo; and His Majesty’s Government have thus to follow two distinct lines of action - (a) support of the regime of Ibn Saud as King of Saudi Arabia, and (b) support of the Hashiraite regime in Iraq and Trans- J ordan• 3. In both cases international relations are involved* and it may be useful firsl to recapitulate the more important instruments which govern the position. Saudi rabia. His Majenty the King has recognised Ibn Saud as King of the Hejaz and of liejd and its Dependencies (now known as Saudi Arabia) by the treaty signed at Jedda on the 20th May, 1927, and the relations established by that treaty involve certain mutual obligations, notably, by Article 2, each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes to maintain good relations with/ HIGH COIHISSIONER, LIEUTENANT GENERAL, SIR A.G.ifAUCHOPE, K.C.B. ,C.M. 1. ,C.I .E. ,D.S.O., ©tc., etc., etc.— - 2 - &lt;Dj® with the other and to endeavour by all the mean* at hi* disposal to prevent his territories being used as a base for unlawful activities directed against peace and tranquility in the territories of the other party. Iraq . The relations between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq will be governed until 1957 or longer by the Treaty of 30th June, 1930, which came into force upon the entry of Iraq into the eague of Nations as an independent State in October f 1932. The High Contracting Parties undertake that, without prejudice to obligations under the Covenant and the Treaty for the Renunciation i&gt;f &gt;/ar, in the event of either of them becoming engaged in war, the other will immediately come to his aid. The assistance which His Majesty's Government are to render to Iraq does not extend to the maintenance of internal order, but it is recognised that the protection of the essential communica tions of His Majesty's Government is in the common interest of both parties. In matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests the High Contracting Parties agree to full and frank consultation. His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad, and his successors, are to enjoy precedence in relation ! to the representatives of other powers. Iraq undertakes that when in need of the services of foreign officials she will normally engage British subjects, and that for the purpose of military instruction only British subjects will be engaged. The relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Amir are determined by the Agreement made between His Majesty the King and His Highness in February, 1928, the ratifications of/of which were exchanged on the 31st October, 1929, Full responsibility is accepted by Hie Majesty as Mandatory for Trans-Jordan; and by Article 5 of the Agreement, the Amir agrees to be guided by the advice of His Majesty in all matters concerning foreign relations of Trans-Jordan as well as in all matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Majesty in respect of Trans-Jordan. 4. The direct relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq are governed by various instruments, notably the lluh&amp;mmara Convention of 5th May, 1922? the Bohr a Agreement of 1st Novem ber, 1923; and the Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage and the Extradition Treaty of 1931. The Hndda Agreement of the 2nd November,1925, defines the frontier between Nejd and Trans-Jordan and makes provision for the settlement of certain questions connected with the frontier, with a view to promoting friendly relations between the two countries. No definite agreement has been reached with the Government of Saudi /rabia as to the definition of the frontier between Hejnz and Trans-Jordan, but, by the exchange of notes appended to the Treaty of Jedda, King I bn Saud has expressed his willingness to maintain the status quo in the Ma’an-Aqnba district and not to interfere in its administration until favourable circumstances will permit a final settlement of the quention. 5. In conformity with the general policy of His Majesty’s Government, a furtner stage will have been reached in the process of establishing these international relations on a regular basis when effect has been given to the proposed mutual recognition between Ibn Saud as King of Saudi Arabia, and Abdullnh as ^mir of the State of Trans-Jordan, which, it is cont emplated/-4- contemplated, vriil be loll owed by the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship between the two countries. 6. Turning now to another aspect of the matter, the following are the chief reasons which have influenced His Majesty’s Government in giving their support to the maintenance of Ibn Saud’s regime in Saudi Arabiai- (a) Having regard to the great concern t 0 His Majesty's Government of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, to their mandatory responsibility for Trans-Jordan and their special interests in Iraq, Kuwait and Bahrain, it has been recognised that it is of great advantage to His iajesty’s Government that the main area of the Arabian Peninsula should be under a more or less ordered government with which they can Aaintain normal diplomatic relations and of importance that those relations should be of a friendly character. (b) Only by the establishment of such an ordered government in Arabia can the sa: ety and good treatment of Moslem pilgrims, many of whom are British subjects, or under British protection, be ensured. (c) Were relations between His Majesty’s Government and King Ibn Baud not of a friendly character, he might well exert himself to absorb Kuwait # interfere in the affairs of Bahrain and even attempt to obtain an influence over the frucial Shaikhdoms. There have been occasional indications that some at least of the Trucial Shaikhs would not be un responsive. (d) His Majesty’s Government would view with concern the establishment of Soviet influence in Arabia. King Ibn Baud has siiown himself to be of the same view and for tnis reason merits support. ^hen recently His Majesty’s Govern ment were unable to comply with King Ibn Baud’s request for a loan, he informed them that he might be obliged, though most reluctantly/— t)-* reluctantly, to accept Soviet offers of financial assistance, i'ere the relations between His Majesty’s Government and him to deteriorate, he might be readier to accept the advances of the Soviet Government. 7. As regards the support given to the Haahimite family in Iraq ©nd Trans-Jordan, His liajesty’s Government have been influenced by the following considerations^- (a) His Majesty’s Government recognise that they remain under special obligations to the Hashimites arising from the part played by the latter in the war against Turkey. (b) King Jels&amp;l and the Amir Abdullah hare shown themselves to be well-disposed to His Majesty’s Government. It is not necessary to enter into detail, but two recent cases in which the latter has, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion and the disturbances in Palestine in 1929. (c) His Majesty’s Government have maintained their support of the Hashimites for many years, and there is nothing which in their view suggests the desirability of any change in a policy to which they are deeply committed. On the contrary, there are special relations with Iraq, arising out of the Treaty of Alliance, which involve continued support; while in the case of Trans-Jordan, His Majesty’s Government have a special responsibility, as the mandatory power, to support the regime which has been set up in that country under their direct protection. (d) Even if His Majesty’s Government had grounds for serious dissatisfaction, there is no obvious alternative to the Hashiiaites as rulers in Iraq or Trans-Jordan. 8. The possibility is recognised that the kingdom of Ibn Gaud may break up on his death, but it would not be to the advantage/ —advantage of His Majesty’s Government to do anything to nasten its disruption. On the contrary, it is to thej.r interest to do all that they can to maintain good relations with Saudi i rafci© and to support Ibn Saud as ruler of a united kingdom. Neverthe less, account must be taken of the mutual animosity between Ibn Saud and the Hashimite family resulting from past events, which cannot be expected entirely to disappear eve n as a result of the establishment of relations on the basis of m utual recognition and treaites of friendship. The possibility of the continuance of disputes and of conflicting interests must be accepted, and the full reconciliation of the two complemen tary aspects of the policy of His Hajeaty’s Government presents a problem, the solution of which is not without difficulty. Support of Ibn Gaud's regime in Saudi Arabia cannot be given at the expense of support of the Hashimite rulers in their own territories, and His Majesty’s Government must take full account of the repercussions likely to be produced in terri tories over which they exercise mandatory responsibility or towards which they stand in special relations. 9. Despite, however, the existence of these difficulties, no question has arisen, nor does the question now arise, of choosing bs between Ibn Saud and the Hashimite family, or of subordinating the interests of one to the other. If events should, unhappily, lead to that, a new situation would be created in which the whole position would have to be carefully reviewed. It is not suggested that there is likelihood of His Majesty’s Government being faced with such a dilemme. Latterly, however, cone anxiety has been caused in respect of relations between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia, owing to the evidence of widespread and continuous intrigues against the Saudi/-a. naJaart o* ■&amp;aiitfxna ob of ^naxifinavoO e^^eatsM aiH 'to • 3 A*aavJbA o.b of iaaTsJni oj ai fi %x'unt $naa ant a\j * 110 x^^jj“ laiju flic!in ibiiBv ii^iw enoxJaiai docj, ai&amp;faiwi of nao ^aiU XXa -axijia vo ul .inoi)^aiJi f&gt;&amp;f irw a to ca bu-ati ncfi ^Ttoq^jja oj belts cteewfsd xjiaomtcia l&amp;hfun osif to noiiaf eel f&amp;um taLooD-o t a&amp;9l t afaeve faaq mo'xl ^aiflda^T: a^imlileah artf bixa fei/iiG nctl ^Xiv&gt;Bai s ea n eva TaoqqJitib of vXa'iiins bsdoa^xa a a doanao xloiriw XmdSum to 8i3«tf aiid’ no anoi^aiai lo ^iiajuiaiXtfa^as ail^ Xo 1c xfi-Livi Qsoq Biil •qi/iabnaxiT: Xo eofiaaif baa no i ^in^ooai 1 ?wm rS inaiatfit &lt;yii?3iX*tfTf&gt;9 Xo hna aa^x/qalb Xo aottsunxJnco axid’ —i:'.'• Xqinco ov seif ,:o no x JaXXlonooai XXoX ail J bcia r b&amp;fq &lt;ooc 3 ti afciQ&amp;siq SnemiTevQi) a *\.tfwa (,ali aih 'io \oUoq *nf Xo aJooqea ^af .'C*ii;aiXXxi5 tvoxitiw fon ai xioixlw Xo noi^Ioc aitf ,maXdoxq b fa oovi^ ad Xonfuso MtdsrJi ibv&amp;l: ni oaii^ai s'^bS ndl Xo ^^toqqjja nwc jierif rif b'isXjjt q fimiiisan esif Xo f'Wqqjjc Xo aanoqx© oiid XXiiX ^auisi ^noranxavoO *ca;« bIjI I&gt;n« f ea xio^i*ina^ -i'^TaX ni Dooubouq ad ox ^Xe^iX auo xeeuoisqa*! 91 U Xo Xm;ooo*i no 4 ^iXxtfianeqaan ^no^Bbnsfii actonaxe iloxxiw navo eaxno^ ♦ enoi^alan Xaxo^qa nx boe^a ^ajlj rlo/rlw BbTsvo^ t fi9itXLoiXXlb atiaxit Xo aoae^axx® aiif t *iavawoil t s^lqa&amp;v; Xo t ©ax m won noiteaup adX aaob non ,near ns esit nox^aanp on Xo no ^XxmuX XmxHusH aut bos bunt ntll nsaw^sd gd ^macoxlo a Ju&amp;va XX ♦nsuid’o axiJ sno to eJ’sana^ni ait^ ^Rnxbnodws ad bluow no if mi tis wan s t fabf of bsaX , ^XiqqsUn.u t bXi;oxiB Xll^Xanso ad 0 J avnrl bloow noi^/aoq aXoxlw 9 /tX rtoxxlw ni ba^aano Xo boortllaXti ai aiaeif J&amp;sif ^ue fon ai fl •btwsivan • afittalib a iioiia xi^iw beoqi ^niad jaammavoO aiH Xo Joaqaan ni boauao n»?d ami yfaixna sn&amp;e t n»7awofi add of &amp;niwo t aifa7A ibnuC: bns aabiol-euia'i? naswfad aaotfal &amp;7 9df tama^a Bau^nfni auouaifaoo baa bsanqaabiw Xo aonadxva \tbu»&lt;iSaudi regime whicli are believed to Have been conducted, in part at least, within Trans-Jordan itself. It is the fact that the Amir has conformed all his official acts to the requests made to him in connection with the situation created by those intrigues. But there are many indications that he knew of these intrigues, even supposing that he did not encourage them, and it seems not unlikely that other persons have actively engaged in the conspiracy, and have made use of the Amir or of his name, either with or without his acquiescence, for the furtherance of subversive activities against Ibn Saud. In consequence, a difficult, and perhaps even serious, situation has threatened to develop. 10. lauch has been done already, at yo r instance, by the authorities in Trans-Jordan and Palestine to prevent these territories from being used as a base for improper activities against the 3audi regime. Effective co-operation in Trans- Jordan played an important part in the frustration of the Ibn Eifada revolt. This has been f ollowed by the exclusion of an important section of the disaffected Beni Atiya, and by the exclusion from both Palestine and Trans-Jordan of various suspects. Moreover, it is t o be hoped that the mutual recognition of the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn Saud and the proposed treaty will materially improve matters. The fact remains, however, that the existence of anti-Saudi intrigue is contrary to the wishes and the interests of His Majesty’s Government; and further, having regard to their treaty x* obligations, and in particular those embodied in Article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda, the credit of His Majesty’s Government will be at stake if such intrigues ere conducted in territory for which they are responsible. In view of the past history of Saudi Arabia, and having regard to /rab mentality, it is recognised that it is hardly to be hoped that intrigue against/e the Saudi regime in territories under hasiiimite role or influence can be completely stopped; but His Majesty’s Ooyernment consider it a definite obligation to take all measures possible to restrict this kind of activity within limits which will not constitute a threat to the stability of the Saudi regime or expose His Majesty’s Government to charges of indifference, if not of actual toleration* is of course a corollary of this policy that Ibn 3a,d should be required to maintain a correct attitude towards his Hashimite neighbours. 11. I should be glad if, taking the foregoing considerations into account, you will revise the position, with special refer ence to Trans-Jordan, in the light of all the information available, and report what further steps can, in your opinion, be taken (l) for restricting anti-3audi intrigue, and, in so far as it may be impossible to prevent it, at least for neutralising its effect; and (2) generally for promoting the establishment of better relations between Trans-Jordan andJn.ntr 3-4-33 CONFIDENTIAL.

Note dated September 193d 2. P.S. to abore, dated 23rh Subject. on THE FUTURE OF ARABIA. February 1933.6 &gt; &amp; THE FUTURE OF ARABIA* **-*** -eneral Remarks, The past history of Arabia ig that of petty warring Shaikhs, and raid ancycounter-raid of Bedouin tribes, a perpetual state of anarchy hardly conceivable elsewhere, but which has suited the conditions of Arabia well enough, and has indeed been the out come of these very conditions. Even in the time of Mohammed, and just after, Arabia was far from being united, and during the centuries which have elapsed since then has only been under one rule, and even bow by no means entirely, for a period of six years i.e.from 1925, when Bin Saud took the Hedjaz from the Hashimites, up to the present time. 2 . Arabia itself (if one draws its northern boundary from the Gulf of Akaba to Basrah) is little more than a gigantic desert, some of it fit for pasture, some of it merely sand, with scattered oasis here and there in which are some small towns, Riadh the most important containing probably not much more than 10,000 inhabitants. The country is thus definitely pastoral and primitive. Its population is unknown, but has been guessed at as from 6-8 millions, of which a large proportion is composed of wandering Bedouin tribes whose mentality, and way of life, has altered little in the past three thousand years except that they now wage their desert warfare with rifles in place of swords and lances. It has no rivers, scanty rainfall, no manufactures, sparse agriculture. here are only two towns, Mecca and Jedda, in the whole country which can oe called ’cities,’ and both depend for their existence not on commercial factors as cities do elsewhere but on the fact that the first named is a place of pilgrimage for the Moslem If the pilgrimage for any reason were to cease Mecca and J edda/ _1 &amp; &amp;&gt; - 2 - Jedda would lose their principal reason for existence. 3. The Arab himself, the peculiar inhabitant of this peculiar country, has certain good qualities, is likeable enough, and even at times attractive. But he is a convinced individualist, as one would expect from his environment. Any sort of authority is irksome tc him; the moat he will tolerate is that of his Shaikh, and even this grudgingly and generally only when it suits himself. Of anv soit combined and sustained co-operation whether for peace or war he is normally quite incapable, though occasionally influenced by religious fanaticism and under a leader of genius such as Bin Saud he can work with his fellows for a few years towards a common end. .rvaid mg — an economic necessity ? ^11 these are platitudes of course but they serve to bring the country into perspective, and while on the- subject of Arabian characteristics a. short comment may be made on the phenomenon of the gha^zu or raid whioh playa auch a pajt in life ln Arabia&gt; ^ whioh is the cause of not a little anxiety to her neighbours. These raids are of two kinds - internal and external. It has often been pointed out by writers on Arabia that the former - which are conducted under certain conventions, preventing any excess of blood shed - are in the nature of a sport, with prizes m the shape of looi^ corresponding to our western sports and games, in fr,ct practically the only sport with which the Arabian can enliven his otherwise somewhat monotonous existence. (As a side issue it may be noted that the Wahabis have of late introduced an element of savagery into these raids quite unknown before in Arabia). There is also the prestige attached to the successful raider, and the Arab lisce other folk - is by no means indifferent to the admiration of his fellowmen - and women. The further interesting point has also been a le ’ whl c 1 i is not by any means so obvious, that these raids may really fulfil an economic purpose by providing - if in a wasteful way - for the redistribution of stock between the tribes. 5./-3- 5* As for the external raids, these are made into what has been called the 'Fertile Crescent',i.e, ’Iraq, Palestine, and Syria, and follow the tradition of thousands of years that the hungry ’desert* shall fill its stomach from the well-fed ’sown’, thus also fulfilling an economic law, in fact the oldest extant: ' That he shall take who has the power, ' And he shall hold who can.' 6. Economic necessity is a sharp spur, and to the extent that raids are due to this cause, they must be considered as all the more formidable. That there are strong impulses behind the raids is shown by the fact that a fairly strict control on the part of Bin Saud, and adequate defence meaaures on the part of the authorities in 'Iraq, Palestine, and Trans-Jordan, have failed to put a stop to these incursions, even though they have been always successfully repelled. Present position of Bin Saud. 7. The position is, therefore, that for his own purposes - to weld his kingdom together - Bin Saud has laid a ban on internal raiding, and for the sake of his foreign relations - with Great Britain and France the two Powers principally concerned - has prevented to a certain extent external raiding. It is these bans which have largely contributed to his unpopularity with his of Wahabi followers, and which were for instance one/the underlying causes of the serious rebellion against him in the winter of 1929-30 by Faiaal Dawish. The Wahabi would doubtless welcome a cessation of internal bickering in return for the promise of a glorious combined first-class raid on the Fertile Crescent# But when he is forbidden to do either he is - naturally enough - dis contented and rebellious. In fact Bin Saud in being compelled, owing/-4- © %&gt; I owing to various causes, to stop railing of all sorts is - from one point of view - really sitting on the Arabian safety-valve, economical and psychological, and if this view is correct it would seem only a matter of time before the engine blows up* Arabia without Bin Saud* 8* With regard to the future of Arabia without Bin Sauds this is at least as an important a consideration ae the present of Arabia with him. In fact the real test of Bin Saud*s success will only come when he disappears from the scene, and it is proved whether he has left behind him a stable kingdom or - like so many Oriental rulers before him - merely a temporary creation which will collapse when deprived of his presence, 9. A consideration of Bin Saud’s disappearance from the A,rabian scene is of course far from being academic. He is now 55 years old, and must one day die a natural death® Or he may die an unnatural death any day - he has many enemies, or as he gets older his grip may loosen, or he may fall from power pre maturely* Recent despatches from Sir Andrew Ryan, who of course knows more about him than anybody else, indicate that his position is far from secure. (Vide Jedda despatch No«2C0 of 28th May 1931 to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). Briefly, he is trying to ride two horses, or shall we say two camels ? , at once, and is losing control of both,. he is not /iTahabi enough for the Wahabis, and yet too Wahabi for the Hedjazi. He has risen to pov/er by the support of a primitive, fanatical and warlike sect, whose principal aim in life is to loot and kill the unbeliever,i.e. any non-Wahabi, but is for various reasons - see para 7 above for instance - losing their support, while he has entirely failed - see para 12 below - to^-in the allegiance of his non-Wahabi subjects. The financial condition of his kingdom, vide for instance Jedda despatch Ni&gt;.253 of 1st July 1931 to/® (g) (*&gt; -5- tc His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, is parlous in the extreme. In fact peace in Arabia may not even depend upon the pressure of Bin Saud. Should his control on the I Hedjaz and over Hejd, the one acting on the other, weaken apprecia-J blv should in fact his position become desperate, there is always I one course which he could adopt, and which would at any rate rally t the Wahabi elements behind him: to raise his war-standard, and on some pretext or other, sweep down at the head of a host of the Faithful on ’Iraq, Syria, or Palestine. This contingency is, of course, unlikely, but not perhaps beyond the bounds of all possibility. In fact during the critical times of February and March 1928, when some ofj^iis tribes broke loose from his territory and raided ’Iraq, it seemed possible for a brief period that he might be forced by his rebellious subjects to take this hazardous step Eventualities on disappearance of Bin Saud. 10. As for the inevitable time when Bin Saud must dis appear from the scene, for one cause or another, one of three eventualities will arise:- (a) A successor will take hrs place, who will be able to control Hedjaz aad Nejd as Bin Saud is doing at present, and peace will continue. Y/ho his successor may be is doubtful. His eldest son, Amir Saud, is the Crown Prince, and Heir Apparent, but Arabs think very little of primogeniture, and cling to the older and more violent tradition of n let the best man win” provided generally that the best man belongs to the Shaikhly family. (b) The successor will be unable to control the kingdom, and keep the peace. In order to secure his position at home he will try the expedient of a war abroad, ( a tradition al policy in the East, its last exponent being Amanullah of Afghanistan, and by no means unknown in Europe until modern times), will throw his lot in with the war party - the Wahabis- 6 - &lt;$&gt;$ and wili launch atta,cks on the surrounding unbelievers, (c) No successor will appear with shoulders broad enough to carry the abba of Bin Saud, his kingdom will disintegrate, and Arabia will relapse once more into her accustomed anarchy, a feature of which will certainly be sporadic raids into the Fertile Crescent, not only by Wahabi tribes proper, but by all those who - &amp;ehabi or net - have been included in his territory and kept under his control. 11. Of these three eventualities if (a) materializes then Arabia will continue as at present and no further comments are necessary. loss bf Hed f iaz by Wahabis • 12, Unfortunately, however, it seems much more likely that either (b) or (c) or a combination of both will arise. What will happen in the Hedjaz in either event is not the immediate concern of the Indian Government, from whose point of view this Note is written,but the Wahabis will probably lose it. They only acquired it by the sword, are disliked - if not detested - by the local inhabitants, and have no roots in the country. With Nejd in ferment, and the tribes ’Up* either raiding each other, or raiding into the Fertile Crescent, it is difficult to see how -Wahabi rule can be maintained in far-away Hedjaz. As in the previous century the Wahabis, after a period of occupation of the Hedjaz, will most likely withdraw. For Bin Baud’s is not of course the first Nejdi ’raid’ into the Hedjaz. In 1802 the Wahabis took Taif and massacred the inhabitants, men, women, and children, exactly as they did a century and a quarter later in 1924-25. In 1803 they took Mecca, in 1804 Medina, and as a repetition of history it is interesting to note that certain features of their rule then, good and bad, tranquility/© $ -7- tranquility was amongst the former, are in evidence to-day. (See Lffirime^s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol.l Part 1.Historical ). Their occupation continued until 1813, i.e. about 9 years, when they were expelled by Mohammed Ali, Pasha of Egypt, acting under orders of the Sultan of Turkey. Palestine. Trans-Jordan, and Iraq. 13. As for Palestine, Trans-ffordan, and Syria, (Syria of course will likewise have difficulties, but those will be the concern of the French), under eventualities ^b) and 10) the authorities of these areas will undoubtedly have to face a serious crisis in the shape of raids and unrest. The seriousness of the crisis will lie, not in the danger of any particular raid but in the cumulative effect of the strain and expense entailed by meeting an indefinite number of such incursions spread over a prolonged period. For once the controlling hand of Bin Saud is lost, on the assumption that his successor cannot fill this place it is impossifclg to say now long it will be before another controlling authority will arise, and in the meantime raids will presumably continue. On the North Test Frontier in India where the same situation exists, only that there it is not the case of the ’desert* and the ’sown* but of the similar age-long feud between the ’mountain eer’ and the ’lowlander*, the Government of India have tackled the situaticn by a forward policy, which by the taking over of certain tribAl tracts and the building up of roads will at the same time put important strategic areas in our hands, bring the tribes more under our authority, and by the development of such resources as he possesses lead the tribesman gradually into peaceful ways. But a policy which is practicable for a settled population of mountaineers living in villages cannot obviously be applied to Bedouins scattered over huge areas of desert. 14. /- 8 - 14. It maif, however, be practicable to build posts at important wells and so deny them to raiders, and to organize the tribes of threatened areas 30 that they can assist in their own defence. Coincident with this it might be found expedient to resuscitate if possible the Shammar Amirate of Ibn Rashid at Hail - a point of considerable strategical importance in desert warfare in northern Arabia - and thus form a barrier against Wahabi incursions from the South. At one time indeed, and not so long ago, it was the Ibn Rashid and not the Bin Sahd of the day who was Aracia’s big man. In 1388, for instance, Mohammed bin Abdullah ibn Rashid captured the Wahabi capital of Riadh and took its ruler a prisonei uo Hail, under whose rule Southern as well as Northern Nejd remained for some 14 years till the taking of Riadh by the present Bin Saud in 1902. From then on up to 1914 the Turkish Administration of ’Iraq found in the rulers of Hail, even though the Shammar power had weakened, useful allies against the rising tide of Wahabism. (On the outbreak of war Ibn Rashid declared for tne Turks, but Hail was not taken by Bin Saud, and Jabal Shamiaar annexed to Nejd until 1921}. Air Route and Pipe Line. 15 * As far as Basrah the Air Route should not be affected by tribal disturbances in Arabia. With regard to the Persian Sulf Section. At the moment of writing this Note (September 1931) it ha not been settled whether the Air Route shall run along the Northern or Southern shores of the Persian Gulf. If the former the Air Route in the Persian Gulf Section will in no way be affected by events in Arabia* If the latter then the remarks in para 17 below are relevant. In view of the fact that flying boats will be used no trouble need be anticipated up to and including Bahrain, At Ras-al-Khaimah, the next halting place, however, if the Trucial Coast is infected with the general unrest consequent upon the break-down/break-down of central control in Nejd, some trouble and perhaps opposition to the continuance of the route, may be expected. The safe-guarding of the projected Pipe Line and railway from ’Iraq to the Mediterranean will be a cause of some anxiety to the autho rities concerned. It is true that the line will run well North of Arabia proper, but anarchy at the centre in Nejd will create unrest beyond the frontiers, just as a stone dropped in the middle of a pond will send ripples far and wide. Defence of ^raq. 16. For Palestine and Trans-Jordan the Government of India is in no way responsible, and Syria is under a French Mandate. If assistance is required for the defence of the two first named it will be forthcoming from areas unconnected with India - Egypt or perhaps England. Nor is the Indian Government in any way responsible for ’Iraq either now or next year when it will become an independent country. But though independent Iraq will still, under her treaty with Great Britain, have claims on the armed assistance of His Majesty’s Government in case of foreign invasion. Should whatever R.A.F.elements left in Iraq, with the ’Iraqi forces, be sufficient to repel the series of raids foreshadowed above - well and good. If, however,this should not prove the case, (and of course it is quite outside the scope of this Note to give any opinion on this point), and military assistance from outside is required, it seems obvious that the Indian Government will be appealed to as the nearest and most convenient area from which such assistance can be supplied - especially if this assistance is required in a hurry.

To take the various areas in turn* The Muscat State is remote from Hejd and has had little to do with Bin Saud, though his ancestors claimed sovereignty over it, and round about 1812 over-ran part of ^man, and succeeded in converting the Bani Bu Ali, of Jaalan, (near Sur), who remain Wahabi to this day* Probably encroachments on Baraimi, a point of some local strategical importance from which the Batineh coast of ’Oman can be threatened on one side, and the Trucial Coast on the other, may be expected. The Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, when pressed by us to do something they don’t want, have been known to throw out dark hints that they may be compelled to seek the assistance of Bin Saud, although in practice they have little to do with him. On his disappearance should some local enter prising Shaikh make himself an independent Amir of Hasa a certain amount of interference of the latter u u in Trucial coast affairs, and consequent unrest may follow, as well as in Q.atar . Bahrain being an island, will be safe from Wahabi incursions, but will doubtless suffer commercially. At present a trade of acme proportion goes on between the island and the mainland, both for the local needs of the province of Hasa, and for Nesj d - especially since Bin Saud has ’blockaded* Kuwait. With flejd and Hasa relapsed into anarchy this trade will of course decrease appreciably. On the other hand various problems connected with Bin Saud and Bahrain, and the intrigues of his agents - the tyuaaabis _ will be automatically solved. On the whole therefore in areas so far reviewed in the Persian Gulf the disappearance of Bin Saud from the A»bian scene, while causing some local unrest along/.'iLlU.' 1 n iji8ig c l on i osiiioo 1c gjsri ^nsiiiniovoi) cuaiJafll oil^ To^iBJjp sixi^ nl •VI -eii) 9fi^ xd boesoioni od IXxw rioijrfw as idilxdxenogeoi nx.eJ'ioo .nitid nx aBO-ifi ewoi'i^v 9dJ oxbj oT .t&gt;nBo nxa 1o oonBiBoqqB oX) el^diX bari e&amp;rt f)fi* Jb[,oil xcon'i ocfomoi ex o^BdS ^bosjuM oilT *tfx io vo x^ n S i9 ' I9Voe X&gt;9fii-ij*Io sio^eo dob e xi£ xf^uorid t bu&amp;% nx&amp; rtfiw ai be bee ool; e bit* 'MtniQ' Xo tfxaq iubi-iovo SI6I Xiioo« Xnnoi bn* nxarasi onw ixson j ,nitI,s«L Xo f xXA x/fi xnj»S ariX gnx^iovnoc jnxoq s t iflix«i«^ nc ednoxbofioions 'viXdBaois. . \,Bb 8inX xdsxl£V» XeBoo rlonxXBH: 9rlX rfoiriw noiX oonjsXioqmi laoisoXBiXe XbooI oxcoe Xc no XeacD XbxouiT orfX bns ^obia ©no no bonoXaoiriX ocf nao nemO* Xo » if bqQ laxoniT oxiX Xo 8iliixan£ orfT .boXoeqx© od xaci t iof(Xo sriX need svarf t Xnaw X’nob ypilt snlriJemoe cb oX eu xd bsesoiq noxiw 2 leee oX bslloqmoo od x&amp;l x.e£i3 XbiIX eXnxxl 3iisb Xi;o ^oixlX oX nf^oni oXXXxI ovaii x 9r ^^ ooxXoaiq nx rL^uoiiXIa nifl Xo oonaXeiesa oxix -isXno IbooX smoe bljjorle oonaiBaqQ aa xb 8 in nO .fitiri dc ifr pb oX niaXioo a «8jbH Xo iimA Xnobnoqobnx na Xloemin eiban ritfiaxiB s n ^ e ^* I Q Xaaoo XsxobiT ni sje io XXbI orfx Xo oonsioXioXnx Xo XnjJOflie ^ ibXb.j nx sb How sm ,woIIoX ^bxt XeoiniJ Xnex/poRnoo bn« , 81 xsiXb X nd t enoieibofii idarla^ moiX «X»t sd XI iw t bnBlsx na grixod niaiiisg: oods Xo obaiX a Jnossiq XA .^XXaxoiOfiiffioo ioIXus eBoXXcfoob XXxv, 10 X xiXod t bfii5XnxBiii oiiX bna bnalei onx fl9svXod no eoojj aoxXioqoiq- ^Xlaiooqeo - b IpK 10 X bna «j888H Xo soaivoiq oxiJ Xo 8b09n XaocX ©riX jbbbH bna b[,9^ riXiVv ♦XxewX 'bobajiooXd * ejsn b. s8 nx oonxe ssasioob oeiijoo Xo Iliw obaiJ aixlX oXni boeqalsi xlX iw boXosanoo efiioldoiq eboiiav bnaxi isxiXo 9fix nO . ,,XdBio * axiX - aXuoga eixi Xo esngiiXni 9xiX bna ,niBirUH bna bu«8 nifl sioXsiorlX eXoriw oxiJ xiO .bsvloa 9 ^ Xliw _ aidassnp Xo oonaiaaqqasxb 9iiX lluV aBieioI oxlX ni bowaivsi ijbX oe cboib ax XaoixiiJ XbooX oxiiob gniauBo alixiv.- t 9n9oe ttBlcmA odX xnoiX bxia£ nifi \s noI malong the Arabian coast, will most probably not entail any commitments or interference, on the part of the Government of India except perhaps in connection with the Air Route (see paragraph 15). The remaining area to be considered, however^ stands on a different footing. 18. Kuwait M an independent Arab State, under British protec tion, but not a British Protectorate' (see P.G.13, page 73, para- graph 2), His Majesty’s Government are pledged to protect against foreign aggression, and in time of need the actual implements of this responsibility would - if military assistance were required - most probably fall on the Indian Government. During the crisis of 1928 - already referred to in paragraph 9-3 ships of the Persian Gulf Division were stationed off Kuwait, landing parties were disembarked, a temporary air base was established on shore, and a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars from •Iraq were sent to the town. it was generally accepted that this was sufficient to defend the town from attacks by tribesmen with- .out artillery. At the same time it was pointed out by the Senior Kaval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, to the Resident that the whole of his Division was thus immobilized at Kuwait and unable to perform its duties elsewhere, and that if a garrison were required at Kuwait for an extended period this duty would best be performed by a battalion of Infantry supported by artillery or ship-guns. Under the conditions now envisaged, i.e. a collapse of Bin Baud’s kingdom and an irruption of Arabian tribes over the frontiers, first - a garrison might be required at Kuwait for a condiderable period, and second - the Royal Air Force might have their hands too full in defending ’Iraq to detail aeroplanes or cars for the defence of Kuwait. 19. In this case the defence of Kuwait would depend on the battalion of Infantry and Artillery, both presumably from India, or in/ Iin lieu of the latter ships guns, which would mean the ’tying up* of the Persian Gulf Division - or part of it - at Kuwait, when it might be needed to cope with troubles elsewhere on the Trucial coast for example. Apparently not much assistance can be expected from Shaikh Ahmad (of Kuwait) himself. During the crisis it was proposed that he should purchase armoured cars, but this idea was finally abandoned for financial reasons. He has apparently little faith in the martial qualities of his Kuwaitis* In a conversation | with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, in August 1929, and with Colonel Eiscoe in December of the same year, he pointed out that the real fighting strength ofi which Kuwait had always depended was the Mutair, Ajman, and Awazim tribes which had been taken away frcm him and given by us to Bin Saud in 1922 b* the Treaty of Ujair, In addition to this his State lias been greatly impoverished by the blockade imposed by Bin Saud for the last 8 years* This he feels all the more acutely as it was hie great uncle the famous Shaikh Mubarak who offered asylum to Bin Saud when an exile and a fugitive, who actually took the field with the Wahabi leader on a hazardous and unsuccessful venture•into Southern flejd, and to whose backing and encouragement Bin Saud*s final and successful bid for power in 1902 was not a little due. Moreover when Shaikh Ahmad succeeded to the Shaikhship in 1921 he continued Mubarak’s policy towards Bin Saud, sending that individual who was then operating against Hail (see paragraph 14 above) Rs.1,60,000 in cash and 3 f 0U0 camel loads of supplies. Much later too, only a few years ago in the winter of 1929-30, it was the refusal of the Shaikh, at our request, to allow Bin Dawish and his fellow dissidents to base themselves in Kuwait, or get supplies from it, that enabled Bin Saud to crush the rebellion. SUMMARY . Arabia a primitive and pastural country is little more than a gigantic desert (paragraphs 1-3), and its most note- worthy phenomenon, the ghazzu or raid, internal and external, maymay well be partly caused by economic necessity (paragraphs 4-6)• Bin Saud*s posit iongppears at present for various reasons far from s trong (paragraph 7), and in any case the real test of his work will ccme when he disappears from the scene (paragraph 8), That his control over Arabia must one day cease is of course obvious, and this may possibly occur before his death (paragraph 9). When he finally disappears (paragraph 10) Arabia will probably dissolve in chaos and the Wahabis will lose Hedjaz (paragraph 12), while there will be a prolonged series of raids on Palestine, Trans-Jordan and ’Iraq,(paragraph 13), against which it may be practicable to resuscitate the Shammar confederacy under the Ibn Rashids of Hail, (paragraph 14)* It is not likely that the Imperial Airways Route will be interfered with, but the protection of the projected ’Iraq- Mediterranean pipi-line and railway may cause some anxiety (para graph 15). The Indian Government may be called upon to assist in the defence of ’Iraq (paragraph 16), and more particularly of Kuwait (paragraph 18), but along the rest of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf they will probably not be involved in any new commitments (paragraph 17). September 1931. sd/- T. C. F. ***■**«•P.S. to Note, dated Sep tenter 1931, on THE FUTURE OF ARABIA. During a recent visit to Kuwait the question came up in conversation between Colonel Dickson, the Shaikh, and njyself of what effect Ifcn Saud’s death, or fall from power, would have on Kuwait. (Rumours - later proved to be unfounded - of the severe defeat of Ibn Saud*s forces in a sir were then current). The Shaikh was of opinion that in either of these events Kuwait would •come to its own 1 . The Blockade would cease, and tribes such as the Ajman and Mutair, formerly owing allegiance to Kuwait, but now under Ibn Saud, would once more turn to him (the Shaikh). Colonel Dickson agreed with these views. If this actually proves to be the case, then the remarks made in paragraph 18 of my Note of September 1931 will have to be modified. It is possible that the Sheikh, provided with money and arms by us, could look after himself and his territory, without further assistance, though doubtless some armoured cars, if available, would be very useful. The Shaikh was of opinion, with which Colonel Dickson and I heartily concurred, that on Ibn Saud’s death Arabia would probably become one vast Donnybrook Fair, the tribes raiding and counter raiding each other in the good old way. The Shaikh, however, did not think that raids would be made across the Iraq frontiers, but would be confined to tribal territory outside it. Both Colonel Dickson and I disagreed with fihis, and considered that once Ibn Saud’s contra^was removed the tribes would be unable to resist the temptation to see what loot they could raise out of Iraq, and that some raiding across the frontier at all events would take place. sd/- T.C.F.
