Amount pr ovis ionally/ allocated to India lor year commencing 1st January 1840 is 145,000 tons, but this is suuject to review at end of first quarterly rationing period referred to m paragraph 3 below. This figure is intended to include wnat might be termed 'direct' exports under followin' headings: (a) Steel Plates, Hails, Sections (all shaoes,) Ears, (including Bright Bars), and Plats; (b) Hoop and '-'trio (including Cold Hoxieu strip); ( c ) Steel'sLet® fcoatefanS’ uncoated,, (d; Tin Plates, (including Black, Tern and Silver ’i’or'fn^ P c at + 4 S ’ S S elJ - ? teels A Hoy and Special Steels, -• 'fvg, 1®’ Steel Tubes, Pipes and 1 * (.hj Sueel xiolts, i-iUls, Rivets, iJashers, Screws and ; and (i) Steel 'fire Rods, vVire and Wire Products. as has been explained in earlier correspondence stee l situation is really acute and difficulty has been experienced in * persuadin c Priority Committee to allocate any figure in excess of your original September estimate. In view of extensive cuts made in demands from other quarters it was impossible to i esist some reduction oi ligure of 168,692 tons given in your telegram of 2nd February and Hahindra, who has been fully consulted throughout, considers that it will be possible to arrange for your essential requirements to be met within allocation now adopted and that there may even be scope for restricting steel imports to a lower level. Headings under which it was thought that some reduction might be possible are (3), (^), (6), (7), (8) and (12) in your telegram No. 206 of 2nd / February. / 145,000 tons was eventually accepted by Committee on assurance being given- that ail future indents on this country for steel under headings referred to above will be carefully scrutinised. 3. Priority Couimittee have further decided to allocate a tonnage to each Department for delivery in periods of three months. First period will commence on 1st April and alter consulting Mahindra I propose, if you see no objection, to apply ior allocation of 36,000 tons for this quarter. P^Jp ly Qfl this point is requested by 1st March. Each Department will have the administration of its own quota and it will not be necessary to sub-divide blocx figure into various classes of steel. Amount of steel exported during 3 months ending 31st March will, of course, count against allocation of 145,000 tons. 4. Decision to allocate definite ^uota of steel will mean that a firm check will have to be kept on all exports to India and in order to ensure that allocation is not exceeded it will/© 2 . will, I think, bo necessary for your v’ar Supply Board to make it known to all concerned that in future no steel in the form mentioned under the headings referred to in paragraph 2 above can be obtained from this country without a recommendation issued under their authority. I am consulting blahindra in regard to terms of suggested announcement and will communicate with you on this point later. 5. Procedure for dealing with 'Indirect' exports, which I understand to mean machinery, plant and other manufactured (^oods with a steel content, is still under consideration and 1 vvirl communicate with you separately in the matter. 6.

First demand for balance of 60,000 tons of rails. The nearest section of rails which we can roll here is the B.S.(?

Rails of straight carbon or medium manganese quality v/ill be supplied as required. If this section is acceptable, we can make arrangements to supply to the following programme. In April and May ij^O, 20,000 tons at the rate of (? 10,000) tons per month. In February and March 1941, 20,000 tons at the rate of 10,000 tons per month. Total 40,000 tons.

We can supply rails to meet this at the rate of 6,000 tons monthly commencing from one month after the supply to meet the first demand has been completed, namely April, 1941. If the rate of supply to meet the second requirement is insufficient we can probably arrange to accelerate but this will require considerable adjustment and planning of industry. Our technical advisers express the view that platelaying at the rate of 5,000 tons of rails a month is as much as the Government of Iran are likely to be able to undertake. Accessories. In your telegram you give no details as to Iran’s requirements of these but from Foreign Office letter No. E.7447/211/34 of November 16th enclosed in your letter No. E.ot 0.8460/39 of November 22nd it is clear that these will be required. We shall require to be provided with detailed drawings, and specifications of the accessories required. We anticipate that we can make accessories such as points and crossings, sleepers, fish plates, bearing plates, fish bolts and nuts if these are substantially according to relevant British standard specification but we shall be able to be more definite when details and quantities of accessories have been furnished to us. With regard to prices of rails and fish plates Tata’s have given us a provisional quotation of rupees one hundred and fifty five (Rs.156) per ton and rupees two hundred and thirteen (Rs.213) per ton for rails and fish plates respectively f.o.r.

We understand from our Shipping Controller that arrangements at Bandar Shahpur are most inadequate and cases have occurred when’chips have left Bandar- Shahpur without unloading. Before we could undertake supply on behalf of the Iranian Government it will be necessary for you to conclude appropriate financial arrangements with that Government to cover cost of supplies, including all shipping charges, which will be payable in India before despatch and our departmental charges at 3 per cent, of contract value. Inclusive in our departmental charges is cost of complete inspection and testing at all stages during manufacture and before shipment by our metallurgical inspectorate. An essential condition of the transaction would be that with Tatas contracts will be on a f.o.b.

Owing however to Ministry Cx Supply's demand for rails it will he possible to release for Iran only (a) 5,814 tons belore 31st December (b) largest share of export trade during the quarter ending wlot March 1940. It is hoped this will mean a further 14,000 or 15,000 tons, but this is by no means certain. Please telegraph to what approximate extent it is likely to be possible for Indian industry to fill the gap and approximately what programme for deliveries could be achieved. An urgent answer is particularly desired. 2. Iranian Government also want a further 200&gt;,000 tons of rails but no orders have yet been placed. They v/ould like to buy out of credit offered to them by Export Credit Guarantee Department. Could you consider providing over a reasonable period any part of these rails in addition to the balance cf the orders referred to in paragraph 1. 3.

Their design and that of components used in their construction would also be controlled to some extent by the availability of materials and manufacturing resources in this country. (3) If the provision of railway construction materials comprising rails, sleepers (steel or wood) and steel bridge materials is contemplated, it is probable that the war requirements of Indian Railways will not absorb India’s full capacity for the supply and production of these items. 3* Copies of this letter and of your letter under reply are being sent to the Tehran Legation.

Dear Peel, You will remember that some months ago the Middle East Official Sub-Committee considered measures which might be taken to influence certain minor Powers in our favour on the outbreak of war. In the case of Persia the Sub-Committee did not think it necessary to do very much on the outbreak of war, but suggested that at a later stage it might be necessary to take some definite steps to please the Shah, e.g. by the supply of aircraft or railway material. Seymour has recently suggested to us that if the need arose it might be easier for the Government of India than for His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to supply certain kinds of railway material to Persia. No doubt this is so, and I pass the point on to you for your consideration.
