Most of the papers discuss ways of countering or restricting the circulation of anti-British, anti-colonial material arriving in the Persian Gulf region from elsewhere in the Arab world. The majority of the Arabic newspaper clippings is from Iraqi newspapers, and includes coverage of the Arab cause in Palestine during the approximately concurrent Arab Revolt in Palestine that took place between 1936 and 1939. Other sources of Arabic nationalist material include newspaper articles from Egypt and Syria.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Anti-colonialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Newspapers</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Propaganda, Anti-British</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008d#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008d#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
