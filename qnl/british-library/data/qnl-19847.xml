M As in 1926 —vide India Office let ter Hoe P»80i; t dated %he lith Mitf*flh 19^6—• eo at present 9 no jforeign i^ower has oonaented to the exercise of Jurisdiction over its nationals in Kuwait by His Majesty, and the Oovemment of India orders (Foreign and Political Department letter h A /'IT 810-fl # dated 86th April 1926j are that when the necessity arises steps should be taken to ascertain froia the Government of the person concerned whether they desire that the case should bs dealt with under the Order in Council* This state of affairs lias hitherto let to no inconvenience but it will in the event of the Influx of a large number of Americans into Kuwait ant ii a au neoessary, it would be as well to obtain the/-5 f\ -2- tbc formal consent of the United lit at ea Crovem- ment to the exercise of jurisdiction over its subjects in Kuwait by His Majesty. It *i 11 be seen fro» reign Office letter Mo. j;.2406/31/91, dated 11th April 1922, to the Colonial Office that the Foreign office considered this point in 1922. I haw said ^if it is necessary* 1 in the preceding paragraph because an alternatiTe much to be preferred, if it is practicable, would be the aznendioent of Section 8(1) (2) of the iOiwait utder in Ooiancil to read the sane as the corresponding section of the Bahrain Order in Council i«e. omission of the necessity for the consent of Foreign -Powers. So far as the subjects of non-jiuslim Powers are concerned the ri^it of jurisdiction ceded to His Majesty's Oowernment by the shaikh of Kuwait is no less than that ceded by the Shaikh of Bahrain, and if in Bahrain His Majesty's Govern- aent exercises such jurisdiction without the prior formal consent of #oreign .Powers it seems illogical to seek such consent in the case of Kuwait. Jfurther, it seems to m that the attempt to secure such formal consent from, say, the (Jovemment of the United States of America in regard to Kuwait would lead that OoTemment to question the right of His Majesty's GoTernment to act without it in the case of Bahrain. Section 6(2) of the draft Bahrain order in Council drawn up by the QoYemment of India in 1911 contained a restriction similar to that con* tained in Section 8(1) (2) of the present Kuwait Order/mmQ m Order In Counsil. Tlw /oreign office however held /' in 1912 (Foreign office letter dated 12th March /&gt; v 1912 to the India Office) that the aection me unneoeeearily elaborate # that our right of Juris- dietion over foreigners was ciained under grant from the shaikh and not under agreeiaent with other Foreign Oovem»entB concerned and euggeeted the foria which was e-w ntuttlly aaopted i.e. ignoring the naceeeity for the ooneent of foreign i^were 'i 'T i ,'5 &gt;/ in a personal letter dated 26th iioveinber 1912 # Colonel Trevor pointed out to tiir x%rcy Cox the objection that a iroreign i^ewer night aake to this assumption of Jurisdiction toy His Majesty^ Government but the point does not seem to have been pursued further. The war intervened eoid the inWo- duotion of the Order in Council was delayed for many years. In 1922 the foreign office had the same set of facts bef©re{th€ia as in 1912 but drew the opposite conclusion, it is a decade later now, and perhaps too late ever to go baeJc to the outlooJc oi I912 9 but if it can be done it would save a deal of trouble not only in regard to Ituwait but pro bably also in regard to Bahrain.A T Conf i denti al.

(0 2 # Sub-para (2) of Section 8 on page 4 of the K Kuwait Order-in-Council 1925 should be cancelled, and substituted by another sub-para, )which should read as follows:- 8 .(2). Foreigners. (a) Subjects and protected persons of all Moslem Powers with respect to whom the Shaikh of Kuwait and any Moslem State, King^ Chief or Government, whose subjects, or under whose protection they are, have agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdic tion by His Majesty, (b) Subjects and protected persons of all Non-Moslem Foreign Powers, with respect to whom the Shaikh has con sented and agreed to theto the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. 3. The reason why I have introduced amendment (a) above is firstly in order to camouflage our intention as given in (b) and secondly in order to give confidence to the Shaikh. It is not in the least likely that the Shaikh of Kuwait will ever voluntarily surrender the existing jurisdiction that he possesses over Moslems in his State, however much a Moslem Foreigi Power might request him to do so. The paragraph indeed strengthens his hand, for it will successfully prevent His Majesty King Bin Saud, the . ersian Oovemment,(and to a lesser extent IRAQ,^ who each claim several thousands of subjects in Kuwait, from trying to 'get at w the Shaikh of Kuwait by asking His Majesty's Government to look after their 'nati onals rt residing in Kuwait, as they might very easily do. 4© I greatly regret that owing to great pressure of work during the last month and a half, I have not been able to reply to your above quoted letter earlier.

Yours sincerely, J- Q. LAITHWAITE. Government of Inuia. *l/rto (I 6 ^ Draft Ku77ait Order in Council.1934 , The following points in regard to the New Order in Council may be noted for purposes of record:- Articles inser ted on lines of Ethiopia Order in Council 1934, etc, (a) Article 18 corresponds to Art. 56 of Ethiopia order (Art. 55 in extracts from draft Ethiopia order enclosed in secretary of State's express letter of 35th December, 1933 to Government of India No.P.Z.7949/33), (b) Art. 19 corresponds to Art 57 of Ethiopia Order (Art.56 of extracts). Arts. 18 and 19 are in substitution for Art. 17 of the government of India's draft which has been deleted, (c) Art. 32 corresponds to Art. 30 (1) (2) (3) of Ethiopia Order. (d) Art. 33 which corresponds to Art. 33 of the Ethiopia Order has been transposed from Art. 73 of the Goveuiment of India 1 s ciraft with which it is identical. (e) Art. 45 corresponds to Art. 87 of the Ethiopia Order (Art. 83 of extracts), (f) Art. 46 corresponds to Art. 89 of the Ethiopia Order (Art. 85 of extracts), !g) Art. 47 corresponds to Art. 90 of the Ethiopia Order (Art, 86 of extracts.) (h) Art, 50 nas been transposed from Art. 72 of the Government of India f s draft with which it is identical. 2. A definition of !, British protected person' 1 has been added in Art. 4. 3. In Art. 11 (1) the reference to Treaties has been deleted because provisions necessary to implement Treaties should be made by xCin^'s Regulations, (cf. deletion of Art, 31 of Government of India's draft already agreed to). { — Art/4. Art. 12 has iDeen suitably redrafted. 5. The reference to a 'Court in England' has been deleted in Art # 27 (4) (Art. 25 (4) of Government of India 1 s draft). 6* Part V of the Order relative to 'Mixed Cases' has been revised throughout to make it accord with Art. 8 (1) (ii) in its new form in conjunction with the new definition of 'Kuwait subject' in Art. 4. (cf. demi-official letter to Foreign Office of 5th March 1934, No. P.2,1528/54), 7. Art. 77 (2) (Art. 70 (3) of Government of Indian draft). The fees, penalties, fines, and forfeitures levied under the Order are no longer confined to British subjects. (cf. Art. 74 rArt .60 of Goveusament of India's draft/)CI QN7ID UTIAL, Note of a conversation between Colonel Fowle and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, Ruler of Kuwait, on 18th of July, 1934 at which Major Watts, Political Agent, Kuwait, was present: on the subject of the Shaikh's attitude towards Jurisdiction over foreigners* /hlle passing through Kuwait on leave on my way to catch the Westbound Airways' machine at Basra, I took the opportunity to do a 'holiday task n ,(I had already handed over to Colonel Loch) by having a conversation with Shaikh Ahmad on various subjects - the above amongst others. I found the Shaikh looking rather puffy and Dr.Greenway informs me that he has given up the unequal struggle against corpulence: some years ago he was 16 Stone but by severe dieting reduced himself to 12. 2o The Shaikh was amiable as usual. I touched on the Mylrea Case. This case is now more or less closed, and was reported by Major Watts to Colonel Loch and myself verbally in Bushire. Major Watts is following this up with a written report. My object therefore was not to exhume the case but (a) to impress on His Excellency that matters connected with British Subjects should be referred to the Political Agent before action is taken by him; (b) to ascertain indirectly, in connection with the new Order-in-Council, what the Shaikh's attitude would be towards handing over jurisdiction of non-Moslem foreigners to us. *- 0 /ith regard to (a). i pointed out that since Dr.Mylrea was a British subject, though employed by the American Mission, it would have been more correct for His Excellency/'7/0 His Excellency to have brought his complaint against Dr. Mylrea in the first instance to the Political Agent, instead of making it direct, without notifying Major Watts, to the headquarters of the Mission in America: the course His Excellency had actually adopted. The Shaikh frankly acknowledged that his action had been incorrect. 4. With regard to (b). In order to test the Shaikh's attitude I went on, purposely somewhat vaguely, to ask what he would do if at any time he had cause of complaint against individual foreigners, French, German, American etc., within his territory. He replied that he had nothing to do with French, German etc. , Governments and would refer the case to the Political Agent. This satisfactory attitude indicates either (i) that he - the Shaikh - is under the impression that non-Moslem foreigners are under our jurisdiction not his or (ii) that even if he regards them as under his jurisdiction he is quite willing to transfer this responsibility on to us. 5. If (i) is the case then when we submit the new Order-in-Council to the Shaikh, presumably he will be made aware of the fact that non-Moslem foreigners are at present not under our jurisdiction. However, we are bringing in the new Order-in-Council not so much vis a' vis the Shaikh as vis A vis foreign Governments, and presumably from (ii) we can deduce that his attitude should not be obstructive. Lieut.-Colonel.lAl Confidential, *0,7i8 -S of 1934. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General| Bushire, the 26th July 1934 • To The Political A^ent, Kuwait* o/o sir, I have the honour to refer to the Secretary of State for India's telcgrcja No. 1009, dated the 30th April 1934, regarding the Kuwait Order in Council 9 and to request you to take the matter up with His j^xcellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al- Jabir as-Sabah as soon as possible. 2« I would suggest that, if you see no local objection and subject to anything v /hich may have been arranged with Colonel Fowle, you should first broach the matter verbally with His excellency Shaikh Ahmad and explain to him that the new Order in Council is substantially the same as the old one, but has a few verbal amendments and has been brought up to date in the matter of, for example, aircraft. The changes might, if you think fit, be shown to him by a comparison of the old and new Order in Council appropriately marked. You • might also refer to the correspondence of 1926 (ending with 1^1 hi6 ^ d ^ er 3rci November 1926) and explain the changes in the definitions of Kuwait subject and British subject* 3 • In view of the terms of the 1926 correspondence and of his attitude in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners in his conversation with Colonel Fowle on the 18th July (at vhich you were present), it se^ms improbable that His iixcellency will raise any objection to the changes in the # definitions/ • |-2- definitions of Kuwait euoject and British subject, but should he appear doubtful you should impress upon him the danger of the present position when it might be possible for a non -Moslem Foreign Government to claim that neither he (the Shaikh) nor His Lxajesty's Government had jurisdiction over their nationals* 4. If His islxcellency accepts the revised Order in Council| you should arrange for a formal exchange of letters between you and him. A draft letter from you to the Shaikh is enclosed to be used unless| after your conversations with the Shaikh, you consider that a modification of the terms is desirable. I have the honour it be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. /i 9 ' Lieut••Colonel, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Draft Letter .

(4) Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 20, the Political Resident upon the receipt of such report, may make an order under sub-Article (1) of this Article, or may direct that the sentence shall continue to be served at the place where the prisoner is at present detained. 20. —(1) Where an offender convicted before any Court under this Order is sentenced to imprisonment, and the Political Resident proceeding under section 7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, authority in that behalf being hereby given to him, considers it expedient that the sentence should be carried into effect elsewhere than within the limits of this Order, and the offender is accordingly sent for imprisonment to a place outside the limits of this Order, the place shall be either a place in the Presidency of Bombay, or a place in some other part of His Majesty's dominions, the'Govern ment whereof consents that offenders may be sent thither under this Article, or a place in which by treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means His Majesty has jurisdiction, provided that if a person is not a British subject he shall only be sent under this Article to a place in His Majesty's dominions. (2) A warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resident shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up at the place named according to the warrant. 21. — (1) In cases of murder or culpable homicide, if either the death or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death happened in Kuwait, a Court acting under this Order shall have the like jurisdiction over any person to whom this Order applies who is charged either as a principal offender or as an abettor as if both such criminal act and the death had happened in Kuwait. (2) In the case of any offence committed on the high seas or within the Admiralty jurisdiction by any person who at the time of committing such offence was on board a British ship, or by any11 British subject on board a foreign ship to which he did not belong, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Order, have juris diction over such person as if the offence had been committed within its jurisdiction.

It seems preferable that any explanations required should be given either verbally or in a separate communication, which might mention: (a) General necessity of revised Ordera-in-Council, covering aircraft etc. (b) That so far as the Shaikh is concerned he is merely renewing his consent of 1926 and that non-British subjects of non-Moslem States are, as before, exempt from the jurisdiction of H.M.G. (c)The danger of leaving matters in the present state whereby non-Moslem Foreign Governments may maintain that neither H.M.G. nor the Shaikh have jurisdiction over their nationals.
