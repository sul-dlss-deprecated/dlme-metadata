Note the men holding and shooting arrows from their bows as the main female protagonist raises her arms in alarm and protest.\r\n\r\nThe \"Akbarnama\" is written in Persian, the official language of the Mughal court, and is divided into three volumes. The first two volumes describe Akbar’s genealogy and record royal events, as depicted here. The third volume contains geographic and ethnographic descriptions of India as well as a wealth of information on such subjects as the Mughal government, the royal workshops, and Hindu philosophy. Abu’l Fazl is known to have read sections of the biography aloud to Akbar for final approval.\r\n", "CreditLine": "Gift of John and Berthe Ford, 2001", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/32482", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Mughal; Persian; Illumination; Illustration; Manuscript; Miniature; Painting; India", "Provenance": "Fine Indian and Persian Miniatures Sale, Sotheby's, New York, March 25, 1987, lot 185; John and Berthe Ford, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 2001, by gift.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak (1551-1602)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.874_Back_UK.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.874_Back_UK.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.874_Back_UK.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.874_Back_UK.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.874_Back_UK.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689", "ExhibIDs": "2071", "Images": "ARG_W.874_Back_UK.jpg, ARG_W.874_Fnt_UK.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
