Shaikh Chassib, who was due to pass through Khorramshahr on the 16th en route to Tehran, failed to arrive, after some days it was learnt that the Iraqi authorities, fearing he would get up to mischief if allowed to pass through Khuzistan, had refused to grant him an exit permit from Iraq except via the Baghdad Khanikin route, a week later news was received that both he and his brother Abdullah had been arrested and sent under Iraqi escort to Amara. There was some initial comment, but on tne wnole there has been surprisingly little reactions to the news. SECURITY. 347. There has been an increase in the number of petty thefts reported, ^ This is however probably due to an influx of ^rabs from the Upper Karun, and other sources, for the date season. 348. The new Frontier Commissiansit teas drawn up a scheme for the reestablishment of certain old frontier posts by means of which he hopes to gain kxhIkxk^ control over the smugglers and tribal gangs who have almost free passage to and from Iraq.

Unfortunately both ha and Sheikh Barraq of the ^awiyah tribe, who was also visiting Khorramshahr, were summoned to .ihwaz under gendarmerie ^scort on the 16th. The reason for this sudden summons to rihwaz is not known, but it is thought to be to get thorn out of the way during Cnassib/thu period when oheiKh/bin nhazsl was expected to p-ss tnr-■ugh hho r r -amshahr. 333.

Before their arrival a typed notice in Arabic, signed by Brigadier Homayuni, was posted in the town calling on Arabs of the Muh&amp;issun, the Dries and the Ras^ar tribes of Khorram- ehahr and Abadan Island to surrender their arras within a week's tine. The notice promised various concessions in the form of distribution of wheat and monopoly goods after the arms had been surrendered and threatened punishment for failure to do so. *?epsje_^ ~tw ^ ^ r-^ P'' to-C similarly, s i a* V* -4* c• 2 • ^icilarly, a ftw da** later, another t^^ed notice in Persian was Issued asking citizens of Kho rr smash ah r to surrender all kinds of sms, licensed or otherwise, against printed receipts* On the 25th January Brigadier Honeyuni arrived by plane fro© Ahwaz and landed at an improvised airfield near the Pol-i- Kou vhere arrangements had been made for him to receive the Khorrarashahr Sheikhs. During the course of this interview, ‘which took place immediately after his arrival, he is stated to have praised the loyalty of the Arabs and asked them to surrender all arms at once in order to establish peace and order in the area* He apparently stated that security in this area would soon be handed over to Hie Persian Amyj that he had been v informed by the British authorities that the Ara-bs in this area are holding approximately 3000 modem weapons and advised them not to deceive him as well as deceive themselves in surrendering old and obsolete rifles* He further told then that their fears ' regarding possible attacks from the Iraq side were fully appreciated and that the Government would make arrangements to protect them* Even before this meeting a few arms had been surrendered* Ehelkh Abbas bin lultan, chief of the Al-Bufarh&amp;n sub-tribe of the Muhalss&amp;n, who lives at Eehr Yousuf situated on the Jraqo- Persian border, was the first to collect 40 rifles from his men and deliver them to the Persian Array. As the tine passed, more sreapons poured in, brought by Individual Arabs, by village head men and by leading sheikha, it is estimated that more than 300 rifles have so far been surrendered* Brigadier Homey uni, when he visited the j ol-i-iiou, expressed his satisfaction at the progress of disarmament but is said to have emphasised that efforts should be made to persuade the Arabs to give up new arms as well as old* i The fifles so far surrendered are all old and obsolete* In not a single instance has any new rifle been delivered. Lieut*-Colonel Lalf believes that the Arabs do hold such weapons but are concealing tnem. The Arabs on the other hand argue that wn&amp;tevcr they have in their possession they are surrendering aiid that if they had any good rifles in the past they sold them in Kuwait, Iraq and elsewhere* 3o. Area . Lieut.-Colonel Saif held a meeting of the Dries and Lassar Sheikhs on the 29th January. Colonel Daulatshehi was also present. He informed the Bheikhs about the Government decision to disarm tribes with a view to establish security in the Island and asked them to surrender their anas at once, weather permitting, to his representative who would be sent to a central place in the Island. Later Li^ut.-Colonel baif stationed one officer and 12 men at Khosroabad for the purpose, though it is understood that he is not bringing any great pressure on these Arabs since the countryside is still a virtual swamp due to heavy rains and is impassable* He also hopes to be able to post a small detach ment at Guaba which has always been a hotbed of intrigue, and from where a number of piracies have been carried out on sailing boats in the Bhatt-al-Arab* These have particularly atfected Kuwaiti boats and have been the subject of a separate despatch. . . 36. 1)1 sannament in ^hadjgan * It is stated that two battalions of the pahlavi e^riment arrived in bh&amp;dgan from Ahwaz on the 23rd under the command of Lieut*-Colonel L&amp;hai and started to disarmdl*»*nn th% ia'ab* Ko daUilr. are &gt;tt to hand but it i* under stood that the Ka’sb are voluritaril^ handing over their eme. Nonetheless there art complaint* that the soldiers arc using undue pressure to extrect modern rifles which the Arabs claim they no longer possess. In August 1941 vfcen the Persian garrison retreated towards Sfeadgan, the BCa'ab got possession of a mnber of good riflss from the Persian soldiers, the Na’ab adnit this but state they sold thee* in Kuwait and elsewhere, 37. The Governor of khorrouchahr has issued a circular to all village headmen asking them to inform him if they have any complaints against any of the Persian officials in his juris diction, The Arabs do not attach much importance to this circular sincef they think| even if they were to make any such complaint, firstly it will provoke the eraity of the official concerned and secondly, as usual, nothing will corns of it. 38. On the night of the 17th two gendarmes patrolling the northern side of the town were attacked by 8 negro-Americans, badly beaten, and robbed of their riflss. One of the gt-mannes was removed to the American Hospital on the following day for tre&amp;tnent. It w^a stated to the Gendarmerie by the American ^ilitaiy Police that 4 negroes ere deserters from the American Array and that one of them known as rt Jack' has been court- oartialled and sentenced to death for certain crimes. The American authorities procniced to make investigation* and expressed regret for the incident. The Chief of Gendarmerie, who was very bitter, telegraphed Tehran and Ahwaz Informing them of the incident and asking for permission to fire or Alldfd soldiers in such cases. 39. On the night of the 24th an armed g&amp;ng of Arabs attempted to loot one of the waggons at Durbund but were apprehended and fired on by the military Police. It is stated that at least 12 men were killed, including two negro-Americana who were a party to the gang. Bazaar gossip stated that the rtid was planned end executed in conjunction with certain negroee of the American Array who had information about the movement of the waggon and its contents, 40. The Deputy Governor of Khorremshahr (the Governor is ill in the Anglo-1 ranian Oil CompanyU hospital) has published a notice informing the people of Ahorramshahr of the new security fence around the British military camp and asking them to use the main road, LQ^abixm* 41.

Low quality flour is still freely used, making the bread inedible. 42. Three bellams bringing big consignments of wheat and potatoes etc. from ahwaz were sunk near the * arun Pontoon Bridge on the 24th, The merchant concerned complains that the accident was caused by lack of proper care in controlling traffic when the bridge is opened. 43. The Khorramshahr Municipality has again published the Profiteers’ Law for the information of shopkeepers. 44. It is stated that a number of &lt;• erslan pilgrims, who illegally crossed over to Iraq territory, were delivered to the Persian Police in KJiorramahahr by the Iraqi authorities. 46. At the end of the month of .. oharram the Iraqi Consulate stopped Issuing visas to Persian pilgrims; the flow of pilgrims into knorramshahr from upeountry still continued however, and the Consul on his own authority Issued visas to a number of others in order to enable them to be present at the Art a' ten Ceremony (40th da^ of Hussain’s martyrdom) at Kerbala. It is stated that the total number of visas issued so far (including those during the month of Moharram) is about 300. 46. The Director of Customs, Khorrsraehahr, has announced that in future all persons intending to leave for Iraq on pilgrimage must deposit with the Police ID 40 for eaeha'dult and ID 2C for each child and produce the receipts at the frontier Customs Posts otherwise they would be turned back to the town and legal action taken against them. * 1 2 3 4 KhbATlQhb. 47.

It is stated that the committee was unanimous in its findings which were that the charges laid by certain persons against the Military Governor were untrue and baseless and that the public was fully satisfied with him. 48. Mr. Israel llnaeh who introduced himself as a representa tive of the Jewish Council in Iran arrived in Khorramshahr on the 23rd and called at the Consulate on the 24 th asking for facilities to show a film displaying Jewish development in Palestine and for permission to borrow ths Public delations Bureau cinema van for this purpose. Since •....blnee Khorrimifihahr is a pradominantiy Arab district and tha cinema van * 8 * in any east In Ah*az t pemission 'was refused* It is understood that he then approached the American nmy who borrowed a Russian Amy film projector and gave him official permission to show the film in their camp, permitting him to invite Jewish residents from the town and Palestinian employees of the Anglo-lr&amp;nian Oil Company 5 owing to lack of transport only a few of the latter were able to attend* Mr* Xlnaeh stated that he n&amp;d been lent the Public Relations Bureau’s projector in Buahire. 49* The period under review is conspicuous for rumours f tended to be pro-Russian, spread in Khorrsmshahr and Abadan* For instance it was saidt (a) that the Russians have occupied Tehrati| (b) that the Russians have occupied Rashtj (c) that in consequence of trouble in Tehran the Russian authorities deported oyed Zia (Deputy from Yezd) to Rashtj (d) that due to disorder in Tehran the Shah has left for Isfahan* Some of the rumours were taken seriously even in educated circles and tnere was some anxiety about the actual state of affairs in Tehran* It is firmly believed in Persian official quarters tn&amp;t certain members of the Tudeh Party (now probably working underground) are responsible for such rumours} it is also suggested tn&amp;t Russian drivers, who came in large numbers to the town during the fortnight under report, were also to be blamed* At any rate whatever might have been the cause of this propaganda, it was done in an organised and systematic manner andsligfatly affected the markets. 60. The news of the strike at the Ahwes Spinning Factory (Sherkat-i-Reesindgl-e-Ahwaz) was widely discussed among merchants and landlords* It was asserted that communistic elements in Ahwaz were responsible for instigating it. Though the Tudeh Party has not come to the fore after its suppression by the Reralsa authorities in Abadan last summer, it is strongly believed that some of its members regularly meet in secret in Abadan as well as in Khorram&amp;h&amp;hr and that a number of Persian employees from different depart ments, the Customs and Finance mostly, have strengthened their ranks* bD.

In the meantime the Iraqi Consulate received permission from Baghdad to issue visas for four days, i.e. from 11th to 14th. Most of the pilgrims availed themselves of this opportunity to obtain visas but before the majority of them could get into Iraq, the Persian Health authorities received information that bubonic plague had broken out in toiara and closed the frontier.

The detachments stationed in Abadan Island were withdrawn and the Persian troops departed from the Pol-i-Nou area for Ahwaz on the 19th. Similarly the Persian column at Shadgan, having completed its tiask, left on or about the same time. The following totals of arms are said to have been surrendered; Khorramshahr area (the Muhaissan tribe) 400 Abadan Island (the Dries and the Nassar tribe) 1000 Shadgan area (the Ka’ab tribe) ••••• 850 Almost all the arms delivered are of obsolete e number of sporting guns (double an d single later returned to owners under licence.

Finally the campaign concluded by the Persians taking written under*- takings from all the sheikhs and headmen to the effect that if at a subsequent date any additional ?ms were found they should be surrendered. As reported in previous Diaries, the Arabs fear that disarmament will expose them to raids from the other side of the ; Shatt-al-Arab. iheir fears and anxieties were shared by Lieut.- Colonel Baif and other responsible officials who recommended to Tehran that afeer disarmament a number of arms should be placed at the disposal of reliable sheikhs and headmen for self-defence. But it appears now that the idea was not approved by Tehran and, i 1 for the time being at least, no arms will be distributed. Particular emphasis was laid on the surrender of Brno rifles which were believed to have fallen into Arab hands in August 1941, but a few were recovered, and it was claimed that they had long ago been sold to Iraq and Kuwait. On the whole tne campaign appears to have been conducted reasonably well, and though there were a faw complaints of high handedness, in general pains vkere taken to recover arms by I persuasion rather than by force. Lieut.-Colonel Baif, who was in charge ot operations in Khorramsha)ir nas gained a reputation for reasonableness. Lieut.-Col. La if claims to have received instructions from the higher authorities that he should take direct control of all tribal affairs in the area, cutting out the civil authority almost entirely; the Governor on the other nand denies having received any such instructions and claims that control tribal affairs will continue in his charge as before. It is probable that tne Governor is right but either way it appears that we are about to enter upon another period of bickering between military and civil authorities. FOODSTUFF 82. No change is reported in prices. Ghee is still scarce. The condition of bread remains as before. Bakers use low grade flour and the bread is almost inedible. The Governor again received complaints from the public and called upon bakers for ari explanation. The bakers blame the Yab Company for not cleaning the wheat before milling it, while the Company throws the responsibility on the bakers for bringing wheat mixed with gravel, thus making it impossible for the Company 1 * machine to clean it. 83.

The construction of the Karun embankment, from the I.W.T. to the Customs, unde^t^ken in January last, is now making progress and it is expected that \ will be completed in a month. 86. The Municipality has decided to undertake the metalling and asphalting of the town's main streets under its own super vision. The Municipal road-roller, retrieved from the British Military in 1943 and since lying unrepaired, is now being over hauled by the Americans, As soon as it is received work will commence. At present the town's lanes are in a most miserable state, particularly during rainy weather when they become impassable. The municipality has giv«*n e contract to Mirsa Jalal Mowaggar for asphalting the lanes at the cost of the residents of each lane. An 'open-drainage' system, to be emptied into the Karun, will be introduced in place of present soakage pits in individual houses. 87. It was decided in principle, at a tneeting of the Yab Company's directors on 6th February-, at which the Governor- General wss also present, that since the Company claims to be running at a loss, its rate should be increased provided the accounts are first examined by a Committee consisting of the representative of the Governor, the Municipality and the Company. This Committee never sat and hence no steps have yet been taken . to increase the rates. In consequence the Yat Companv have served notice on the Municipality (21st February) informing them that if no decision is taken the Company will cease to function at the end of the current Persian month. (21st March). ) It may be true that the Company is running et e loss, but the notice probably was a bluff in order to goad the persons concerned to action. The root of the whole affair is said to be tne differences between some of the directors of the Company, and one or two of the Municipal Commissioners who allege, perhaps from nersonal motives, that the Comnany's main ten ence exnenses are more than reasonable and that the whole organisation could be operated at a much lower cost.

Vihy should not the A.I.O.C. treat the labourers in the same way as the Europeans are treated? They have every facility while in comparison the labourers have none.

They re-opened the ballot-box and counted the remaining votes. The following is the result of the counting 1 1. J&amp;lal Mohsen Movacar 2 . Haji Ali Faisali ' 3. Abul Aziz Kaji Matook Fazeli 4. Abdul Razak Shaikh Jaber Khan Ka’abi 5. Abdul Hamid Sharifi 6 . Haji Sayed Mohamed Ali Moustowfi. A complaint against the following - 1. Jalai Movaqar 2. Hali Ali Faisali 3. Abdul Razak Ka*abi - was submitted to the Supervisory Board (which started to function on the 11th in accordance with Article No.44 of the Law Governing the City and Provincial Councils Elections) on the grounds that as the above-mentioned people are unable to read and write Persian, they cannot be elected. This is in accordance with Article No.9 of the Law. This complaint was signed by some self-interested persons who are known to be members of the Tudeh Party. The Supervisory Board inserted this complaint in the proces verbal of the elections and left it to the City Council for a decision when it starts functioning. 147. The floods in Iraq have spread southwards across the desert from Amara and are at present threatening the tdwn of Khorramshahr. Thousands of coolies, working under the supervision of Angio-Iranian Oil Company engineers, and with large quantities of A.I.O.C, equipment and material, have raised a protective embankment round the town, in a rough semi-circle stretching from Khumba (on the Karun River) to the Sentab Jetties (on the Shatt-al-Arab). In spite of these measures however the danger to the town is not over as the water- 5 - MiSCELLAi&amp;IOUS (continued) * 4c csS) water has been steadily rising, and at some placesJ^as nearly reached the level of the embankment; the overflow which will result from any further rise in the water level is likely to create a breach which it may not be possible to repair owing to the tremendous weight and volume of water now being held up. The situation has been aggravated by the exceptionally high tides now prevailing in the Karun River which cannot drain the waters from Iraq. Should the town of Khorramshahr come to be flooded, the waters which flow over into the Karun are likely to cause that river to flood the Island of Abadan. So real is the latter danger thought to be, that the A.I.Q.C. Refinery, aerodrome runway, American air base, and other important installations in Abadan have been protected with embank ments . • 148. Reference paragraph 82 of Diary No.4. Instructions have now been received to the effect that the water filtration and pumping plant should be left for the use of the town of Khorramshahr against a payment of Rials 300,000 - the original price. Argument^ between the representatives of the Y.A.B. Company and the townsfolk is going on as to whether the plant should be under the control'of the Y.A.B. Company or a board elected by the inhabitants. The decision for the time being is, that the Y.A.B. Company will pay the cost pending the final decision. (SGD•) V.W.D.WILLOUGHBY.

The Abadan and Khorramshahr tribal chieftains at a meeting on the night of ll/ 12 th unanimously decided to form a Tribal Union as a protection against outside influences, and to counter the Tudeh Party which is canvassing amongst the Arabs for members. The chiefs fear that the Tudeh Party who have been vilifying and dictating to Government officials might poison the minds of ignorant Arabs irretrievably. The Tudeh Party has consequently become extremely apprehensive of Arab intentions and are making propaganda to the effect that this movement is sponsored by the British who are smuggling in arms and ammunition. PARTY POLITICO 167. Reference paragraph 166. The Arabs officially inaugurated their Union on the 23rd and under the advice of Aghai Mateen, the Governor of Khorramshalir, agreed to call it 'The Khuzistan Farmers* Union” in spite of strong opposition within their own ranks. The purpose of changing the name from 'The Arab Tribal Union” to that mentioned above, was to avoid any misunderstanding about the word 'tribal” which has a Pan-Arab flavour. The inauguration ceremony was well organised and all the speeches v/ere pro- Government. The Iranian Military and Police officials of Khorramshahr and Abadan, as well as all the tribal chief tains of this area, and iirabs numbering about 3000-4000 attended the celebration, with the exception of the following Khorramshahr pro-Iudeh merchants who fea blame the British for this 'disturbing movement' as they call it: 1) Ismail Navidi 2) Haji Mohamed Peryrow 3) Haji Salem Salemi 4) Mahmood Tammai, the lawyer. These four ueople have also spread the rumour that the AIOC have paid a sum of £2000 to the Arab chieftains^ towards the expenses incurred in the formation of this organisation. 168. The official opening of the Khorramshahr Tudeh Party Club premises took place on the evening of the 28th. It was attended by a crowd of about 1000 comprising labourers, the merchants mentioned in paragraph 167, and a few pro- Iudeh Arabs under the leadership of Hassan and Abdulla, sons of Helayel. Aghai Hussein Tarbiyat cor^iiienced by explaining to the audience that as the result of their united front they were able to combat the influence of the foreign imperialistic powers. Aghai Nataki, speaking next, confirmed the observations of Aghai Hussein Tarbiyat by citing evidential facts. The third speaker was Aghai Makki Rabe*e who, speaking in Arabic, conjured the farmers not to be deceived by their chieftains who are living in luxury at their expense. Aghai Manbari, the last speaker, gave a short account of the life of the guest of honour, Hussein Tarbiyat, a nd said that they should all try and emulate him.

Tudeh road pickets and **6Treet Guards 11 were posted at strategic points in Abadan and Khorramshahr during the course of the day, and the British Staff in Abadan were submitted to the most humiliating indignities. Martial Law was declared at noon, but in spite of this, large meetings were held in the evening, after which the Tudeh mob got entirely out of hand. They attacked and burnt the Arab Union Headquarters, killing one of the most respected Arab Shaikh contractors in Abadan.

The Tudeh party has remained outwardly quiet during the period under report f though It wap thought that the removal early In the month of Colonel Hejasl and Major Fateh from Khuzlstan would be the signal for a renewal of Tuddh activities' In this area. Secret meetings and 'pep” talks continue to be held mainly with a view to keeping up the morale of the workers. Members are con tinually badgered to pay their subscriptions and the usual scyrl- lous anti-British and anti-011 Company sentiments are expressed. The party sent a telegram to their Headquarters In Tehran deploring the present lull in their activities and stating that they are unable to endure any longer the ^oppression* 9 by the Oil Company and local officials. They received a reply, however 9 cautioning them to do nothing for the present. Early in the month 9 some eonfualon was caused In the ranks of the Tudeh when they heard a Speech broadcast from Tehran by All Qmeed 9 one of their former leaders In Abadan. In which he announced his allegiance to the Prime Minister^ Democrat Party 9 which he now considered to be the only true party In Iran. 234. Some doubt la reported to have arlselL locally regarding the ultimate destination and use to which funds collected by the Party leaders are put. For instanee 9 a cheque for Rials 96 9 846/- was sent by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company to the United Council of Labourers and Tollers of Abadan for disbursement to the Council's workers who had worked on the anti-flood operations In May and June. The cheque was signed for on behalf of the Council by Aghai ttosleh.

On the 13th October, Colonel Azmoudeh f labile Prosecutor of the extraordinary Military Tribunal In Abadani issued orders for the arrest of lieutenant Colonel Leall. Chief of Police, on charges of having facilitated the commission of offences during the riots of 14th/L5th July. His arrest was followed the next day by that of his deputy, Major Daul&amp;tshahi, on similar charges. Both officers ware subsequently sent to Tehran where it is said the cases are to be heard before a special court which deals with officials. As a result of these arrests a strong protest was mad© by the Governor General to the Prime Minister, and the Chief of the General Staff telegraphed to Colonel Azmoudeh, expressing his displeasure at the arrests taking place in the actual area for which these officials were responsible. 240. These arrests, together with the lack of sufficient numbers Of police in Abadan, have been the main cause of a general deterlo*- - ration of security on Abadan Island, from where reports of incidents which Include armed robbery, knife attacks on British employees, # and the firing of shots in the A.I.C.C. Refinery area hive been received. The Company have represented the matter to the , &gt;1 Governor General at Ahwas and have asked for the police force in Abadan to be brought up to a strength compatible with their res ponsibilities. mum 241* Colonel Javanshir, the recently appointed Military Governor of Abadan, wasaialtted into hospital during the month and is said to be dangerously ill. No successor has yet been appointed. 242. The strength of the Military Garrison on Abadan Island which consisted of one Infantry Battalion, three Infantry Companies and one M.G. Company of the 14th Infantry Regiment of Ahwaz, has been decreased by the transfer of the three Infantry Companies to Bandar Shahpur. 243. Colonel Baq&amp;fi, the Officer Commanding the Khuzistan ^ray Division, visited Khorramshahr on the 1st, 9th and 24th on tours of inspection. 244. The secret meetings reported in paragraph 233 of Khorram- shahr Diary No. 10 continue to be held in Khorrsanshahr and Abadan. Reports indicate that the mistakes which led to the failure of the July riots and lessons to be learned for future operations are continually being stressed, and members are being warned to arm themselves In readiness for more vigorous and carefully planned action against the British when the time comes to strike. It is suspected that crude fire-arms and other weapons are actually being turned out in some of the Company’s workshops, but surprise raids by the A.I.O.C. authorities have not yet been able to substantiate this. 246. The following pro-Tudeh officials were arrested during the months (i) Makl Rabi 1 #. the Acting President of the Khorramshahr Tudeh Party, for interfering in Municipal affairs. (ii) Rafi-Zadeh, Director of Education, for the illegal registra tion of certain Tudeh pamphlets regarding the general elec tions, Pro-Tudeh teachers and students thereupon decided2 to go on strike as a protest, and telegraphed the leachers 1 Institute in Tehran f&amp;££'ordlngly. They went back to work however ^en the latter replied thht the Mtter wa* being dealt with in Tehran. ^ TRIBAL 246• Eight Arab Chiefs of .^hadegan were arrested on the 23rd on a charge of having refused t&lt;| product don scripts for the Army when ordered to do so, and sent t&lt;Htawwu~ ra Ttsey'were however released when they explained that their request for a few days grace to round up the requisite number of conscripts had evidently been mistaken by the conscription officials as a refusal to do so# 247# R.I.M. the Shah’s preliminary Farman regarding the holding of General Elections for the 15th Majlis was displayed in Khorram- shahr and Abadan on the 18th, but has caused little reaction in view of the order issued by the Military Governor, Abadan, to the effect that it will not be possible to hold the Flections in either place as long as Martial Law remains in force. The Tudeh party are reported to have selected Hussein Tarbiyat, who was implicated in the July riots, to stand for the next elections. The Arabs are, as usual, in a state of complete uncertainty and have approached H*M. Consul for gui anc©. The usual non-committal replies have been given to them. 248. The Persian ftavy are reported to have received instructions early in the month to prepare the three gunboats lying at the Khor- ramshahr kaval Base for naval action against the tribal elements in Bushire# These gunboats were handed back to the Persian Govern ment by the Royal Indian Ravy in May, but no effort has been made to man or maintain them since then. They are said to be unseaworthy but one gunboat was eventually persuaded to propel herself down the 8hatt-el-Arab, when it was discovered that she carried no ammunition suitable for ner guns, which are of British make. She then returned to port and both the A#I.O.C# and H#ti* Consul were asked, quite naively, whether they could supply a few ,, bullets M which would fit these guns. 249.

His Majesty's Consul expressed the hope that they would obtain reinforcements as the state of security in the town was far from satis factory, whilst thefts of military stores and commercial cargoes were becoming increasingly frequent. £ftc,iirity»- 330 Thefts and burglaries are on the increase in Khorramshahr lately. ^ is belieyed that a band of robbere under the leadership of an Arab called Zowemil is responsible for most of the raids, and that its &gt;j numbers are increasing with success. The main centre of exploit is around the newly developed railway sidings, at the late Shaikh's Palaces and the Customs.

This would certainly indicate that individuals have all along been hoarding wheat in their houses. the other hand it is hardly possible for any single holder to be concealing any considerable stock nor c an the supplies with individuals be very iarge without this being dis covered. Moreover the *rice now being offered is .almost enough to tempt pereeas to ris^ starvation am part with what they have. i«ven so it is reported that Uie -i.l.O.C. were only able to pur chase about bu tons of wheat from the Masj id ouleiman area and havu not yet &amp;et with mox^e success elsewhere. ^ates ;- The price of dates has risen from dials 4b to nials 100 per 7b Milos. This is said to be due to a greater demand for dates since the h*iVd.C. have commenced buying them. Trices of other food stuff have however reduced slightly in hhorramshahr since the A.i .u*C. has been organising supplies in the Abadan basaar. In the meat market the Jutf.O.C* have still not succeeded in getting the meat company to reduce prices and mutton remains at 12 'iais a kilo, though it has not exceeded ID liaba in khorram- sbahr* The k.f*0*C. have, however, induced the meat company to guarantee a fixed price of 12 dials for a year as an alternative (since meat normally rises much higher in the winter than in uie j&amp;mer), ami are hopii^ to persuade the Governor to accept this. The latter desires a cash guarantee from the meat company to be deposited in the bank and the matter is still under consideration. 397 • Thefts t- Only a few petty thefts have been reported during this fortnight. 398.

The Governor returned to ivhorraraanahr on 31st. 90. ^arhang Jehanauai of the ministry of »ar aeconipa- nied by ^adr-et-Tujjar, a leading merchant of khorasan, arrived from Tehran on the 21st and went to -twarbela on pilgrimage. 91. ^atwan IX Hessai of the Conscription Department arrived from ^hwaz on the 21st to take the local conscripts to ^hwaz. It is suspected that the recruiting authorities, Police and Gendarmes are ill-treating people and taking bribes in return for exemption. About 26 persons who had absconded to Basra to avoid conscription were caught by the Iraq Police and returned to the authorities in Khorramshahr• The iieeruiting Officer has been asked to furnished His Majesty's Consul with a list of all those with British Interests whom he desires \o enlist. 92. Dr. Daftari, an inspector of the Ministry of Health arrived from Tehran on the 29th on a tour of inspection. He is staying with the Quarantine Medical Officer at khorramshahr• 23.

House-breaking and armed robberies more frequent in Hhorramshahr* People are are becoming complaining of &amp;tli® apa*thy of the Police# The Chief of Police still complains of Xke lack of^ inefficiency of his personnel. He seems however to have become a complete tool of the Commissioner of Police for Khuzistan, ^arhang Alborz, and is reported to be collecting money for him. His prede cessor was believed to have been removed for refusing to oblige. It is also believed that the officials (vide .-~M ^ paragraph 43 of_ Diary No. 3) who came from Tehran to investigate complaints against the Police in khorramshahr ^ were 'satisfied* 4 by the Chief of Police here. On the night of 30th March an Iraqi armed robbar who is believed to be an Iraqi deserter was caught by the Police authorities and detained in custody pending enquiries. 97. Shaikh oaleh Hindi, a British Indian subject in Abadan, was arrested by the Police authorities on the 24th on a charge of murdering a dancing girl. A representative was sent from this Consulate to see the accused and to present a letter to the (iovemor to ask for particulars of the case. Investigations are being coupleted by the Police during which, according to the usual practice in Persia, the accused is kept in .solitary confinement. However he was allowed to speak with the representative of the Consu late and make arrangements for his defence and disposal of his possessions. He had his own bedding and the condition of his confinement appeared generally reasonable. The Governor*s official reply is awaited. 98. Indian guards and others on barges moored in the Kanm above Khorramshahr town are said to sell goods to Arabs who come up In b&amp;llams at night time. 99. The Assyrian Levies guarding the smoke screen near the Bahmanshir where the road from Kut-i-^haikh joins the main road are said to sell whisky, gin and brandy at 200, 150 and 300 Rials respectively.

Road, Rail and telegraphs were all disrupted throughout the fortnight as a result of rainfall/^ and the Karon flooding. Villages on the bank of Karun between Khorramshahr and Ahwaz have been flooded and both people and property have been lost. The new Military road and the Ahwaz-Khorramshahr railway have been breached about 40 Kilometers from Khorram- ^ a &lt;n. shahr. It is hoped to have them in commission in about/(ten days# Efforts were made to marshal all Military lorries and get Aid-to-Russia material through by alternative desert tracks, but none the less stores are accummulating at 2 to 3 thousand tons a day and certain tinned food supplies have been going bad due to exposure.3 The river has been flowing at about 10 knots and Q p 7 1 barge towing has been almost impossible* 102* Several hundreds of pilgrims returning from j harbela have been stranded at Khorramshahr. They have_ vr • ^ been housed in the moeques ana specially hired buildings* Arrangements for 100 to go to Ahwaz were made by the Governor and this Consulate with the British Military authorities and it is hoped to assist others* 103* harhang Khatemi* the Military Governor of Abadan, called upon His Majesty^ Consul on the 2£th* He confirmed having received instructions that the whole Island of Abadan was within his sole jurisdiction and that he was to act under instructions direct from Tehran. Similarly the Police and Gendarmes were directly under his control# He also said he was increasing the police, but conqplained recruits were still net forthcoming and of delays in their pay and allowances. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were extending to them the rations issued to their own staff* He is himself now living in an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company^ house in Bawarda and works in the Bakhshdari* No Military tribunals have as yet been set up, nor is there any news of the special British liaison Officer to be appointed by the Commander-in-Chief, Persia - Iraq Command# His Majesty's Consul called on the Military Governor of Abadan on 29th to discuss further matters affecting the administration# H g ,.fl. 104# smallpox appears to have died out, no fresh oases have been reported. 105# Partly aue to the continued wet weather and to ingress of impoverished wanderers from outlying districts ana famine areas further afield, typhus has broken out in Abadan# About 120 cases have so far been discovered and are being treated in the Anglo-Iranian Gil Company's hospital.
