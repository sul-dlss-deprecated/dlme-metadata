Reference letter dated 22nd December from Resident Director of the A.P.O.G. to your address regarding negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait, in which he suggests that I should accompany him to Kuwait with a draft agreement for the Shaikh*s signature. He has also addressed me asking to be allowed to take similar action at Bahrain. I have not 3 &gt;-et received any instructions from the Government that negotiations should be opened, but in any case I think it would be best that preliminaries should first be opened by the respective Political Agents. I do not know the present Shaikh of Kuwait, but I doubt if he would be prepared to sign an agreement of the sort straight off when presented to him by Sir Arnold Wilson and myself, and I am quite certain that the Shaikh of Bahrain would not. The latter would certainly require a good deal of talking to first, and probably the former would too. This I think should be left to the Political Agents with support from me if necessary, and when the Shaikh is amenable a repre sentative of the A.P.OoC. might take over the agreement to be discussed and signed.

An acre is a British surface measure consist ing, of 4840 square yards, equivalent to a square of approximately 570 dhir&amp;Vof four equal sides of 14iii dhirS s each. An acre need not be a square, however, but may be any shape, as in Britain a plot of ground is not described as so many ya£?- s according to the sum of its sides, but ^ so many square yards according to product of one length and one breadth in the case of rect angles; thus an acre(of 484Q square yards) might also consist of xk^x^xxautxxxkk»»x. kxkxokkkxadtxjt two lengths of 220 fuc*x yards (a proxlmately 417 dhira’s) each, and two breadths of 22 yards (approximately 4l c dhira’s) each, or of two lengths of 484 yds (approximately 217 dhira’s) each and two ^ breadths of 10 yds (approximately 19 dhira s each, because 220 multiplied by 22, and 484 multiplied by 10, both make 4840, mhicn is the number of square yards In an acre, although in Kuwait the former plot would be described as consisting of 92? dhira s, and the latter as 1872 0 - foicr An area of 400,000 acres, if square, has -fkm sides of 25 miles,or approximately 83,36863,368 diiira's, each, making a total of 333,472 dhira'a in a.jL^ according to the kuwait method of measurement. |&gt; ( 2 ) Period: Two years.

E.I t 'htf i No. /V Xo H.E. _ dated the January 1923 T yOL Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, i C.I.E., A. C, Ruler of Kuwait. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the *7Lh Jamadl I 1341 relative to the proposed agreements for the exploration for and exploitation of oil in Y.E.’s territory. T tui/X- i hope that the following explanations remove the difficulties A which you saw in my previous letter. ihe difference between the Exploration Licence and the Prospect ing Licence is that under the former a few geologists will come and c &gt; | 'lu, travel about the country studying the nature and formation of the ground and will prepare reports and maps of any tracts in which they think oil is likely to be found. Under the Prospecting Licence on the other hand. Engineers and come and test, by actuall drilling wells, etc., whether there actually is oil in such places as the geologists reported it as likely to be found, and whether it is in sufficient quantities to be worth the expense of.working 0 I. THE EXPLORATION LICENCE. I (a) Area. The area which the Company wishes to explore is only that included within the red line. (b) &amp;(c) The period and licence fee are as you say 8 years, ex tensible to four if necessary, &amp; Hs.1,000/- II. PROSPECTING LICENCE. n. (a) Area. The Company cannot say the extent of the area In whlc/cr- they will want to prospect until their geologists have ex plored the country and submitted their reports, but they think the area will not be more than 400,000 acres alto gether, or that they will want to prospect in more than five different parts of Y.E.’s territory. As an example, they might want to prospect in a tract of 150,000 acres round Burqan, In one of 100,000 acres round Ghadhai, in one of 80,000 acres In Yah, in one of 50,000 acres to the west of Jahrah, and in one of 20,000 acres in Kabd. Each plot might be of any shape, square, oblong, triangular, round,or entirely Irregular. Of course there is no reason to suppose that they will want to prospect in five different blocks,as It is quite likely that the geologists Ik may think it Is unnecessary to do so, and consequently the 400,000 acres , or such less area as they wish to prospect in, may be in only two parts of your territory, or even all together in one place. As the acre is a British measure which is not used in Kuwait, and as there Is no square measure here, I wished to give Y.E. an idea of the extent of 400,000 acres and said that if the 400,000 acres were all together and In the shape of an exact square, each of its four sides would be 25 miles long, or approximately 83,368 dhira's, which would make a total of 333,472 dhira's according to your method of measurement® (b) 6c (c) Period 2 years and licence fee Rs.10,000/r as you say® HI. EXPLOITATION LEASE. (a) Area not more than 100,000 acres divided into not more than three blocks. The explanation of this Is similar to that of the 400,000 acres above. To give you an idea of the area, if the 100,000 acres be all in one plot and exactly square, each side will be 12&amp; miles or about 41,684 dhiras, making ,*i I 166,736 dhlra*s in all. (b) vour royalty will be Rs.S-J per ton. (c) lou will not be paid royalty on 8u.ch oil as is used for their machinery. the firs/ (d) The rate of royalty to be subject to revision aftHf^ten years by mutual agreement or, if necessary, by arbitra* tion. (e) If the Company take 100,000 acres, they will guarantee to pay you a minimum of Rs.30,000/- a year either as royalties @ Rs.S-l per ton or as a fixed rent of Rs.30000 ft whichever Is more. That is to say, if the royalties &lt;! Rs.3^ per ton for any one year amount to say Rs&lt;,200,000 they will pay you Rs.200,000 and no fixed rent. If, on the rogtltles $ Rs.3&amp; per ton amount to only Rs. 15,000 they will not pay you any royalties, but will pay the fixed rent of ks. 30,000 instead. Naturally, if they do not require as much as 100,000 acres, a fixed rent of less than Rs.30,000 will be agreed upon. Although it icftji does not say so, I presume the rent or royalties will be paid to Y.E. at the end of the year. (f) Y.E. will have the right to cancel the lease if you think that the Company Is not fulfilling the conditions of the lease, if the Political Resident agrees with you that this is so and advises you to do so* (g) Exemption from customs dues and taxes on all material imported for the work for a period of ten years from the date of the signature of the first agreement, I.e. the Exploration Licence. If there be any further point which Y.E. still does not fully understand, I mightbe able to explain It to you better verbally.

I enclose herewith a Draft Agreement between the Sheikh of Doweit and the A.P.O.C. which shews the lines on which we should like to conclude an Agreement. I will come up to discuss this matter with you, if convenient to you, on Thursday next at about 10 o T clock. I hope you will find it possible to explain to the Sheikh that Rs. 3-8-0 per ton represents considerably more than lb$, which is what we pay to the present Persian Government and which is more than any Oil Company’s pay except in countries where oil has actually been produced for many years past and where its existence in paying quantities in any given area has been placed beyond doubt by the results of previous explorations Moreover, Royalty on crude oil proposed by the Colonial“ ( 2 ) - ( COUTIUUSD ) Office gives the Sheikh an assured and certain revenue independently of any profits which the Company may or may not earn.

Article 8 : Secretary of State having definitely stated in his letter of 14th August 1982 that he felt unable on principle to recommend the Shaikh to grant the Company permanent immunity from Customs and confined himself to recommending ten years exemption for plant and material we cannot recommend more to him. Article 18 : Date of caixpxcEX commencement of the ten years seems obscure but the compromise seems Perhaps Wilson could obtain approval for Article 1 if not already originally mentioned because Colonial Office raised difficulty of Najd - Kuwait Boundary which no longer exists.

Wilson said red line 'i£SR-*&amp;»&amp; ; I suppose we Cfinriot recommend more than ten years, v : Might not the article be worded however so as to imply that the question will be reconsidered at the end of ten years. I should like to see 'the reasonable personal requirements of employees” included as the Shaikh holds rather strong, views on the subject of alcohol, and so, I understand, do Canadian drillers. Article Personally I think the Shaikh would prefer a separate document re force ma jeur as to have it X embodied would be equivale &amp;o his owning; that, he cannot protect property in his own territory. \ I Know Wilaon wants It to be separate so as to be able to show the main agreement to I bn Sa'ud when negotiating with him and. this clause would be obviously amed chiefly at his subjects....

Owing to a mistake in‘my office I got the date of the next mail 27th, so sent you a wire about the matter, which now proves to have been unnecessary• I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter I have sent to Wilson on the subject of article 1 and R. As a matter of fact, I think the draft agreement quite a good one, but in view of the fact that the Colonial Office went so thoroughly into the matter and discussed it so elaborately, I dont see how I can recommend things that they have not discussed (article l) or decided not to recommend (article 8). I am afraid this will delay the matter and be very annoying, but it can^ be helped. Perhaps Wilson will decide to put the two articles through without any recommendation from us, and obtain Government’s approval after. T expect this would be the most expeditious way of doing it.

My dear Wilson, 1 linri that, owing to an oversight, you were never sent a 'pojt copy* confirming my telegram to you 40 . 359 or the 6 th April. 1 now enclose a copy. And this gives me the opportunity to explain to you rather more fully what was in my mind when 1 sent you that telegram. 1 hope you did not think it very abrupt. It was done simply with the object of sound ing a note of warning as to the difficulties which suggested themselves to me on a first reading of tne voluminous corres pondence abo-it the Koweit lease which iTevor, w Ai c seemed a little uneasy about where it was leading , showed me immediately 1 arrived-, and to give us all a little breathing space before we got m^ch further in these important negotiations . Since then, the very careful candidexation which I have been able to give to the whole matter has rather strength ened my original apprehensions that we are not altogether on the right lines. But let me first try and sum up for our mutual bene fit the position as it is at present. Firstly , you stand by your single draft agreement , embodying the exploration license, the prospecting license, and the exploitation lease, which has been altered arid modified in one or two respects after consultation with More and Trevor. Secondly, the Bhaiich of Koweit is apparently quite ready to accept thwe parts of the draft agreement which refer to the exploration and prospecting licenses*, and as regards the exploitation lease, has, so far, seriously cavilled at on- point only, namely the question of royalty: as to which he suggested a 25 % royalty in lieu of the rate (m 3/8 a ton) pro posed by his Majesty's Government, and by y c ^ ucj.puny2 f f &amp; ( dxAft* agreement. jx ACt»*&gt; on t»iia Ilia raooxd^d by 'Pxavox on the 4th March after he had had a talk with you abate* tiiat you have referred that &lt;iuedtion to the Board in London t and appar ently their reply in still awaited. Thirdly , we stand by our instructions froni His Maj- esty'e Government which are of the most precise nature t and seem to me very definitely to limit our discretion in the mat ter of recommending terms to the Shaikh. And I cannot help feeling that, out of his desire to help forward the negotations in ewery way , - a desire which I need not tell you I share to the full - Trevor did per naps give a wider interpretation to our instructions than 1 feel myself warranted in following. They are so precise that I am convinced we should only be stor ing up trouble for ourselves in tne end and delaying the ult imate settlement which we all desire, if we did not observe ^ them witn the greatest caution at the beginning. Ido not wish to go into too great detail %t present; but the following comments on some of the points of your draft will indicate the nature of my apprehensions Article I which apparently sums up the whole arrange ment - a concession, namely, to cover both the two prelim inary licenses and the subsequent exploitation lea^e — seems to be ambiguous. The vital *oint which it contains, tn© reference to 60 years , would 1 think more suitaoly be introduced in the clause specifically referring to the exploitation lease. But 1 snail deal with ti^t i-oint later on. And I am still doubtful of tne propriety of exceed ing our clear sanction in regard to the 'Red Line' in tne document itself. Explanatory letters do not seem to me an altogether satisfactory way of dealing with points which are surely of first importance i Article IV goes, 1 think, further the* the 'agr©^ to sign ultimately a lease’' for exploitation which 4 -4 I \3 4 x,&gt; all that the ’’Principal points rt autnorisea me to ’orge on the Sliaikh. 'Phi« article actially granta the lea^e in ^ueation. Article Vlll aeema ratner i^ozzlixAg. Tm first port ion deems rarely consistent with the fact that rent (or royalty in liej* oi rent) id to he charged ; and the second portion d ais with a quite separate matter, namely Cuatomd .and in tiiat coruiection I do not think my authority per mits me to include personal requirements of the Company’s employees among duty free articles in view of tor. Churoh- hill's very clear pronouncement , ai.id the equally clear acceptance by your London directors , on this iGint* Th? Company are right to provide that their employees ahall be able to import what they like in reason for tiieir per sonal oomiort*, but not, surely, that these import.; should be duty free ? And the ; e par ate letter suggested by Trevor in re gard to the reconsideration of the exemption aft?r the 1C y ear a have expired does nco appear to me to oe justi fied by our very distinct orders. Article Xll • With regard to the date on wnion the royalty payments should begin there was evidently some both douot in the minds of, More and Trevor, which resulted in the compromise whereby the rate is to be revised at tne end of'twelve years from the date of tills agreement” . 1 do not tnink there is any need for such a material alte. ation of the terms suggested by His Majesty’s Government. It seems olear enough to me that payments of royalty for the first ten years should only commence when the exploit* ation lease commences to operate. Before that, tnat is during the currency of the exploration and prospecting licenses , fees only are payable by the company . More over the words substituted , which 1 have already quoted , are inconsistent with your Article XXXI Wiiiox. says t* 3 at thethe royalty shall begin after oil has been found in ex ploitable quantities , a very different thing from 'the date ot this agreement” . Article Xlll itself, might giv? rise to dome diff- ioalty ; and 1 cannot help thinking that a dimple declarat ion that royalties a ho aid accrue from the date on which the exploitation leaee begins to run would be more satia— factory and giv* lead scope to misunderstandix^gd. Article XV * The only room l find in my instruction* for arbitration id in respect of the. royalty rate after ten years; and the reference to arbitration in the second half of this article appears, therefore, to lack sanction. Finally,there iu no mention in the draft agreement of the maximum output of ICG tons which the Company may take royalty free during the period of the prospecting 11 cense • Doubtless , the above are all points which could be taken up one by one and settled satisfactorily without much trouble. But tne real difficulty lies, 1 think, deeper trjan that; it is inherent in the nature of the whole draft agree ment which 1 am driven to think attempts too much, and which minor alterations here a.nd there will not radically alter. It is, at once, an exploration license, a prospecting licende, and an exploitation lease for 00 years all rolled into one. What are our instructions ? ‘To get axjead wltu the first two undoubtedly ; but as to the third we are only authorised to ob tain (or ueeK to obtain) , an agreement to sign euoh a leaae ultimately . as tne corre pondenoe shows , the only objeot of tide agreement being obtained now w a to safeguard the Company in the setter of profits whioh the Shaikh Blight endeavour to force up in the event of oil being found in aoundance. Although no mention is made in the correspondence between His Kajeety's Government and the Poa*d in London of the period of the exploit ation lease, 1 quit, realise that it is every bit as important- to bind the Shaikh beforehand in this respect as in the matter of5 of protita •, and I think it would be reasonable to include in the agreeioent a provision that the le se # if signed , shall run for not less than 60 years unless the Company should so desire. But it was no doubt the intention of Hie h jetty’s Government to leave over tar subsequent settlement at the right time the many other important points which must remain for considerat ion. And it seems clear that it w s precisely because the present 'agreement to sign* must be limited in its scope, that His majesty's Government we. e careful to advise tae embodying oi these conditions as to ultimate profits in a separate doc ument . fhey never contemplated the drawing up now of an ex ploitation lea*e in its final for®; arid the attempt to do so, without full knowledge of the wishes of His Majesty's Govern ment in this respect and before actual conditions have been determined by the results of tne preliminary exploration,etc ., lias led to difficulties which 1 think could have been avoided if the directions of His M«.je ty's Government had been more closely followed . I quite see the advantage from your point of view of getting the whole thing over at one stroke of the pen so to spe^K; but we simply nave not the authority to sup port that method of settlement*, and anxious though I am to help you in every way 1 can # 1 must follow my chart. 1 feel therefore tiat the only thing to do - irk some though this most be to all concerned when matters hav~ got so far - is resolutely to go back and at rt again on lines which I am sure axe sounder; namely two distinct agr^srceuw each embodying the known points agreed upon; one granting the exploration and prospecting licenses*, the Other an agreement by which the shaikh will jndartak* to alga ultimately a mining lea e embodying certain conditions aa regards area to be worke. and profits to be realised , which are laid down la sub-head 111 of the Memorandum setting forth the '^rixicipal points agreed upon 11 and alao the period of duration which 1 ta*e on iquself the responsibility of including in tnat ag* .ement. S.S• &gt;ot* k o 11 / ti a regards the mapy other ^-oiaW w^iioh euoh a lea^e will have to contain, this sabsidiary agreement, should, in ray view, be absolutely silent* The re-castixig ot your draft agreement in oo*iform- ity with the above suggestions will not, I sincerely ho jr e , present much difficulty . I am convinced that when it has been re-drafted , the two documents which will remain will not only be simpler and less ambiguous , but more in conformity with the with the wishes of His Majesty*s Government, as 1 read them, than the agreement in its present form* 1 believe you are thinking of coaiiig to Bos hire early next month. If ao, and you could a^are a day to discuss the whole thing , 1 should be very glad to see yo^. here. It would not tuKe us long to run over the two drafts and arrive at a mutually satisfactory settlement which I could recommend to the Shaikh. Yours sincerely , Sd/~ S . G. Knox . T.

He pointed out that,seeing that the agree ment affected the vital interests of his country and of its people,it would be unfair for him to expedite the con clusion thereof without due consideration and consultation. He would,on the other hand,be doing an injustice to the company if he rejected any of their proposals off-hand • Furthermore, he would be guilty of telling the company an untruth if he pro d sad to undertake anything which was beyond his power to perform . * This affair is of a com mercial nature*, he went on to say, *and it needs consider able deliberation in order that full justice may be done to both parties *• Sir A.T.Wilosn stated that,in view of his friendship for the Hhaikh and his loyalty to ills ajesty* s Govern ment ,he would in no wise attempt to force the Shaikh’s hands by bringing the least pressure to bear upon him ,aiid that the latter could consider the agreement with due care. Colonel Efcox had already wired for a ship for his voyage and intended leaving Kuwait on Monday night after dining at the shaikh’s Palace; and sir A,T # -dlson would prolong his stay at Kuwait till Thursday and leave the place by the glow Mail if the Shaikh was inclined to think that it would be possible for him to discuss the terms by that time . If the phaikh did not think so,however, sir2 . A.T.Wilaon would leave Kuwait in company with the Political Kesident* The shaikh answered that,while he wished to settle the matter with all possible speed,he would beg of sir Arnold not to urge upon him to hasten a decision • » I will not make any contract with any company except the one * presided over by you , and of this you may rest assured'* He added that there were many modifications for him to sug gestjthat he would read one article of the agreement after another,suggest such alterations as may be required by the interests of his country and submit such new articles a# he may deem fit • Sir a.T*W ilson inquired if the shaiidi could think of discussing any of the articles in this meeting, so that those provisions on which both parties agreed may be known and those over which they disagreed may be reserv ed for future discussion • y The Shaikh rejoined by saying that it would surel take someti e to do so and that he would request for an ample respite to deliberate on the different points* 'But I tell you* , he remarked, 'that I shall not enter into an agreement with any other company without your informa tion • » ** Sir A.T.lfilson asked the Shaikh if this assurance could begiven to him in writing • The shaikh replied to this I give you ray word of honour that 1 will not conclude any contract with any Company wit out informing you,at first,of the terras suggested by then • This word I give you in view of the friendship and regard I entertain for you personally,as I have regarded you as flay father o r eve n more* * *** v — * # J ^' Jjs' i) *** CiA]* l V3. - thanking the haikh for trie ahove assurancSi Sir A.T.^Xson reiterated hie remark with reference to hi a departure f and stated that his purpose in inviting the Shaikh to discuss such of the terms as he could was to avoid a further-visit by him to huwait t a» he,sir Wilson,had to proceed to haghad and perhaps to Teheran and that he did not presume that it would he convenient for him to visit Kuwait again * The shaikh observed that he was aware of the fact that sir Wilson was very busy with important matters ,but that the shaikh himself would be visiting Basrah in a few days, say a fortnight,and would take an opportunity of discussing thematter with sir Wilson there,failing which he ould no doubt refer to the representative of the Government at Kuwait ♦ 'But you should not have the least doubt,' he added, 'that I will not enter into any agree ment whatever with any company except the one of which you are the head,without informing you beforehand.» ( 0 ) Sir Wilson explained to the shaikh the addition made by hi a to article 10 of the proposed agreement • The Shaikh appeared to be pleased v/ith the same and observed that it was useful for him • He repeated to ;irA.T.Wilson hi a intention of visiting Basrah and meeting sir Wilson at Mohsmmaroh, but he emphasised again that it was not advisable to discuss the conditions of the agreement without due meditation on his part. ^ JT^ U* ic) &gt; 1 ?

I enclose herewith, in original and with translation, a letter elated the 23rd instant from Shaikh Ahmad on the subject of a draft oil concession, which he has been discussing with Major Holmes, and which he is most anxious to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd. I have informed the Shaikh in reply that I am forwarding his letter to you, and have reminded him of the written undertaking given the late Shaikh Mubarak in his letter dated the a?th October 1913, and of the fact which you pointed out to him on the occasion of your recent visit that neither Major Holmes nor the syndicate ^ilch he represents are In any way M appointed from the British Government ’, adding that,in view of the very definite row!sea which he made to Sir Arnold Wilson and to you at the beginning of the month, I felt it was quite unnecessary to say any more. X discussed the matter with him verbally on the evening of the 22nd instant, and he definitely promised that he would not sign any agreement in the mean time, and no agreement has actually been signed as yet, but Major Holmes' representative is still in Kuwait with the draft agreement all ready for signature on receipt of what the Shaikh would consider a satisfactory answer from you. I understand that the success of Major Holmss* negotiations was manoeuvred chiefly by Shaikh Xueuf, head-master of the Hadrasat al-Afamadiyah, and Khan Bahadur kulla Salih, who were both tireless in their efforts to persuade the Shaikh to grant him the concession. If storiss which I hear now are true, Major Holmes 8 U S H I R £.t hlB8*lf appears to be gifted with a no et vivid imagination a to be but little hwapered by » conscience. One of the chief arguments he is reported to have used was that now that Ibn Sa’ud hae granted a concesaion to his syndlcaU it ie obviously wisest ^ I 1 I for Shaikh Ahmad to grant one too, as otherwise ' they could draw away an oil from Kuwait territory without going there at all, in the sane w y that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company draw away oil froa the neighbourhood of Mosul'! He is said to have agreed at once to any and every alteration to the draft agreement which the Shaikh suggested, and to have assured him that there would be no question whatever of His Majesty's Government not approving of the proposed agreement, as this was a question which would be settled in London and it was only the local Political officers who were trying to boom the Anglo-Persian On Company for reasons of personal friendship, etc., and that they would go back on what they had said when taxed with it from London, as Sir Percy Cox had done in tho QH&amp;e of I bn I must auy that from what I havo &amp;&amp;en of Major Holmes personally, X am surprised if these stories are true as I Judged him in my own mind to be a thoroughly honest and straightforward m-n X learn tliat Shaikh Ahmad's proposal to grant a concession d'Arcy Exploration Company, Ltd., is not looked upon with favour by the majority of the leading merchants and other influential men In the town, and that, at a giaJlis summoned to discuss the the question on the 22nd instant, some remarkably plain Speaking w ' a Indulged in, notably by Shaikh Sabir as-Subah and Hamad al~ Shaikh Ahmad is a man of no strength of character, and I do not think it is at an likely that he will try and take his om way in opposition to both public opinion and your advice, if, as X presume will be the case, you still advise him to deal only with to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd., in preference to the Khalidw the d'Arcy Exploration Company, Ltd.Translation of a latter, dated the ath Dhul 4a'd&amp;h ^ 54 - ( 3Sr&amp; June 1933 ), from H.S. Shaikh Mmi-A al-Jablr as-Subeth, C.I.S., ^aler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After cosplimenta. I beg to infora you that Major Frank Holmes, the accredited agent of the Astern and General Syndicate, Ltd., has come to Kuwait and has submitted a to i e a draft concession for mineral oil in Kuwait territory, which, on careful consideration, X find to be beneficient and profitable. What I particularly like about it is that it is a British company and that it undertakes not to sell the concession to any but British companies. In addition to this, X purpose inserting a clause to the effect that this con cession will only come into force if approved by His Majesty Government, and that if Government do not a prove it it becomes mill and void. I teel confident that if X grant this concession to the Company in question. His Majesty Government will raise no objection, as my friend Bhuikh ’Abdul *Aaia Multan of Najd k&amp;hxiummui has granted them a similar concession and H,E. Mir Percy Cox who was present at the time raised no objection, and as my friend hex the Ruler of Bahrain has given them a similar con cession and there was no objection to this either.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of the SOth June, No. 899, transmitting the text of a draft Agreement submitted to the Sheikh of Kuwait by Sir Arnold hilson on behalf of the D^rcy Exploration Company and your despatches No* 578 and 405 of the 15th and 24th of July on the same subject* Before commenting upon the draft provisions of thisj^Agreement, I desire to explain in some detail the attitude of His Majesty*s Government towards this Concession and towards the question of the grant of Oil Concessions on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf in general. For this purpose it will be convenient to review briefly the circumstances which have led up to the present situation* in this despatch I do not propose to deal with the question of the Nejd Concession, since this will form the subject of a separate despatch* of a considered policy have obtained from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and from other native rulers in the Persian Gulf, formal undertakings to the effect that they will not grant any concessions for the development of Oil in their territories to any person, or persons, not approved ('appointed 11 ) by His Majesty’s Government* The object of obtaining As you are aware, His Majesty’s Government as part ACTING RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULPOBTAining these undertakings was two-fold, in the first place it was intended thereby to protect the rulers themselves against the pernicious activities of unscrupulous Concession hunters of the type which preyed so successfully upon the Turkish Empire before the war, and secondly it was desired by this means to restrict the grant of Concessions to reputable British firms, and thus to prevent the infiltration of foreign incidence in the Persian Gulf, which was regarded as politically undesirable* 5# In order to avoid advantage being taken of the native rulers* inexperience in such matters, it was laid down that applicants for Concessions should not negotiate direct with the Sheikhs, but should, in the first instance seek His Majesty’s Government*s permission to apply for a Concession upon approved lines, and, having obtained such permission and agreed upon terms which His Majesty f s Government would be prepared to recommend to the Sheikhs as acceptable, should then open negotiations either through the Political Resident or through the medium of the Political Agent concerned* 4« Sn the summer of 1921 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company expressed a desire to secure a series of exclusive prospecting licenses for Oil over the whole Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf* The Company’s proposal was referred to this Departraent by the India Office and, as my predecessor was satisfied that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were in a position to undertake and carry out satisfactorily the development of the oil resources of that area, the proposal was accepted in principle* After considerable correspondence and negotiation the main heads of an Agreement covering exploratory and prospecting rights In the territories of Bahrain and Kuwait were drawn up in agreement with the Company by the interested Department of His Majesty’s Government,and were coEnnunicatod to the Political Reaident for submission to the Sheikhs concerned* These draft heads of Agreement, which were adapted from the usual Colonial Model, were so framed as to provide the nucleus of an Agreement, which would, in my opinion, have been in every way favourable to the interests of the Sheikhs, in that they were designed not only to provide for the expeditious and systematic development of the oil resources of their territories, but also to produce for the Sheikhs very handsome royalties* 5# However, before any agreement could be concluded Major Holmes, avowedly, and probably actually, in ignorance of the necessity for obtaining the prior permission of His Majesty's Government, approached the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain direct and succeeded in inducing them to grant or ' undertake to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate, which he represented, exclusive Concessions for the exploitation of oil and other minerals in their territories* 6 * These concessions contain several unsatisfactory features (notably the provision whereby the Sheikhs would receive a percentage of the shares of the exploitation Company, in the place of a definite royalty based upon output) and they would in any case require to, be substantially modified before I should feel justified in advising the Sheikhs to accept them* But quite apart from this consideration, I felt very strongly that the Sheikhs should not be allowed to disregard their solemn undertakings with impunity, nor that 'unapproved** firms, by approaching them direct, should be permitted to secure Concessions the terms of which had not previously been submitted to His Majesty's Government; particularly in view of the fact that the Anglo-Anrlo-Poraian oil Company would thereby have directly suffered as a result of having carefully observed all the conditions required by His Majesty’s Government. A telegram was therefore sent to Colonel Trevor on the 50th June instructing him to inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty’s Government would not approve of the Concessions which contrary to their undertakings they had granted to Major Holmos, and that the Eastern and General Syndicate wag not a firm approved by His Majesty’s Government. this latter statement it must not be understood that my intention was to give the impression that His Majesty’s Government had wy objection in principle to the Eastern and General Syndicate except on the grounds of the irregular manner in which their Concessions had been obtained* On the contrary, so far as His Majesty’s Government are aware the Eastern and General Syndicate although possessing neither the wide experience of oil production nor the efficient organization and financial strength of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are a substantial and reputable firm. 8 « ' In view of the attitude taken up by His Majesty’s Government the Eastern and General Syndicate have now volunteered to modify their Concessions in such manner as to Conform to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. These Concessions have not yet been closely examined in the Colonial office but if in fact the syndicate show themselves willing to accept such suggested modifications as may upon examination prove to T)h necessary, and moreoverare able to satisfy me that they are in a position and intend to carry out to the full the obligations which they propose to undertake towards the Sheikhs, following paragraph, feel any strong objection to their candidature• Company both by their priority of application and by their due observance of the correct procedure, have in my opi&amp;fcon established an undoubted claim to His Majesty^ Governments prior support, provided, of course, that they are prepared to offer to the Sheikhs terns at least as favourable as those submitted by not prepared to recognise the Concessions granted to the latter Company unless and until the Sheikh of Kuwait has set forth hie objections to the draft Agreement submitted to him by Sir Arnold Wilson: has explained his statement (reported in the telegram of the 13tb. July from the Political Agent, Kuwait, July No* 378) that the draft Agreement is entirely me of the validity of those objections: and has further has been obtained his proposals are 1 shall no longer, subject to my remarks in the On the other hand, the Anglo-Persian oil the Eastern and General Syndicate* Consequently I am a copy of which accompanied your despatch of the 30th unacceptable to himself and his people: has satisfied stated precisely in what manner he wishes that Agreement modified* 10 . If when this information 1 ti notnot accepted by the Anglo-Peraian Oil Company x shall then he prepared to approve of the Kuwait Connession being gi-anted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, provided that the terms thereof are no more favourable to the Company than those rejected by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and that the Concession is recast noon approved lines* 11* You should therefore oonnrrunicate to the SheiKh the revised draft agreement contained in the later paragraphs of this despatch and inform him that His Majesty f a Government consider it a fair basis for discussion rrith the Company* You should also call upon him to formulate his objections if any to this revised draft Agreement, and to state in the clearest terms in what way he proposes that it should be modified* Yhe SheiM^s proposals should then be communicated to me and also to the local representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who would then decide, in consultation with his principals, to what oxtenfi these proposals may be accepted* I am also prepared,provided the alterations proposed do not involve any large question of principle, and provided that they are acceptable to the Company to authorise you at your own discretion to approVe on behalf of His Majesty’s Government the grant of the concession by the SheiMi without further reference to myself* In dealing with this matter you should proceed in / consultation with the local representatives of the Company as proposed in the last paragraph of your despatch No* 405of the 24th of July* 12* The procedure which I have set out above as regards Kuwait, should also be followed, nutati„ .-lutandis with regard to Bahrain. Tou should proceed as you propose in your despatch No. 406 of the 24th of July and, when you think that the time is rip© for further action, the Sheikh should be informed that His Majesty's Government have not found it possible, in view of the prior claims of the D'Arcy Exploration Company, to approve the concession granted by the Sheikh, contrary to his predecessor's solemn undertaking, to the Eastern and General syndicate, and that they desire him first of all to consider the application of the former Company. In the event however of the Company not being prepared to of for th© ShoiKh terms which are as favourable in the opinion of the SheiKh himself and of His Majesty^ Government as thoae offered by th© Syndicate, His Majesty*s Government are paopafced to withdraw their opposition to the grant of a concession to the latter* 15* I will now proceed to examine the Anglo- Persian Oil Company*s draft agreement, the form of which in my opinion, leaves much to be desired* I fully sympathise with the Company*a desire to regularise their position once and for all, which has led them to provide in one agreement for the grant of exploration and prospecting licenses and a mining lease, but their draft has in consequence lost in precision and clarity, and appears to chaaga the Shei&amp;h with large and ill-defined liabilities over a long period of years* This is illustrated by the wording of Article I# which at present gives the impression that thethe exploration license is to remain inforce for a period of 60 years. This is presumably not the intention, and in any case directly conflicts with Article S. I should therefore not find it possible to infora the Sheikh that I am satisfied that his rights and interests would be adequately guarded by the existing draft agreement ♦ The Company can, however, attain their object equally well, and without imparting ambiguity into the agreement, by adopting the expedient of framing an agree ment whicn provides ..or the grant of exploration and pros pecting rights, and also irrevocably binds the Sheikh - subject to the fulfilment of certain specified conditions - to grant at the request of the Company (on or before the termination of the prospecting period) a mining lease upon terms set forth in detail in a document scheduled to the agreement. The advantage of this method, which is generally s employed in similar oases in the Colonies, is that it define without ambiguity the exact relations between the two part ies in all the various stages; moreover it is by this x$xsx arrangement open to the Company at the expiry of the pros pecting period either to withdraw from the whole undertaking with incurring any obligations in respect of exploitation, or, if oil is discovered in profitable quantities, to obtain a mining lease upon previously agreed terms. 14. This view should be represented to the Local Representative of the Company, and he should be pressed to substitute for the present draft agreement a revised draft modified on the following lines* H© should be informed that if the Agreement is revised'• J-.,- revised in this way I shall have no hesitation in commending it to the sheildi.

I am sending you 'to-day a copy of' the draft concess ion as approved by the Colonial Office . You will see that they have made several alterations - e .g. they don't like the siaflle agreement prepared by Sir Arnold Wilson. I thought they wouldn't; I didn't myself in view of their instructions. If Sir Arnold Wilson approves of the draft we might mention it when I come over . I doubt however if the Shaikh will have changed his mind yet. It is a curious change (due to Holmes and Bin Saud no doubt) which has come over him since we spoke to him last February , is it not ? The present idea is that the 'Lawrence' will get back here on the 26 th instant , and that I will come over bringing Colonel and Mrs . Knox to stay at Kuwait, and my wife, Mrs . pierpoint , Major pierpoint , Captain and Miss Mallam to go on with me . We shall be there I hope on the 27 th,* but as the delegates wont (in my opinion) get to Kuwait till the end of December perhaps the Knoxes will prefer to stay here in which case I shall leave them at Sabzabad to come to Kuwait later .

He should be informed that in my owxi opinion the terms of the draft concession for Kuwait contained in my despatch No . 9 referred to above are likely | i ^ to be more favourable . 7 . &gt;is regards this latter concession the Syndicate have submitted to me a draft from which I observe that the area purporting to be covered by the concession is not ex actly the same as the area of the neutral zone as shown in the records of this Department. The difference is not very great , but before the concession is actually granted you should cause it to be examined with a view to ensuring that the area covered by it is accurately defined .

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No 218-S ’ of 1Q91 DATED BUSHIRE, THE 8TH (RECEIVED 20th) SEPTEMBER 1921 ’ Subject. Anglo-Persian Oil Company's desire to obtain concessions to prospect for oil on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. 1 lia J e fL he T h( ? 10U ^ffi 0 refer t0 i the corres P°n(ience between the Colonial Office and the India Office regarding the desire of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain concessions for oil in certain Arabian territories on the 1 ersian Gult Littoral, copies of which were sent to the Foreign and Poli tical Department and to me (with Mr. Wakely’s letter No. P -2794 dated 30th June 1921). 2. I waited to reply to this as I expected some communication from the Government of India, but as considerable time has elapsed, and His Excellency the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia has already communi cated his views in his letter No, S D -1928, dated the 10th August (a copv of which is annexed in case it has not alreadv been sent to the Government of India), I think it advisable to submit my views without further delay- 3. As regards Kuwait and Bahrain I agree with His Excellency the High Commissioner that, in view of the Conventions of 27th October 1913, and 14th May 1914, which we have made with the respective Sheikhs, there is no objection to negotiations being opened at once., I also concur with His Excellency that the style “ Anglo-Persian Oil Company is undesirable for a Company obtaining a concession in Bahrain and that it would be advisable to form a subsidiary company to be styled “The Arab Coast Oil Company ”, or “ The Arabian Oil Company ”. I presume the same Company would prospect all down the Arabian Littoral and Oman, so perhaps it might be styled “ The Eastern Arabian Oil Company ”, unless operating all over Arabia in which case “ The Arabian Oil Company ”, or “ The Anglo-Arabian Oil Company ’’ would be better. 4. As regards Muscat, the present Council of Ministers is very amenable, and I think that if they were sounded by the Political Agent on the subject we should find that no objection would be likely and that negotiations might be opened at once with the Muscat Government. But as the Government of India are aware, the writ of the Muscat Government does not carry far beyond the coast, and what view the Imam and the Omanis would take is difficult to say. I am enquiring from the Political Agent who has just returned to Headquarters if he can give any idea on this point 5. In respect to the Trucial Coast, I would observe that the Sheikhs and Tribes of this part of the world are extraordinarily ignorant and back ward, and I think that a sudden request for exclusive prospecting rights would be regarded with the greatest suspicion and would meet with deter mined opposition in all the Sheikhdoms. I think it would be best in the case of these Sheikhs to endeavour, in the first instance to obtain Conventions similar to those made with Kuwait and Bahrain,' and later on to try for concession if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, after prospecting in the neighbouring countries, thought it worth while to prospect on the Trucial Coast. With the exception o the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi the Trucial Coast Sheikhs have only a narrow strip of sandy soil between the Oman Hills and the sea; whether this is likely to contain oil or not of course I cannot say, but I should think prospectm 0 there might well be left to the last. 6. I agree with His Excellency the High Commissioner that it would be good policv for the Company to pay a lump sum to clinch the negotia- tions, if the Arab Potentates concerned show they especially if they agree to exempt the machinery of the Company from Customs dues. A copy of this letter is being sent direct to the India Office. Copy sent to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad. I XI—396Trevor S r7s L f T T R r F p° M T™ E Hon ;? LE ^'Tenant-Colonel A.

(5) Letter No. 36-S., dated 10th January 1922, from Political Resi dent, Persian Gulf, to Resident Director, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Mohammerah. 2. I do not think that the procedure suggested by Sir Arnold Wilson— viz., that he and I should proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement and try and get the Sheikh to sign it—is likely to be successful, because the Sheikh is very old and obstinate and will require a lot of talking to before he will agree to sign any such agreement. This, as I have stated in enclo sure No. 3, can only be done by the Political Agent in the absence of any representative of the Company resident in the place. When the Political Agent thinks that the Sheikh has adopted a reasonable attitude and shows signs of being willing to sign, a representative of the Company might go over with a draft agreement for final discussion and signature. 3. Prom enclosure No. 4 it will be seen that the Political Agent, Kuwait feels certain that Sheikh Ahmad would not sign such an agreement straight off; so I think that it will be best for the Political Agents in both places to do the preliminary negotiations. 4. If the procedure indicated above is adopted, there will be no need to follow that suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir Arnold Wilson’s letter, which I venture to think is hardly suitable. As the same agreement is required from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and I shall have to deal with the Bahrain one, the most convenient plan would seem to be for me to arrange both, but for me to appear at Kuwait on behalf of the High Commissioner and then proceed to Bahrain as the representative of Government seems anomalous.

I XI—396 I2. I beg to apply for permission to negotiate on the same lines with the Sheikh of Bahrain, and to solicit your personal assistance in the matter in * due course: I venture to hope that if and when permission to negotiate is granted you will find it possible to be present in person at the negotiations. 3. I further solicit your assistance in obtaining from the Trucial Chiefs conventions in regard to the Exploitation of Oil similar to those already made with Kuwait (27th October 1913) and Bahrain (14th May 1914). Enclosure II to Serial No. 13. —Letter from Sir A. T. Wilson, Resident Director, Strick Scott &amp; Co.- Ltd., to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, dated the 22nd December 1921. I have the honour, to state that I have been instructed by the Board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company limited to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait with a view to concluding agreements with them in connection with Oil in their territories. 2. As you are no doubt aware, it was provided under the arrangements concluded in 1914 for a fusion of interests m regard to Turkey of the D’Arcy Exploration Company and of, the Turkish Petroleum Company that none of the participants would interest themselves in concessions any where in the Ottoman Empire otherwise than through the Turkish Petro leum Compa,ny. 3. The Clause in question reads as follows : — “ 10. The three groups participating in the Turkish Petroleum Com pany shall give undertakings on tlmir own behalf and on be half of the Companies associated with them not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production or manu facture of Crude Oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe or Asia, except in that part which is under the administration of the Egyptian Government or of the Sheikh of Kuwait or in the “ Transferred territories ” on the Turko-Persian , Erontier, otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company 4. You will note that the territories of the Sheikh of' Kuwait are specifically excluded. 5. The Board do not consider it necessary at this stage to incur the considerable expense involved in registering a new subsidiary Company, and propose that negotiations should be conducted on behalf of the DArcy Exploration Company. I trust that this course wid have your concurrence. 6. I enclose a draft of the Concession which T propose to negotiate with the Shaikh of Kuwait, if and when I have your authority to do so, for which authority I now beg to apply, 7. As regards Article 10 of the draft, in view' of the fact that the Bakhtiari Khans are taking such strong exception to the deduction of In come Tax on dividends to which they are entitled, the Company would prefer to a share interest an arrangement under which an annual payment equivalent to 10 per cent, of the nett profits, after providing for deprecia tion, etc., should be paid to the Shaikh. In this connection reference is invited to the terms on which the A P. O. C. holds its concession from the Persian Government: viz., 16 per cent, of nett profits. It is considered by the Board that not more than 10 per cent, would be justified in the case of Kuwait and Bahrain in view of the somewhat unpromising prospects of finding oil at either place, and the very heavy capital expenditure involved, and of the purely nominal assistance in regard to protection required from the Chiefs at either place—practically no pipe line would be needed for example if oil were found. 8. I have no official information as to whether Kuwait is at present for purposes of Political Administration uhder Baghdad or Bushire, and only venture to address you on the subject as the result of an informal conver sation with the Political Agent I 1st - i^‘ i W ai .

' I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 22nd December forwarding a copy of a letter which you have despatched to His Excellency the High Commissioner at Baghdad Regarding opening negotia tions with the Sheikh of Kuwait for an agreement with him in regard to oil m his territory, and asking for permission to negotiate with the Sheikh of Bahrain on the same terms. So far His Majesty’s Government have not given permission for nego tiations to be opened, no doubt however they will do so shortly. When they do however I think the best plan will be for the Political Agents to prepare the way by preliminary talks with the respective Sheikhs. I am quite certain that the Sheikh of Bahrain who is as you know very old and rather obstinate, will never agree to sign an agreement of this sort straight off. He will need a lot of talking to and persuasion which pan onl) be done by the Political Agent as there is no representative of the Company resident at Bahrain. I do not know the present Sheikh of Kuwait but the Political Agent states that he is quite sure that Sheikh Ahmad would not be willing to sign the agreement without lengthy discussions and consultations. In the circumstances I think the best course would be to instruct the Political Agent at Bahrain to discuss the question with the Sheikh when ever possible and report when the Sheikh shows signs of becoming amenable; a representative of the Company could then proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement for final discussion and signature. If necessary I would support the Political Agent in the preliminary negotiations I think similar procedure would probably be best in Kuwait also.

I replied to him that in our draft, many of the administrative and political clauses had been copied word for word from the Eastern apd'General Syndicate’s draft, and that tho^e which were not so, differed only in as far as we had made arrangements for the grant of the concession to cover the whole of the Sultan’s territories—subject to our entering territory outside the Hasa province only by the Sultan’s definite permission—and by the inclusion of certain clauses w T hich .were as much in the interests of the Sultan as those of the Company, regarding the occupation and acquisition by the Company of private property, some of which he was himself asking the Eastern and General Syndicate to include in their agreement. Ibn Saud said that he could not consider the grant of the concession for any area outside the Hasa province. The time was not yet ripe for the admission of foreign influence into the less civilised parts of his realm. That is the attitude which he always adopts when he is in a tight corner, namely that of a Sultan having but little hold over a fanatical crowd of savages who frequently get out of hand. As a matter of fact, however, he has the Ikhwan completely under his control and it is only in the more enlightened towns that he has any difficulty in enforcing his authority. I explained to him that that need not stand in the way of our negotiations, I could not, on my own authority, accept the confinement of the concession to the Hasa province only but I would refer the matter to you and I had no doubt that, considering the circumstances, you would agree. Then it was that he produced the argument which he afterwards used to block any suggestion which did not suit his views; and regarding the validity of which I Jiave made careful enquiries without, however, obtaining any definite result.. He claims that he is not a free agent in such matters as this but is bound by a Council of Ulama at Riyadh under the presidency of his father. One evening when I had called on him and found him alone, without even any of his confidential secretaries, he professed to explain to me the position of this council and how it came into existence. * You will understand ”, he said “ that I do not belong to the senioi branch of the Saud family, and so, in the ordinary^ course of events should not have attained to my present position. The senior repi esentative ol t e senior branch is one Saud who now lives with me, but who, a few years ago, raised the standard of revolt in the Southern provinces with a view to getting for himself the position which I now hold. Ibn baud, having crushed the revolt thought it advisable to come to terms with his opponents and consented to the formation of a council of Ulama under the presidencyof his father to whom all important questions should be referred, he being left considerable freedom of action in general matters but being merely the Council’s executive officer as regards matters which have been referred to it. He professes to be very anxious regarding the security of his position and very afraid lest he may give his opponents a loophole for getting in a telling blow on him. How far that this claim that this Council.is a power ful body whose views he dare not oppose is true, or how far it is merely a foil to be used when he wants to block proposals made to him, I was unable to discover very clearly. There seems to be some difference of opinion about it, at any rate among the people of Hasa. It is certain that the council exists and that the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft was shown to its members before any reply was given about it, but there are some grounds for the belief that it is ‘ Ibn Baud’s servant much more than his master. The presidency of the council can easily be made by a master ful individual, a position of paramount importance in the state and in the cpurse of a conversation one evening, ‘ Ibn Saud gave me a very broad hint that when his father dies he may himself appoint one of his sons Sultan and himself become Imam of the Ikhwan and president of the Council, a position which would give him immense power and authority while at the same time allowing him to disclaim all responsibility whenever he found it convenient to do so. Be that as it may be, however, it was this claim of his which finally blocked my negotiations with him. He maintained that, in spite of all argument, that he would not dare to give affront to the Council by making fresh proposals to them after they had discussed and accepted the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft as it now stood— subject to certain modifications which they had demanded—and the only conditions under which he would be willing to negotiate with the A. P. 0. C. was that we should accept the whole of the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft and the modifications asked for word for word in both the English and Arabic versions and that in addition we should make a financial offer which showed a clear advance over anything which the Eastern and General Syndicate had offered. At the same time he refused point blank to receive his royalty in any other form other than by share participation, insisted.on the payment of 1 per cent, export duty as laid down in the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft and on the payment of import duty on all the goods imported for the personal use of the Company’s Staff, and at the same time while admitting that our offer to pay the guards was an advance on the offer made by our rivals, declaring that he was quite willing to pay them himself. It seemed to me that in spite of his plausible talk and flattering refer ences to the Company he had never any intention of giving us the conces sion if he could possibly help it, and he intended to use us merely as a means of getting the Eastern and General Syndicate to bid higher than they had already done. That being so he was not little surprised and dis appointed when I informed him that I had been instructed to break off negotiations. I informed him before leaving, however, that if his nego tiations with the Eastern and General Syndicate did finally break down we were leaving the door of negotiations open and were willing to discuss the matter with him at any time, but using our draft as the basis of the discussions. Finally I desire to place on record by appreciation of the way in which Ibn Saud treated me while at Hasa. Shaves, camels and horses were placed at my disposal. I was given full permission to go wffiere I liked, even into the fort and the armoury, and on one occasion he did me the honour of calling on me in my own house, an honour which, I am told, he confers on very few of his visitors.

S OF^1923^ ’DYTFli Bushire, the 20th June 1923. DATED Kuivait Oil Concession. My Lord Duke, A/r ? ecretar y S tate for India’s telegram’ No. 1846, of the 18th May 1923, I was informed that His Majesty’s Government wished me to endeavom to secure from the Shaikh of Kuwait a definite undertaking that he would give no oil concession to any other company than the D’Arcy Exploration Company to which His Majesty’s Government intended to give preference over all other interests in Kuwait, I now have the hdnour to forward to Your Grace a copy of a draft agreement which was submitted to the Shaikh of Kuwait by Sir Arnold Wilson with my approval; and a minute of a conversation on the subject of that draft between Sir Arnold Wilson and the Shaikh at Kuwait on the 2nd June last. The draft which was presented to the Shaikh differs considerably, Your Grace will observe, from the separate agreements I was originally directed to help the Company to negotiate; and principally in this that whereas the present draft includes in one document exploration license, prospecting license and a definite lease for sixty years, my instructions were merely to encourage the conclusion of the first two, and as to the third, to confine myself to obtaining “ an agreement to sign ” ultimately such a lease. The only object of that ‘ agreement ’ being obtained now was apparently to safe guard the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the matter pf profits which the Shaikh might endeavour to force up later on in the event of oil being found in abundance; and itnvas no doubt the intention of His Majesty’s Government to leave over for subsequent consideration the other points which might remain. But they apparently did not contemplate the drawing up now of an exploitation lease in its final form. The position has, however, materially altered since these instructions were conveyed to me last November. The appearance in the field of the Eastern and General Syndicate as an energetic and open rival oi the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Arabia was a new factor in the situation which encouraged the Shaikhs to play off one party against the other, and generally undermined the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Sir Arnold Wilson’s desire in the circumstances to get the position of his Company defined once and for all, and without moie delay, seemed to me entirely reasonable. In face of klajor Holmes active methods, u did. not seem to me to be a time for procrastination, and I believed tk it a on Id accord with the views of His Majesty s Government that I siiould inteipiet* as literally as possible my obligation to assist the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany while safeguarding at the same time the Shaikh’s interests. But in order to give His Majesty’s Government freedom to step in and amend, if they thought fit, any clause whatever throughout the whole agreement, I stipulated for the insertion of clause 1^ of the draft to which I venture to invite Your Grace’s particular attention. Sir Arnold Wilson very willingly fell : n with my views. The opinion which Sir Arnold Wilson and I both formed of the damag ing nature of Major Holmes’ activities, was supported by the exceedingly cautious attitude taken up by the Shaikh when we visited him at Kuwait recently I had it from Major More that in March last the Shaikh was ready enough to enter into a binding lease with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and was merely disposed to cavil at one or two minor points in that Company’s proposals. He now showed a determined disinclination to commit himself in any wmy beyond giving verbally, and in satisfactorily clear terms, the required assurance that he would not enter into a concession with any other Company than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This assurance wTiich he gave to Sir Arnold Wilson in the course of his conver sation of the 2nd June, he repeated to me in the presence of the Political Agent on the following day, and in equally emphatic language. I understand that, for their part, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are ' in no hurry to exploit the Shaikh’s territory; their chief anxiety was to be certain that no other party would be able to obtain a footing there. In this they have succeeded; and although he would have preferred that the lease should have been accepted by the Shaikh, Sir Arnold Wilson expressed to me his satisfaction at the present-stage which the negotiations have reached. I am not without hope that with the disappearance from the scenes of M^jor Holmes, and after he has taken counsel with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Shaikh of Kuwait will arrive at a satisfactory under standing with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I still await the despatch from the Secretary of State f or India pro mised in his telegram 1846 of May 18th, which is to convey to me the additions to the terms of the Kuwait Concession I was originally directed to procure. I hope that these will, not conflict wdth the terms of the draft lease which I have already offered to the Shaikh, and that Your Grace will agree that in the present circumstances, if the two parties wish to come to terms, it is advisable that any agreement signed now should be in the form of a final and conclusive lease.

T . Wilson, and Shaikh A hmad-ul-Jaber as-Sabah, Ruler of Kuwait, on the 2nd June 1923. Sir A. T. Wilson asked the Shaikh if he had had time to peruse the draft of proposed agreement between the Shaikh and the D’Arcy Explora tion Co. and to offer such remarks as he may have. The Shaikh replied in the affirmative, adding that he will have to make many observations and suggestions for modifications. He pointed out that, seeing that the agreement affected the vital interests of his country and of its people, it would be unfair for him to expedite the conclusion thereof without due consideration and consultation. He would, on the other hand, be doing an injustice to the Company if he rejected any of their proposals off-hand. Furthermore, he would be guilty of telling thQ Company an untruth if he promised to undertake anything which was beyond his power to perform. “ This affair is of a commercial nature ”, he' went on to say, “ and it needs considerable deliberation in order that full justice may be done to both parties.” Sir A. T. Wilson stated that, in view of his friendship for the Shaikh and his loyalty to His Majesty’s Government, he would in no wise attempt to force the Shaikh’s hands by bringing the least pressure to bear upon him, and that the latter could consider the agreement with due care. Colonel Knox had already wired for a ship for his voyage and intended leaving Kuwait on Monday night after dining at the Shaikh’s palace; and Sir A. T. Wilson would prolong his stay at Kuwait till Thursday and leave the place by the Slow Mail if the Shaikh was inclined to think that it would be possible for him to discuss the terms by that time. If the Shaikh did not think so, however, Sir A. T. Wilson would leave Kuwait in company with the Political Resident. The Shaikh answered that, while he wished to settle the matter with all possible speed, he would beg of Sir Arnold not to urge upon him to hasten a decision. “ I will not make any contract with any Company except the one presided over by you, and of this you may rest assured.” He added that there were many modifications for him to suggest; that he would read one article of the agreement after another, suggest such altera tions as may be required by the interests of his country and submit such new articles as he may deem fit. Sir A. T. Wilson inquired if the Shaikh could think of discussing any of the articles in this meeting, so that those provisions on which both parties agreed may be known and those over which they disagreed may be reserved for future discussion. The Shaikh rejoined by saying that it would surely take sometimes to do so and that he would request for an ample respite to deliberate on the different points. “ But I tell you ”, he remarked, “ that I shall not enter into an agreement with any other Company without your information.” Sir A. T. Wilson asked the Shaikh if this assurance could be given to him in writing. The Shaikh replied to this :—“ I give you my word of honour that I will not conclude any contract with any Company without informing you, at first, of the terms suggested by them. This word I give you in view of the friendship and regard I entertain for you personally, as I have regarded you as my father over even more.” While thanking the Shaikh for the above assurance, Sir A. T. Wilson reiterated his remark with reference to his departure, and stated that his purpose in inviting the Shaikh to discuss such of the terms as he could was to avoid a further visit by him to Kuwait, as he, Sir Wilson, had to proceed to Baghdad and perhaps to Tehran and that he did not presume that it would be convenient for him to visit Kuwait again. The Shaikh observed that he wds aware of the fact that Sir Wilson was very busy with important matters, but that the Shaikh himself would be visiting Basrah in a few days, say a fortnight, and would take an opportunity of discussing the matter with Sir Wilson there, failing which1 ‘‘^you^hould ntVave^wf eS f n ] at i Ve .? f . the Government at Kuwait, mt you snouia not have the least doubt, ’ he added “that T will not enter into any agreement whatever with any Company’ except throne of which you are the head, without informing you beforehand.” P th * m , Si ( r , Wllson ex P lai ned to the Shaikh the addition made by him to article 10 of the proposed agreement. The Shaikh appeared to be pleased with the same and observed that it was useful for him. He repeated to Sir A T Wllson his intention of visiting Basrah and meeting Sir Wilson at Moham- merah, but he emphasised again that it was not advisable to discuss the conditions ol the agreement without due meditation on his part. / L XI-396,I k, v British Residency and Consulate-General, Buehire, 6 th February 1924.

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 28th larch 1924. &gt; Bir # wi tli i % cxerence to the correspondence ending with your despatch No. 7 dated 22 nd February 1924 regarding the Anglo-Persian t &lt;; il Company * &amp; desire to obtain concessions from the thaihhe on the Arabian littoral of the Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that 1 paid a visit to Bahrain and Kuwait in R.I.M.S. 'LAXAllCE' last week and made some enquiries regarding this matter. ’• arrived at Bahrain on the 20th instant and that afternoon received a visit from Major Holmes. I attach a «—------- copy of a Note which I made of my recollections of the interview. 1 also had a talk with the Political Agent, ajor Paly, who handed me a letter which he had addressed to ( a copy of which 1 anneat), but had kept on hearing that I was coming. Of course I exchanged visits with Shaikh Hamad. Prom all these I gathered that there is a very determined opposition at Bahrain to granting the concession to the \nglo-Persian Gil dempany. I did not notice it rather more than a year ago before 1 went on leave, but it is very prominent now. ..hether it will gradually wear off or not 1 cannot say. At present any ill-wishers of the British or of the Angio-Persian Oil Company never lose an Opportunity of impressing upon their hearers that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a Government concern and that to grant a concession to this company is tantamount to giv- -ing it to Government: that they have hitherto always looked to he Fight Hon’ble J.H.Thomas, H. M. Secretary of State for the Colonies, Bowning Street, tiOITBCB, T. W. 1.2 to the Government to deal impartially with Arab matters, that they cannot hope for Government to do so when the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company come up against tl theme of the Arabs. hese mischief-makers have been assis ed f.ir#x%}£ by firstly a considerable number of ex- -officers and ex-^esopotamian political officers having been imp or ed into the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and secondly by all the talk there has been in the English press - which has been copied and greatly enlarged on by the Egyptian and the Arabic newspapers - about the desire of the British Government to sell their shares in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the controversy on this subject and the final decision of the present Government not to sell the shares. But it is also evident from a recent petition made Kis Excellency the viceroy by ihaikh Isa regarding his supersession as Shaikh, that mischief-makers - taking heir cue no doubt from the ignorant stuff written in a portion of the English press about Oil and Iraq - have been making out. that the desire of Government (in the guise of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) to obtain the oil at Bahrain has been at the bottom of the removal of 0 haikh Isa. But whatever the cause, haikh Hamad has made up his mind not to give any concession to the Anglo—Persian Oil Company, unless he is forced to do so, and I do not think he will change it for some time. While at Bahrain I made some enquiries about Qatar, and found that the fhaikh of that place was very keen {on financial grounds) to give a concession , but not to the Anglo-Persian Gil Company for similar reasons to those actuating Shaikh Hamad. ^3or Holmes told me that he had. received several overtures from vhaikh Abdulla with a view3 view to neg©elating a concession, but had not taken any steps in \ r i ew of the instructions lie had received froia His Majesty f s Government; 1 believe this statement to be perfectly true. I called at Kuwait on the 22nd Maroh,but owing to the arrival of the rans-Jordan!an delegate*! by air at the same time as I arrived, the recently received reports of a raid by ahabis, and other reasons, 1 had not much opportunity to talk about the oil concessions. But from his reply at my last interview and from other sources I gather that the dhaikh’s mind has been thoroughly poisoned again®t the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that he has not ■’he least idea of giving them the concession for his prin cipality . 1 have not the least doutot that Major holmes will secure the concession for the neutral area. he position being as it is, it remains to decide whether we should keep the matter undecided for an indefin- -ite period in the interests of the Anglo-Persian Gil Company or whether we should agree to the Phaikhs of Kuwait, Bahrain and Ha tar closing with the offer of the Eastern and ( eneral Syndicate. It is sufficiently obvious that none of the shaikhs have the least desire at present to give the concession to the .Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and here is no knowing how long they will adhere to this decision. But it hardly seem© fair to prevent them from granting the concessions and consequently from receiving the revenue therefrom,for an indefinite period. yU f X understand, object V the principal ikMmiim of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in desiring to obtain the concessions is to prevent other companies from coming in, their object will be achieved if they simply wait and do not press for the concessions themselves. In the interests of the Shaikhs however, it would rwould secsiii fairer if the Anglo-Persian Oil Compstny* as the Company first in the field, were requested to send an official to negotiate with, the various thaikns within a certain specified time, and thenif their offer is definitely / refused, to authorise the Eastern and General Syndicate to conclude its concessions with the ''hai,&lt;hs concerned. 1 have the honour to be, fir, Your most obedient, humble servant, Sd/- A* P.

All the world was rapidly being parcelled out from the oil getting point of view and it behoved his Company, a new one in this respect, to ook slippy to get a look in. He objected to being called an adventurer; he had been years ( 2 E, I think) in ,he servie of his Qompany - an engineering firm with connee ions in -he far .as~, I forget the name - one of the eighty-two companies with which Mr. tmuno. vis is con tec eo - and had been prospecting etc. all over the world and had never been called an adventurer before; somebody, he would not say who, w s calumniating and slander -ing him everywhere; it certainly was not the head men of the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company, they were too good friends wi with his firm to do such a thing; he could not understand why he was being abused and why Government officials regard- ^ / -ed him with suspicion. I replied had he considered the effect of his appearance on the scene in company with a person G the Colonial if ice, and appeared to be qui a frank and abovi— Tub* 'K^\ r )/\ person 10 :e T;r. kann. He replied chat he had after he had started with Dr. Mann realized that he was a considerable handicap; he went on to tell me how Dr. Mann had taken out some very valuable presents from his Company the Eastern and General « yndica .e and presented them io Bin Baud as from him» -self l never mentioning that they had come from the Syndic* -a e. He also said that he had found that Dr. Mann was positively incapable of speaking the truth and if one asked a simple question like ‘'Have you seen so and so he would at once deny it even though Hie person mentioned had just been in the room with him and left, and he must know one would find out the truth later. He (Major Holmes) would take good care never to be in Dr. Mann’s company again if he could hedp it. Major Holmes then asked me about the Kuwait Beucr&amp;l Zone Concession and showed me the blue prints of the map made at the Cjair meeting by c ir Percy Cox, jand Hie map he had had mode for his concession, which he stated was made at the Baghdad Map Office by the High Commissioner’s orders, of which he had aken several copies, Hie High Commissioner having said he could ake as many as h® liked to pay for. He said that he could not see any difference between this second map and the original blue print; he had shown the two o ir Henry obbs and he could not see any difference. Mi'jor Holmes then showed the - wo maps o me and I could see hardly any difference except that possibly the South-.est boundary line was he leas thing more curved in the second map. I have informed Major Holmes that I thought iw would meet the case ii he added a note (signed by both part— ~ies if he got the concession) to the effect that the neu- -tral zone to which the concession referred was approximately asas shown on his map; if iPi differed in any minor particulars from the official map made by £ir Percy Cox at the Gjair Conferencein 192S the latter was to be the guide. I added that if he did this I saw no difficulty in his negociating for the concession in his forthcoming visit to Kuwait. hajpr Holmes then said that two geologists were expected immediately and had already arrived in Baghdad to prospect along the coastal part of the Hassa concession. ~ j iih my permission he proposed that the party should start from Kuwait and go down along the coastal belt to Jubail and end up at Q,atif; he thought this would be the best way of getting the trip done before it got too hot. I said I saw no objection but was going to Kuwait the next day and would wire from there after consulting the Political Agent . ( I may here say I did this, and after seeing ajor lore on the 22nd Parch sent a wireless message from hi.IKS. * LAfKITBCl-’ * in which I was, to the B. I.

Com, any had since applied for a concession and if so, whether or not he intended ,o grant such a concession. Shaikh Hamad said he had replied 'hat the Anglo Persian Oil Company had not applied since he had refused their firs application, and he did not intend to grant them a concession. i n 14th March Major Holmes called on me and said he wished *o show me the correspondence he had had with Shaikh Hamad, with a view to ascertaining for the ingormatioi of his Directors, how the matter stood. He showed me the letter referred to by Hamad, in which he (Major Holmesj had given a correct version of the attitude of Government that in the event of the non-success of the Anglo Persian Oil Company application they would be prepared to withdraw apposition to the candidature of his syndicate. He also showed me Hamad 1 s reply, in which the la ter stated he would not give any concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company because it was common knowledge that Government had large thare interests in the Company which contained ex -Government officials and. that although he had great faith in the fairness of Government he would wish to fe&amp;i certain that they would always be unbiased and neutral arbitrators to protect his interests zpzz vis-a-vis any nglish Company exploiting oil. AeAs Boon as I had a favourable op^. ortuni *y1 mentioned aasually to Hamad that 1 had seen his reply to hajor Holmes, and thought it was unnecessary for him to have given hie views on the Anglo Persian Oil Company to a rival concern and that i would, have, sufficed to say that he iiad received no fur,hr application. dh&amp;ikh Hamad replied to hie hat 1 had assured him that Government had no invention of forcing him to give a concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company or any other Company against his wish, and that he could not under any circumstances agree to the Anglo Persian Oil Company having a concession. o had taken the ulerrhip in spite of opposition of all his family and others, because he saw .hat Government, would have no/ recourse but .to take the rule out of hie hands of A1 Hhalif- ~eh, as Colonel nor told him, and he thought he could best serve his family by accenting the position; but as regards oil concessions, people had. put it about that haikh asa’s removal was not unconnected wi h his having given a concess- -ion elsewhere than to the Anglo Her si an Oil Company which all Arabs regard as Government pure and simple, and Ghat, if after that, he (Hamad) consented o the Anglo Persian Oil I a leading merchant (and in^rlgu-—' wf Company having he oil, he would be accused by the whole farsily, as well «• s other Arab rulei’S, of hating sold his country in return for being made haikh. 1 at once laugheo a v nis views and endeavoured wO persuade him that he was unnecessarily timorous of local opinion, but he was most insistent that he was right, and iat he could under no eircums anees al^ur them.
