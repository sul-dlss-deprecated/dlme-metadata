Please refer to your letter C/109 of the 7th May about the application of Mr. Fawsi Khaddurah to register seven aircraft belonging to the Contracting and Trading Company. 2. I have discussed this request with Barnard and we neither of us understand what is behind it. There seems to be no necessity at present to raa&amp;e special arrangements for the registration of aircraft at either Kuwait or Bahrain and valid registration elsewhere can be accepted. It is, of course, necessary that the provisions of the Kuwait Air Navigation Regulations especially para 3 should be complied with. 3. So far as I am aware, provided the aircraft comply with the Air Navigation Regulations in force in the various Persian Gulf States, there is no objection to the company using them for charter flights in the manner proposed. So far as Muscat is concerned, however, I should wish to consult the Muscat Government about the scheme generally and it would be necessary to make sure that only such aircraft are used for visits to Muscat as can land and take off there safely. To begin with, in any case, it would I think be necessary to give the rolltlcal Agent, Muscat prior notice of each intended flight and ascertain from him that there was no objection to it. 4.

Dear Sir Rupert, Mr. Fawzi Khaddurah the resident engineer at Ahmedi of the Contracting and Trading Company called this morn ing and wished to know whether his company could regis ter, preferably in Kuwait or failing that in Bahrain, seven aircraft belonging to them. If the answer is in the affirmative he wishes to know what formalities are to be complied with. 2. Details of the aircraft are enclosed (in original).

MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER 210 DATED 25th MARCH, 1949 South Arabian Coast Route Although landing grounds exist at Masirah Idland and Salalah, they are at present manned only by small Royal Air Force parties. However, arrangements have now been made with the Anglo-Iranian Gil Company to put down a small supply of petrol and oil at these landing grounds to meet the needs of operators on unscheduled flights, 2, Permission to use these landing grounds must be obtained in advance through the Ministry of Civil Aviation (ASG3), London. 3. Civil operating companies who use them do so entirely at their own risk and on the following understanding (a) There are no navigational aids and no air traffic control services. (b) No servicing facilitjss are available. (c) No emergency night stop accommodation is available. (d) No food or water is available. . Because of the limited stocks of petrol, aircraft 4^ * i that land without prior permission cannot be refuelled. Aircraft that are given prior permission must carry sufficient food and water for passengers and crews during transit, together with two days* emergency reserve in case an aircraft becomes unserviceable at either landing ground. If an aircraft should become unserviceable, the operating company will be completely responsible for arranging onward air transport for passengers and crews.

H efuelling Faoilities for Civil Aircraft at Masirah. ,A meeting was held at the Foreign Office at 11.00 a.m. on the 19th January to discuss refuelling facilities at Masirah Island. The following were present,*- H.W.A. Freese-Pennefather: C*C*B. Stewart: J. Murray: A. C. Stewart: T.E. Rogers: B. D* Tims: R.W. Fowler: C. M. de L, Byrdo: D. R. Muir: J.R.

Colonial Office. 2. Mr. Freese^Pennefather (Foreign Office) opened the meeting with a short history of the problem. He said there were two things to be decided:- (a) - whether, urtSor the Musoat Civil Air Agreement His Majesty’s Government had any obligation 9 to provide refuelling facilities for civil aircraft at Masirah; (b) if so, how best these facilities could be provided, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government as a whole. 3* A^c, Stewart (Foreign Office), who hod been responsible for the actual negotiation of the Civil Air Agreement, summarized the general background of these negotiations. There had been no civil aviation requirement and the paramount object had been to obtain strategic facilities for the Royal Air Force. If however, we had asked merely for these strategic facilities, it would have been open to the Sultan to ask some other country e.’g. United States of America or India, to run his civil airfields. This would have been unacceptable to 'the Royal Air Force and it was therefore decided to eonclude a Civil Air Agreement giving His Majesty’s Government exclusive rights to maintain 9 airfields in the territories of Muscat. The Sultan was undoubtedly left with the impression that we would provide adequate civil facilities. The Agreement itself contained provisions, to which wc did not take exception, governing the granting of rights for scheduled services. The Sultan was informed ofour intention to provide 0 Civil Superintendent. In fact from the Sultan’s point of view, the bargain was simply that the Royal Air Force were being given special facilities in return for our undertaking to run his airfields* He wanted these airfields both to stimulate infernal civil aviation in Muscat, and to facilitate the development of an Aden-Basra route. The Air Officer Commandfng, Aden, was present at the final negotiations and was well aware of the various undertakings given to the /Sultan.Sultan*. . In contain other respects, we had not lived up to these undertakings* If now we failed to provide civil refuelling facilities, the Sultan might well accuse us of breach of faith* '4. Mr. Byrde (Ministry of Civil Aviation) said that Ministry of Civil Aviation had neither short-term* ^ long-term interest in Masxrah* They had agreed to a Civil Air Agreement only as a strategic insurance for the Royal Air Force and on the understanding that their * obligation would be limit;ed to the provision cf a * ’ C'ivil Superintendent* The ‘interests cf foreign operators m Masirah were short-term, -since eventually they would acquire aircraft types which would allow them to overfly Muscat* . The Ministry of Civil Aviation had examined the possibility c f using the Anglo—Irania.n .Oil Company to sot up a civil refuelling organization but costs were prohibitively 'high* * • „ . 5. Wing^C-mmander Mitchell (Air Ministry) said that Mc.sircih airfield was only on a care and maintenance basis and the Royal Air Force were prepared to accept, a six m-nth delay before operations could take place from it. They would in^fact be prepared to withdraw their present party provided their right of re-entry, was.&lt;protected* Their own aircraft flow was limited to one Dakota per fortnight to supply the maintenance party* There wore no navigational or landing aids, and no passenger handling facilities, such as hight—stop accommodation or reserves of food and water. ' 6. &lt; The arrangement whereby certain foreign airlines are atpresent positioning their own- fuel at Masirah was then discussed* Mr* A* C. Stewart pointed out that ’this* was a breach, of the Agreement. Wing Commander Mitchell said that the Royal Air Fr rce did not like the arrangement since they had neither the buildings nor the staff to handle .the fuel* d # ♦ * . • • 7* • Mr.* Froose-Fennefother said that we must assume that the. Sultan nttached impcrtnnee to our providing civil facilities at Masirah* We had quite, definitely an obligation, to him to provide at least limited refuelling facilities# It was a question ^f deciding how administratively this could best be; done* There were throe possibilities to be considered:- a • ..(a) the Royal Air Force might' provide fuel for civil aircraft, as well as for their own* (b) the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company'might provide fuel for civil aircraft, while--Ghe Royal Air Force retained responsibility for- refuelling their own; (c) the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might provide ‘fuel ..far all .aircraft, b'th Royal Air Force and civil* r • . ' 8*^ Wing Commander Mitchell said that if civil facilities of any kind were tn be provided, the Air /MinistryM flinistry wanted a normal int-uscr arrangement cn the principles already agreed between the Air Ministry and the Ministry rf Civil Aviation. Mr, Frees e-Pennofather agreed that this would be the most satisfactory solution but felt that the flow of aircraft hardly justified it. Mr.. Byrde said that, in the circumstances, there was no justification for separate Scyal Air Force and civil refuelling organizations. 9* Mr* Froese-Pennefather asked if the Royal Air Force would bo prepared to refuel civil aircraft if they were given a subsidy to meet possible losses. Wing Commander Mitchell said he thought not, but the matter would be one for the Air Officer Commanding, i.den. Mr. Rogers (Foreign Office) said that surely very little, if any, expansion of their present establishment would be required to enable the Royal Air Force to oxcroise the necessary supervision of refuelling. Mr- Froose-Pennefather then asked if the Royal Air Force would be prepared to buy their fuel from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and was told that this would have to be examined further. 10. Various problems connected with the establishment of an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company organization at Masirah were then discussedp Mr. Byrde said that because of costs, the Anglc-Irariian Oil Company did not intend to employ any European staff. Wing Commander Mitchell said that the Royal Air Force might possibly be able to assist in providing accommodation and in supplying the detachment. Mr. Byrde emphasized the extremely high costs of a.civil organization. There was some discussion on detailed figures, but Mr, Byrde could, not see how costs could be reduced below £150,000 per year. 11, Mr, A. C. Stewart reminded the meeting that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was anxious that there should be adequate arrangements for the collection of custom duties cn fuel supplied to civil operators. Wing Commander Mitchell did not think that this presented any great difficulty. 12, Wing Commander Mitchell said that, in his opinion. refuelling facilities were not the main difficulty. If civil aircraft called at Masirah, the Royal Air F^rce would be faced with emergency demands fcr night-stop ©ccommodation f and for food and water, which they c' uld not provide; and if an aircraft went unserviceable with full passenger-load, these demands would be considerable. .Furt'^erm.-re, if we allowed scheduled services to use Masirah surely we would be expected to complv with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards. 13. The provision of emergency facilities by a consortium of operators was then discussed. It was generally agreed that quite apart from being a breach of the Agreement (which, however, the Sultan might be persuaded to accept) it would conflict with the strategic interests :f the Royal Air F$rce. • Mr.-Byrde said that emergency stops were likely to- be few, and the necessary stocks could presumably be calculated. Mr. Freese-Pennefother suggested that, having regard to the apparent profits being derived by operators /fromfrom the r:utc, wc sbculd bo able tc recoup the cost Ojf any emergency facilities provided by us* 14c Qn the question of obligations under the Chicago Convention, Hr, M urray (Foreign Office)- said that since the Sultan was not a signatory, he could have no obligations under itc Since the Convention did not cover the territories of Muscat, it was doubtful if we, while - acting as the Sultan’s managers, were under any obligation to c jjpiy with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards* Mr. Byrde. however, admitted the relevance of the dir Ministry T s r pcint and said that if we failed to comply with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards, we should come in for criticismo In general discussion it was agreed that ? in the circumstances, such criticism would not be difficult to counter c Md^.dohnston (Colonial Office) said he had l. is cussed the problem of refuelling facilities with dnglo-Iraninn Oil Company* If the Royal dir Force CvUld agree to refuelling civil aircraft, he was certain the Company would do everything possible to help in the way of transport and accounting. Mr. d.C. Stewart suggested^that if the Royal dir Force assumed managerial responsibility the, actual handling and accounting could well be done by the local Royal dir Force contractor. 16 3 Mr* Freese-Pennefather said that it appeared that the_easiest and cheapest solution seemed to be that the Royal dir F^rce sh uld refuel civil aircraft. Wing C&lt;mmandcr Mitc he3.1 said that the ^ir Ministry were opposed as a matter f principlec Mr , Freese-Pennefather asked if they w-uld be prepared t agree if it were specifically stated that their agreement was n^t tc be taken as a precedent. W_ i ng Co mma n d e r Kit c he 11 said that this was not an isolated instance; the dir Ministry were being faced with similar demands elsewhere* The dir Ministry would certainly examine the problem further, but in view of the situation which had arisen, they might well wish to reconsider their str n tegic requirements at Masirah. * ' The m eeting. ]ess the dir Ministrv•representative agreed that:- ' 9 (a) the simplest and most economical way of refuelling civil aircraft at Masirah was for the Royal dir Force tc assume managerial responsibility; (b) the possibility of an interdepartmental adjustment or vote between Ministry of Civil Aviation and dir Ministry should not be ruled out. 18o Mrj,_J?reese-Penn efather emphasized the need for an earl^ lecion, particularly .iiicc it was impossible to import fuel into Masirah after mid-dpril owing to monsoon conditions# It was also desirable to reassure the Political Resident on the subject of oust ms duty as soon as possible.* FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W, 1 0 Distribut ion: Those present Residency, Bahrein.

(112/38/48) PERSIAN G-ULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN, 9th December, 19*. 8 . Please refer to telegram No. 433 of the 5th November, 1948, from the Governor's Deputy, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, (copy enclosed for ready reference), on the subject of the refuelling of civil and foreign alrcrafit at the Salalah and Masirah airfields. 2. I learnt during my recent visit to Muscat that there has been considerable correspondence between the Aden Governor and the Consul there about refuelling of charter flights at these airfields, and the question is one which requires early settlement. 3« I was not aware that the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company had exclusive rights at Masirah and Salalah, and have been unable to trace any correspondence on this subject. Under the general conditions laid down by the Sultan to govern the use of aerodromes within his territory, supplies of fuel and lubricants for aircraft must be obtained from the agents apnolnted to manage the aerodromes. Under the Muscat Civil Agreement, His Majesty's Government are his agents so far as Salalah and Masirah are concerned, and under Article 2 of the Agreement, His Majesty's Government have authority to appoint agents to manage and maintain these aerodromes. His Majesty's Government could therefore presumably appoint the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company as their agents for the supply of fuel and lubricants, but I think the Sultan should be informed that this is being done. 4. The Royal Air Force are exempt from the payment of duty on all their stores, vide item 5 of His Majesty's Consul's letter No. C.214-2/40 of the 5th April, 1947, to the Sultan, a copy of which was forwarded to the India Office under my letter No. 626-S of l?th April, 1947* I very much favour the proposal that the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company should be asked to undertake responsibility for the supply of fuel and lubricants at the two If this is done, they should, I think, be urged to maintain separate installations for: (a) the Royal Air Force, and (b) other aircraft. They would then pay customs duty at the time of import on all fuel and lubricants for the '(b )' 1 installations. It will be desirable in my opinion to inform the Sultan before hand of any arrangements proposed, and to obtain his concurrence. I should be grateful if the whole matter could be dealt with as expeditious ly as possible as the present position is very unsatisfactory and it appears to me possible that the Sultan may be losing revenue. B. Burrows, Esquire, 5 Foreign Office, London.5.

The anglo-Iranian Cil Company (not nhell as stated in despatch) have exclusive rights at both ^lasirah and Salalah and as R.a.i* agents would under the treaty be the only suppliers entitled to put in stocks for civilian user. 3. I regard the L&gt;outh Arabian route as being of considerable commercial and international importance (apart from strategic considerations) but unless action is taken route will be closed to all civil air traffic.
