Sir With reference to correspondence ending with my despatch ho. 52 of the 16th August 1932, I have the honour to state that fi have received a letter from the JPolitical Agent, Kuwait, in which he states that representatives of the Anglo-Bersian oil Company, Mr. Gass and Mr. Chiaholm, have been having conversations with him and His excellency the Shaiich on the above subject. Mr. Chisholm of the Anglo-iter a i an oil Company arrived by air''to-day from Basrah in the erne connection i and brought with him the revised copy of their proposed Agreement with Mis Kxcellency of which X enclose a copy. occasion of Mr. Gass' last visit to Kuwait expressed a wish that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company draft agreement should be prepared as quickly as possible, has now taken up the attitude—as explained by Colonel Hickson — that 'hs, the Bhaikh, was mt at liberty to discuss the detail! 'of/ The position is that His Excellency, who on the Jolonial office onaon. i® Majesty's Secretary of btate for the Colonies,*of the draft agreement, or even put fonwara Ms own pro- ^poeals until euali time as the Mon * bic the Political •KeBident, through the i^olitical Agent had intimated that *the wording and details of the draft agreement had his ‘‘approval arid that of His Majesty ’8 Uowrmaent“. Uolonel Dickson goes on to aay: •X understand that Mr* Chisholm **will call on you on Friday, 20th August, to explain ttm ♦‘situation in all its aspects, but in order to enable the “Anglo-Persian Oil Company to ‘get on with 1 their “negotiations with the hhaikh, which are now held up, it “seems to Me to he very necessary that you should give “their draft agreement your preliminary “blessing * 1 and “authorise me to tell the shaikh that you approveof it as “far as it goes, and have no objection to his opening “formal discussions with the Anglo-i^ertian Oil Company’s “representatives, so that they can bring their draft “agreement up to the stage at which Major holmes has been “able to bring his, i,e. to its final state , and embody ing all suggestions that the shaikh lias to make“. 3* Mr* Chisholm lias talked the matter over with me to-day and has expressed the same views as those put forward by Colonel hickson* while realising tlmt the attitude of the ahaikh must he somewhat annoying to the Company, I do not see ray way to carrying out Colonel Dickson’s suggestion » as the hh&amp;ikh, having seen the Company y e draft agreement, has expressed a desire for Mis Majesty’s Oovemment »b approval, I think hie wish should he complied with, and for the following reasons. In the proposal draft there are - (a) Various articles (such as Hob. 8 and 11) which deal with comparatively unimportant matters, which the Hhailch is capable of deciding himself with the assistance of the/the Political Agent and the Political Resident in direct eoisiaunication with the Company; (%) Other article# (such aa Mae* 1, &lt;§ and 13) which coTer matters of political import ance to His Majesty’s Uocomment; (e) Articles of a technical or financial nature (such as these mentioned in articles 2 to b t 7 and 9) regarding which the OhaiMh is unafcle to look after his own interests without expert advice from His Majesty’s Go wmmenfc . If the Shaikh discusses the draft with the Company before His Majesty’s Government’s views are known, he may con cur with some of the articles under (b) and (c) which His Majesty’s Government may later have to object to, either on their own behalf or on behalf of the Shaikh« An awkward situation would thus obviously arise for His Majesty’s Government, via a vis both the Shaikh and the Company. It seems better, therefore, to obtain His Majesty’s Government's views first and then for the Shaikh to discuss the matter with the Anglo-Persian Gil Company* I have explained my point of view generally to Mr. Chisholm. X have the following comments to make on the proposed draft agreement• Article 1* Bander Shuwaikh should presumably be. exempted as well as a possible cantonment area near Has-al-Ardh (▼id. Bushix. despatch ho. 42, dated 6 th October 1930). She period covered by this article, nhieh is apparently for Exploration, is two years. Shis seeme reasonable. She/fh« extent eovered is the whole territory. Mo depth of boring ie laid down* X do not imow whether this is an important point or not. 1 believe it is sometimes cue tomary to limit the depth of boring during the period of exploration to twenty feet. ho comments. Ar Here ifroepecting apparently begins# The period la two years. Mo areas are specified, sometimes, I believe# a certain number of areas are chosen by the licensee. Article 4. Mining Lease apparently begins with this article. The period is for seventy years. This may be considered too long but X understand that the ahaiich himself asked for this period. There is no limit to the areas covered by the mining operations but as the total area to be covered is small# perhaps there is no objec tion to this. Article b . I have no comments to make on these figures prigia X&amp;oie appear adequate. Mo provision is made for the revision of Royalties or for giving the bhaikh facilities to cheek production by inspecting the Company’s books or otherwise. (The latter suggestion was mads in the case of the Eastern and General Syndicate Bahrain Concession in the Petroleum department's letter He. * 2 * Si-Part 2 # dated 20th June 1932). Article b. As the Anglo-Persian oil Company are a British Company presumably in the case of war or other emergency His Majesty's Government could control the Company'sactivities, so a special proviso to cover this contingency will not be necessary* Article 7« Xn this connection reference is invited to Colonial office despatch ho. 11 f dated J 3 bth march 192fc.

Since your letter was written, Mr.janson has called at the Colonial Office in order to discuss the matter.

But the Secretary of State expects to receive ver&gt; shortly a communication from the Political Resident in the Persian GulX on the subject of the draft concession which your representative has submitted; and on receipt of this, he hopes to be able to arrange for the matter to be considered in consultation with the other interested Departments of His Majesty*s Government.

By Order for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.mom LZjL f? Persian Gulf * Confidential, Downing Street, 30th September 1932, a Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential despatch of the 25th of August, Ho.36 of 1.932, forwarding a revised copy of the proposed agreement between the Anglo-Persiah Oil Company and the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2 , I enclose for your confidential information a copy of a note from the United States Embassy in London to the Poreign Office, together with the reply which has been returned. From this reply you will see that the two draft concessions submitted by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and by the Eastern ana General Syndicate are at present being examined with a view to a thorough comparison of their terms, and that it is proposed to communicate the result of that examination tc the Sheikh of Kuwe.it in order that he may reach his own conclusion as to the respective merits of the two offers. Pending the conclusion of such examination, which must of necessity occupy some time, I am of opinion that it would be inadvisable that the terms^of the con cessio ns should be discussed with either of the applicants, either in London or by you or the Political Agent at Kuwait, and I suggest for your consideration that the Shaikh of Kuwait should be advised in the same sense. 3. As soon as I am in a position to do so, I will address a further despatch to you containing the comments of His Majesty’s Government on the two drafts.

Embassy of the United States of America. London. September 6th, 1932. / Sir, I I have the honour to refer to your note Ho. E. 1733/121/91 of April 9th, 1932, in which you were good enough to inform me that should the Eastern and General Syndicate desire to renew their application to the Sheikh of Koweit for an oil concession, which they would subsequently transfer to another company, His Majesty’s Government will raise no objection to the application being taken into consideration together with any other applications for oil concessions which may be forthcoming from other quarters. In this connection my Government has been informed by the interested American company that the Eastern and General Syndicate addressed a letter on June luth, 1932, to the Colonial Office requesting information as to whether the draft of a proposed concession (with special reference to Clause 8 thereof) with the Sheikh of Koweit was satisfactory from the point of view of safeguarding the interests of His Majesty 1 s Government, and, in addition, requesting an indication of wherein it failed to do so. It is represented ?i$it Honourable r John Simon, G.C.3.I., e t cetc., etc., 1 Eooreign Office, S.W.l.represented that the failure of the Colonial Office to give in reply a definite indication of its views in this matter prevents the Sheikh of Koweit from taking a decision on the draft concession which the Eastern and General Syndicate submitted to him on May 26, 1932, since he is barred from taking action before knowing what safeguards His Majesty*s Government requires in a concession which is eventually to be assigned to a British or Canadian incorporated company controlled by American interests; meanwhile, it is stated, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company has submitted a draft concession which the Sheikh of Koweit is being urged to grant immediately. Inasmuch as the question of safeguards does not arise in the case of this proposed Anglo-Persian concession, the Sheikh of Koweit is presumably free to make a decision on it at any time. Thus the Eastern and General Syndicate is placed in a disadvantageous position, since it is unable to obtain consideration from the Sheikh of Koweit for its draft concession because, it is represented to my Government, of the failure of the Colonial uffice promptly to furnish the information requested nearly three months ago by the Eastern and General Syndicate. In view of the above considerations and the assurances given me in your note of April 9th, which was duly and textually transmitted to my Government, I have been directed to invite this matter to your attention and to urge that appropriate steps may be taken in order that the American interest involved may be placed in as favourable a position as the Anglo- PersianPersian Oil Company in having its application considered by the Sheikh of Koweit.

Proposed agreement betv/een the Anglo-fersian Oil Co. and the Shaikh of Kuwait.V l' ^.Z.5573/32 3rd October, 1932, Sir, In reply to your letter of 13th September, Ho, 98019/32, on the subject of the application submitted by the Anglo-Per si an Oil Company for the grant of tin oil concession in Xoweit, I am directed to forward, for trie information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a note containing certain criticisms and suggestions on the draft concession which has been put for?/ard by the Angle- Persian Oil Company. Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that, if no objection is seen, the points to which attention is now drawn should be considered in connection with the communication ultimately to be made to the Resident for transmission to the Sheilch of Koweit. 2. As will be seen, the memorandum in question does not deal with the point which is likely to be of principal interest to the Sheikh, viz, the financial aspect of the proposed concession. Prima facie the offer made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would on the whole appear to be more satisfactory from the point of view of the Sheikh. , j than that which has been put forward by the Eastern and General Syndicate. It is for consideration whether , when the time comes to make a communication to the Sheikh, the best procedure might not be ( 1 ) to give him a brief summary ier Secretary of State, Colonial Office.summary and comparison of the financial advantages which he might expect to derive under the rival agreements, and ( 2 ) to suggest that, when he has made his choice 'between the competing Companies, he should make the grant of a concession subject to the agreement presented by the successful competitor being so amended as to cover such points as His Majesty’s Government might, for whatever reason, recommend him to insist on, 3 .

IT o c omment s • It seems desirable, as proposed by the Resident } to except both Bandar Shwaik and also the possible cantonment area near Ras-el-Ardh. Subject to the observations of the Petroleum Department, it is perhaps unnecessary to impose any limitation on the depth of boring during the period of exploration. No comment. The whole area of Koweit is over 20,000 square miles. It is perhaps desirable, subject to the views of the Petroleum Department, to specify particular areas for drilling. As the Sheikh has himself asked for a 70 year lease and this is the period of the concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate in Bahrein, no objection need perhaps be taken. (a) It seems important, as suggested by the Resident, to make provision for the revision of royalties and to give the Sheikh facilities to check production by inspecting the Company’s books or otherwise. (b) It may be desirable to limit further the delay which may elapse before the Company declare that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities. Under Article 12 of the draft agreement they are required to make such declaration not later than 1941 f or surrender their rights under the agreement. But this date appears unduly remote and it seems desirable to bring it nearer - perhaps 1937. (c)(c) Third line from end. Presumably in the event of a dispute between the Company and the Sheikh, as to whether events resulting in the interruption of the Company T s operations were or were not outside the control of the Company, the matter would go to arbitration. If, however, this part of Article 5 is not common form perhaps the Petroleum Department would suggest some form of words which would more adequately safeguard the Sheikh’s interests. (a) Perhaps the Petroleum Department would confirm the Resident’s assumption that as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are a British company ’’presumably in the case of war or other emergency His Majesty’s Government could control the Company’s activities”. Perhaps they will also advise as to the desirability of specifically inserting in this Article (or elsewhere in the Agreement) any of the safeguards proposed by the Board of Trade and set out in the Cabinet Paper No.20 (32) dated 6 th April 1932. (b) If the suggestion above as to the v/ording of Article 1 is accepted, Bandar Shwaik and the Ras-el-Ardh cantonment area will fall outside the scope of the concession. It is perhaps desirable to make this clear in the wording of the Article and also to make the rights granted under its first sentence to the Company subject to the provisions of Article 9. (c) The last sentence of the paragraph seems unduly wide. Perhaps the Petroleum Department would advise whether it represents common form.

There is no real reason why they should he granted so wide an exemption as they suggest, and the Eastern and General Syndicate are, of course, prepared to meet the Sheikh on this point. No comments. Presumably only unoccupied land is meant to come under the first sentence of this Article, and no harm would he done hy the insertion in line 2 after ’'all ' 1 of the word ,, unoccupied u . This again raises the question of exemption from export and import duties referred to in connection with Article 7. Paragraph 2. Second sentence. ? insert after the word 'Sheikh' the words 'as shown to the satisfaction of the Political Resident'. (a) Last sentence. The period which may elapse before a declaration is made might he shortened - see the comment on Article 5 above. (h) After 'terminate' a provision might he added that the properties, buildings, etc. of the Company shall become the property of the Sheikh. It seems desirable to define a British Company as suggested by the Resident in the terms proposed in Colonial Office Despatch Confidential of 13th March 1930. le 14, le 15. Line 2, Read 'the drilling period' as proposed by the Resident. In the interests of expediting arbitation, in the unfortunate event of a case having to be disposed of in this manner and of preventing disputes, would it be preferable to provide that the umpire shall be appointed•0 appointed by the Political Resident? :al. It seems desirable to provide, as in the case of the Eastern and General Syndicate’s concession in Bahrein, that the Company shall maintain a Chief Local Representative in Koweit; that all communications with the Koweit authorities shall be made through this representative to the Political Agent and that the Company’s representatives and the Sheihh shall not deal direct with one another. . • ' i ..K**Confidentlal» Politioal Agency, Kuwait.

Bear Magowan, Mr.B.R.Jackson, representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in America, who is known to Chalkley,has just been in to see me about a visit which Sir John Cadman is going to pay to the United States within the near future. During our conversation he mentioned the fact that the Anglo-Persian is having considerable trouble with the Gulf people on account of the concession which the latter wish to get in Koweit. It appears that the Anglo- Persian were not wildly enthusiastic over the oil deposits in that district and took practically no steps to gain the favour of the Sheikh, until a British syndicate came along and started to buy the concession frcm him. As the syndicate could not raise sufficient funds in Great Britain, an attempt was made to interest some American concern and the Gulf people entered into it with some enthusiasm. The Anglo-Persian do not at all want to have important American interests in that area and are willing to offer J.H. Magowan Esq. , O.B.E., Acting Commercial Counsellor, British Embassy, Washington,D.C. tneIt the Sheikh more than the concession is worth in order to keep the Gulf Company out, but H.M.Government are, according to the Anglo-Persian, inclined to favour the Gulf interests in order that it may not be said that we oppose the establishment of an American company on the Persian ^Uxf. Hr.Wallace of the Gulf Company does not see it that way and has adopted a most hostile attitude contending that H.M.Government and the Anglo-Persian are closing the Open Boor and keeping it closed by a method which the United States Government would never adopt towards British firms in this country (l am afraid his experience in that respect is not very wide but perhaps he thinks that Columbia and Venezuela are United States territory). Anyway the matter is being taken up as between the American Embassy and Foreign Office and Jackson wondered whether it had also been referred to the British v .Embassy in Washington because, if not, he was anxious that Ch&amp;lkiey should knew that this fight is on. He has tried his best with Wallace and has failed and he hopes to get Sir John Cadman to take it up with Mr.Mellon's brother in Pittsburgh. It is a bit of a mix-up with the other Mellon as Ambassador in London. X happen to know Msjor Holmes, who got the concessions from v'\frcm the Sheikh, rery well, and I have always regarded him as an exaggerated optimist somewhat given to extravagant schemes, so I told Jackson that it does not follow that the oil is worth the expense likely to be incurred; but that does not matter so much and it only makes it all the more tragic if the Americans get into the Persian Gulf on a wild cat scheme because, once in, they will doubtless wish to stay and obtain more profitable concessions.

Sir, vVitn reference to the recent inter-departmental discussions which have taken place in regard to the grant of oil conceasion5 in Kuwait, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to enclose for the information of Secretary Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister copy of a memorandum which has been prepared in the Petroleum Department comparing the draft concessi6ns submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the AnglorPersian Oil Company. ( ^j l 'Hj I am, etc., (sgd) Director • The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, COPY. No.P.D.98 Part 2. S.W.lCOPY. KUWAI T* Memop by Petroleum Department * The attached document has been prepared in the Petroleum Department comparing the more important provisions of the draft concessions submitted to the Shaikh by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo_Persian Oil Company. Particulars have been added of certain provisions in addition to those covered by the comparison which it is suggested ought to be included in any concession. When the Shaikh has decided which of the applications he would wish to accept it will be necessary to give further consideration to the draft of the successful applicant. There are certain points raised by the Political Resident and the India Office, such as the exclusion of certain areas, facilities for imports, questions of telegraphs, railways, etc*,, as well as certain drafting amendments, which can be l more conveniently dealt with when the larger question has been disposed of. Some of the more important points raised on the draft of the Eastern and General Syndicate by the Government of India in their letter of the 15th April last (P.282-JM/28} have been dealt with in the comments on the terms offered by the two applicants. Two of these are the question of the area of the concession and the period for which the concession should be granted. In view of the Petroleum Department it is necessary to draw a distinction between a country such as Kuwait, where conditions are very difficult, facilities are few, and there is no guarantee that oil in commercial quantities will be found, and a country liKe India where oil has been proved and there is a market near at hand to absorb the whole of the production, while in addition there is in existence a Government organisation which is responsible for ...for seeing that the policy of the Government in regard to oil development is carried out, #ith the existing organisa tion of the oil industry on the basis of large corporations the tendency is for applicants for concessions to seek large areas for development, and such security of tenure as will enable them to obtain over a period of years a reasonable return on the heavy capital expenditure which oil development entails. So long as there are reasonable arrangements in regard to royalty payments it is in the interest of the State which owns the mineral rights that such a tendenc^y should be encouraged. There is no doubt that much waste has resulted in the past in countries which have allowed undue competition between rival concerns. The Government of India also suggested that the minimum royalty offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate was quite inadequate, here again it would be very difficult for H.M.Government to suggest to the Shaikh that he should stand out for a higher minimum. In a letter of the 6th October 1930 the Political Resident suggested that the minimum of Rs.70,000 offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate was too low and that a minimum of Rs. 100,000 shoaid be insisted on. This sum has now been offered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, It may be that rather than run the risk of losing the concession both applicants would be prepared to offer rather more than they have done but it would only increase the difficulties which already exist in dealing with these two applications ii any attempt were to be made to staft them bidding one against the other. The question of the declaration that oil lias been found in commercial quantities is obviousxy an important one. The India Office in their letter to the ColonialV. -3- Office of the 3rd October have suggested that in place of 1941 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might be pressed to agree to say 1937 tf There may be room for compromise on this point but 1937 would only allow a period of five years and the Eastern and General Syndicate require that period for exploratory work* It is considered that in the first instance this matter should be left to the Shaikh and the Company to which he decides to grant the concession* If the Shaikh consults the Political Resident on the point it is suggested that his advice should not go beyond indicating that something rather better than 1941 might be asked for* The Petroleum Department has included in the general provisions which should be contained in any concession which may be granted two which relate respectively to pre-emption during an emergency and refining a proportion of the oil in Kuwait, or British Territory. It is suggested however, that it would be preferable to omit these at this stage from the memorandum which is submitted to the Shaikh and to deal with these points when putting forward the safeguards required by HcM.Government. ***********P.Z.6989 Copy sent to Enelosure in Admiralty Bering Lettar, Qa.tad 18th Kerember, 1932» Ho.M.02977/32. COH?TD M.02977A2. Sir, 18th Hotember 1982 With reference to Foreign Office letter S0.2.5929/121A1 of 15th Hot-ember, 1932, to the Colonial Office, in which it is mipr^estad that the Inter -departmental Meeting proposed by the Admiralty to disouo* the toleiprnohic instructions to be sent to the Political Besident, Persian Gulf, in the matter of the Keweit Oil Concession, roi ht be unnecessary if the instructions proposed in India uiiice letter No.P.Z.6809/32 of 12th November to Colonial Office were acceptable to other Departments, I am commanded by Uy Lords Cossr issionera of the Admiralty to offer tJie following observations for the consideration of the Jeoretary of State for the Colonies. 2, The implication to be drawn from the wording of paragraph 3 of the India Office letter appear* to be that the Political Resident should confine his advice to the Sheikh to strictly impartial explanations of the Petroleum Deoartment's analysis and should take no steps to influence the Sheikh's decision. 3. In view of the great strategic importance attaching to the development of oil supplies in the Persian Tulf *rea by bona fide British Companies, i-y Lords are of ooi that no legitimate steo which mi *t influence the Sheikh of Koweit to award the concession to tne Anglo-Persian Cil Comoany rather than to the American interests actin : unier The Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL thethe cloak of the Eastern and General Syndicate should be neglected, although They fully admit that it it eeeential that the burden of choice must ultimately rest entirely with the Sheikh* My Lords therefore consider that the instructions to thePolitical Resident should point out that i is of the utmost importance that the Sheikh should give his decision in favour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the Political nesident should neglect no legitimate step to ensure his taking this decision provided that the ultimate decision can bo made to appear to have been entirely that of the Sheikh himself and that no ground is given to the American interests concerned for an accusation against his Majesty’s Government of having brought undue influence or pressure to bear unon the Sheikh. 4. My Lords also consider it desirable to add that should an opportunity arise to tender his advice to the hheikh the Political Resident, in addition to explaining any doubtful points in the Petroleum Department’s analysis,mifdit well refer also to the following points:- (i) That as nothing is yet known as to whether the field will be a cheap or m expensive one to work and as at present there is a considerable world over-production of oil, there may well be a strong inducement to limit production from th© Koweit field rather than to increase it. In these circumstances the 'bird in th© hand' of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s offer seems to b© worth considerably more than the 'two in the bush' of the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft concession. (ii) The wide experience of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in this area enables them to offer a fair economic royalty, combined with a higher r inimum payment. The Eastern ? f nd General Syndicate, on the other hand, being almost entirely without local experience, offer a hi^er royalty and a lower minimumminimum payment but would seem to be themselves doubtful whether the royalty which they offer is ©conoraically possible since their draft concession provides for a complete cessation of work for any time up to two years during which no payments would accrue to the Sheikh. 5. I am to suggest that the whole matter should now be considered by the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence* 6.

The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l.COPY P.Z.6750/32 5th November, 1932 Sir I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to refer to your letter of November 3rd, -No.E.5764/121/91, dnclosing copy of a memorandum presented by the United States Ambassador on November 2nd, relative to the negotiations which have been taking place for the grant of oil concessions in Kuwait, and to offer the following observations for the information of Secretary Sir John Simon. In view of the statements contained in the abisve memorandum, the Secretary for Mines considers it desirable to place on record the facts regarding the negotiations, as dis closed by an examination of the earlier correspondence and despatches from the Political Resident in the Persian Uulf. The Anglo~Persian Oil Company were the first Company to take an active interest in the oil prospects of Kuwait, and as long ago as 1917 they carried out a preliminary examination in Kuwait and Bahrain and applied formally for the grant of petrol eum rights in the territories of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain. For various reasons these negotiations were not brought to a satisfactory conclusion and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has more than once suggested that if they had received a little more help at that time from the Government Departments concerned the Eastern and General Syndicate would never have become interested in these territories. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has represented that at the request of His Majesty’s Government they had agreed not to approach the Shaikhs directly, but to negotiate only through the Political Resident in the Persian ... The Under Secretary of State FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l.Persian Gulf. Major Holmes, however, on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate obtained promises of concessions from the oha^khs of Bahrain and Kuwait by approaching them personally with the result that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company forfeited their chance of obtaining concessions while a lengthy correspondence was taking place between the Government Departments concerned, the Government of India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the High Commissioner for Iraq. (2) In 1925, Major Holmes, acting on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate (which was then purely a British Company) made certain proposals to the Shaikh in regard to the grant of a concession which were not, however, acceptable to him. The Anglo-Persi&amp;n Oil Company also continued to negotiate without success. (3) In March,1926, the Eastern and General Syndicate commenced operations ( by arrangement with the Shaikh) to drill for water in Kuwait, and undertook to sink two wells within the area surrounded by the town wall of Kuwait. After several failures the first well reached a depth of 700 feet without striking water. It was apparently as the result of information disclosed by these water boring operations that the interest of the Syndicate in the oil prospects of Kuwait was further stimulated. (It should be noted that these operations had nothing ostensibly to do with prospecting for oil, the Shaikh having refused to grant to ^aj or Holmes an oil prospecting lie ence.) (4) In September, 1928, however, Major Holmes, with the permission of the Political Resident, again approached the Shaikh for the grant of an oil concession, and submitted a draft agreement. (5) In November, 1928, it was realised that the point concerning • • • #j -a -3- w concerning a British. Control Clause had been overlooked in the Bahrain Concession, and the Eastern and General Syndicate were informed that in any concession in Kuwait which might be granted, a British Control Clause must be inserted similar to that imposed in the case of British Companies operating in British Crown Colonies* Ho question of American participa tion had, up to this time, arisen and the suggested inclusion of the nationality clause was in fact put forward partly as a precautionary measure in order to bring the concession into line with British practice in other oil producing terri tories (such as India and Trinidad) and partly because the Shaikh of Kuwait expressed himself as being unwilling to gran a concession to any Company which was not under British contr It was not until December 19th, 1928, that the Syndicate informed the Colonial Office that they had concluded agreemen with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, under which they assigned to that Company such rights as they possessed to explore the territories which they were interested in, with options to form Companies under British or Canadian Laws to acquire and work any territories taken up under the terms of their options. (6) In March, 1929, the Political Kesident reported that Major Holmes had arrived in Kuwait and left for Baghdad, but that apparently he had not renewed with the Shaikh the negotiations for an oil concession. drew up a Second draft concession which they forwarded to the Colonial Office asking that it might be discussed with the Directors of the Syndicate and Major Holmes in London. The Colonial Office replied that before the matter of the concession could be discussed it would be necessary to In August 1930, the Eastern and General Syndicate consult • • • •-4- consult the other interested Government Departments, and also the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, In the meantime Major Holmes had written to the Political Agent at Kuwait stating that the proposed British Control Clause was causing much difficulty with the Company’s American Associates, and that it was their intention to take up the question of modifying it with a view to making it conform with the modified form of British Control Clause which had by that time been incorporated in the Bahrain Agreement, The Shaikh of Kuwait on the other hand is understood to have informed the Political Resident that under no circumstances would he agree to a concession being transferred to an American Company, and to have been insistent that the nationality clause should be inserted and the concessionaires remain British. This attitude of the Shaikh accorded with the policy of the Govern ment of India, who were entirely opposed to the entry of United States, interests into the area of the Persian Gulf. ^8) In August 1931, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, largely on account of representations made to them by the Petroleum Department, renewed their application in regard to Kuwait and announced their readiness to make a further geological examination, which was subsequently carried out. &lt;9) It was not until December, 1931, that any representa tions were made by the United States Government. Some of these points were set out in the Foreign tv 1733/121/91} which was sent Office Note of April 9th, 1931, (E 1700/l^V / to the United States Government. It will be seen from the above summary that while „ „ b, true t&gt;»t fw .o~ 4 *««. “* G *“‘ 1 Syadicate &gt;»v. been .nd..r»rin« « “ ■Celt, British !»&lt;.«.«. be* b.gotl.ting f.r r=r, „cl. longer* end *«»«'* Atthe . • a -5- At a Conference held at the Colonial Office on the 1st January,1932, the representative of the Foreign Office agreed that provided the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were serious in their intentions as regards Kuwait it would be as well to keep the position open for the present as far as the United States was concerned# As regards the complaint of delay in completing the comparison of the two draft concessions referred to in your letter, the Secretary for Mines desires to point out that it is not the case that no progress has been made in the matter. A critical examination of the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft had already been prepared in the Petroleum Department when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s draft concession was received. It was however agreed at a Departmental Conference that it would be advisable to defer sending this until a comprehensive statement could be drawn up, comparing the relative merits of the two drafts# In point of fact, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company^ draft was not received in the Petroleum Department until September 14th, at a time when, as it happened, the staff of the Department was depleted by illness, and many other more urgent questions had to be dealt with. It cannot be accepted, moreover, that the delay of 4 years, to which Mr. Mellon refers, can be attributed to the Petr oleum Department, and it would be futile to suggest that a delay of a few weeks in comparing the terms of the draft concessions has in any way prejudiced the Eastern and General Syndicate or the Anglo-Persian Oil C omp any• Tbe points involved in considering the draft concessions raise technical questions of some difficulty, but the secretary for Mines hopes to be in a position to submit a statement comparing the two draft concessions withinthe next few days# A copy of this letter is being sent to the Colonial Office, India Office and Admiralty* I am, etc., tsgd.)

The Eastern and General Syndicate refer rather vaguely to 'exploratory work' by geologists and engineers, which they undertake to begin within 9 months of the date of the concession, failing which the Shaikh may cancel the Concession. Nothing is said as to drilling and the Syndicate require a period of 5 years for their exploratory work. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company ask for a maximum period of two years for exploratory work, which will be Company# Note The comparison is made between the third draft Eastern and General Syndicate.

The work of proving and developing an oilfield involves very heavy capital expenditure and companies are not likely to be attracted unless therejis a guarantee of their being able to obtain a long period in which they may have an opportunity oi securing a return on the money expended. There are precedents for such a period as is now asked for in Iraq, where the period granted by the Iraq Government is 75 years, in Persia ( where the period is 60 years, and in Bahrain where a similar period is provided for* In his letter of the 2t&gt;th august, l 'j 3 (36/1952) the Political Resident mentions that he understands that the Shaikh himself asked for a period of 70 years. Area . The right to explore the whole territory of Kuwait and select an area for ultimate development not exceeding 1,640 square miles divided into 6 or more blocks. Area * The draft agreement covers the whole of Kuwait territory for the whole period of the concession. Comment . The Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s draft Concession provides for the grant of the whole of the area of Kuwait, for the period of the concession* On the other hand, the Eastern and General Syndicate provide for the selection within 5 years of an area amounting in the aggregate to 1,640 square miles, this area may be divided up into six or more blocks, and by such an arrangement they presumably hope to secure all promising oil bearing territory which is woifch having. ■*•3 ** •'6 ? having* The value activities to 1,640 than real* of their proposal to limit their square miles is, therefore, more apparent There would appear to be definite advantages in having the whole of this rather limited territory developed by one Company of good standing. Competitive development of an oilfield by two or more Companies seldom produces the best results as it tends to lead to unnecessary loss of gas pressure and premature exhaustion of the field, as has been the case in many fields in the United States. The operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Persia are generally accepted as being in accordance with the best Modern practice of unit dev el opment. It may be mentioned that in the case of Iraq there was in the original concession a provision for the selection of areas* So much difficulty arose in regard to this matter that the Iraq Government agreed in the revised Concession granted last year, to accept the Iraq Petroleum Company’s proposal for the grant to them of exclusive rights over a large area amounting to about 36,000 square miles, or nearly twice the area of Kuwait* Incidentally the Eastern and General Syndicate refer to the area to be reserved to them as M Cnnceded Territory”* There are obvious objections to the use of such a term and this should be replaced by ”Leased Area”. Working Obligations . The Concession to become void unless the Company has commenced ex ploratory work within a period of 9 months from the date of the Concession* If, after commen cing operations following the exploratory period of five years, the Company discontinue the same for a continuous period of 2 years the Shaikh shall have the right td cancel the Agreement. Working Obligations * After a maximum period of two years for exploration, the Company undertake within a period of 2 years to drill in a workmanlike manner a total depth over all of at least 4,000 feet. If the Company fails to carry out its obligations, or to make the necessary payments, the Shaikh has the power to terminate the Agreement. Comment • • • •Comment . Nothing is said in the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft concession as to drilling obligations, and as the draft now stands they would have carried out these obligations if they only did surface and shallow geological drilling. It may be suggested that they will have to do such work as will enable them to select their areas, but as the comment on this question indicates they can select any number of blocks in choosing their 1,640 square miles. In Bahrain the Eastern and General Syndicate obtained a concession in 1925» This provided for an Exploration period of 2 years and a Prospecting period of 2 years, subject to extensions. In 1927 the Syndicate assigned their rights to American interests, and they have not yet taken up a kining Lease. They have recently applied for a further extension of the prospecting period and have only recently begun work on a second well. On the other hand, to undertake to drill at least 4,000 ft* overall in a period which under the terms of the draft cannot exceed 4 years, and may be less,the Angl©-Persian Oil Company does give an indication of serious endeavour to prove oil. Further the provision in the i^astex-n and General Syndicate’s draft that they may discontinue operations for continuous periods up to 2 years before they run the risk of losing their concession is unusual, and hardly indicates an intention to carry on exploitation as speedily as possible. A provision of this kind is included in some oil concessions, but six months is a much more usual period, although a period up to 12 months is sometimes provided for.

A royalty of Rs.2-10 per ton of petroleum, subject to the following payments. During the 1st year Rs.50,000 plus any royalty accrued with minimum payment of Rs.65,000; during the 2nd year a minimum of Rs.80,000 and annually thereafter a minimum of Rs.100,000 unless operations are interrupted through causes outside the control of Company when payment will continue at annual rate of Rs.25,000. If the Company fail to make a declaration as to commercial production by a date in 1941 to be specified, the Shaikh to have power to call upon the Company either to make the declaration forthwith or to lose the concession. COMMENT . ^ It will be seen that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company offer a higher amount on signature of the Concession, and a higher annual amount when they commence drilling (which must happen within 2 years of signature of the concession). Except for the first year after the declaration that oil has been produced in commercial quantities, their minimum royalty is also higher than that offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate. It will also be observed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must make a declaration by a date to be specified in 1941, that oil has been found in commercial quantities or surrender the concession. In the Eastern and Seneral Syndicate’s draft this question has to be settled by arbitration. Bearing in mind the absence of any specific drilling obligations during the period of-6- )U ! *» Comment # • • o of 5 years provided by the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft for the exploration period, it seems unlikely that there would be much prospect of taking the Syndicate to arbitration at an earlier date than that by which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must make their declaration. After the declaration that commercial production has been obtained the Syndicate offer a tonnage royalty of 3 Rs. 8 annas per ton and the Anglo_Persian Oil Company a royalty of 2 Rs.10 annas. To decide which of these is better in the interests of the Shaikh depends on the production which is likely to be secured. And here the amount of the minimum royalty is important. Generally speaking, the Company with the higher minimum royalty will have the greater inducement to produce oil. It may also be said that too high a tonnage royalty may retard production, and here the provision in the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft, allowing a cessation of operations should not be lost sight of. The rate of royalty y offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate is the same as that in India, but there is a local market to absorb all the production. The rate offered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is approximately the same as that levied by the Iraq Governments In Venezuela the rate of royalty is understood not to exceed 2/- a ton in most instances, while in Trinidad there are many leases with a royalty of from 1/6 to 2/**; altnough in recent years a royalty of 3/— has been imposed. In the case of both these countries, over 90 per cent of the oil has to be exp orted. . Customs Duty. The Company undertake ) Customs Duty.

But where the State is the owner of the minerals it is regarded as preferable that the State should take the whole of its financial return in the shape of royalty. Apart from the principle involved there is bound to be some difficulty in assessing the value of the oil for purposes of the duty, whether at the well head, or port of shipment. There are some cases in which royalty is charged on the basis of a percentage of the value of the oil won, and endless difficulty has arisen in finding a satisfactory method of determining the value. In Trinidad, where the Government owns the greater part^ of the minerals and the question has been thoroughly considered, the idea of an export tax has been definitely abandoned as un suitable .

The Company should give an undertaking at all times during the continuance of the Concession to carry on all opera tions for winning and working crude oil, and natural gas in a skilful and workmanlike manner and in accordance with modern approved methods; to maintain all productive borings in good repair, working order and condition and to take all practical measures to prevent the injurious access of water to the oil bearing formations. 3, The Company should furnish an annual report of tbeir operations, together with a plan showing the location of all wells drilled. They should also keep accurate records of the drilling logs of all wells, showing all casing inserted and any water horizons passed through* 4* All abandoned boreholes should be plugged so as to prevent ingress of water, and excavations fenced off if the Company is required to do so. 5. There should be a provision for the measurement of any oil won, for purposes of ascertainment of royalty* A draft of a suitable clause is appended. 6. It may be desirable to provide for the revision of the rate of royalty at intervals of, say, 10 years, on the application of either party, such revision to be based on the general trend of world prices for petroleum products. Minimum and maximum rate of royalty should be laid down in the first instance. 7. It is usual to provide for a royalty on any natural gas sold. The equivalent of 2d.(? 2 annas) per thousand cubic feet is suggested as a suitable rate. It might also be proOther o • • provided that in the event of casing-head gasoline being produced the Shaikh may fix a royalty at a rate not exceeding the equivalent of i/ 2 d. a gallon, 8 » The Shaikh (?

On the termination of the Concession the Company should undertake to deliver/ up to the Shaikh without payment of compensation in good order and repair and fit for further working all productive wells or borings together with all casings and fixtures below ground level, as well as all buildings, wharves, roads, pipelines and railway lines.Other points will need consideration but as some arise on one draft Concession and some on the other it will save time if these are deferred until a decision has been taken by the Shaikh as to which application he desires to accept.

My dear Ambassador* Since I wrote to you on November 11th about Kowelt oil* I have been considering the question* on which* as you know* I was not In possession of fUll details at the time of cur interview. I have* therefore, come to it with # fresh mind, and one or two points have at once struck me. 2o The memorandum which you left with me on November 2nd might be interpreted as implying that His Majesty’s Government have been purposely procrastinating in regard to the participation of American interests in the development of Koweit oil for over four years. But, apart from the fact that the Anglo-Persien Oil Company were in the field in Kcweit long before the British concern which is now acting for the United States interests* I wish xc make it clear that the decision of His Majesty’s Government (which was communicated to the Eastern and General e Excellency The Honourable Andrew w. Mellon. 3General Syndicate in November 1938) that any ell concession which might be granted must contain a clause which would confine it to British Interests, was taken on grounds of general policy and before we had heard anything of American participation in the matter. The decision wes in fact taken In pursuance of the then existing general policy of His Majesty*s Government which had been In force for many years, and also because the Sheikh of Koweit, whose interests they ere, cf course, under an obligation to protect, expressed himself as unwilling to grant a concession to any company not under British control. It wee not until December 1'J, 1938, that the Syndicate informed the colonial office of their agreement with the Sastern Gulf Oil company, by which the concession, if obtained, was to be transferred to United States Interests. His Majesty's Government did not however feel able to change their decision until, in December 1931, your Embassy first made representations in the matter. Then His Majesty’s Government, in their - ncj eculd to meet the United desire to go ss far as vnej eeuxu States faStates Government, reconsidered the question and decided after much deliberation that, while they could not commit the Sheikh of Kcweit, they would, for their part, not insist in this case that any concession granted must contain a clause confining it to British interests, if the Sheikh for his part was willing to grant a concession without such a clause, and we so Informed your Embassy in April* 3o Your memorandum also reverts to the representa tions made in Atherton’s official note No. 231 of the 6th September, to the effect that the American interests with the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company cring to their igncranc&lt; of the provisos which His Majesty's Government would requi: to see embodied in the concessions granted, in order to safeguard their own interests* But surely these represent* tions were satisfactorily answered in Sir John Simon’s reply, No. E 4582/121/21 cf the 16th September* As I understand it, the 'safeguards' are a matter for discuseion after the Sheikh cf Kcw-it has made his decieici from the point of view cf whet ie tc the t***t advantege cf hishl» own '-tet©. (i am advised that though no final decision has been taken on the point it is net unlikely that at least soma of them would equally have to be embodied in sny concession which might be granted to a purely British Oil company wishing itself to operate in Koweit), As these safeguards are not primarily the concern of the Sheikh, and will not effect the comparison of the two draf t concessions on their merits, they do not in our view effect the matter at the present stage* 4* As you know, that stage is that the latest draft concession submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the draft submitted by the Anglo-Persian Oil Competoy have been compared in London by the department concerned on the technical side in order that the Sheikh, who is naturally net well versed in such technical matters, may understand vhat in fact will be the effect of the main provisions of each offer (eog* the financial side, conditions of working the oil, etc., etc.,)* The resulting document is now on its way to the Persian Gulf ©nd we must await the reeuit of the Sheikh’s examination. 5. The two offere made for tha concession are thusthus being treated concurrently, and that, I feel sure you will appreciate, was the cja2y correct course for His M8j8Sv,y s ^ernnient to take in order to secure the most acceptable terms for the Sheikho If only in hie interest, His Majesty's Government were naturally bound, as Sir John Simon informed Atherton in his note Ho* E 1735/121/91 of the O'th April, to allow any interested company to consider whether they wanted, to apply for a concession, and if so to give them time to do so© The Anglo-Persial Oil Company formally renewed their efforts to obtain a concession in Kowett in August, 1951 (not October as mentioned in your memorandum)© 6* I regret that there has been delay in the whole matter; I cannot of course at this stage say exactly when the Sheikh will decide to gx*ant a concession; I do hope, however, that in the light of the preliminary information I have now given, you will be able to assure your Government that there has been no desire on our part to cause them embarrassment by any avoidable delay© Believe me, My deer Ambassador, Yours sincerely,CONFIDENTIAL, No. 956-S of 1932* The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Political Agent, Kuwait. and is directed to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document/ British Residency •'7 ■' and Consulate-General, /x BUSHIRE.

The matters dealt with in the deleted paragraphs will be taken up at a later stage. Also last sentence of all, commencing 'when Shaikh has made his choice” should be deleted, this being a matter for you to arrange with Shaikh and you should take a suitable opportunity of bringing suggestion in that sentence to his notice. As you are aware, it is very desirable from point of view of His Majesty’s Government to reach a definite decision as soon as possible in view of pressure now being brought to bear by American oil interests and it is hoped that you and Political Agent, Kuwait, will now be able to persuade Shaikh to reach a decision between the rival applicants in the light of information contained in memo randum which will be communicated to him as above. You will a preciate that it is most important in case Shaikh decides in favour of Anglo-Persian Oil Company that His Majesty’s Government should be able to avoid any suggestion that pressure has been brought tu bear on him, or that decision is not the Shaikh’s own. In the circumstances, while you and Political Agent are at liberty to give Shaikh an v . explanations for which he may ask, e it her of the state ments in memorandum^or of effects in the light of that draft concession, you should leave it entirely to him to make the choice on his sole responsibility.

Dickson is in possession of copies of all the inter-departmental correspondence referred to by you. 2. The Shaikh of Kuwait is at present on a visit to Bahrain and cannot return before 29th December. 3. The earliest date on which Dickson can reach Bushire is 1st January. This, however, would involve his absence from Kuwait during the visit of Naval Commander in Chief from 3rd to 6th January. 4. viork of translating Petroleum Department’s memorandum into Arabic will take time, and during Commander in Chief’s visit Shaikh will not be able to study memenandum or discuss points on which he may desire advice. X think it most desirable that 1 should explain such points to Shaikh personally, but Commander in Chief visits Rushire from 7th to 9th January, and I can leave for Kuwait only after Commander in Chief’s visit. 5 . I therefore propose to instruct Dickson to communicate (amended) memorandum to Shaikh on 8th January, make at the same time the oral explanation mentioned in paragraph 1 of your telegram No. 9, ask the Shaikh to study the memorandum ( which will certainly take him some days), inform him that I shall arrive Kuwait 11th January to dis- « -cuss any points which he wishes cleared up, and let the local representatives of the Anglo Persian Oil Company and tne Eastern and General Syndicate know that the Shaikh has received comments of H.M* s.

The Admiralty* a letter if I may say so is rather to the point, and largely voices ay own views. 8. You remember I discussed the question with you, as to what would happen, and in whose favour the Shaikh would be likely to decide {Anglo Persian Oil Company or The General ^astern Syndicate) after he receives His Majesty*s Governments final criticisms on the two draft agreements. 4. Presumably His Majesty’s Government*a final letter will take the form of a comparative statement, showing where the A.P0.C*s offer is superior to that of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and vice versa. Presumably also they will not advise the Shaikh as to which of the two concessions it would be to his advantage to accept. 5 # If my presumption is correct and this happens a I have the uncomfortable feeling that the Shaikh will express his gratitude and thanks to His Majesty*s Government for all the trouble they have taken in hi® interest, to make the matter so clear, and will then proceed to give the concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate.

All this the Shaikh told me on his return, saying that rajor Holmes on their arrival refused to alio?/ Shaikh Hamad to take him (the Shaikh) away to his own palace, and that Shaikh Hamad did not seem to mind at all* The plot seems to have nicely arranged between Shaikh Hamad and Major Holmes with the Shaikh, as a willing victim* Certain it is that the Shaikh Is profoundly grateful to Major Holmes / and for all he did for him. 4. The Sheikh apparently spent a good deal of time out at the oil works in Bahrain, and wan highly impressed, as it was no doubt intended he should be* He talked much of the 'gushing' oil that he saw around him etc. etc* 5 , Major Holmes’ move was a clever piece of pro paganda , and was of course his reply to the recent invitation of the A.P.O.C. to personally conduct the Bhaikh round 'Fields' at Masjid Sulaiman. Looking hack on events I have little doubt now In my own mind that it was Major Holmes who largely put into the Shaikh’s mind that to land in Persia was unsafe, and then having disposed of the A * I' • 0 * 0 *, planned the Bahrain expedition just to show what h&amp; could do. 6, As I have already informed you, on his return * to Kuwait, Major Holmes had an official invitation awaiting the Shaikh from the Eastern and General Syndicate asking him to be their guest in London during the coming summer. This was duly presented to the Shaikh, and looked jovy ^ell. 7# Major Holmes ■ sudden midnight departure for Basrah and London on 29th December 1982 X have not boon able tc fathom yet.

He just dis appeared.8# I mention the above facts rather at length for your information solely and to show you the type of man our Major Hotaos Is, 9* A point worth mentioning X think is the fact that during the past 10 days or so, there hae been a consider able amount of anti A.l •0#C* propaganda in Kuwait, Xt may r or may not have its origin in Major Holmes, Personally I rathe think it started with him, and was deliberately spread by his various 'Jaokals* in the Town, Of course one will never be able to prove tthis, The propaganda has taken the form of malicious gossip against the A,P*0*C. in the matter of their dispute with Persia, w^ich is quoted as a very good oxomplo of what a dangerous thing it is for a small end weak State to have dealings with a powerful company whose principal shareholder i© the British Government, These latter are made out to be oppressors of the weak and ever ready to trample on the rights of small nations and communities# In fact Britain’s policy today Is made out to be put of running away from people who stand up to her, and bullying those who ore too weak to do so, 10 , Of course X realise that the above propaganda may emanate from Persia, but X prefer to put my finger on Major Holmes,COx&lt; ffliJ&amp;ffr IAL .
