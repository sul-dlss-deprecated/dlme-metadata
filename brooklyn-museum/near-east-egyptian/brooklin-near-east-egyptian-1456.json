Inscriptions to the god Shed are rare. Workmanship poor. \r\nThe figures of the god Shed and Horus occupy slightly more than half of the face. They stand facing each other each grasping a sceptre. Two columns of inscriptions are in front of him. The lower part of the stela shows the scribe Nefer-Sekerew kneeling before a table of offerings under which is his name. The upper right column of inscriptions is not easy to read but appears to be \"Horus son of Isis.\"\r\n\r\nCondition: Bad, each side badly chipped. Center of face flaking, entire piece worn. Faint traces of red remain on the body and face of the kneeling scribe.", "medium": "Limestone", "dimensions": "10 5/16 x 7 1/16 x 1 9/16 in.
