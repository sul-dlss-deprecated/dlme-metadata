He is a graduate of the Sorbonne University, returned to Baghdad from Pans in 1926, and was appointed a Professor in the Baghdad Law School. In 1928 he was transferred to the post of Director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but resigned two years later as the result of a quarrel with the Minister, Abdullah Damluji. Accompanied Nuri Pasha on his visit to Mecca in 1931 ; later on is said to have had a violent quarrel with him. This led to his quitting ’Iraq in the Autumn of 1932 and taking service under Ibn Sa’ud as Legal Adviser in the Sa udi ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Baghdad it is now rumoured that he has quickly tired of his new Master, whose methods are naturally repugnant to one educated in the principles of European law.

With reference to the semi-official note from the Eastern Department to mv ^hancery No 1338 | 16 4|25 of November 25, I have the honour to state that Mr. Hope-Gill was unable to extract any information from' the so-called Assistant Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs here regarding the date ol exchange of ratifications and entry into form of the Treaty of December 1931, between Ibn Sa ud and the Imam Yahya, I therefore wrote personally to Fuad Bey Hamza on January 1, explaining that the information was needed for purely documentary purposes. When I reminded Fuad Bey of my letter in conversa tion on January 9, he replied that the ratification had been effected by an exchange of telegrams the dates of which were not in his possession, but he was obtaining them from Riyadh. 2. I took the opportunity of asking Fuad Bey about the mission which the King was understood to have sent to San’a making it clear that mv inquiry was dictated by a purely general interest in the relations between two monarchs whom His Majesty’s Government liked to see on good terms with each'other I said that my information was a little confused. It had been announced in the Umm-al-i^ura that the King was sending a representative to San’a. (This announcement was made in the issue of November 4, under the heading “ New endeavours of His Majesty the King for the union of Arabs. Negotiations with Yemen.”) Subsequently an impression had grown up that this referred to the despatch of Sheykh Hamad Suleyman and Khalid Bey al Qarqani, and that thev had been held up by the revolt in ’Asfr. 3. Fuad Bey said there had been no question of sending Shevkh Hamad and his companion to San a Their destination had always been ’Asfr, where it was at first intended that they should investigate the situation and where thev lemained after the outbreak of the revolt.

The King had sent quite independently another officer direct from Riyadh to San’a in the person of Muhammad Ibn Dhawi, a “ clerk ” in his diwan. The object was to discuss in a friendly spirit various outstanding matters, among which Fuad Bey specifically mentioned frontier delimitation. 4. Fuad Bey said that Muhammad ibn Dhawi was still in San’a. He pro mised spontaneously to inquire about the course of the negotiations and to let me know the result of his inquiries. When thanking him, I repeated that my interest in the matter was general and that while I should be glad to have any further information, I did not wish to be importunate. All that really concerned us was to know that the rulers concerned were in good relations, as we were all for peace in Arabia. Fuad Bey made the remarks which are now usual about the excellent attitude of the Imam in regard to the ’Asfr revolt, of which he disapproved. I said that all my own information supported the belief that the Imam had no desire to embroil himself. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Chief Commis sioner at Aden.

I have the honour to state that, according to information derived from the local press and other sources, Sheykh Kamil al Qassab arrived in Jedda on December 4, and proceeded to Riyadh where he saw Ibn Saud. He returned from Riyadh on January 2, and embarked next day for Egypt on his way to Haifa. One informant states that he was given a substantial sum by the Minister of Finance on instructions from the King. 2. Al Qassab had at one time an official position in this country as Director of Education, though it is not quite clear whether he held it under King Husein or the present King. His name has appeared several times in recent intelligence reports from Palestine as that of an ardent supporter of Ibn Saud and an advocate of the projected Arab Congress being held at Mecca. 3. In view of the difficulty of determining Tbn Sand’s real attitude towards the Arab Congress idea, it would be of great interest to this Legation to know whether al Qassab’s proceedings or utterances on his return to Palestine throw any light on the subject. 4.

The Vice-Consul was confident that it was still going on but on a very small scale. He believes seldom more than 3 slaves at a time are shipped and often only one. Small Sambouks are used and adults are not as a rule dealt in. The Chef de Cabinet in the course of conversation only reiterated what French officials have been saying for years, i.e., that slave traffic through French Somaliland is non-existent ; that the coast is too well patrolled. I ascertained that the coast from the head of the Gulf pf Tajura to Raheta a distance of 115 miles was in charge of a District Commissioner with a small party of native camelry stationed at Obak so it is doubtful if the patrol is in any way effective. The District Commissioner is the only European official employed in this region. There seems little prospect of combating the trade until the French take an active interest. Mr. Lowe assured me that there would be no difficulty in the French authorities obtaining information if they really wanted to. ######•»* 6. Ras-al-Ara. * ****** In the evening of 13th November, having received information of a rising in Asir by the Idrissi against Ibn Sa’ud’s suzerainty, proceeded to Aden to store and fuel. m ******* i £###***•* On reaching the vicinity of Hodeida it was realised that it would be im practicable to land so course was shaped for Kamaran arriving at 1600. Kamaran .—The Administrator, Captain Wickham, visited the ship shortly afterwards. He had no fresh information regarding affairs in Asir except a rumour that the attack by the Idrissians on Gizan had failed for the present. 9. On 18tH November, Captain Wickham received a personal letter from Seyyid Abid al Idrissi (nephew of the Idrissi) announcing a revolt due to Sa’udi oppression, and the restoration of the Idrissi’s authority in Asir. Abid en quired as to the attitude of the British Government and under what conditions they would contemplate an agreement. The purport of this letter was passed to the Chief Commissioner, Aden. About the same time unconfirmed reports announced the capture of Sabia and Gizan by the Idrissians. On 20th November information was received that Tbn Sa’ud had re-captured Gizan, having sent troops by sea and attacked under cover of darkness. 10. Hodeida .—The weather having moderated I sailed early on 21st Novem ber for HODEIDA and arrived at 1115 The Political Clerk, Mohamed Saleh Jaffar came on board on arrival and a salute was fired on ascertaining that the local authorities were prepared to return it. ^ *11. Saleh Jaffer informed me that the Governor Saif-al-Islam al Hussein, fourth son of the Iman, was sick and that the Assistant Governor, Kazi Ali Bin Hussein Al-Amri would receive my call. I landed at 1600 and was me f a guard and band about 120 strong and several of the principal Officials ot the district were presented to me before proceeding to the Government Offices. My reception was most friendly and it was obvious that a visit trom one ot H. M. Ships was considered an honour. The Governor sent a message saying how sorrv he was not to be able to meet me. He invited me to send a telegram to the Iman which I did expressing pleasure at the opportunity ot visiting HODEIDA and appreciation of my reception. The Iman replied thanking me for my message and welcoming our arrival. Later in the day a dhow came oil bringing gifts from the Governor con sisting of 2 oxen, 3 sheep, chickens, eggs, coffee, and bananas. In return I sen some cases of tinned fruits, jams and syrup, which it is believed are appreciatec. 12 The following morning the Acting Governor accompanied by Saleh Jaffer and three members of Al Hussein’s Staff returned my call. He wns shown over the ship in which he displayed great inteiest and expressed a, hope that we would pay more frequent visits to HODEIDA. As he was unquestion ably acting in the place of the Governor who was sick, I ga\e him a salute o 15 guns on leaving, this being the number accorded by British and Italian warships on previous visits. From information obtained from the Political Clerk, it appears that the Iman, while secretly encouraging the revolt in ASIR, is not giving any open support. Proceeded at 1130 and returned to K AM ARAN. 13. Kamaran .—On 21st November about 95 refugees including 50 male adults, arrived, mostly from GIZAN ; amongst these were Seyyid Abid, accompanied by his cousin Seyyid Hussein and a party of 30. Abid had hoped to receive an answer to his letter with request for an agreement and handed a further letter to the Administrator with definite suggestions including pro posals for a grant by the Idrissi of Oil and Salt concessions in FARISAN and GTZAN respectively in return for help. The text of this letter was passed to ADEN. 14. Abid accompanied by Hussein called on me on 23rd November. He was in formed beforehand that I could in no way discuss the rights and wrongs of the political situation ; an arrangement to which he endeavoured to comply but was unable to resist, expressing bitter feelings against Ibn Sa’ud stating also that all the Idrissians needed wure arms and ammunition and that they were more afraid of the Iman than Ibn Sa’ud. In the course of conversation he meutioned having visited H. M. S. “ ODIN some years ago at GIZAN and asked why no British A\arships came there now. Abid is a pleasant, plausible fellow with a keen sense of humour and his troubles do not appear to weigh heavily upon him. Hussein had little to say. 15. On 24th November Abid was informed by the Administrator that he must leave the island and he sailed for MASSAM A on the 25th. Later it was reported that, on encountering some Idrissian dhows and hearing that the Idrissi was about to start a new offensive, he transhipped, sent his family on to MASSAWA, and landed at MADAYA (about half way between GIZAN and MEDI). Confirmation of this has been received and it is since reported that SABI A and the Wells at GIZAN have been recovered by the Idrissians. The Sa’udi troops in GIZAN are obtaining water from FARISAN. A wounded Saudi soldier who arrived with two others from GIZAN on 23rd November is being treated in the hospital. Proceeded on patrol west of the reef area at 1600 on 30th November. ****** *• Lcf62FD6 (7) {Received on 11th March 11)33, with Political Secretary’s, letter ho. 8, dated 23rd February 1933.)

Proceeded to KAMARAN by the North passage and arrived at 1800. 3. Kamaran .—There was no information to show any change in the situa tion in ASTR. All refugees had been ordered to leave the island and were clear by 7th December. Accordingly I proceeded with the programme originally projected having ascertained that the Chief Commissioner Aden concurred that the presence of the ship at KAMARAN was no longer necessary. PARIS AN ISLANDS were deliberately avoided in order that there should be no impression of British countenance or support of the revolt. I had consulted with the Chief Commisioner whep at ADEN with regard to the policy it was desirable to adopt. ** * * * * * • 7.

Mukalla .—MUKALLA was reached on the morning of 18th December, a few dhows being boarded on passage. Calls we’re exchanged with fhe Wazii*, Seyyid Bubakar Husein, representing the Sultan who was absent in India. We had a friendly reception and were entertained to luncheon iri the Sultan’s Palace. Motor cars were placed at our disposal for a duck shooting expedition. 14. Bir Ali .—Sailed at 1835 on 19th December and arived on the follow ing morning at BTR ALI. There was a strong easterly wind blowing and landing was difficult. Visits were exchanged with the Representative of the Sultan who was absent in ADEN. The Representative complained that his neighbours from BAL HAF (20 miles west of BTR ALI) had arested two dhows and imprisoned six of his villagers and asked if I could do anything to procure their release. It was a coincidence that when at ADEN the Chief Commissioner had asked me to visit BAL HAF as well as BTR ALI m order to avoid jealously as a good deal of friction existed between the two tribes.8 * 15. Bal Haf. —I reported the complaint to the Chief Commissioner and pro ceeded to BAL HAF. The Sultan was friendly but somewhat deaf and loqua cious. I believe lie felt that the ship had been sent specially to BAL HAF on account of the existing circumstances. The result of my proceedings are reported in Enclosure No. 2 herewith.

I beg to report that I interviewed the Sultan of Bal Haf this morning and informed him of your message 1956 of 20th December, having ascertained previously that the report from BIR ALI was correct. 2. On request I gave him written instructions to release the dhows and their crews. He then stated that the crews had already been released shortly before the arrival of H. M. S. “ HASTINGS ” (1600—20th December), but that the dhows were still at BAL HAF. After some discussion he promised to send a message to BIR ALI forthwith requesting that men should be sent to take them away. r - 3. It apears that the dhows were detained as a reprisal for the theft of four canoes from the fishing village of J1LLAA. The canoes were not actually stolen by the Bir Ali but by a Bedouin tribe (Ahl-el-Adin from AL-HAMIA). Bal Haf stated that this Bedouin tribe were close friends of the Bir Ali and that the latter had incited and paid the former to commit the crime. 4. He also stated that he is always ready to obey the instructions of the British Government but that his tribe are very indignant at the loss of the canoes and he fears there may be trouble if the canoes are not returned or compensation paid.

The article is chiefly of interest as making express mention of non-Moslems as prospective concessionaires, in open contrast to the policy which appeared to be in contemplation in 1931, when, for instance, it was definitely recommended by the “ National Conference ” convened in June of that year that concessions should be granted to Moslems only. 3. The policy 6f confining concessions to Moslems held the field, though perhaps more in theory than as a genuine factor in Ibn Sa’ud’s schemes for economic development, until recently. It has now perhaps been felt that the arrival here on February 15 of Messrs. Twitchell and Hamilton, representing American mining and oil interests, needed some public explanation. 4.

The Government most sincerely desire that Moslems should not fail to undertake this business. We remember that His Majesty the King last season expressed in his speech, which was published in the “ Umm-al- Qura ” issue No. 383, that he would have no objection to any of the Moslem Kino- s Princes or merchants wishing to make humane efforts in this country for the welfare of Moslems, provided that such efforts do not affect the prestige and honour of our countries, our independence and religion.

T } mye on maii y occasions during the last three years drawn attention to the difficulty created at this post by the fact that the,Sa’udi Ministry of Foreign Affairs has its headquarters in Mecca and that the visits paid to Jedda bv responsible members of the Ministry have been very irregular. As you are aware Sheykh Ali Taha, one of the assistants of the Governor of Jedda, was given early10 last, year the post of Assistant Under-Secretary of State, resident in Jedda, but has practically never been able to serve any useful purpose in that capacity except as a transmitter of messages. 2. Some weeks ago Fuad Bey Hamza informed me that he had arranged to visit Jedda regularly every Saturday after Ramadhan, i.e.&gt; roughly from the beginning of Febiuary. He has in fact been available in Jedda on the forenoon of most Saturdays since that date. The Ministry has now informed the foreign missions by a circular that the branch of the Ministry in Jedda will be open every Saturday for the i eception of foreign representatives. The circular adds that the Under Secretary (or Deputy Minister, as Fuad Bey prefers to call himself) will be prepared in exceptional circumstances to visit Jedda at other times at the request of the representatives. 3. I take this opportunity of stating that the effective arrangements of the Sa ? udi Government for dealing with foreign affairs remain otherwise unchanged. The Amir Feysal continues to be titular Minister and to play no apparent active role. Fuad Bey Hamza continues to be the only person with whom business can usefully be discussed. If the new arrangement is adhered to, it should alleviate the difficulties of which I have complained in the past.

In paragraph 32 of the Jedda Report for March (File No. 81-N/33), enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of April 7,1 mentioned that Ibn Sa'ud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of March 31. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year’s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian Vice-Consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year’s pilgrimage. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro- pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participents in this year’s Haj. 2. It is the King’s custom to speak at great length at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of April 6. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Leg ition. 3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity in Islam but he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in certain pas sages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one definite suggestion of any important omission. According to my Persian colleague the King gave as one of the reasons why he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fact that so many Moslem countries are under alien denomination. He is said to have included in the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain. If he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might gratify some of them. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department) to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt and Transjordan. MC364FDEnclosure 3 to Serial No. (13). Summary of the Speech delivered hy His Majesty King ‘Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud at the banquet given on the 31st March 1933 at the Royal Palace at Mecca. As published in the Mecca J7w2m-aZ-()wm No. 434 of the 11th Dhu’l Hijja 1351 (April 6, 1933). The Arab people, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God in the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilizing rain on the earth and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Muslims were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had ; and if they would but adhere to the commands of God, as given in the Quran and the sacred writings, they would be successful and united, but if they set aside these commands they would become separated and degraded. And this, the King went on, is what is happening now; and he drew a picture of the sad condition of the Muslim world in general and the Arab people in particular at the present time. Some people imagine, he said, that the only remedy for this state is for Muslims to adopt European civilisation ; but this was not true, for the teachings of the Quran guarantee prosperity, unity and happiness to those who follow them, because they make no differentiation between King and commoner, save in respect of piety alone. Nor were foreigners alone to blame for all the calamities which had overtaken Islam, for amongst Muslims themselves they found some who were misguided and who were willing to aid them to work against Islam. I am the Herald of Islam , the King concluded. He was an Arab Muslim who sen ed Islam and who worked for the spread of Islam and for Muslim unity \ and he was prepared to sacrifice himself and his family in the defence of Islam. He did not aim to be a chief of earth ; of greatest importance to him was to make God s word supreme, and in pursuit of this he cared for no difficulties. Many had opposed him since he first put forward this aim but had been vanquished. AY hat did they want of him ? His actions were clear ; he followed the AVay. It had been said that he claimed to be Khalif over all Islam. He made no such (laim. A Khalif must enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole world of Islam, and this was possible in the time of the Khalifat ; but was there a man who could so do at the present time ? It was clearly impossible and all he himself desired was unity and co-operation among Muslims. Behind him were more than 400,000 warriors ; if he wept they wept; if he re joiced they rejoiced and if he ecommanded they obeyed his commands These were the Troops of Unity, the brethren of all who obeyed God, ready to fi-ht for God and expecting nothing from it except to satisfy God ; and this was the force destined to confirm the Religious Law and Islam throughout the territories over which he ruled.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign- Office, No. 149 (1330/28/38), dated the 15th May 16,33. I have dealt in recent reports with two separate but inter-related subjects connected with the financial situation in this country, viz., {a) The proposed estab lishment of a National Bank under the auspices of the ex-Khedive (see correspon dence ending with my despatch No. 101 of April 5th); and {b) The position in regard to the payment of the Sa’udi Government’s debts, with special reference to debts in which His Majesty’s Government have a direct interest and to the use of drafts on customs to pay commercial debts (see correspondence ending with my despatch No. 123 of April 21st). 2. Both of these subjects have been brought into the lime-light as a result more particularly of the article by Mr. Philby in the Times of April 26th. So far as official circles in the Hejaz are concerned, silence had for some time brooded over the Bank proposal. They have, I think, been a little perturbed at receiving no news as to the progress made by ‘Abdul Hamid Shedid since he left on April 10th14 with his concession in his pocket and, I am now assured, a small sum of cash down for expenses. This has doubtless made Ibn Sa’ud and his entourage all the more sensitive regarding two misconstructions alleged to have been placed on Mr. Philby s article in the translation published by the A/,ram newspaper of Cairo. The Ahram version had, according to people here, laid the Sa’udi Government open to the accusations of having sold themselves to a group intending to create not a State Bank, as Mr. Philby called it, but an “ international ” bank and of having mortgaged their customs revenue. Both accusations were repudiated in a long and indignent leading article in the Umm-al-Qura of May 12th and the second was categorically denied in an official communique of May 11th, published in the same issue of the Umm-al Qura. I enclose a treanslation of the communique. The Umm-al-Qura also published a letter from Mr. Philby correcting the misconstruc tions placed on his article. 3. The Umm-al-Qura leader is not worth reproducing as it is mostly diatribe* The most interesting points in it are the stress laid on the importance of the distinc tion between a state bank and an international bank, an explanation of the methods hitherto used to pay off debts and the use of drafts on customs in that connexion and a rather weaker attempt to rebut the suggestion that the adoption of the Bank proposal means countenancing usury. It is claimed that the Government have paid off more than half their debts in the last two years and the hope is expressed that, if some of the economic projects now in view materialise, the remainder will be settled shortly. 4. All this may amount to little more than a passing storm in a teacup but I have though it worth recording as a sidelight on a curiously uncertain situation in regard to the proposed bank and the hopes that hang so largely, though not exclu sively, on the prospect of its being started. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt and to the High Commissioner for Transjordan. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (18). Extract from the 11 Umm-al-Qura ” of May 12th, 1933. Official Communique, dated 16th Muharram 1352 (11th May 1933). It has been rumoured by some people abroad that the Government have put in pledge their Customs Department in discharge of certain loans. The Govern ment confirm what they have already promulgated that they had not contracted any loan whatsoever and that they had not mortgaged the revenue of the Customs at all. (19) (Received on 11th June 1933 with Political Secretary s letter o. 21, dated the 25th May 1933.) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the India Office, No. 17963/33, dated the 17th May 1933. I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatch from the Resident at Aden regarding the succession to the Sultanate of Lahej. 2. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister agrees with the Resident’s views as to the atti tude which he should adopt in the matter, and, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare s concurrence, he proposes to approve the course of action suggested in paragraph 13 of the Resident’s despatch. 3. A similar letter is being sent to the Foreign Office and Air Ministry* * * Enclosure to Serial No. (19). Despatch from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, !No. 65, dated the 22nd March 1933. I have the honour to refer to the recent political events in Lahej in connection with the succession to the Sultanate, that have been reported briefly in Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 2260, et seq. (File No. 26-N/33). /\X 15 ft' * A r\. 2. For very many years the custom in regard to the succession to the Sultanate of Lahej has been that after the death of the reigning Sultan his successor is elected by certain tribal Aqils and Qadhis, who are entitled to do so. The election is then reported to the Resident, and the new Sultan is accorded official recognition unless there are very cogent reasons to withhold it. The customary procedure thus briefly outlined is common to the whole Protectorate. 3. There are five branches of the family of the Sultan of Lahej, in two of which (the Ali Muhsin and the Fadhl Muhsin) the succession has been confined, with fairly regular alternation, since the death of the common ancestor, Sultan Muhsin Fadhl, in 1847. 4. On the acceesion of the present Sultan, His Highness Sir Abdul Karim bin Fadhl Ali Muhsin, in 1915, the heads of the Fadhl Muhsin refused to recognise him. In 1919 a rapproachment was brought about between this dissident element and His Highness, but the animosity still smouldered, and in 1930 it broke out in the form of a conspiracy, instigated by these persons during the absence of His Highness in India, to remove him and to arrange the succession of a member of the Fadhl Muhsin branch. The conspiracy was discovered ; and, on his return from India, the Sultan took such action against the ringleaders as he hoped would put an end to overt opposition to his authority. 5. In consequence of this incident His Highness made tentative proposals to the Residency that he should ensure continuity in the succession by proclaiming his eldest son, Sultan Fahdl bin Abdul Karim as heir-apparent. My predecessor advised him not to do so and the matter appeared to have dropped. 6. On the 12th February of this year, however, His Highness informed me that at the instance of the electors, and with his permission, an election had been held, that his eldest son Sultan Fadhl bin Abdul Karim had been unanimously elected as his successor, and that he had accordingly nominated him as such. 7. His Highness had caused or allowed these steps to be taken without prior reference to the Residency, and I was about to express my objections to this proce dure when the report was received of the attempted assassination of Sultan Fadhl at the hands or at the instigation of the leaders of the Fadhl Mohsin branch {vide Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 2260, et seq). This new circumstances made it impolitic for me to advise His Highness to retract his recognition of Sultan Fadhl his successor, for the reason that His Highness’s acquiescence in my request might seem to be a concession to violence ; and I therefore considered it advisable to confine myself at the moment to asking His Highness for an explanation of the reasons that had prompted him in departing from the customary practice in regard to the succession. 8. In reply His Highness explained that his action was designed to guard against the strife and dissension that are the usual consequences of disputes regarding the succession on the death of a tribal Chief. He argued that the Sultanate of Lahej has come to be recognised as the centre of arbitration between tribal Chiefs over a wide area, and that it is therefore particularly necessary that continuous security and order should be ensured in it; and he pointed out that continuance of the custom hitherto existing in regard to the succession tended towards multiplicity of claimants and complexity of issue. He further contended that the electors, who are the custodians of custom, had themselves initiated the proposal of an election during his life-time, and that he had acceded to their wishes in the best interests of his State. 9. I have told His Highness that I am reporting what has occurred and the' explanation that he has given me to His Majesty’s Government. 10. A settlement of the succession during the life-time of the present Sultan will have considerable advantages if it is loyally observed when his death occurs. Since 1918 and especially during the past five years, the Sultanate of Lahej has assumed an immportance unknown before the Great War, pnncipallv due to the personality of the present Sultan and to his advisers and assistants from his own branch of the family. And the very close contact that has been established between His Highness and the Residency in the consideration of all major matters of general importance in the Protectorate render continuity of succession (and consequently t)f policy), at Lahej, very desirable. MC364FD11. In view, however, of the uncertainty that must, in the nature of Arab tribal polity, still exist as to the actual accession of an heir-apparent on the death of a ruling Chief, I consider that official recognition of a pre-elected successor would seldom be effective, and ought not to be accorded. 12. While, therefore, I am sympathetic towards the efforts of the Sultan of Lahej to protect the admirable results of his organisation and industry in Lahej from disintegration at the hands of a less able, and possibly hostile, successor who might be elected from another branch of the family, after his death, I do not recommend any departure, on our part, from the existing procedure in regard to succession. 13. I propose, therefore, subject to your approval, to limit myself to informing His Highness that the election has been noted, but that formal recognistion of his successor must be deferred until the latter s actual accession to the feultanate ; and I intend to avoid the use of any expression that would imply a guarantee by His Majesty’s Government of the arrangement that has been made.

I am submitting this memorandum to my higher authorities here, but do not yet know whether it will be approved. I am sending copies of the enclosed revised draft to Parkinson at the Colonial Office, and, at his suggestion, to Peirse at the Air Ministry, with the necessary explanations.Enclosure to Serial No. (22). Attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the question of Arab Unity. 1. The phrase “ Arab Unity ” is an extremely vague one, which has been used in many different senses. 2. It is generally most in evidence on such occasions as Arab or Moslem congresses, and was freely bandied about during the Moslem Congress at Jeruselem in the autumn of 1931. On such occasions it is generally used extremely loosely as a popular rallying cry against either “ Western Imperial ism ’ or the Zionist movement; but in actual fact it seldom amounts to much more than a rather undigested idea of co-operation between Arabic speaking people in matters of education and propaganda, but to some extent also in such politico-religious questions as that of the Hejaz railway, the future of the Holy Places, etc. Arab unity in this sense is something rather akin to pan- Arabism, and appears to have no more practical significance than the rather shadowy pan-Islamic movement, of which so much was heard some ten or twenty years ago. 3. From the political and practical point of view, “ Arab unity ” should mean the union, either in a single State or in a confederation of autonomous States, of all former Ottoman territories, south of present-day Turkey, which have a predomi nantly Arab population. This would to some extent limit the application of the idea to the north-western half of Arabia— i.e., to the Arabic speaking territo ries north-west of a line drawn from the middle of the Persian Gulf to the southern end of the Red Sea. It is in fact only to this area that the idea can be regarded as properly applicable, and it is therefore mainly from this point of view that the question is discussed in the present memorandum. But attempts may well be made to extend the idea of Arab unity to the Persian Gulf states and south-eastern Arabia. It is thus not possible to consider the problem without touching on its possible relation to these areas also. 4. The idea of Arab unity, as applied to the former Ottoman territories, i.e., to the Arabic speaking areas north-west of the line mentioned in the preceding paragraph, was the ultimate aim of the Arab Revolt during the War, and was the ideal for which the Hashimites, under Hussein and Colonel Lawrence, strove during the war and armistice periods. There is no doubt that the remaining members of the Hashimite family—Faisal, Ali and Abdullah have never aban doned this dream, although subsequent developments have rendered it wholly impracticable. 5. The most important of these subsequent developments, from the purely Arabian point of view, has been the rise to power of Ibn Saud, and his conquest of the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former Kingdom of the Hejaz. The dynastic rivalry between the Hashimites and the Saudis renders it almost inconceivable that there could be any close or organic combi nation between the territories respectively ruled by them. It is true that King Feisal of Iraq has come to terms with King Ibn Saud and is now in friendly re lations with Saudi Arabia, and that we are working hard—with at last a fair hope of success—to secure a similar ra'p'prohment between Ibn Saud and tho Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. But the rivalry between the two family systems is still a basic factor in the situation, and unless one group were virtually to disappear, there seems no prospect whatever of any effective combination of the territories at present ruled by Ibn Saud (i.e., the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former kingdom of the Hejaz), with those at present ruled by the Hashimites, (i.e., the independent Kingdom of Iraq and the mandated territory of Transjordan). While the Arabs are themselves divided into these two great groups, any talk of Arab political unity in the wider sense must be illusory. 6. It would, moreover, be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to support either of these groups against the other, since they are bound by special obliga tions to both. Apart from the support which the Hashimites gave to the allied cause during the Great War, King Feisal and the Amir Abdullah have in the past shown themselves to be well-disposed towards His Majesty’s Government. It is not necessary to enter into details, but two recent cases in which the Amir4T 18 Abdullah has, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion of 1925, and the Felestine disturbances of 1929. More over, His Majesty's Government are bound to King Feisal of Iraq by the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, and have a special responsibility to support the Amir Abdullah’s regime which has been set up in Transjordan under their direct protection as mandatory. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government are bound by special ties to King Ibn Baud in Saudi Arabia. They have main tained friendly and indeed cordial relations with Ibn Saud ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. King Ibn Saud has not only main tained and developed these friendly relations but has proved himself capable of establishing and maintaining a stable and ordered Government in Arabia. It is moreover important for His Majesty’s Govermnent with their great Moslem interests in India and elsewhere, to remain on friendly terms with the ruler of the Holy Places of Islam. In these circumstances all that His Majesty’s Government can do is to attempt to hold the balance evenly between the Hashimites on the one hand and the Saudis on the other, and, while doing all in their power to pro mote friendly relations between the two, to refrain from any action which might lead to the predominance in Arabia of either house at the expense of the other. 7. Apart from this major difficulty, there are also other elements in Arabia proper which are unlikely to be capable of combination in any unified system. The most important of these are the independent kingdom of the Yemen, whose ruler is short-sighted and quarrelsomy and on uncertain terms both with Ibn Suad and King Feisal, though he ostensibly has treaties of friendship with both ; and the various minor Arabian rulers, such as the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, wdio are extremely jealous of each other and of their own independence, and have never shown any sign of capacity for political co-operation. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Aden Protectorate need not for the moment be considered in this connexion. On the other hand if the protagonists of the political ideas of “ Arab unity ” were ever to succeed in translating their ideal into practice, it is probable that they w^ould exercise strong pressure on the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and of Southern Arabia, and on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, to join in furthering their aim. Such Sheikhdoms as Koweit and Bahrain are in close touch with Iraq and Saudi Arabia, both commercially and politically. Moreover, all these States, including Muscat, maintain a fairly close link with Saudi Arabia through the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which is attended by many members of their ruling families. The pilgrimage offers exceptional opportuni ties not only for religious and cultural, but also for political, propaganda; and if Mecca were at any time to become a political centre of a united Arabia, or of a great Arabian confederation, it is possible that the political ideal for which it would stand might exercise a considerable attraction over the Arab rulers of the South Arabian and the Persian Gulf States and stimulate them to a greater desire to co-operate with the leading States of Western Arabia at any rate from the negative point of view of combatting western political and cultural influence in the Middle East. 8. As regards the minor Arab States of the Persian Gulf, an im portant consideration is the fact that, save in the case of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman (where, however, we exercise a dominating influ ence), the foreign relations of the rulers concerned are by treaty exclusively conduct ed by His Majesty’s Government and that His Majesty’s Government are bound by a series of treaties to give these States varying degree of protection against foreign aggression and to assist them to maintain their independence. Apart from these treaty obligations, it is a basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the Middle East that these states should not be absorbed by any of their powerful neighbours, but should remain as far as possible independent units under effective British control. The development of inter-imperial air comunications, both civil and military, has, in the last few years, given this well-established prin ciple a new importance. In the case of Koweit, both King Feisal of Iraq and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia have at various times shown signs of wishing to acquire a hold over this territory, which would be a useful acquisition to either. Both on treaty grounds, however, and on grounds of imperial policy, it is important to us that Koweit should not be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Similarly as re gards Bahrain, apart from our treaty obligations to protect the Sheikh against £aggression, it would be definitely against British interests that the islands should be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Persia. King Ibn Saud has already, by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, specifically recognised the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and is not likely therefore to seek to annex Bahrain. Meanwhile it is one of our main objects in our negotiations with Persia to obtain a similar recognition by Persia of our special relations with Bahrain, etc., and the abandonment of the antiquated Persian claims both to Bahrain and to certain other Arab islands in the Gulf. In these circums tances it would clearly to impossible for His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce in the incorporation of any of the smaller independent Arab States whether in the Persian Gulf or in Southern Arabia in a wider Arabian political combination. 9. Meanwhile in the north and west any project for Arab unity in any practical sense of the word must come into conflict with the mandatory system in the French Levant States and in Palestine, with all that that system implies. The French, even if they were prepared to agree, on certain conditions, to the emancipation of the State of Syria proper, have made it clear that they have no intention of relin quishing their hold on the predominantly Christian State of the Lebanon, or, for the present at any rate, on the curious non-Arab enclave of the Jebel Druse. His Majesty’s Government are equally precluded from allowing Palestine to be absorbed in any way in any kind of predominantly Arab union, if only in view of their deep commitment to the policy of the Jewish national home, quite apart from their obligations to the other non-Arab or non-Moslem Communities and interests in Palestine proper. 10. From the point of view of practical politics, therefore, the question of Arab unity resolves itself into the possibility of some kind of combination, providing for the inclusion of indigenous non-Arab elements such as the Assyrians, Kurds, etc., between Iraq, Transjordan and the State of Syria. 11. As regards Transjordan, the union or combination of which with Iraq would at first sight seem easiest, since Transjordan is at present a purely Arab State and since its ruler is the brother of King Faisel, an initial difficulty is presented by the fact that Transjordan is covered by the mandate for Palestine, of which it technically forms on integral part. It would therefore be necessary, before any effective combination between Transjordan and Iraq could be brought about, that His Majesty’s Government should arrange for the release of Transjordan from the mandate. Transjordan does not, however, at present appear to fulfil any of the conditions which have been laid down by the League of Nations as justifying the release of a territory from the mandatory regime. Even if Transjordan did to some extent fulfil these conditions a factor which might militate against her liberation from the mandate is the possibility that there may at no distant date be a Jewish settlement in Transjordan. While there can be no question of extending to Trans jordan the articles of the Palestine mandate which relate to the establishment of the Jewish national home, the existence of a Jewish minority in Transjordan would certainly increase the difficulties in the way of bringing the mandatory regime in that territory to an end. 12- As regards the State of Syria, there is no doubt that the French are seriously contemplating the possibility of its emancipation, and that King Feisal of Iraq, and Arab nationalists generally, both in Iraq and in Syria itself, are considering the possibility of a union of Syria and Iraq, perhaps under the rulership of a single individual. There are, however, various difficulties and objections to such a project. 13. In the first place, the French are unlikely to release their hold on Syria completely. Even if Syria were to be released from the mandate, it is probable that the mandate would be replaced by a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance on the lines of tlw Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The position would then be that the Syrian portion *f themew State, or confederation, whether it took the form of a republic or of a monar chy, would be bound to France, and would remain under predominantly French political and cultural influence while the Iraqi portion would be bound to this country under the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930 and would remain under predominantly British influence. This might well lead to a situation of international rivalry which would produce serious international complications. 14. Again, Syria is at present in a higher state of development than Iraq Although its people are perhaps less virile, its towns are larger and more flourishing, and its culture and civilisation are more advanced. In any case, it is a far more MC364FD9 agreeable country to live in. It is probable, therefore, that Iraqis would be increas ingly attracted to the Syrian towns of Damascus and Aleppo, and thus perhaps also to the even more definitely French district of the Lebanon or town of Beirut, and that Syrian—and thus French—influence would tend to establish itself increas ingly in Iraq proper. The capital of the new State might even be moved to Damascus whicn is an infinitely pleasanter town than Bagdad, and as a result Franco-Syrian influence might spread eastwards until the whole character of Iraq and of the politi cal relationship between His Majesty’s Government and that country might be* transformed. It is clear that the immediate interests of His Majesty’s Government, particularly in regard to the safety of inter-imperial communications, which have been so carefully protected by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, would suffer serious injury as the result of such a development. 15. The questions dealt with in paragraphs Nos. 12, 13 and 14 above were considered by the Ministerial Middle East sub-Committee of the Committee. of Imperial Defence on November 17th, 1931, and the relevant conclusions then reached ran as follows :— (1) That the outcome most likely to be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government would be the constitution of Syria as a repubhc with a Syrian as President; (2) That for a single individual to hold the crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in ay case, be hkely to prove . unworkable; (3) That any attempt by King Feisal to transfer his crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests. 16. Even were all these immediate dynastic and political obstacles to be surmounted, it is very doubtful whether real Arab unity could ever be achieved even between the major States such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc., if only for purely geographical reasons. In actual fact, notwithstanding its apparent homogeneity and compactness, there is no geographical unity in Arabia. The northren countries, such as Iraq, Syria, PaTstine and Transjordan, all differ widely from each other in configuration, soil, climante and general character. Southern Arabia, although it appears to possess a certain unity from a first glance at the map, can really more accurately be described as an archipelago of human settlements in a sea of desert, inhabited by tribes who are driven by the exigencies of desert life into becom ing, as it were, land pirates ceaselessly preying on each other. Any idea of unity or confederation based on the ordinary European conceptions which such words suggest is quite inapplicable to an area of this type. 17. But from the point of view of general international co-operation and under standing, of cultural development, and of economic prosperity, His Majestys’ Government can naturally only view with sympathy any movement which tends to bring the peoples of the Arabian countries into closer and more friendly relations with each other, provided, of course, that it is not incompatible with their special treaty relations and responsibilities towards certain of the States concerned. They have indeed always done whatever has been possible to this end. The improvement of the last few years in relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been mainly due to the efforts of His Majesty’s Government, who brought about the reconciliation bet ween King Feisal and King Ibn Saud on in board H. M. S. “ Lupin ” in February 1930. His Majesty’s Government are now actively engaged in trying to bring about a similar improvement in relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, and hope that these may lead to the conclusion of a treaty settlement, including treaties of friendship and bon visinage, between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, corresponding to the treaty settlement concluded between Saudi Arabia and Iraq * in April 1931. His Majesty’s Government have moreover always sought to further the close co-operation of the Arab countries in economic matters, and have suceeded in securing for Iraq and Transjordan, by suitable provisions in the relevant instru ments, the right to accord specially favourable tariff treatment to neighbouring Arab States, notwithstanding their most-favoured-nation obligations to other countries. 18. Should the question of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the problem of Arab unity be raised in the course of King Feisal’s impending visit to this country, it is submitted that it should be explained that the general attitudeof His Majesty’s Government will be one of friendly sympathy towards any cons tructive proposals for peaceful co-opertion and for the development of close and friendly relations among the leading states of Arabia ; King Feisal could be left to explain in greater detail exactly what he has in mind ; but, since it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government, for the reasons explained above, and especially in paragraphs 6, 8 and 15, to support any policy designed to bring about the political unification of Arabia, it seems desirable that any suitable opportunity should be taken to discourage King Feisal from identifying himself with, or committing himself to, such a project. Such discouragement might, for instance, take the form of advising His Majesty, as Sir Francis Humphrys has already done, that he can best serve the Arab cause by concentrating his energies on the peaceful development of his own country’s resources and institutions, so that the Government of Iraq may serve as a model and a source of encouragement to other Arab states. 19. In any case Sir Francis Humphrys has suggested that it would be well to do whatever may be possible to discourage King Feisal from holding a Pan Arab Congress in Bagdad, as it has been proposed that he should do this autumn. While the arguments which may be used with King Feisal against the holding of a Congress must necessarily depend to some extent on the course which the discussion of this aspect of the question with him may take, the following considerations might perhaps usefully be brought to His Majesty’s notice. 20. In the first place is it clear that none of the causes which King Feisal may be presumed to have most at heart— e.g., the consolidation and international standing of Iraq or the future prospects of the Hashimite family in general—are likely to be furthered by the holding of an Arab or Moslem Congress either in Bagdad or elsewhere at the present time. The proceedings of the Congress, for which King Feisal could not escape a considerable measure of responsibility, could hardly fail to produce an adverse reaction at least on the French, and therefore not only prove internationally embarrassing but als© render relations between Iraq and Syria more difficult. The opportunity of the Congress would moreover almost certainly be taken to raise in an acutely controversial form such embarrassing questions for the Hashimite family as that' of the Amir Abdullah’s attitude towards the Jewish Settlement in Transjordan, his relations, both now and in the recent past, with King Ibn Saud, and his attitude towards certain Arab parties in Palestine itself. Moreover, the Congress would almost certainly, as in the case of the Jerusalem Congress of 1931, give an opportunity to zealots or mischief makers to make anti- foreign speeches which would lead to bitter resentment in foreign countries with Moslem interests, such as France and Italy ; it would offer a favourable opportunity for anti-Hashimite propaganda intrigue, and would inevitably tend to intensify the existing divisions in Arab opinion rather than to bring about a spirit of friendly and effective co-operation among Arab peoples. Some of these arguments have already been used orally with King Feisal by Sir Francis Humphrys last February and March, and King Feisal then stated that be was most anxious to avoid doing anything which might have'the effect of antagonising his neighbours or cause annoyance or embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government. There is reason to believe, however, that His Majesty has not yet completely abandoned the idea of a Congress and it is very desirable from every point of view that he should now be strongly urged to make up his mind agamst its being held at all. &lt; 23) Memorandum No. 52/1550/1427/2, dated the 2nd June 1933.

One of the stock projects for promoting the development of this country on modern lines is that of supplying the city of Mecca with electricity. 2. The Sa’Odi Minister of Finance who appears to be interested in this idea, was recently approached on the subject by a philanthropic Indian gentleman, Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim Jawan Bakhsh, who is described as a leading merchant of Calcutta. The Indian Vice-Consul reports that at an interview between them, at which he was present, Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim expressed anxiety to secure the concession provided that he could feel assured that the capital sunk in the venture would be adequately safeguarded, a proviso which he considered would be amply met if, in case of dispute he were allowed to invoke the assistance of the British authorities. Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman demurred to this, but mdicated that he was prepared to agree to a reference of disputes to arbitration, when anyone, English or otherwise, might be selected as one of the arbitrators. 3 Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim Jawan Bakhsh appeared satisfied with his conversation with the Minister of Finance and subsequently addressed to him a letter embodying his terms for the grant of the concession. I enclose a translation of this letter. 4. The present electrical equipment of Mecca consists of some ten or twelve separate plants, of which the most important are the one supplying the Haram, one in the King’s Palace, three in palaces of Amir Faisal and one or two in govern ment buildings, the house of the Minister of Finance and possibly other members of the Royal Family. 5.

He is staying at a large house which has recently been bu.lt by the Minister of Finance about a mile outside the town It is already rumoured that the so-called “ Green 1 alace is to be turned into a hotel. Be this as it may, it is interesting to note the tightening of the con nexion between His Majesty and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who spends but little “n jedda and may have built his new house partly with a view to his master s 2 I found the King affable, but he did not appear to be in the same good form as when I last saw him at the end of last August; I cannot say that he looked ill but he gave the impression of suffering from nervous worry. He seemed distrait and I had to initiate almost every subject of conversation. The nature of the audience required that the topics should be general. M e discoursed of our respective states of health, the excellent rains that have fallen m Nejd, the virtues of water and the broader aspects of the recent pilgrimage. The most striking feature of this last part of the conversation was the King s eagerness to assure m&lt;” of Ids readiness to entertain suggestions for the betterment of pilgrimage condi- ( tions. He repeated this assurance at least twice. 3 Mr Furlonge, who was with me, agrees generally with my impression of the King’s physLl state. He had not seen ^ Majesty for nearly two years and would not like to express himself too confidently, but he thought that Ibn Sa ud presented the appearance of having aged considerably. 4 The King’s plans appear to be uncertain.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 139- (1328/398/2), dated the 15th May 1933. In paragraph 18 of the Jedda Report for January to March 1932 (F. 139-N./32) Mr Hope Udl mentioned a Sa’udi Commercial Code, the serial publication of w ic i had bee P n competed during that period. On my return to Jedda at the end of Mav 1 found awaiting me a portly volume containing a rough manuscript transla tion of this enormous document, which took up much space ,n successive numbers of the'umm-abQura newspaper from August 7th, 1931 to February 26th 1932 inclusive. The vicissitudes of the 1 remainder of the year made it impossible for me to give Mention to it Now that the storms of rebellion had died down,. I owe it to the industry of my translators, if for no other reason, to give some brief account of so considerable an addition to the modern legislation of this country. It will be very brief indeed, as the code is a mere white elephant at present. It won e useless labour to check the translation, to have it typed and to study it closely. 2 The code is not one which the ordinary religious courts of this country would ever dream of applying. It is designed solely for the purpose of tribunals Tf the type known as Majlis at-Tujar or Council of Merchants. Only one such court exists at present. It has its being m Je f a , b ?* i Ciw diction in commercial cases is supposed to extend to Mecca, bo tar as 1 it is a very inept body but one seldom hears it mentioned at all, never, in my perience, in connexion with any important commercial suit. 3 The code provided for the use of this non-professional tribunal consists of four parts. Part I (Articles 1 to 149) deals with commerce on land and contains chapters dealin' with the usual matters, including companies, agency, bills o exchange and fnsolvency. Part II (Articles 150 to 431) deals with maritime commerce and comprises, among others, chapters on the ownership of ships, seamen, bilH of lading freight and charter-party, passages, hypothecation of ships etc., bills OI lading, 1 T r T / A r j-i r le S 432 to 533) is devoted to the marine insurance and average.

The last Article, 624 charges the Viceroy with the execution of its provisions, a clause which indicates that, even in principle The code ' tended only to apply to the Hejaz, which at the time had not yet been merged in a unifiedHa’udi Arablji- ... , 4 I learn from Fuad Bey Hamza, who was probably the principal author of the code “hat it was based mainly on the old Ottoman codes (see Young, Coisde Droit Ottoman, Volume VII page 55 ff.)

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 182 (1702/199/10), dated the 14th June 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 119 of April 18,1 have the honour to state that Ibn Sa ud again came to Jedda early on June 10, in anticipation of an early departure for Riyadh. He gave his usual series of formal audiences to heads of foreign missions that morning, beginning with me, as the Soviet Minister was in Mecca. His Majesty appeared to be in good form and was as affable as usual. I presented Mr. Calvert. 2. Following on general conversation of the usual anodyne character, the King observed that the autumn was his busy time in Nejd, as it was there that the leading people flocked about him, each expecting the personal attention of the sovereign. He went on to say that within a year to two his son Sa’ad might be trained enough to reheve him of this burden. I took the opportunity of con gratulating His Majesty in person on the action he had so wisely taken to provide for the future of the throne. The King, in thanking me, stressed the fact that he had not taken the initiative but yielded to the appeals of his people. 3. The King’s remark about the Amir Sa’ud derives some significance from a report which reached me on June 3, in a form too uncertain to be worth reporting at the time that the King was contemplating abdication and was only waitimr for the return of the mission he had sent to the Yemen. Without wishing to exaggerate the probability of such an event at some not too distant date, I think that it should be borne in mind as a possibility. To a European it may seem unlikely that a man of 53 with Ibn Sa’ud’s past should contemplate such a step at the height of his achievement. I am not sure, however, that it would be alien to his character to retire in favour of the son, whom he has so spectacularly installed as Heir Apparent, hoping perhaps to guide the steps of his successor during the remainder of his own life. It is nearly three years since Fuad Bey spoke to me of the King’s desire to reduce his burden of responsibility and “ to reign rather than to rule ”.27 This forecast proved false but there have been faint indications of a slow move ment in that direction. Ibn Sa’ud has tended to lead a somewhat easier life than of old. He has left more in the hands of his advisers, though he still controls them all in major matters. He has accepted new constitutional forms, which, though they appear to us rather illusory at present, are not wholly unreal. Last year he made new secretarial arrangements at Riyadh, which involved the transfer to the Amir Sa’ud of his own chief secretary, Ibrahim ibn Muammar, who has now gone as Charge de’Affaires to Baghdad. 4. I collect these indications for two reasons. Slight as they are, they lend support to the idea that Ibn Sa’ud may end his active career, or at any rate his public career, by abdication rather than by death. Secondly, and this is of more interest to His Majesty’s Government, such an intention would help to explain the rather marked tendency which Ibn Sa’ud has shown during the past year to seek to compose various differences which might militate against the success of a new ruler ; to disarm hostility among his own subjects ; and to reduce the possibilities of quarrel with neighbouring countries like ’Iraq, Transjordan, the Yemen and perhaps even Kuwait. 5. I sought a further audience with the King on June 11, to discuss business. I will report what passed separately in connexion with the subjects I raised, in so far as it may be necessary to record it. The King broached no subject of his own. 6. Ibn Sa’ud returned to Mecca late on June 12. During his short stay His Majesty gave a great deal of time to Captain H. C. Armstrong, who is writing his biography and whom he consented, as a result of correspondence through the Sa udi Minister in London, to receive in Jedda. Captain Armstrong arrived on June 7. He had a general conversation with the King on June 10, and had four further audiences on June 11 and 12 of an average duration of some two hours each. The King has been most forthcoming and both parties appear to be exceedingly pleased with each other. I have avoided any appearance of promoting Captain Armstrong’s enterprise but he is staying with my wife and me on the strength of old friendship. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Cairo, the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and^to His Majesty’s Chief Com missioner at Aden. (30) (Received on 22nd July 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 27, dated the 6th July 1933.) Letter from IIis Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 110, dated the 16th May 1933. No. 1. In paragraph 32 of the Jedda report for March (F. 81-N./33), enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April, I mentioned that Ibn Sa’ud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian Vice-Consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year’s pilgrimage. In the ease of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention, had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro-pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participants in this year’s m 2 ' ll u t ] le King S c f ustom to s P eak at g rea t length at these annual banquets. I he published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a ha f of the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th April. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Legation. ^ x r28 3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity in Islam, but he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in certain passages may have been more emphati I have heard only one definite suggestion of any important omission. According to my Persian colleagues the King gave as one of the reasons why he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fact that so many Muslim countries are under alien denomination. He is said to have included in the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain. If he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might gratify some of them. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), to His Majesty’s Am bassador at Baghdad, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan. Enclosure in No. 1. Summary of the Speech delivered by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz-ibn-Saud at the Banquet given on March 31,1933, at the Royal Palace at Mecca. (As published in Umm-al-Qura, April 6, 1933.) The Arab people, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God in the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilising rain on the earth, and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Moslems were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had ; and if they would but adhere to the commands of God, as given in the Koran and the sacred writings, they would be successful and united, but if they set aside these commands they would become separated and degraded. And this, the King went on, is what is happening now ; and he drew a picture of the sad condition of the Moslem world in general and the Arab people in particular at the present time. Some people imagine, he said, that the only remedy for this state is for Moslems to adopt European civilization ; but this was not true, for the teachings of the Koran guarantee prosperity, unity and happiness to those who follow them, because they make no differentiation between King and commoner, save in respect of piety alone. Nor were foreigners alone to blame for all the calamities which had overtaken Islam, for amongst Moslems themselves they found some who were misguided and who were willing to aid them to work against Islam. I am the Herald of Islam ”, the King concluded. He was an Arab Moslem who served Islam and who worked for the spread of Islam and for Moslem unity ; and he was prepared to sacrifice himself and his family in the defence of Islam! He did not aim to be a chief on earth ; of greatest importance to him was to make God’s word supreme, and in pursuit of this he cared for no difficulties. Many had opposed him since he first put forward this aim, but had been vanquished. What did they want of him ? His actions were clear ; he followed the Way. It had been said that he claimed to be Khalif over all Islam. He made no such claim. A Khalif must enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole world of Islam, and this was possible in the time of the Khilafat; but was there a man who could so do at the present time ? It was clearly impossible and all he himself desired was unity and co-operation among Moslems. Behind him were more than 400,000 warriors ; if he wept they wept; if he rejoiced they rejoiced ; and if he commanded they obeyed his commands. ’ These were the Troops of Unity, the brethren of all who obeyed God, ready to fight for God and expecting nothing from it except to satisfy God ; and this was the force destined to confirm the Religious Law and Islam throughout the territories over which he ruled. MC364FD—25—19-8-33—GIPS(31) {Received on 5th August 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 29, dated 20th Jidy 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 17th July 1933. Letter .from His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 147, DATED THE 20tH May 1933. Since 1 wrote my despatch No. 331 of the 1 2nd August last [Serial No. (101) in F. 9-N.)32], incidental reference only has been made in reports from this Legation to M. van Leeuwen, the Dutch expert who entered the service of the Saudi Government in April 1932 as financial adviser.' 1 have now to record jiis final departure from Jedda on the 18th May. 2. M. van Leeuwen returned from sick leave in or about October last. This leave interrupted what was to have been a year of continuous service, to be followed by a period of leave on full pay before his contract finally expired. I believe it was agreed that lie should draw no salary for the period of his absence last year, and should make up for the time lost by serving for an additional three months at the end of the year originally contemplated. 3. Unfortunately M. van Leeuwen’s health has continued to be precarious. He has had several bouts of illness during the spring, and this has been the immediate cause of his leaving for good. It must be attributed in part, however, to the hopelessness of his position in the Administration here. I do not think that he has at any time been allowed to do more than write academic reports, and it has been increasingly evident of late that he could play no effective role in a department dominated by the personality and methods of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 4. Things were not improved by M. van Leeuwen’s condemnation of the National Bank scheme (F. 85-N.|33) projected by the ex-Khedive and his asso ciates. By the time this was launched he had lost patience to such an extent that he abandoned his previous attitude of discretion and expressed his adverse opinion to outsiders like myself. Saudi circles were very ready to think that his hostility to the scheme was due to apprehension lest it should damage the posi tion of the Netherlands Trading Society, which is, as you know, the only orga nised bank here and in which he was formerly employed. The suspicion may have been increased by the fact that, for reasons of health, he had gone to stay indefinitely wdth the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires. 5. It was to be foreseen that no adviser could reorganise the finances of this country in a year, least of all in a year so inauspicious as one beginning in April 1932, when they were already in a desperate condition and the whole world as well was in a mess. It is, however, lamentable that M. van Leeuwen, of whose capacity I cannot judge, but who was an honest and industrious man, should not have had a chance of doing anvthing at all. He had no axe to grind, and I do not think that the Netherlands authorities made any attempt to use him for their own purposes. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires has assured me that since he presented M. van Leeuwen to the King he has scrupulously refrained from meddling in his affairs, and has not seen his reports. I believe this to be true, and I shall be all the sorrier for M. Adriaahse if, as is possible, he has to concern himself with the final settlement of account between the Saudi Government and their late adviser.

We are instructed to inform Y. H. that it is not now possible to pay the t full arrears of Your Highness’s stipend owing to tne long lapse of time during which Y'our Highness has not claimed it. H. M. G. have, however, now sanctioned the payment of three years stipend to Your Highness commencing from 1st April 1930, and ending with 31st March 1933. Owing to the closing of the current financial year in March, we have drawn the amount due from 1st April 1930 to 28th February 1933 (2 years and 11 months), /.c., Rs. 2,100 minus Rs. 7-14-0 on account of Bank commission which we remit to you by draft No. 71 104, dated 25th March 1933.

Sultan Omer bin A wad Alkaity Sultan of Sheher and Makalla, Hyderabad Dn., to the Resident, Aden, dated the 25th May 1933. With reference to your honour’s letter, dated 28th March 1933, I have the honour to state, Oh Friend, that I regret very much for the decision of His Majesty’s Government regarding the arrears of my stipend claims. I had discussions at first with General Scott and General Steward that it is below my position to receive sixty dollars monthly as a stipend amount, and according to my request to increase the same at least up to rupees one thousand monthly I was assured that they will try their best to increase the amount. The matter was referred to His Majesty’s Government and I was keenly waiting for the favourable decision of the same and hence I did not claim the arrears of stipend of the usual amount of all these years. Then finally I had discussions with Colonel Lake for the arrears. Under the above circumstances T request your honour to refer the above matter again to His Majesty's Government that the amount of the stipend should be increased to Rupees onei thousand monthlv, and if the above request is not granted my stipend arrears from October 1918 up to October 1933, should be granted because I did not claim the arrears only thinking that the matter was under discussion and so my claim for the amount of the arrears of all these years should not be debarred at all. I herewith return the draft No. 71|104, dated 25th March 1933, for Mm amount of Rs. 2,100 with a request to send me the draft of tho full amount of all these years as mentioned above. I will keep up the terms of the treatv and the same friendly relations and co-operation with the Government if at all T am not paid. • Enclosure 4 to Serial No. (35). Letter from the Resident, Aden, to Hfs Highness Sultan Omar bin Awadh al Qu’aiti. Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, Hyderabad, No. 4108, dated the 28th June 1933. I have the honour to refer to Your Highness’s letter of the 25th May 1933 on the subject of vour stipend and to acknowledge receipt of draft No. 711104 of the 25tli March 1933 for Rs. 2,100 which you have returned, and which I am retaining pending Your Highness’s further consideration whether to accept ^ it or not. In the latter case the sum will be refunded to the Treasury ; and for technical reasons it is unlikely that it could be subsequently recovered for Your Highness’s benefit. 2. I note Your Highness’s explanation that you have not in the past claimed the stipend to which you became entitled on your accession in 1922 for the reason that you were awaiting the decision of Government in regard to your request for an increase in the amount of your stipend. 3. T would however observe that the decision of Government in this matter was conveved to Your Highness by the then Resident in his letter No. C.j77 of the 30th January 1925, and since that time Your Highness has been given no assurance or other indication that could in any way lead vou to hope that the decision was likely to be reversed, or was indeed even under discussion.V 33 4. There is now in any case no question of Your Highness’s recovering from His Majesty’s Government the arrears of stipend accrued up to the 1st April 1927, the date on which His Majesty’s Government assumed responsi bility for the Aden Protectorate from the Government of India. 5. Furthermore, on your first visit to Aden after that date, in October 1928, the then Resident made it sufficiently clear to Your Highness that lie was not prepared to recommend to His Majesty’s Government your request for financial assistance ; and Your Highness’s subsequent representation to the Resident in October 1932 was not more favourably received. 6. In these circumstances I regret that I am unable to recommend to His Majesty’s Government Your Highness’s explanation of the reason for the accumulation of the arrears of stipend, nor to move them to reconsider their decision to pay those arrears in respect only of the period from 1st April 1930. 7. In regard to Your Highness’s wish for an increase in stipend, I regret that I cannot see my way to making any recommendation to His Majesty ’s Gov ernment at the present time ; for whatever may be the opinion of this Residency as to the adequacy or otherwise of the stipend at present appertaining to the Sultanate of Shihr and Mukalla, the fact that Your Highness, during the eleven years since your accession, has spent altogether less than 3 years in your territories must mitigate against a favourable consideration of Your Highness’s requests. In this connection I would again commend to Your Highness’s most earnest attention the Resident’s advice contained in his letter No. 2497 of the 19th April 1933.

Many thanks for your Secret letter (243|4|33) of June 19th [Enclosure to Serial No. (33)]. I cannot connect your information’s story about the German Minister in Baghdad with anything of which I have knowledge here. You will have seen from my monthly reports that there has been much hatching of financial and economic schemes but this is a new one on me. I do not quite know what the security of the Port of Jedda means. One of the few good assignable securities here would be the heavy quarantine dues collected from all pilgrims and other travellers by sea. It is easy money for the Government as the shipping companies include the dues in the cost of the tickets, but the Government have shown no readiness to assign any revenue, whether customs or quarantine dues or other to the service of a loan. As for an unsecured loan, there are philanthropists like the err-Khedive of Egypt, etc., who seem ready to produce or promise money without obvious inducement ; but I doubt whether they include Germans. The German trading Consul here told me last year that, when the Sa’udi mission tried to get money in various capitals, Berlin was one ; and he laughed. He is now away for an indefinite period. All the same, if you hear anything more on the subject it would interest me to have it. I am sending a copy of this to Rendel.

Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter, No. 18113133, dated 20th September 1933. Note by Capt. J. B. Glubb on a conversation in which he took part on leaving Amman ; the note is self-explanatory. Note by Captain Glubb on a conversation with the Amir Shakir. On 24th August, just as I was about to start for England on leave, I received a message iiom llie Amir Shakir, stating that he wished to visit me to sav good bye. He arrived a few minutes later. He began at once by saying that he was personally in little anxiety at the presence of Ibn Sand in the Hejaz. Tbn Saud was a bedouin, ruling unstable bedouins, and he (Shakir) was really not greatly perturbed whether Tbn Saud remained ten years or twenty years in the He jaz because he was perfectly certain that the Saudis could not rule the Hejaz per manently. Their fall was smiply a matter of time, and then the Sherifs would return. The Shcrifs had very deep rooted loyalties and associations in theHejaz, and it was only the almost insane conduct of King Husain, which made it possible for Ibn Saud temporarily to overthrow the Sherifs. The case of the Imam Yahya was, however, quite different. If the Imam Yahya were to obtain the sovereignty of the Hejaz, “ death would be better for us (By us he presumably meant the Sherifs now in exile in Iraq and Trans- Jordan). The Imam was, he said, a very different proposition to Ibn Saud, and was also a Sherif. At the moment, the Imam was not saying anything about conquering the Hejaz, but, if war broke out, and he conquered Asir, where he has great influence, he would dominate the Hejaz, and the Holy Cities would drop into his lap, almost without an effort. Ibn Saud was weak and unpopular in the Hejaz, and the Akhwan had suffered frightfully in the recent operations in Asir. The very name of Asir was now anathema in Nejd, and it would be difficult to raise any kind of a force in Nejd, if fresh hostilities were now to break out in that area. His Highness went on to say that the Sherifs had great influence in the Hejaz, and that he himself had recently received letters from the Southern Hejaz and Asir. He had letters from one whoso name I think he said was Ibn Abda and from the Zeraniq and other tribesmen of the Red Sea littoral of Asir. These people had remained neutral in the Idris v. Ibn Saud rebellion. Many of them wrote to him now to ask his advice. They said that they were not greatly concerned whether Ibn Saud retained the rule of the country or not, but the first thing which they wanted to know was whether there was any chance of a return of the Sherifs. If Shakir could promise ttmm any support, such as that of the British, which gave any hopes of success, the}' would be ready to declare for the Sherifs. Failing this, they would be obliged to choose the next best from amongst the other competing rulers. The Amir mentioned the names of several tribes, but as I was not familiar with them, I cannot recollect them for certain, except the Beni ShahF and the Zeraniq. His Highness continued that he was unable, of course, to answer these letters or take any action in any matters of this nature, owing to the attitude of the British and their ever ready suspicions that he was intriguing agaihst Ibn Saud. But at any rate, he pointed out, both Tbn Saud and the Sherifs were allies of the British, whereas the Imam Yahya most emphatically was not. The inter ference of the British had prevented the Sherifs replacing Ibn Saud in the Hejaz, with the result that Ibn Baud’s obvious weakness was now tempting the Imam Yahya to take the offensive, ft really looked as if Ibn Saud would soon collapse. The British did not offer him active support, but merely limited their help to preventing the Sherifs from over-throwing him. It seemed probable that the result would be that the Imam Yahya, over whom the British had no control would step in ami take the Hejaz himself, to the exclusion of all Great Britain’s allies. If the Sherifs were to recover the Holy Cities, His Highness continued, they could easily come to an agreement with Ibn Saud, who would remain the ruler of Nejd. This ums the natural arrangement, only upset by the insanity of King Husain. But any arrangement would be better than allowing the Imam Yahya to come in. His Highness then said that he had intended to speak to me on this subject for a considerable time, as also to Mr. Kirkbride, the acting British Resident, but that he had hesitated and procrastinated until he heard that I w^as about to leave, when he made up his mind to speak immediately. He hoped that I vmuld have an opportunity in London to make known what he had ^gid, to His Majesty’s Government. He had intended also to tell Mr. Kirkbride. Should he do so, or would I be seeing Mr. Kirkbride ? 1 replied that I had already said good bye to Mr. Kirkbride, and had not time to see him again, as my car v'as at the door and I was catching Imperial Ainvays. I promised, however, to submit the gist of what he had said, to the Colonial Office in London. He then remarked “ It is obvious nov T , that Feisal is the only man in the Sherifian family who can do a job of work ”. I enquired whether King Feisal’s viev T s agreed with those wffiich His High ness had just expressed to me. He replied emphatically that their views were absolutely identical. I said that, in that case it seemed probable that King Feisal would already have explained them to His Majesty’s Government, as he had just returned from Europe. His Highness replied that he did not knov T if the King had done so or not, though he believed that His Majesty had no secrets from his friends the English (!!!).His Highness then took his leave, again assuring me of the vital importance of keeping the Imam Yahya out of the Hcjaz at all costs, adding that the Imam was now immensely powerful, that he had invited all the Yemen under his un disputed sway, and that, if he completed the conquest of Nejran, he would be within striking distance of Kiyadh itself, in addition to being able to threaten the Hejaz through Asir. I hope that 1 will not be thought to have acted irregularly in submitting direct to the Colonial Office, a report on a conversation which occurred before I left Amman. As stated above, however, the Amir Shakir made these statements in a visit ostensibly made to say goodbye, when my car and luggage was at the door. 1 could not possibly have committed it to paper, without missing the Imperial Airways machine, on which my passage was already booked and paid for. I presume that copies of this note will be forwarded to Jerusalem and Amman, with this explanation as to the method of its submission. (45) {Received on 7th August 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 33, dated 21st September September 1933.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 16th September 1933. No. 1. Memorandum respecting Petroleum in Arabia {as revised by Petroleum Depart ment .— {Received in Foreign Office, August 11, 1933.) (A)— Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Hejaz. —Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest in it was stimulated by Mr. TwitchelPs survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jedda, but this area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it was pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is known geologically as a “ Rift Valley,” that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are considered to be remote, though not entirely non-existent, and even after a complete survey, “ Rift Valley conditions ” are such that any test drilling would be very speculative. (2) Hasa and Kmueit Neutral Zone. —It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be underlain by rocks of the same geological age as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fields, and that potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity in Bahrein in 1932. (3) 'The Far son Islands and Asir. —Interest in these islands and! or the mainland of Asir. from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group, in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). (4) Mokalla. —In 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum prospects were quiie unfavourable. (5) Muscat- -The Anglo-Persian Oil Company abandoned this area as un favourable in 1925-26. (P&gt;)—Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company. —The Turkish Petroleum Company (now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was former! in 1912, when the Deutsche Bank became associated with the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain claims to oil rights in Baghdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Baghdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with the Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, 50 per cent. ; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company andm the Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the three groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia (excluding ^gypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories), except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the British and German Governments, ami by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the war American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq Petroleum Company and the arrangement as regards non-competition between the groups composing the Iraq Petroleum Company was confirmed in an agreement between the groups, entered into in 1928. This was a private agreement between the groups with which the British Government was not associated. Under this agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded the Sultanate of Koweit and the Farsan Islands, but included Bahrein, and an area was thus defined within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than through the Iraq Petroleum Company or its nominee. On the admission of French and American interests the share capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company was distributed as follows :— Percentage. Anglo-Persian Oil Company .. .. .. 23.75 Royal Dutch Shell .. .. .. .. 23.75 French Group .. .. . .. 23.75 American Group( 1 ) .. .. .. .. 23.75 C. S. Gulbenkian .. .., .. .. 5.00 100.00 - , As the Royal Dutch Shell is 60 per cent. Dutch and 40 per cent. British, the British shareholding in the company now only represents about 33f per cent. The Iraq Petroleum Company is still technically a British company, as in article 32 of its convention with the Government of Iraq the company must be and remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must at all times be a British subject. But the position is different from a British point of view’, from that which formerly obtained when the company was British in fact as w’ell as in name. Apart from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Companv, there are no really large oil companies which are entirely British, and which could compete with the big groups represented on the Iraq Petroleum Companv. ^ U he Burmah Oil Company has never been inclined to undertake exploration work outside India. There may, however, be some instances where the Iraq Petroleum Company is not prepared to seek concessions in the reserved area, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, either by itself or in association with one or more of the other groups, may be allowed to acquire concessions. (2) British Oil Development Company and Mosul Oil-fields (Limited). On the 20th April 1932, the Iraq Government granted an oil concession to the British Oil Development Company (Limited) over the western portion of Iraq. ?n l nnA 0nCeSS1011 is f ° r a P erio d of seventy-five years and covers an area of about 40,000 square miles,. comprising all Iraq lands situated west of the River Tigris and noi th of the thirty-third parallel of latitude. A special law confirming the British Oil Development Concession w^as passed and published in the Official Gazette on the 29th May 1932. This is reckoned as the date of the commencement of the concession. The company must be and remain a British company registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must be a British subject. Ihere is, however, a large foreign interest in the company. The British Oil (*) In 1932 the American shareholding in the American group (Near East Development Cor poration) was held in the following proportions :— Standard Oil Company of New Jersey ..

Mola (Italy), three representatives of the Italian Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli, and E. C. Simmons (solicitor). At some stage, but when it actually occurred is not clear from the information available, German and Eranco-Swiss interests were also included.

In March 1933 the board of this company was re constructed, and the Foreign Office informed by the company that the directorate was as follows :— Viscount Goschen {chairman). Other British directors (5) : Sir Edward Mountain (deputy chairman). *i e -rT e Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, Lord Glenconner (director of Hambro’s Bank), W. R.

The Gull Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, retining and marketing oil throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon family, who are said to have come in originally as finan ciers and to have ended up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony—Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S. 0., New Jersey, in the 1. P. C. It is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate in a possible concession in Koweit. In 1927 it obtained on option from the Eastern and General on the Bahrein Con cession, -which the syndicate had secured in December 1925. Eventually, how ever, this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presum ably because the Gulf, as a member of the I. P. C., could not hold it. In 1929 it acquired from the Eastern and General Syndicate an option over any rights which the syndicate might possess in Hasa, the neutral zone and Koweit. It could only operate concessions in Hasa and probably also in the neutral zone with the permission of the I. P. C. (6) Standard Oil Company of California. —After the break-up of the Standard Oil Group in 1912, many members of the group became independent, including the above company. This company is one of the largest oil companies in the United States, and is a complete unit, being engaged in producing^ re fining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. The company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has oil properties in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, the Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petro leum Companv, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C)— Past Concessions affect inn Saudi Arabia. (1) Northern Hejaz.—lt is possible that certain concessionary rights were granted in Turkish times, but this subject has not been explored in the Lega tion. There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, but there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted. Any interest of Mr. Philby’s is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharquich (Limited). (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—-Two American engineers {Twitchell and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petro leum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Companv, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable [see under paragraph (A) (1)]. (3) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 1925 to prospect for oil for a period ot two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla— The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite unfavourable. (5) Ilasa—The Anglo-Persian Oil Comrmny applied, probably for prospecting rights only, to Ibn Saud in 1921. The E.G.S. came into the field later At the beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P. Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home suggested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C., whom His Majesty’s Govern ment considered to have a prior claim. About the same period or earlier the two companies were in touch with each other with a view to sharing interests, and it is stated that at one point they went through a pretence of breaking off44 negotiations so that Ibn Sand might give the concession to E.G.S. in ignorance of the interest of A.P.O.C., to whom he was hostile. Be that as it may, E.G.S. got the concession, and on the 6th May, 1923, Ibn Sand granted an oil concession (including the Qatif and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Major Holmes gave an undertaking not to sell part of the concession to the A.P.O.C., and His Majesty’s Government thought of trying to induce Ibn Sand to cancel this restriction, but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924. Thus the A.P.O.C. were left out in the cold. The final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known, but there are indications that it followed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. Cox. That draft, and probably the actual concession, included inter alia, provision for the following :— (a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations in a specified manner within nine months. (b) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous cessation of operations for more than twenty months. (c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection ” in half-yearly payments to begin sixty days after date. (d) Pavment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,” but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Sand in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, (a) Ibn Saud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (b) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927, in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “ at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.” The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have .been conducted by that company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) Koweit Neutral Zone. —On the 17th May, 1924, an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, trans ferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be re instated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Companv. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memorandum concludes from a review of the known facts the “ impression .... that Iban Saud did actually grant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.” As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems 1 hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other “ at least subject to forefeiture,” &amp;c., but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928 that it had “ never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th Julv, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the Sheikh and discussed the■■■I 45 matter. The Sheikh’s recollection was that Ibn Sand gave the Hasa Conces sion proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the Sheikh a draft joint concession in respect of the Kowiet .Neutral Zone, which he wdshed to give to Major Holmes’s company, the E.G.S., and asking the Sheikh to sign it. His Majesty’s Government informed the Sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to Ibn Saud. About a year atter- wards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession w’as there and then can celled. Ever since the Sheikh of Kowdet has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheikh of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) Farsan Islands, now also a part of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.S. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear wdiat became of this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a con cession for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Iban Saud, made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them, Ibn Saud came for ward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi w r as again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated “ a decision in the question of the dispute which we w r ere asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Government ” to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request wdiich the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D )—Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows :— (1) Northern Hejaz .—Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. (2) Asir .—Ibn Saud in June 1933 intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. wflthin wffiose sphere of in fluence Asir fell and who -were the only company wflth any British interests v r ho were likely to be prepared to consider the .matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination if they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the exploratory period. (3) Hasa .—After some competition between the Iraq Petroleum Company (wflio sent a representative out to negotiate in 1933) and the Standard Oil Company of California, a concession was ultimately granted to the latter. It is understood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concession was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £30,000 (gold) and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 5s. per ton. ~% 46 (4) Qatar .—The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative but with the object of transfer to the I.P.C. secured an exclusive option from the Sheikh to carry out geological investigations for a period of tv r o years with the right to apply for a concession within that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the Sheikh. (5) Koiveit Neutral Zone .—The present position in regard to this area is not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes’s primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 w r as to obtain Ibn Sand’s consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the case that so far as Ibn Sand is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty’s Government. (6) Farsan Islands .—There has been no activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the Anglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Depart ment that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands.

Letter from Hrs Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 285, DATED THE 9tH SEPTEMBER 1933. No. I. With reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 160 of the 31st March 1932 F. 140-N.|32), paragraph 4, relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitch ell in regard to the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that water has again been brought to Jedda from the wells at Waziriya, and the event w^as ceremonially inaugurated on the 26th August in the presence of the Minister of Finance, local notables, and a large gathering of townspeople. As the result of the discovery of a fresh spring, to the south-east of the wells themselves, work has been in progress for some months past, under the direction ot bheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and experts of the Mecca water supply of Ain Zubeyda. The water has been led through the old pipes, put down in Turkish times, and now' tails into the Idarus reservoir, situated on the outskirts of one m t m ^°? r n r quarters of the town. The present rate of flow-, according to Mr. Iwitchell, who still shows active interest in this undertaking, is 40 e-allons per minute, and this, he says, it wall shortly be possible to increase to as much as three times that amount on the completion of work on a second conduit which runs alongside the first, but w-hich is not yet connected over its entire length. Mr - Twutchell pomts out that here there is an ample and cheap waiter supply sufficient for the needs of the towm, whose present rate of consumption he places at 38 gallons per minute. Although other local experts w-ould estimate the local rate of consumption at probably not more than 24 gallons per minute it may be conceded that the new source of supply is more than sufficient is cheap (for it costs nothing at the Idarus reservoir), and at present is reasonably safe at source. The Indian Medical Officer attached to this Legation recently conducted an analysis of the water, chemically and bacteriologically and pronounced it to be fit for consumption. The total water consumption of Jedda therefore, may be expected to increase, particularly as the poorer classes are able to draw as much as they require for the mere trouble of carrying it away! 3. From past experience, however, considerable doubt is expressed as to the prospects of Waziriya water becoming a permanent factor in the towm’s water supply The doubt is not diminished by reports that, although from Waziriva to Ras Qama (a place 5 krlom. from Jedda) the conduit has been cemented and is at present fairly sound over the remaining distance the nipes a^e old an rotten and require constant care to prevent leakage. Sheikh Muhammad Dehl ud has unsuccessfully approached the Jedda municipality in an ende^o r to lit the pipedine thoroughly repaired, and has now placed the matter before Tbn Sand stating his preference for a cement conduit over iron piping. baud ’4. In the meantime, the sea-water distillery, or condenser plant, continues to supply the town with drinking water of a kind at the rate of about 8| gallons per minute, and the English engineer in charge anticipates no great reduction in demand for his product, in spite of its greater cost, on account of the lack of confidence in Waziriya water on the part of those who are able to afford the other. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the Department of Overseas Trade.

The following were the main points of interest in a general conversation ■which I had with Mr. Philby yesterday afternoon. As I have reported from Jedda Mr. Philby now-a-days speaks to me pretty freely.

State Bank. Mr. Philby spoke of the breach between the c^r-Khedive and Shadid, of whom he (Mr. Philby) now has a very poor opinion, though he was greatly impressed by him in Jedda. He comsidered it clear that Shadid had misrepre sented to the Saudi Government in the spring his position vis-a-vis of the ex- Khedive, from whom he pretended to have received full powers to treat and conclude an agreement. After getting the contract, he had avoided meeting Abbas Hilmi. He had embarrassed the latter more particularly by getting the Saudi Government to make out drafts in his own (Shadid’s) favour to cover their share in certain expenses and by evading a request from the caj-Khedive to hand them over. The amount was not great but it was a dirty business, as Abbas Hilmi was morally responsible to the Saudi Government. According to Mr. Philby the err-Khedive, with whom and wffiose entourage he has been in touch wants to behave honourably, but is not keen on the bank affair, which would only attract him, if he could get British financial backing. Everybody con cerned appears to consider that Shadid’s arrangement with the Saudi Govern ment was impossible. Mr. Philby has outlined in the Khedivial circle (apparently without any mandate from the Saudi Government) his ideas of a workable contract, providing for a much smaller capital and a loan of sav £stg.l00,000 instead of one of £gold 200,000. ^ This record of a friendly conversation over the tea-table maV not be exact m every particular, but it represents with sufficient accuracv the'main lines of what Mr. Philby told me.

He said that he had got the interest on all these debts, between £2,000 and £3,000—-a statement which does not quite agree with what he told me sometime ago in Jedda. He had no idea what the Saudi Government would do when the present moratorium expires in November next. He agreed that they would do well to make some sort of businesslike arrangement and stick to it but seemed to take a very moderate view of the likelihood of their doing so.

C.) visited the ship in quest of information as to the approaches to the port of Jizan, his ship having been chartered by the Saudi-Arabian Govern ment to convey thither 700 troops from Jedda. 8. On the same day the Acting Commissioner called on the Commanding Officer in connection with suspicions of being engaged in the^ smuggling of Opium which were entertained bv the Police against the Official Interpreter. Tbe matter- was fully investigated and the accusations proved.to be based on a case of mistaken identity. Tbe incident, however, served a useful purpose in impressing on the new Ship’s Company the gravity with which the Drug Traffic is regarded. 9 In this connection the campaigns of Russel Pasha in Egypt have now rendered the importation of drugs through the northern ports and on the north coast and across the western and eastern frontiers a far more risky undertaking firm formerly, with the result that the Egyptian authorities have naturally turned their eves towards the Sudanese frontier as being the obvious alternative for the development of new smuggling activities. This in turn has resulted in •m even closer surveillance in Port Sudan, but although it is understood that no evidence lias been found of an extensive entrepot trade, the opium traffic for local consumption has been proved to be on a considerably larger scale than was originally suspected. Practice Areas.1C) port Sudan.—On account of reports from the British Legation at Jedda of increasing- tension between Saudi-Arabia and the Yemen on the Asir frontier, it was decided to sail one day in advance of programme, in order to ca a Kamaran for further intelligence. The ship sailed accordingly at 17-00 on Uth September, and arrived at Kamaran at 12-30 on 21st. 17.

He felt certain that had hos ddies commenced in the coastal area they would have come quickly to ns 'now e ge from refugees, who in the prevailing northerly wind would soon have arrived from the Jizan-Medi district.

These events, in brief, consisted of raids and demands for the pavment of taxes by Imamic troops and tribes into villages in the south-west extremity of the Protectorate.

Weighed and proceeded at 06-00, and boarded two dhows—the first encountered during the period of the patrol—in the approaches to the entrance to Perim Small Strait. This scarcity of dhow traffic is attributable mainly to the tension existing between the Yemen and Saudi-Arabia, though trade in general is poor. 30. Passing through the Small Strait the ship anchored at 09-00 on 28th off Suqaiya 31. The Commanding Officer and Interpreter at once landed, find were received with great cordiality by the Sheikh, who had only just arrived back from Perim (paragraph 22), and villagers. No further developments had occurred in the district during his absence. A copy of my further Report to the Chief Commissioner, Aden, is shown in A ppendix II. ****** 34. Present in Aden was the Egyptian Government vessel Mabariss, which has been placed at the disposal of the John Murray Expedition. This expedi tion, under the Leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Seymour Sewell, Sc. D. of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, is about to commence an extensive biological survey in the Western Indian Ocean, which will also include matters of more direct navigational interest. It is interesting to note that during their passage from Egypt the expedition anchored for three days in the Hanish Group, where they were closely and some what abruptly questioned as to their business by the Italian Askaris on Jebel Zukur and Great Harish Island. It is understood, however, that their work was in no way impeded. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (49). APPENDIX I. Enclosure to H. M.

Ff the amberi chief of Sheikh- Said will take customs dues on dhows callings, then where are we to go as it would not be paying to dhowmen with their scanty freight that they get to call anymore to Sokeiya, and besides this the Chief of Sheikh-Said closed the road for us, as to why we are in favour of British, but we know from our forefather that British rules from Aden to Sokeiya but the treats of the chief of Sheikh- Said makes us nervous, and we are in danger any time.

S. “ Penzance ”—Report of Proceedings for the period September to 1st October 1933. Visit of ’Aqil of Bir Suqaiya. I have the honour to report that the ’Aqil of Bir Suqaiya visited H. M. S. “ Penzance ” this morning and presented the enclosed letter. It appears that he came to Perim on Saturday last with the intention of seeking an interview with Mr. Sinclair, but was recommended instead to call on me. 2. I interrogated the ’Aqil with the object of elucidating his complaints, and gathered the following information :— (a) A small force of Yemeni troops at Sheik-Said forbid the passage of traffic from the Protectorate to Perim through that port. The ’Aqil had on this occasion made the entire journey by sea. (b) Since the visit of Lieutenant Hamilton to Suqaiya (about 14th instant) an armed Yemeni soldier appeared and demanded arrears of tax, in compliance with which 50 MT dollars were accordingly paid. -* — (c) Five days ago, a further demand was made for camel and goat tax, but there being no money in the exchequer the envoy was told that payment must be deferred. 3. I could see nothing to be gained by visiting Suqaiya in the ship, and therefore told the ’Aqil that my programme would not permit of this deviation. If weather conditions permit, I propose to visit Suqaiya for a few hours on Thursday 28th September, while on passage to Aden. Enclosure 4 to Serial No. (49). APPENDIX NO. IT. Enclosure to H. M. S. “ Penzance ’’—Report of Proceedings for the period 2nd September to 1st October 1933. In amplification of my wireless message timed 12-40 of this date and in continuation of my report No. 1115iG, dated 25th September, I have the honour to inform you that II. M. S. “ Penzance ” arrived off Bir Suqaiya at 09-00 this morning. 2. Accompanied by my Interpreter I landed immediately and was cordiallv received by Shiekh Ahmed Ali Fateh, who had himself only arrived one hour previously, in a Perim dhow. 3. N since the o furthBi- developments in the situation in the village have occurred Aqil s departure, neither is there any local intelligence of a recentreinforcement of the Imanic troops at Sheikh Said, where a post of one Sergeant and six soldiers has been established for some time past. 4. In apparent contradiction to his written statement (enclosure to my No. lllpjG of 25th September), the ’Aqil now states that Sheikh Ahmed A1 Ambari of Sheikh Said is friendly disposed towards him, and by agreeing to act as surety for the payment of taxes by the ’Aqil, has obtained the release from IVJocha of the latter’s first cousin. This relative was presumably one of the twelve Subnisis referred to in Aden Political Intelligence Summary No. 344, paragraph 2479 (P. No. 26-NJ33), as he was stated to have been initially in Am Nabia. • 5. In accordance with your message timed 1310|27|9 I instructed the ’Aqil that he was to refuse payment of taxes, and was not to comply with any orders to proceed to Mocha. Should a tax demand be accompanied by a display of force I instructed him to repeat his previous protestations of complete penury. 1 further informed him that the Residency have the matter fully in hand, and will afford him all the support of which he may stand in need, adding that the Officer Commanding at T. A’id has been warned to withdraw and maintain his troops and tribesman within the recognised limits of the Yemen. b. I feel confident that the ’Aqil’s peace of mind has to a large extent been restored, while the visit of H. M. Ship to his settlement cannot fail to reach the ears of the neighbouring Imanic authorities, with, it is hoped, beneficial results. . Nonetheless there are two points which still becloud his outlook— (a) The paucity of his ammunition reserves, which amount to but twenty rounds among the ten rities in his possession. (b) The restrictions on his actions imposed by the guarantee assumed on his behalf by the Sheikh of Sheikh Said. The cancellation of this surety would without doubt greatly strengthen his hand in resisting the imposition of taxes.

Telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the London Foreign ( Office, No. 182, dated the 27th October 1933. Jedda despatch No. 394, September 20th, 1932. I saw Minister of Finance this afternoon at his request when he gave me a verbal message from Ibn Sand through Amir Feisal to the effect that Maigret who returns from leave to-morrow recently met Fuad in Syria and requested permission to pay a personal visit to Nejd upon his return to Jedda. Fuad has now secured Ibn Sand’s consent and Maigret will proceed I understand imme diately thence here. Fuad will await him in Riyadh and will return with him to Hejaz. Minister of Finance emphasized that visit was purely private and would be short and gave as reason that Maigret merely wished to see the country. He would meet the King either in Riyadh or in the neighbourhood. Abdullah Sulaiman added that should anything pass during visit other than private nature Fuad would inform me of it at our next meeting. I am at a loss 1o understand true (grp. undec.) of this strange departure from what has always been assumed would be the King’s attitude towards foreign representatives who desired to visit Nejd. It is difficult to accept pro testations as to private nature of visit at their face value and it is more than likely that other interpretations wall be placed on the visit when the news becomes public property. Apart from its significance as a meeting between the King and French representative at Riyadh and its possible fillip to French prestige it forms a precedent of which other foreign representatives including Soviet' Minister might avail themselves. , Lc571 FD—25—20-12-33—G IPSJ f CONFIDENTIAL.

The approach to Jedda was made without difficulty and the ship anchored in the Inner Anchorage at 1100 on 18th November. The hag of the country was saluted with 21 guns, which was returned promptly by the shore Battery. 9. Colonel Hamdi Bey called and presented the compliments of the country. This officer fought in the Great War as a Lieutenant in the Turkish Army, and is now the Director of Military Training for the whole Kingdom of Sa’udi- Arabia. Though pleasant personally, it is difficult to imagine that he fills this important post with much zeal or ability. His predecessor, a more efficient German-trained officer, was dismissed for corruption. 10. In the afternoon the Commanding Officer, accompanied by Mr. B. W. Seager (British pro-Consul) called on Sheikh ’Ali Taha and Sheikh ’Ali A1 Amari, respectively the Acting and Assistant Governors of Jedda in the absence of Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Mu’Ammar, who was engaged at Mecca in a matri monial venture. ’Ali Taha is a Hedjazi who has spent 25 years in Civil Service, firstly under the Turks, then under the Hashimite dvnasty, and! finally under the present Wahabbi regime. His colleague is a Nedji. The call of Colonel Hamdi Bey was then returned at the err-Turkish barracks at the outskirts of the town. The building appeared to be scarcely occupied ; 2 armoured cars were observed in the central courtyard, but were evidently in a state of complete neglect. 11. The two Governors Returned the Commanding Officer’s call on Monday, 20th November, and were accorded a salute of 13 guns on their departure. Accompanied by the Mayor of Jedda (Sheikh Ali Salami) and Mr. Seager they lunched with the Commanding Officer on 22nd November. 12. Mr. Tv. S. Twitchell, the American Mining engineer, was in Jedda, having recently returned from El Hasa, where he had been assisting the Standard Oil Company of California in their prospecting onerations, which fonninated in the grant of an oil concession by the Sau’dian Government. Mr. Twitchell made the journey across Arabia by car and lorry in seveii days, and since Mr. Philby has now embraced Islam, it is probable that he is the only living Christian who has performed this feat. 13. As recently foreshadowed elsewhere, the affairs of Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby and his Sharqieh Company are by no means flourishing, and it seems that the terips of his concession for the importation of Ford cars and all motor tyres are nroving financially unsound. Mr. Philby himself was on a business journey to Egypt. 14. It is understood that the large Soviet Legation, which holds itself much aloof from the European community, does little business, and pays no attention to the pilgrims from Russian territory. This may perhaps be due to the official anti-God policy of the Soviet, and in this connection it is believed that this attitude proves a definite commercial handicap when dealing with the Wahabbi Kingdom, founded as it is so largely on a fanatically religious basis. The same disability operates also in the Yemen. ** ##*##*Sport. 16. Two football matches took place, the first against a team composed mainly of Javanese and the second against an Arab side ; the foimei was drawn, and the latter won by the ship, 2—0. Both games drew well behaved and enthusiastic crowds of between 2,000 and 3,000 spectators. Football made its first appearance in the Hedjaz about 2 years ago, and initially was banned, as it was thought that football clubs would become a cloak for political intrigue. The Government, however, was not long able to maintain this attitude in the face of the wave of popularity which the game attracted, particularly as it was strongly backed by the Amir Faisal, the \ iceroy ot tne Hedjaz and second son of the King, who alone among the Royal House has visited Europe and acquired a smattering of western ideas. Rather is the game now encouraged in the belief, that, instead of criticisms of the Go\ eminent, the relative merits of prominent players now provide the main topic of gossip m the bazaars. Whatever, may be the truth of this comforting theory, there can be no doubt as to the grip of the game on the popular imagination ; teams are springing up at Mecca as well as at Jedda, professionalism is beginning to show itself, and the days of the Sau’di Cup Final, transfer fees, gate money and other blessings of civilisation may not be far distant. ** ****** 17 Throughout the stav, the hospitality offered on all sides was most marked and particularly at the Legation under Mr. A. 'S. Calvert, the Charge d’Affaires, whose kindness in providing car conveyance and in assisting in water transport was of great assistance. Political Situation. 18. No marked change in the situation on the Yemen frontier has taken place! * The Imam has recently re-opened correspondence, by W.|T., asking King Ibn Sa’ud for the reason for his troop concentrations. The latter replied at length, re-stating his contentions and d'emands, re questing a reasoned reply to them, and suggesting a further meeting of delegates. To this latter proposal the Imam readily agreed, but, typically, omitted all reference to Sau’dian claims. Once more Ibn Sa’ud pressed for a considered reply, and it was this strongly-worded communication which was incorrectly reported in a Cairo newspaper as constituting an ultimatum. 19. The concentration of troops and tribesmen continues, and is believed to be nearing completion. It is reported in Jedda that the full quotas haw 1 not been forthcoming from many tribes, and that in the case of a powerful group in the North-West, Ibn Sa’ud has not felt himself strong enough to insist on the despatch of any forces. ' Bedouin who have never seen a white man have recently passed through Jedda en route for the South, • - ’ (2) (Received on 20th January 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 53, dated 4th January 1934.)

Herr Borchardt is acting on behalf of the Valend Import and Export Company of Amsterdam, which is, I believe, a German owned Company. 2. While in Bagdad he has, through the German Legation, been put into communication with a certain Abdul Latif al Abdul Jalil, who, when in Bagdad last Summer, represented himself to be authorised by King Ibn Sa’ud to nego tiate the purchase of large Quantities of arms and ammunition and also to dis cuss proposals for oil and other concessions.3. According to my information Herr Borchardt is offering to the Govern ment of Sa’udi Arabia a light automatic weapon called the Schmeisser machine pistol, of which, it is claimed, 400,000 have already been supplied to the German army. Sample weapons are offered at 1,085 French francs, while for orders of 5,000 and upwards a price of 935 francs per weapon is quoted. 4. I understand that Herr Borchardt left Bagdad for Tehran early in December, leaving further negotiations in the hands of the German Minister here. 5 .

Next day Fuad told me in strict confidence which I promised to respect that although various popular rumours which I had heard were false Maigret had been asked to Riyadh to explain French attitude regarding matters raised by Saudi mission in Paris last year. These were facilities for obtaining war material and a loan as well as a mission to help with military organisation and air force. Fuad was vague as to stage which had been reached but implied that French were ready to oblige. He spoke of loan to be made by financiers and of a mission having civilian status but to be chosen under the auspices of the French Government. Despatch follows. (4) {Received on 28th January 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 2, dated 11th January 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 8 th January 1934. Better from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 338, dated the 22nd November 1933. 1 have the honour to report that Tala at Harb Pasha, who is described in No. 45 of the List of Leading Personalities in Egypt, enclosed in Cairo despatch No. 68 of the 9th January, as a Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, is understood locally to be flying from Suez to Jedda, with stops at Wejh and Yanbu, on or about the 2nd December, in a De Havilland Dragon aeroplane belonging- to Messrs. Misr-Airwork ; a ground' engineer sent by the hitter to prepare the ground for landing arrived by steamer on the 19th November, and the agency work for it has been entrusted to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (rSiidan) (Limited), Jedda. 2. Tala at Pasha’s objects in this visit, which is not expected to exceed four days, are said to be threefold, viz., {a) to fix up local representation for the two pilgrim ships, which, I understand, have recently been purchased by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the Hejaz ; (b) to organise the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular, the cotlon goods which are said to be produced nowadays by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr ; and (c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr opening a branch in Jedda to assume the functions of a State bank for the Hejaz, in view of the apparent demise of the ex-Khedive’s project (see the correspond ence ending with your confidential despatch No. 266 of the 5th October). 3. To these objects may, perhaps, be added a fourth, namely, that of demon strating one of Misr-Airwork’s aeroplanes to Ibn Sand. You will recall that this company last year proposed to send an Avro to Jedda for this purpose (see the correspondence ending with the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt’s Savingram to you, No. 91 of the 19th August, 1932), but did not proceed with the4 scheme. Their object at that time was to sell Ibn Sand light military aircraft, and it seems probable that the recent reports of tension between him and the Imam Yehva have led them to consider the moment opportune for a serious effort to this end*. Local gossip is rife on the subject, the establishment of an air ^ervice between Egypt and Jedda being suggested in some quarters, whilst other and unkinder ones suggest that Talaat Pasha’s idea in arriving by air is to be able to leave the country quickly in the event of war with the Yemen materialising. 4. The aeroplane, if and when it arrives, will be the first machine of any sort to fly in or near the Hejaz since the ill-fated Wapiti, whose crash was reported in Mr. Hope Gill’s telegram No. 201 of the 14th September, 1931. Its arrival may serve to focus local attention on the parlous condition of the Saudi Air Force.' The latter still consists of the four Wapitis and five old P. H. 9’s bought from His Majesty’s Government ; but the former, which alone might, be made to fly, still remain, as they have remained since the time of the crash referred to above, in their ramshackle hangar, with absolutely no attention except an occasional greasing by an inexpert hand ; while Ibn Sand remains without a single pilot capable of flying the machines, and without a single competent air- mechanic. No attempt has been made to develop any ground organisation, and projects, which have been reported on various occasions from this post, of engaging Turkish pilots and|or training Saudi subjects in Turkey, have remained unrealised. 5. With Saudi finances till further depleted by the war-prenarations, the scale of which is easily the greatest yet made, the prospects of Ibn Sand being able to afford the heavy and continuous expense of employing competent pilots and ground staff, and of his embarking upon the essential refitting.of his.present machines and the ground organisation necessary for any extensive flying, are receding further and further into the future. The prospects of his buying new machines seem even more remote, however, tempting the opportunity thus to steal a march on the Imam, unless the realisation of a State bank project should bring with it a substantial loan or credit arrangements. The advent of a financier will, in any event, be awaited with no little interest in this country. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Egypt. (5) (Received on 11th February ir&gt;34. with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated 25th January 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 19th January 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 332, ^ DATED THE 5tH DECEMBER 1933. Talaat Pasha Harb, whose anticipated visit to this country by air was reported in my despatch No. 338, Confidential, of the 22nd November [Serial No. (4)&gt;, duly arrived in Jedda on the 3rd December, accompanied by three others associated with him in this mission. He was met on the landing-ground close to the town, which for the previous two days had been the scene of con siderable activity, by the Amir of Jedda. a posse of local notables and a large concourse of the inhabitants. He had left Egypt on the 2nd December and had spent the night at Tor, where he had taken the opportunitv of inspecting the ouarantine station. He had resumed his journey on the 3rd, had descended at Wejh, where a stay of some little time was made, and at Yanbu, where a short stev was necessarv for the purpose of refuelling. His pilot was Mr. G. J. Mahony, of Misr-Airwork, S. A. E. 2. It is still early to learn more than I was able to report in my despatch under reference as to the objects of his visit and the measure of success he is likelv to achieve. I understand from mv Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha is pleased with his reception bv the Saudi authorities. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, has been in Jedda during the past two days, and I learn that conversations have been nroceeding at the Kandara Palace, where the members of the mission are being entertained as the guests of the Saudi Government. 3. Talaat Pasha, whom I met for a short time to-dav, informed me that he proposed to leave for Mecca by car to-morrow and expected to return in two or si5 Lc49FD fhree clays ’ time. He would take to the air again on the 9tli December for Yanbn, whence he intended to go to Medina by car, returning to resume his journey to Egypt from Yanbu two days later. 4 . His visit has naturally received a good deal of local attention, and has, it is believed, excited considerable interest in Government circles. One is in clined to wonder how far Fuad Rev Hamza, during his leave, which was partly spent in Egypt, was instrumental in preparing the ground for this visit. At any rate, the obvious intention of Talaat Pasha is to create an impression as favourable to the objects he has in view as he possibly can. The D. H. Dragon aeroplane has been partly occupied since its arrival in carrying out short demonstration flights for the benefit of both European and native passengers. I am also informed by my Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha, to mark the occasion, brought with him a large selection of goods, probably of Egyptian manufacture, for distribution as charity to the poor of this country. It is pleasant to observe this pious practice, one of the five obligations of the true Moslem, going so happily hand in hand with, and sanctifying, a more material commercial purpose. I hope to be in a position to report further on this matter in due course. ' . * 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt. ( 6 ) (Received on Uth February 1934. with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated 25th January 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 17th January 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 351, dated the 5th December 1933. In my telegram No. 197 of the 15th November, I had the honour to indicate certain aspects of the local financial situation which might have a bearing on the Saudi attitude towards repayment of their debts. I submit herewith a somewhat.fnll er review of the situation. 2. All indications are that the Saudi Government are making the most determined efforts to reduce expenditure to a minimum and to lose no chance of augmenting their income, in order to leave themselves the widest possible margin .for the heavy expenditure entailed by the military preparations, now being undertaking. The latter are, of course, on a scale unparalleled . in the 1 ustory of this country, for tribal contingents from every quarter of Arabia have now been sent south, together with all available munitions, including even such items as a battery of field-guns from Medina brought in by the Turks before the Great War. The tribesmen receive little or no actual pay, but need equip ment, food and transport ; a recent Mecca estimate nut the present expenditure under this head at £5,000 a day. The figure is doubtless exaggerated and will be reduced in anv case once the armv has been transported to the required area, hut even a tenth of this figure would be a sufficient drain on the Saudi income. To minimise it, the Government have recently taken to themselves importing such necessaries as paraffin, rice and sugar through certain old and trusted local firms such as Haji Zeinal Ali Ridha, with whom the Minister of Finance has been in relations since his Bombay days. This practice has hit other merchants hard. 1 3 . The revenue has diminished almost to vanishing point. As you are aware the hulk of it is derived from two sources, pilgrims and customs receipts. The pilgrimage of 1933, 20,000, was the worst since the inauguration of the Saudi rpo-ime and the prospects for 1934 tend to suggest that little, if any. improvement can be looked for. At present three pilgrim ships have arrived from the Straits and Java, bbaring exiguous cargoes of pilsrnms, and hookings are reported poor. The decline in the average value of pilgrims is moreover noticeable. Better-class and rich pilgrims are becoming rnrer. and the tendency seems to be more and more for the pilgrimage to be coufined to peasants, who bring wuth them the minimum sum necessary to do the pilgrimage m the cheapestmanner. This reihices the total of their purchasing power and with it that of the shopkeepers and other classes of Hejazi who live by them. 4. The decline in customs receipts cannot be measured, for no statistics are available, but must be considerable. The decreased number of pilgrims, the uncertainty of future numbers, the decline in the purchasing power of the people, the excessive increase of customs dues last May (see Jedda despatch No. 154) and the he^ivy stocks still held by local merchants as a legacy from the last eighteen months, have all contributed to the redaction of imports. Figures contributed privately by the Director of Customs are remarkable ; during the first eight months, of the current Arabic year (April to November 1933) the number of packages imported through Jedda was 9,847, as compared with 48,735 during a similar period last year. i 5. Customs receipts are in any case heavily mortgaged by the system of drafts which the Saudi Government have adopted to an increasing extent in the last two years as a means of satisfying creditors without paying them. Fuad Bey Hamza told me on the Jst December that no such drafts had been issued since the beginning of the current Arabic year. My information suggests that this statement is not entirely accurate, and that 'certain favoured creditors, notably the importing him mentioned in paragraph 2 , have, in effect, received such drafts ; and that, moreover, these new drafts are “ 100 per cent. ,, ones, i.e., allowing the importer to admit goods free of all duty until the amount of the draft is paid off, instead of the “ 25 per cent.” once formerly issued which merely entitle him to write-off one-quarter of the amount of duty on each consignment while paying the remaining three-quarters in cash. In any case, the total of the drafts issued previous to this Arabic year and still unredeemed must be very large. _ The Soviets are stated to hold 'such drafts in respect of their 1931, importation of kerosene and benzine, but to be holding them, until such time as they can import with less certainty of loss. 6 . All Government revenue is collected—one might say snatched—at the earliest moment and remitted to Riyadh. Forced loans on merchants, which were such a feature of the autumn of 1931, have not been in evidence, principally because of the lack of merchants rich enough to afford them, though this method was recently resorted to to pay Mr. Philby for a consignment of tyres. A tendency to impose new taxes, for example, on motor launches and on water- carts, is, however, noticeable. 7. Meantime other Government expenditure is cut down to the barest minimum. Official salaries are even more in arrear than usual ; for manv months employees were being paid on the principle “ one-third cash, one-third kind, one-third carried forward,” but even this now been modified to “ all carried.” Bribing is consequentlv even easier, cheaper and more prevalent than, before. Money is refused for all kinds of necessary and even profitable expenditure ; the condenser engineer laments the lack of essential spares, and the piping necessary to supply Jedda with good water is not forthcoming. Even contingency allowances for Government offices have of late been held up. Redemption of debt, in such an atmosphere, seems the height of improbability. _ The currency position reflects the e-onera! situation : the Saudi rial, which a year ago stood at 18£ to the £ gold and two years ago at 174, is now fluctuating round 26. The value of its silver content is understood to be about 30 and, while at the moment it is showing a slight tendency to rise, as it does each year before the pilgrimage on account of the demand for it created by the arrival of pilgrims, the general opinion is that, after the pilgrimage, it' will depreciate to nearly 30. 9. Despite the catalogue of depression in the preceding paragraphs, there is some reason to believe that the regime is in reality far from bankrupt and that its protestations of poverty are the result of Semitic cupidity and dislike of disbursement, far more than of actual lack of money. The Minister of Finance has been noticed to be far less worried than he might be expected to be and the Roval Familv still seem able to afford luxurv cars. The monev, however, it is agreed, is not, in the Hejaz, but where it barf been remitted so steadily and so long by the faithful Minister of Finance—Riyadh. 10 .

Talaat Harb Pasha had discussed the project at length with the Saoudi Government and, in the circumstances, it seems doubtful whether Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company (Sudan), Limited, will retain the Banque Misr’s agency for very long. 3. I am sending a copy hereof to the Foreign Office and the Department of Overseas Trade.

You will see from Ryan’s Saving telegram No. 2 of the 11th January [Serial No. ( 8 )], a copv of which has already been sent to you officially in our letter E.-542J72j25 of the 24th January, that Abdul Hamid Shadid, who was previously acting as the agent of the err-Khedive in the project for the establishment of a Saudi State Bank (see correspondence ending with our letter E.-5925|234j25 of the 13th October 1933), has now returned to Saudi Arabia with a proposal of his own on the same lines, for which he claims to have the support of the Westminster Bank. 2 . I expect you are in a position to throw light on this claim, and we should be grateful for information on the point, which we could pass on to Ryan, as he asks. 3.1 am sending copies of this letter to James, at the Colonial Office, Laithwaite at the India Office and Farrer at the Department of Overseas Trade. (H) (Received on 17th February 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 5, dated 1st February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 30th January 1934. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 355, dated the 9th December 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 285 of the 9th September regarding the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that the day of cheap and plenti ful water for Jedda now seems as far off as ever. 2. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziria Committee are still at work at Waziria extending the old Turkish conduit farther back into the foothills in order to increase the head of water, which seeps into it from the subsoil, and a satisfactory flow of water into the town continues. They have,, however, done nothing towards the renewal of the conduit near the town ; and it has now been established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated tilth of ages that the water, which ^.reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of germ. Europeans here consequently eschew it, and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considerations of price a great deal more than by those of hygiene, fights shy. 3. It is estimated that an expenditure of £5,000 would suffice to repair the whole conduit, renewing the piping where necessary, and thus relieve Jedda of any future anxiety as regards water. The water runs from these wells to the town by gravity, and no pumping apparatus, not even the now derelict windmill pump introduced by Mr. Twitchell, is needed. An enterprising municipalitywould whole-heartedly support the scheme. But the Waziria Committee is lethargic. The all-powerful Minister of Finance is believed to be hostile to the scheme because its fruition would necessitate the closing down of the condensers which at present supply the town and would thus deprive him of one small but certain source of revenue. The local merchants on the committee aie tai too much in awe of him to act effectively. M hilst, therefore, the yield of certain municipal taxes has been voted for furthering the scheme and thei e is some talk of a future levy on pilgrims, no efforts are being made to raise on adequate sum for the purpose, and the labours of the well-meaning Dehlavi seem doomed to be stifled through lack of funds. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade. ( 12 ) {Received on 17th February 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated 1st February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 30th January 1934. Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 360, DATED THE 12TH DECEMBER 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 332 of the 5th instant [Serial No. (5)], relative to the visit of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission, under the leadership of Talaat Pasha Narb, to this country, I have the honour to report that the members of the mission left by air for Yenbu on the morning of the 10th December, intending to journey by car thence to Medina and, returning the second day, to resume their flight to Egypt. 2. The programme followed whilst they were in this country conformed closely to that reported in my despatch under reference. Talaat Pasha Narb left Jedda bv car on the 6 th December for Mecca, where he was entertained by Amir Feisal,* Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muhammad- el- Fadhl, and returned on the 8 th, when he dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. 3. The results of the visit, in so far as they are known, or partially known, may be stated under the following heads :— {a) Banque Misr. —T am informed by the manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), that his firm have been given, for the time being, the agency of the Banque Misr as regards its purelv banking business. Mr. Warner expressed fhe opinion, how ever, that it would not be long before the Banque Misr established a branch of their own in this country. {b) Local Representation for Pilgrim Ships.—It is understood that this has been given to the local firm of Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha. It was stated on the 8 th December that, although no written agree ment had at the time been signed, yet Talaat Pasha Narb had definitely promised the representation of this shipping interest to the local firm. Mr. Warner, in this connexion, stated that his firm had been given the handling of the money of Egyptian pilgrims, probably qua agents of the Banque Misr. (c) Pilgrimage by Air from Egypt. —It it believed that this question has received some consideration during the stay of the mission, though I am unaware of the result, if any. I have received the impression that the Saudi Arab Government have not proved very receptive to this idea. (d) Sale of Egyptian Products.—1 am not at present in possession of information on the activities of the mission in regard to the organisation of the sale of Egyptian products. The gratis distribu tion of such goods, to which I referred in my last despatch, was, I find, not confined to the poor alone, but was liberally used as com mercial ground-bait in business circles as well. 4 . T am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Cairo.

M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 359, DATED THE 12tH DECEMBER 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 325 of the 31st October and to m telegram No. 21(1 of the 10th December, relative to the visit of M Roger Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, to Ibn Sand at Riyadh, I have the honour to report that, as foreshadowed in my telegram under reference, my French colleague, who arrived back from leave on the 3rd December, left for Riyadh yesterday m a car provided by the Government in company with Haji Hamdi, the French-Algeiian Vice-Consul and Fuad Bey Hamza. In my interview with the latter on the 10th December, he admitted that M. Maigret’s visit would not be of a purely personal and private nature as I was informed on the 2Hh October by Sheiv.i Abdullah Suleyman. Conversations would take place_ on matters of no great- importance, except to the countries concerned, viz., Syria and Saudi Arabia, and would relate to trade and commercial questions affecting the two countries. Fuad Bey remarked that he expected to be absent in Nejd for about two weeks, but that on his return he hoped to be in a position to give Sir Andrew Ryan more information in regard to the objects of this visit. He also observed that M. Maigret was “ opening the door ” of Nejd to other visitors. 2. 1 understand that M. Maigret’s projected visit was known m Syria at the latest early in November, as the Indian vice-consul of this Legation, passing through Damascus about that time on his return from leave in Istanbul, found rumour very busy with the news. It 'was stated in some quarters, that I ranee was ready to lend countenance to Ibn Sand in his present political difficulties, and the wildest conjectures were current according to wdiich Italy and France were the “ backers ” of the Imam and Ibn Sand respectively in the present dispute, Great Britain, for once, being omitted from the picture. 3 . It would be of great interest to learn in due course from His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch, whether any light, independent of the perhaps somewhat refracted information promised by Fuad Bey Hamza, can be thrown from Syria upon the inward reasons for this visit. Can there be among these matters of mutual commercial interest to the two countries the rather baffling problem of the market for thrones in Syria ?

I have the honour to inform you that the First Secretary of the Polish Lega tion called at the Residency yesterday with reference to the arrears of payment, amounting to thirty thousand pounds (£30,000), due by Ibn Saud to a Polish group in respect of arms and ammunition supplied in 1930. Monsieur Benis explained that the Saudi Government, having agreed to pay interest on the sum outstanding, appeared to intend to rest on this virtuous decision until the end of time. •2 . He wished the Residency to know that a certain Monsieur Wilniewczyc, Professor at Uie Warsaw Polytechnic, had recently left for Jeddah, with a view to negotiating with the Saudi Government an early settlement of the Polish claim. He mentioned this to obviate any risk that distorted accounts of Monsieur Wilniewczyc's mission or activities in Jeddah might reach you. Similarly, in order to obviate any misrepresentations from the Arab side, he had advised Monsieur Wilniewczyc to leave his card on you. No question of his invoking your assistance, however, arose. 3. Monsieur Benis was thanked for his communication. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Office.

In the evening a reception was given at the Sa’udi Arabian Legation which was attended by the Diplomatic and Consular Corps, the leading Iraqi Ministers and officials and senior British officials and their wives. The Sa’udi Charge d’Affaires, Sheikh Ibrahim al Muammer, received his guests with kindly courtesy and was evidently gratified by the cordial congratulations which he received from all present. 3. The occasion was marked in the press by the publication of H. M.’s photograph and of laudatory leading articles praising his achievements. The Nationalist newspapers, such as “ Al Istiqlal ” and “ Al Uqab ”, rejoiced in him as Ihe ruler of the one Arab country free from foreign domination, and heralded him as the keystone of the arch of the longed-for Arab liberation and unity. The Government organ, ” Al Tariq ”, struck a soberer and less ten den cions note and was satisfied merely to indulge in neighbourly rejoicings with the people of Sa’udi Arabia on this happy occasion and to exhort the Governments of both countries to do their utmost to develop the common in terests oi the two kindred nations. r 4 V^ akl ?S da(? allowance for the irresponsibility of journalists, I think it may still sa■ elv be said that Ibn Sa’ud is a popular figure in this country and that the people have never shared or taken any live interest in the Hasimite feud with the House of Sa’ud. Most Iraqis respect Ibn Sa’ud for his personal achievements and tor the honour which he has brought to the Arab race The12 shortcomings of his administration of the Hejaz are, however, fully appreciated by the educated classes and they have no desire that he should extend his rule to this country. 5. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to H.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-717|717|25, dated 6 th February 1934. Lette from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 6 (98|23|3), dated the 12th January 1934. With reference to previous correspondence ending with my despatch No. 172 (1611|134|20) of the 5th June last, relative to the constitutional evolution of this country, 1 have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of January 5 th con tained a short article on the subject of reports in the Egyptian press, of which 1 have no other knowledge, to the effect that Ibn Sa’ud proposed to separate certain part of his dominions, like the Hejaz and to place them “ under the supervision of one of the neutral Sherifs ”, the f^rst of whom would be one of those living at Beirut. The Umm-al-Qura states that, as a result of inquiries in high official circles, it is authorized to deny this report categorically. The officials consulted pointed out the impossibility of any suggestion that the King would do anything to destroy the unity, which he has striven for thirty years to create. 2 . I have thought it wmrth while to draw your attention to this curious report and the emphatic contradiction with which it has been met. You will remember that early in 1926, Sherif Ali Hayder, the head of the principal branch of the Dhawi Zeyd, sought the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in securing the position of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under Ibn Sa’ud and that at a rather earlier stage in the Sa’udi conquest of the Hejaz, it was suggest ed that Sherif Sharaf Adnan Pasha might be set up by the Ibn Sa’ud as ruler of the Hejaz. Little has since been heard of the ambitions of Sherif Ali Haydar and his sons Sharaf Adnan, who entered the employment of Ibn Sa’ud, has sunk into obscurity in Mecca. Whatever his relations with these people, it is to my mind almost inconceivable that he should willingly place any of the Sherifian family in any position of g7/«sz-independent authority. 3. I had already drafted the first two paragraphs of this despatch, when I received a copy, kindly sent to me by Sir H. Satow of his despatch to the Foreign Office No. 119 of December 16th, regarding the Sherif Ali Haydar and his son Abdul Majid. It looks as though that family were letting off a little flight of ballons d’essai. The ambitions of the son, who is or was married to a daughter of his namesake the last Turkish Caliph, are no new thing. He used to ventilate them freely at the Embassy in Constantinople during the period following the Armistice with Turkey. I was on terms of friendship with both father and son at that time, but have had no recent communication with them, except that Sherif Abdul Majid sent me n Christmas card soon after my arrival here. I acknowledged as briefly as politeness would permit. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo and His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut.(18) (Received on 8th March 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 7, dated 15th February 1934.)

However, the Hejaz Government had made a proposal by which a part or total payment of the £30,000 would be made pro vided the Polish group in question would supply the Hejaz Government with further arms and ammunition, smaller in quantity than the previous order. 2 . Monsieur Ben is enquired whether we would have any objection to the conclusion of an agreement on the above lines. He was reminded that the Resi liency was not responsible for Hejaz affairs which were within your competence. He said that he understood that this was the case, but that, as there was no Polish representative at Jedda and as he had to make seme sort of report to his Government, ho was anxious to ascertain, if possible, our views beforehand. The Oriental Secretary thanked Hm for his courtesy and, while reaffirming that Hejaz matters wore not within the competence of the Residency, expressed the private oninion that the proposed transaction was a business one on which we were not called to express an opinion. 3. To-day Monsieur Benis rang up the Oriental Secretary and informed that Monsieur Wilniewczyc had just arrived from Jedda and was verv pessimist ic at the possibility of getting anything at all out of the Hejaz Government. He was, however, submitting to his principals the proposals made by the Hejaz Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 1 above. He seemed to think, however, that there was not much chance of the deal being concluded. (19) {Received on 3rd March 1934, wi*h Political Secretary’s letter No. 7, dated 15th February 1934.)

The reply that they have up to the present no information about this scheme nor any indica- tion that it is to be supported by a British Bank. They point out that it is more than doubtful whether we should be able or willing to do anything to encourage the forimihoi 1 ot a note-issuing Bank in Saudi, Arabia, even if it were to be handled by people whose integrity was entirely above suspicion. The conditions which would permit of a Central Bank being set up seem to be a very long way indeed from being fulfilled m Saudi Arabia, and if the project is ever realized it will, m the opinion of the Treasury, have to be by stages. 2 . They find some difficulty in giving a detailed written opinion on a case such as that of Ydlibi’s scheme, but they add that they would be very glad to have the opportunity to talk it over with you when next you are in England. 2 . On a subsidiary point I may add that we too are mvstified bv Ydlibi’s reference to arrangements in Iraq. Apparently at one time during last year the Iraqi Government had a vague idea of creating a State Bank but we have heard no more about it.

R. Bailey in the Yemen and Aden, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Phillip Cunliffe-Lister that' he would see no objection to a proposal to endorse Mr. Bailey’s passport as “ not valid for Aden, the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen ’V 2. The Passport Office have boon in communication with the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited who have furnished them with Mr. Bailey’s last known address in this country and have stated that he is no longer officially connected with the syndicate. If Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister so desires, a letter can be addressed to Mr. Bailey by the Passport Office requesting him to send them his passport, which is described as passport No. G03 issued at Calcutta in 1928. On receipt, it would be endorsed in the sense suggested. If Mr. Bailey cannot be traced in this country, the Passport Office can issue a circular to His Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers instructing them to make the necessary endorsement on Mr. Bailey’s passport, if it should come into their hands. 3 . It should be realised, however, lhat, even if Mr. Bailey’s passport is endorsed in the manner suggested, the action proposed will not necessarily pre vent his entering Aden or the Yemen. So far as Aden is concerned, it may perhaps deter Mr. Bailey from making further visits, since he will be liable to expulsion if he is found there. On the other hand, if in spite of the action taken by the Passport Office, it proves impossible to secure Mr. Bailey’s passport for the proposed endorsement and he finds his way hack to Aden, the Aden authorities have power to make the necessary entry upon it. With regard to the Yemen, His Majesty’s Government will have done all in their power to prevent his entering that country, and if by chance he should succeed in doing so, the Yemeni author ities are, of course, entitled to expel him. The Resident at Aden wall presumably, if he sees fit, inform the Yemeni authorities of the action taken by His Majesty’s Government in this matter. 4 . Sir John Simon will be glad to be informed whether Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister desires action to be taken by the Passport Office in the sense outlined in paragraph 2 above.

Mr. Davey states that although he was informed by the London Offices of the Perim Coal Company that the Italian surveying ship “ Ammiralgho Mag- nadii ” would visit Perim for coal during December, 19o3, she has not yet been in the port. 3. On 13th January, the Italian sloop “ Ostia ” arrived and embarked oil fuel.

Subsequently Mr. Davey was informed by the Island Police that the^officers, after making their observations at the High Light, descended to the Old ing i o Obstruction Point and there made sketches. 4 It is understood that these sketches were also of the Arabian coastline, but am' did not admit of this being confirmed. H. M S. Penzance '’dl therefore call at Perim on her return parage from Djibouti, when the police officeis cerned will be interviewed. 5 .

TwitchelPs activities in prospecting for gold in Arabia, i recollect quite distinctly the earlier secret information regarding the matter. 2 .

Probably, however, pome member of your Department belongs to the Central Asian Society and either attended the meeting, or will know when it is to take place. 3. I had gathered, from a conversation with McFarlane of Gellatly Hanker and Company Limited that their object in taking a share in this project was less in the hope of obtaining any substantial return tharf from a sense of the need of watching what Philby and Twitchell. were up to Philbv’s previous escapade in regard to gold in the Assyrian Desert turned out, as you will remember, to be a- Ls2 r &gt;6FD-45 / complete fiasco. There were, indeed, indications that the so-called mine had been ‘ salted \ 4. On the other hand we have a certain amount of information about gold mining on the other side of the Ked Sea, near Port Sudan. As long ago as May 1931 Turner (then Commercial Secretary to the Residency) wrote to me to the following effect :— 5. Mr. A. Beeby Thompson, who had advised tire Egyptian Government about oil, and the Sudan Government about water, told Turner that he firmly believed there were really great possibilities about gold mining in various dis tricts between the Nile and the Red Sea. In the past the main practical difficulty in working these deposits was a shortage of water. Nowadays, with motor trans port, the question of water had become much simplified. Many of the workings which are marked as “ ancient gold workings ” in the general economic atlas of Egypt presented to the International Geographical Congress at Cambridge in 1928 by the King of Egypt have, in ancient times, merely been scratched. Beehv Thompson believed that, with up-to-date mining machinery, good results could be obtained. 0 . We have also a note which shows that a gold mine exists at Gebeit which as you know, is not tar from Port Sudan. A new cyanide plant was installed thcie m the autumn of 193o and was supposed to be readv by March 1934 In the autumn of 1933 one of five stamp batteries was already in operation and nro- ducmg about £_,000 worth of gold per month. There are also records of other small mines m the same neighbourhood. ™ J* Sll ^ a isa good deal of evidence that gold does exist on the west c ast of the Red Sea, but there is no evidence whatever of heavy mineralisation in Arabia Judging, however, from our experience in Western Abyssinia the present high price of gold may very well tempt some of the bigger and entirely respectable gold mining companies, probably through an intermediarv to take som, M* r t in Twitched venture since there is 'a market fm the -shares-- if nothing else—of these low-grade gold properties at present. 8 .

When Awayni called on me the following day, April 28, he referred to the enclosed letter. I said that I had seen it hurriedly but that there did not appear to be much in it. He replied cheerfully that it contained all they needed to work on. J did not pursue the subject and we went on to talk about oil, in lines which I reported at the time. As regards the ’Iraqi analogy, I took Ydlibi to be referring to the ’Irak Currency Board and not to any bank. After my interview with him, J turned up page* 128 of the general Report on ’Iraq for 1920-31 and page 26 of the Re port for January-—October, 1.932. I gathered from those reports that the ’Iraqi Government contemplated in 1927 a State Bank, with a monopoly of note issue, but that this scheme was abandoned in favour of the present Currency Board. I do not, however, understand these things and it consoles me to find that the Treasury experts can make as little of Ydlibi’s scheme as I can. Enclosure to Serial No. (69). TRANSLATION.

T. 26524|34, dated 26th June 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister of Jedda, to the Foreign Office, Department or Overseas Trade, No. O.T.-16, dated the 30th May 1934. I I have the honour to report that an announcement appeared in the Mecca newspaper ‘ Umm-al-Qiira ’ on May 5th to the effect that an “ Arabian Steam Navigation Company ” bad been established in Jedda and had purchased two steamers which would run between Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports. One of47 these steamers, a vessel of some three hundred tons from Beirut formerly named “ Andree Edde ” but now renamed “ El h ath ” arrived off Jedda on Uk; 21st May and sailed for Jizan two days later. The otner, also from Beirut and to be named “ El Nasr ”, has not yet arrived. 2 . it would appear that this Company, like the ‘ Arabian Export Com pany ’ described in my despatch No. O.T. 11 of the 4th April last originated in the fertile brain of the Minister of Finance,, who intended at first to use the ships for military transport, but has now conceived the idea of using them for commerce and possibly for the transport of pilgrims in the future. Sheykh Muhammad JSerur as- 8 abban, manager of the Export Co., fills the same position in the Steam Navigation Co., and the Amir Feysal, Fuad Bey Hamza, Sheikh Yusuf Vasin, and other notables are shareholders. The firm of Huseyn ’Awayni, a Syrian well-known connexion with the Lancashire trade and through Ids association with the projects of Mr. A. G. Ydlibij are to act as shipping agents. The steamers themselves are said'to have been bought from or through, a certain Haji Khalil Tabbara, described as the pilgrim agent of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan), Ltd., of Beirut. ?&gt;. it is clear that the new company, while ostensibly a private concern, is ii&gt; fact primarily a Government enterprise, representing the first attempt of the Saudi Government to enter the realms-of commercial navigation. Indeed Sheykh 1 Yusuf Yasin, while stressing the commercial character of the Company in com versation with me a few days ago, said that the Government had undertaken to guarantee any loss- on working. The Government may be encouraged in this venture by the success of the mofor-car companies, which form a parallel instance of semi: private, Government-controlled’ concerns and which were originally in tended for Government transport but now carry the Bulk of the pilgrim-traffic' within the country. 4. It may be recalled in this connexion that in the latter part of King Hussein’s reign, the Hashimite Government acquired at least four small vessels of this type and employed' them either for coastal' work or for transport of' pilgrims, whom they sometimes forced to travel by them. Two or three of these vessel's were attached in Egypt, I believe by order of a court, in satis faction of claims against them and efforts made by the Saudi Government to retrieve them after the fall of Jedda were unsuccessful. Another had been mortgaged to members of the Al-Fadhl family in Jedda and passed into their hands. It subsequently became more or less derelict and I do not know, what has happened to it. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secre tary of State for Foreign* Affairs and H. M. Consul-General'at Beirut. (71) (Received on -1/7?

I take this opportunity of drawing attention to a statement in paragraph 26 °f T the Intelligence Report of the Political Agent, Bahrain for May 1 st to 15th (F. Xo. 33-X.jJ4), that one of the flying boats emploved in the recent reconnais sance of Qatar landed at Jinnah Island on or just after the 11 th May. I presume that as I was not notified by telegraph of this landing, the flying boat did not actually enter Saudi territorial waters. In view, however, of the importance attached in the standing instructions to doing everything possible to obviate protests by the Saudi Government, T suggest for the consideration of the Air Othcer Commanding that it might be well to advise me of causes in which it as been necessary to land in the immediate vicinity of Saudi territory in order to enable me to meet at once any Saudi: criticism. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to H. M.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office No 145 dated the 14th May 1934. yith reference to paragraph 9 of my despatch No. 133 of the 23th April I have Ihe hononr to enclose herewith one copy of the Saudi Green Book whi&lt;h was published in its complete form on the 29th April. It runs, as you will see to over -00 pages ot close print, and I cannot hope to forward a translation'’ I enclose a summary of the contents of the book. The plan of the principal ehap- ters is to provnlc a certain amount of explanation and comment in addition to the numbered documents which form the major portion. Numerous as these doc, - which has passed'since 1927 YwOw' i,n &gt;' thin S. Iike il11 the correspondence importance. On the 8 th May Fuad tome of Iho polribiTit v of seemed to be ot a formidable character, as they were to include a rectitica io o frontiers and an indemnity. I suggested, in a general wav to Fuad Bev iliar. as Ihe King had persistently repeated his demand* in fe T °- . , , it might be somewhat difficult to recede from the position fh ori p mal them was the only condition of peace Fuad BeHeX^ ^ treaty of friendship had also to be concluded and said'that am jmstioli^of&lt;4 guarantees ” would fall to be dealt with in this. Then he added that a tele- jgiaiti, not published in the Green Book, had been addressed to the Imam warn ing him oi tne risks he might run, if actual hostilities became necessary. 2 . The Green Book nevertheless contains texts of great interest. Perhaps le most interesting oi all is the text of the first treaty between Ibn Sand and tne lansi, the exact nature of which has long been a subject of speculation. X enclose a rough translation of this agreement, but as I cannot have it checked at piesent, I would ask that it should not be used for purposes of publication unin a more accurate translation can be made. You will observe that it bears to date the Knli Phu’l Hijja, 1338 (the 31st August, 1920), whereas it is refer red to in the second Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of the 21 st October, 1926, as an agrey- tjl ° ■10th Saiar, 1^39 (the 21th October, 1920). I have ascertained from r uad Bey that the date of signature is correctly stated in the Green Book and taat the latter date is that oi a letter from Ibn Saud approving of it. This gave the agreement final validity, the Idrisi himself having signed the original. ^ 3. The title Imam ” has become so closely associated in European language with the Imam Yahya that it may not be out of place to remind you that if is borne erjually by Ibn Baud as Imam of the Wahabis and by the Idrisi as the religious head of his own adherents. It has often, in the 'past, been applied to them tout court, with results that are nowadays somewhat confusin'. m t' \-V ]l be . Seen from the enclosecl translation that the first Saudi-Idrisi J reaty did not m any precise sense establish frontiers. What it did was to take account oi the ancestral claims of Ibn Saud, founded on the earlv expan- sion oi \\ ahabi and the more recent expansion of the Idrisi, whose pretension^ Jt ” ot actual occupation, extended to areas far greater than his dominion in me Tihama of Asir. The effect of the agreement was to partition the total area which both might claim, but much more with reference to tribes and their ranges than to geographical features. I need not pursue the analvsis further at present. I would point out, however, that, unless a treaty in modern form r tween Ibn Saud and the Imam Y ahya relegates all past arrang’ements to limbo, the agreement of 1920 may still have importance in connexion with the compli cated question of Ibn Sand’s titles. o. lUxt m interest is the account given of the negotiations between Ibn Aio * 10 Imam Yaliya in 1927-28 and the settlement of the Arwa question in 1931. The story of the two missions which Ibn Saud sent to Sana in 1927 and the Y emem missions which came to Mecca in 1928 becomes much clearer than if has hitherto been. The telegrams between the Imam and Ibn Sand which produc ’d the hitter's award, giving Arwa to the Imam are still of interest. The most important points are perhaps the following :—- (a) When the first Saudi mission went to Sana they were confronted with a Y emeni claim to the whole of Asir, as having always been Yemeni, despite Idrisi occupation. The Saudi, mission counterclaimed the whole country as far as Mokha. and. Xchid and inland to Bajil, as having been Idrisi, and denied all lemeni claims in Asir. It is not astonishing that no agreement was reached. (Jj) Chapter III contains proces-verbaux of meetings held during the vi=ic of the second Saudi mission, to Sana. If trustworthy, they hear out the recent Saudi contention tnat an oral agreement of sorts was reached in the course of two meetings, as stated in Mr. Zada’s letter to Mr. Rendel of the 28th July, 1933. ft is.loss important to try to ascertain the effect of that aoTeemenf, none of the versions of which quite agree in terms, than to record the fact that it was clearly a status quo arrangement only. The best of several proofs of tins is that, when sending his own mission immediatelv afterwards to Mecca, the Imam wrote a. letter to Ibn Saud in which he described his object as being to convince.the Knit' of bis claim to “ what is in the hands of the Idrisi 7 too-ofher with all that is counted as of Khaulan-bin-Amr and TIamdan-bim Zeyd.” This, I think, can be taken as a restatement of his demands of the pre vious vear. though it is difficult to estimate the territorial scope of demands in regard lo the inferior, defined with reference to the names of tribal ancestors. (V) The Imam’s mission to Mecca accomplished absolutelv nothin' and though the status quo went on it might well be argued that whatever validity it hod was impaired or destroyed bv the failure of the negotiations in the course n f which it was more or less defined. The Tmam docs not, however, seem to have taken this line. He bided his time until he advanced to Arwa.51 ((/) The A nva hicident led to a fresh meeting of delegations. As you aro aware tue\ r came to a deadlock over territorial questions and tlie Imam lett tue matter to the arbitration of Ibn Sand. The King’s telegram of the 22nd Kajab, loot) (the bra December, 1951), giving Ins awara, is precise only in the phrase : “ 1 say that 1 abandon Jebel Arwa to your Honour.” It is, however, clear from the corresp(&gt;ndnce that other specilic areas had been discussed, including that of the Deni Malik and Jebel Pita, and the Imam, in his reply of tne 27th Kajab, 1350 (the 8 th December, 1931), said that he had instructed his delegates not to pursue the question of that particular area. This goes iar to justify Ibn fraud’s resentment at the Imam's recent interference in the area in ques tion, but the correspondence is in other respects ambiguous. Tne editor of the Green Hook seems hardly justified in stating that the Imam’s teiegiam constitutes a complete recognition of the frontier by the Imam, subject only to a request of consideration of a proposal of his in regard to two named t ribps. From a European point of view the upshot of the Arwa dispute can only be re garded as obscure, except as regards Arwa itself and perhaps the Beni Malik- Fifa area. (e) Immediately after the settlement of the Arwa question, the delegates, signed a Treaty of Friendship, &amp;c., dated the 15th December, 1931. It was noted at the time that this treaty made no reference to frontiers. It has always been doubtful whether tire Imam regarded it as a treaty at all, although the fraud! Government stated later that it had been ratified by an exchange of telegrams. (t now appears from the texts of these as published in the Green Book that Ibn fraud's telegram expressed a straightforward approval of what his delegates had agreed to, but the Imam’s telegram could be read either as an approval or as a postponement pending further discussion. On the face of it, it looks like ^ an approval, but he asked the King to send his delegates again to discuss, out standing minor points. 6 . Chapters VI to XIII relate to the most recent phase beginning about the end of August 1932, when, after delay due to various causes, including the. ILn Rifada revolt, the King again turned his attention seriously to his rela tions with the Imam. I have not had the whole of these chapters translated, as you are familiar with the main course of events and the result of all the nego tiations, including the King’s suggestion for a sort of alliance, has h en negatived so far as any agreements of permanent effect are concerned. 7. I have not yet had time to study Chapter XIV, which deals with the Yam and with Najran. The divergence of views regarding these has been so complete and both parties are, to my mind, on such weak ground that I do not expect the documents to prove of much use either way, but, if I find them to be of sufficient interest. I will submit a further report on them at leisure. 8 . The Imam Yahya is a master of obscure language. Ibn fraud is more capable of precision, but can be equally obscure on occasion. They both, as you ^ know 7 , overlay most of wiiat thev sav with blankets of pious verbiage. I trust, therefore, that you will make allowance for the imperfection of this despatch, which I have prepared at a time of great pressure from rough translations of highly peculiar texts. T have endeavoured to isolate the points which seem to have most bearing on the present dispute, in case the recent happy turn of events should result in a rational general settlement free from the ambiguities of the past. 9 . In this connexion I would revert to my despatch No. 1 of the 2nd January relative to the possibility of a Saudi claim to Hudevda and connected matters. In that despatch I expressed the view that a study of historical events since 1872' might be a useful contribution to an examination of the claims and counter-claims of the two rulers. I have found that to be really useful such a study should go much further back, and, while I have collected a good deal of material, T have found it unite impossible to complete and collate it. The most I can hope to do is to nroduce at some future time a paper of some historical interest, even though a settlement between Ibn fraud and the Imam should deprive it of practical utility. 10. In the meanwhile the facts which T have collected are of use in shaping mv owti views. If I were revising mv despatch No. 1 of 2nd January, I should amend it in various particulars. T should not, however, alter my virnv that Tbn fraud has a good case for claiming both ports of Aeir : that he w r ould have a verv poor ease for claiming as against the Imam, on historical or le°al grounds, the littoral beyond a point somewdiere not far south of the Wadi Tashar ; and52 that neither he nor the Imam has any strong claim to Najran, as against the local tribes. As regards Hudeyda, I find myself supported by no less an authority than Ibn Sand himself, who, in the conversation reported in Sir G. Clayton’s despatch of the 16th July, 1928, to the Colonial Office, said : “ That he would leave the Imam in possession of Hudeyda, to wffiich he recognised the Imam’s clear right.”. 11.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1 . Treaty between His Majesty the King and the Idrisi, signed August 31 1920 (Translation). IN the name of God the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Prayers and peace may be upon the Prophet of God. L9396FDMay it be known to him who sees and reads this that when the Imam Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman-al-Feysal, may God protect him, ordered us to go to the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-bin-Idris to conclude an agreement oi particular Islamic brotherhood and to bring about union in the religion of God and His Prophet, and to invite people to collaborate in good deeds and piousness, to cause good manners to be carried out and evils prohibited, to strive in the Course of the Cause of God and to endeavour to unite the hands against the enemies of the religion. When we approached the above-mentioned Imam he was glad and pleased to hear it. He liked it and he was keen about collaboration in working for the welfare. It was, therefore, decided by us and him to have an agreement of brotherhood concluded between the two above-mentioned Imams on the above- mentioned lines. Whereas there were in the kingdom (f territory) of the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali tribes and cities in Yemen of those which were in the past belonging to A1 Saud, the Imam Abdul Aziz has left them for him because of his desire for the welfare and collaboration in the same and his good behaviour. It is, therefore, necessary, to specify the tribes and to distinguish them in order that each one of them may undertake the duties commanded b} T God in respect of the subjects under him. So the tribes of all Yam, Wadaa and those which belong to them of Beni Jamaa, Sahar, Sharif, Qahtan, Rufeyda and Ubeyda, including Beni Bishr, Beni Talq, Shahran, Beni Shehr, Ghamid, Asir Ghamid, and all “ Qadha ” (province) of Mahayel, including Beni Thua, people of Bareq and Tarqash, people of Ar Rish, and others who belong to them, and all the tribes of Hali mentioned are all under the Imam Abdul Aziz. Those belonging to the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-al-Idrisi are Tihama, except what is mentioned above, and other belongings in his possession. Rijal-al-Ma of Asir is his own .property. Neither party should interfere in affairs of the subjects of the other party. _ The tribes of the Surat, Tihama, Yam and others mentioned above as belonging to Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman cover the villages and the Bedouins in mountains and plain lands. They have to advise and collaborate with each other, and to exert their endeavours in performing their duties commanded by God as to what is necessary for the religion of Islam and in respect of their subjects. This has been issued, written and declared by us, the representa tives of the Imam, as we are acting on his behalf, and by the Imam Muhammad- bin-Ali-bin-Idris, in his presence and under his signature. This agreement and covenant has been given by us and him. He who goes back on his word will be violating his own promise. May God grant us success. Prayers and peace of God may be upon Muhammad, his relatives and friends. 16th Dhul Hijja, 1388 (31st August, 1920). (Seal.) MUHAMMAD-BIN-AjLI-BIN-IDRIS.

(74) (Received on 25th August 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 32 dated the 9th August 1934.) Letter from the Admiralty, to the India Office, No. M.-3453I34 dated the 2nd August 1934. I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council extracts from a report of proceedings of H. M. S. Colombo at Mukalla and Socotra covering the period 23rd to 25th April, 1934. 2 . Similar letters have been sent to the Colonial Office Ministry. and the : Air Enclosure to Serial No. (74). Report of Proceedings of H. M. S. Colombo at Mombasa, for thf, period 23rd to 25th April 1934. Mukalla. 23rd April—24th April (Time Zone 31). 35. The ship arrived at Mukalla at 09-35. On arrival the Port Officer and doctor came off and I arranged to call on His Highness the Sultan. This 1 didat 11-00. In the afternoon His Highness returned my call, was shown round the ship and took tea on board, being saluted with 11 guns on leaving. That night four officers and myself dined with His Highness the Sultan, and were entertained to a cinema show afterwards. A searchlight display was given after dark. 36. Early the next morning His Highness the Sultan sent a present of four live goats, eight tins of honey and four bunches of bananas. The Sultan was very interested in visiting the ship, and did all he could by placing cars at our disposal to make our stay agreeable. The Sultan is half Indian and well informed. He has travelled in Europe and was contemplating another trip shortly, I believe to Vienna. 37. The ship left at 07-00 on the 24th April. Socotra. 25th April (Time Zone—3]). 38. Tire ship arrived at 11 - 00 , and anchored 1 mile off Tamarida in 7 fathoms. Owing to the clearness of water, it being possible to see the bottom at 8 fathoms, it is a little alarming when entering the Bay for the first time. 39. On arrival, a native, who stated he was the “ harbour master ”, came off and said they had not been notified of our visit (actually the letter announcing our arrival was brought to us from Mukalla) and that His Highness the Sultan was in the hills. I accordingly arranged to meet the Sultan ashore at 16-00 that afternoon, which was done. 40. The Sultan had nothing to report and had not been visited bv any other warships or merchant ships. I particularly asked him if any Italians had visited Socotra, which he said was not so. 1 did this as, at Aden I was told that sometime ago Italians from Somaliland had been there and were thought to be surveying. The Sultan and his following are of a level of civili sation similar to the Sheik at Sharjah. The usual courtesies were exchanged in the Audience House, at which I was received with a series of detonations on arrival by the guard firing their rifles. I asked the Sultan if he would like to visit the ship but he excused himself as it was getting late. 41. After giving a searchlight display, the ship left for Lamu at 20-10. Just prior to leaving, His Highness the Sultan sent off a present of two live sheep, for which I returned a present of tea, sweets and cigarettes. I also gave the “ harbour master ” a small present in reply to his request for “ bac Sheesh ”, the only word of practical value he seemed to know. I took a letter for the Sultan for transmission to Aden. (75) Memorandum from the Foreign Office, No. E.-5102]2429|25, dated the 11th August 1934.

With reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 213 of the 18th May, 1932, relative to the constitution of this country, 1 have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of the 22nd June published a “ High Decree ” sanctioning a re organisation of the Ministry of the Interior. I enclose herewith a translation of the first three articles of this measure, the remainder of which deals merely with consequential details of merely transitory importance. 2 . The Regulation of the Council of Ministers of the 19th Sha’aban 1350 [Enclosure 2 to Serial No. ( 1 ) in File No. 132-N.I32], to which reference is made in the second article of the measure, is doubtless that which formed the enclosure to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 118 of the 5th March 1932, and the departments formerly attached to the Ministry of the Interior would appear to be those specified in Article 17 of that measure. This regulation has, however, so far as I am aware, never previously borne this particular date. Mr. Hope Gill’s attempts to ascertain its date, as recorded in the note No. 1518|256|10 addressed by Jedda Chancery to the Eastern Department on the 25th May 1932 succeeding merely in attaching to the measure its date of publication, the 15th January 1932. 3. As you are aware from previous correspondence the Amir Feysal holds permanently the post of President of the Council and Minister of the Interior as well as that of Minister for Foreign Affairs. T^he sole object of the new decree would appear to be to simplify a system of administration, which turns so largely on his personal position and perhaps to make it working more economical by reducing personnel.

( 22 ) (Received on 10th March 1934 with Political Secretary's letter No. 8, dated the 22nd February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 19th February 1934. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 371, dated the 30th December 1933. In my telegram No. 227 of to-day’s date [Serial No. (3)1, I have summed up briefly my conversations with my French colleague and Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the visit of the former, in the company of the latter, to Riyadh. It may interest you to have a fuller account of this episode. 2. As reported in Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 359 of the 12th December j Serial No. (33)], M. Maigret and Fuad Bey started on the 11th December, two days before my own return to Jedda. Thcv reached Riyadh on the morning r f the 15th December and left again on the 18th December, getting back to Jedda and Mecca respectively on the 21st December. 3. M. Maigret lay' very low, as his custom is. until the 27th December. On that day a telephone message, from me asking whether he had returned elicited the offer of a visit. When he came, he first gave me some interesting general impressions. He contrasted Sana, a place where one merely got back to the Middle Ages, with Riyadh, which might he a Babylonian city of 5,000 or 6,000 years ago all sun-dried bricks and silence, in a setting of illimitable desert. 4. I observed presently that M. Maigret’s journey had been the subject of much comment. In order to draw him out, I cited, half-jestingly, the rumours that a Saudi prince was to sit on the Syrian throne, that negotiations regarding the Hejaz Railway were in progress, or that France was intervening in the quar rel between Ibn Sand and the Imam Yahya. 5. M. Maigret endorsed my own sceptical comments on rumours so fantastic and proceeded to tell nm, with an air of great frankness, what he represented as the whole truth. He had a passion for visiting out-of-the-way places. He had a great sympathy' for this countrv. He intended to write a hook. His Government had authorised him to go to Riy-adh, and he had eune there on the invitation of Ibn Sand. He had undoubtedly' talked politics with the King, but only Fmropean politics. France had no political interest in Arabia, except in so far as her uosition in Syria raised certain questions, e.y., in regard to tribes, and intensified her concern with Moslem affairs. His Government alwavs impressed on him the necessity for a discreet avoidance of mixing up in Arabian politics. And so on and so on, for a pleasant hour or more. 6 . It is quite true that M. Maigret, who hardly leaves his house while in Jedda, has a great taste for distant travel in the East. I had been prepared, for this reason and because T do not believe him to “ cut much ice ” with his own Government, to discount the importance of his trip to Riyndh. Nevertheless, his statement left one thing unexplained, namely, why the Saudi Government had authorised the visit Tee ban on non-Moslem access to Bivadh has been slightly relaxed this y r ear, witness the recent visit.of Mr. 'Twitchell, hut the reception thero of any r foreign diplomatic representative is a portent. LrlOflFP16 7. On the 28th December Fuad Bey came to see me for the first time since my return. Our first subject of conversation was M. Maigret’s adventure. I trotted out the same three rumours, with much the same comments as before, and added a vague reference to suggestions that the French Government might be prepared to give some kind of material assistance to Ibn Sand. Fuad Bey expatiated on M. Maigret’s love of travel, his desire to write a book and his great friendliness towards this country and Islam. He dealt systematically with my collection of rumours. There was no present question, he said, of a Saudi candidature for the Syrian Throne. There could be no such question so long as the French were committed to a policy in Syria which turned out on its having a republican constitution, and any modification of which would raise complicated questions, among them that of securing the assent of the League of Nations. If the Saudi Government reopened the question of the Hejaz Railway, as they had it in their minds to do, they would approach His Majesty’s Government in the first instance. All that had happened so far was that his own replies to interviewers in Egypt had had a repercussion in Syria, where he had been asked many ques- tions^and been led to engage in very general conversations of an informal kind. He dismissed more briefly any idea of French intervention in the quarrel with the Imam. 8 . Fuad Bey went on to say that there was, none the less, a business side to M. Maigret’s journey. After obtaining my promise that what he was about to say would be regarded as highly confidential, he explained that when he was in Paris with the Amir Feisal in the spring of last year, certain questions had been broached. Conditions in Paris made it impossible to pursue them at that time. The French had tried later to communicate with him at The Hague and Berlin, but he was alreadv in Moscow when they got into touch with him. Skipping a long interval, he said that eventually the French Government had charged M. Maigret to communicate their views on the desiderata put forward by the Saudi mission last year. They related to war material, a loan and a mission to help with military organisation and the Saudi air force. It had been decided to invite M. Maigret to convey the French reply to the King at Riyadh. 0 . Fuad Bey was much less precise as to the messages which my French colleague had brought. His language generally, rather than any definite state ment, implied that the negotiations were approaching a happy close. As I have stated in mv telegram under reference, he mentioned financiers, and not the French Government, as the providers of the prospective loan, and he said that the mission, though recruited under the auspices of the French Government, would be of a civilian character. 10 . Fuad Bey assured me more than once that these dealings with the French implied no departure from his Government’s policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government. He reminded me lightly and amiably of their failure to obtain from British sources the help they needed. I said that we could not criticise the action of the Saudi Government in cultivating French friendship, and begged him to believe that my desire for information was inspired by interest and not ''by jealousy. I did not comment otherwise on his statement, except for a passing remark, when he mentioned the proposed military mission, that I thought the Saudi Government had been looking to Turkey about a year ago for this kind of assistance. Fuad Bey replied, with a slight and perhaps unintentional lapse from strict accuracy, that there had only been a question of sending young men to be trained in that country. ] 1 . Assuming Fuad Bey’s explanation to have been generally in accordance with the facts, and he was not only more precise but also more convincing than my French colleague, it remains to be seen what advantages the French Government expect in return for their benevolence. I have no means of obtaining information on this subject. My general view is that there wall be little reason for perturba tion, even if the negotiations do in fact produce concrete results. Despite my regard and admiration for Ibn Saud, I have still to discover that, in his dealings with European Powers or commercial interests, he ever gives much that is solid or of durable value for what he receives. I have never thought, for instance, that a power providing an air force can hope for much of a “ cinch ” on the air of Saudi Arabia. 12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representative in Paris and His Majesty’s'consular officers at Beirut and Damascus.17 (23) {Received on 10th March 1934 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 8, dated the 22nd February 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 19tli February 1934. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 16 (172|124i3), ‘ dated the 23rd January 1934. With reference to my telegram No. 2, saving of January 11 [Serial No. (8)1,1 have the honour to state that on January 22, Mr. Philb} related to me in confidence a conversation he had recently had with Abdul-Hamid Bcv Shedid about his new proposals for the creation of a State Bank in this country. Shedid stated that he was now representing J. S. Bartho lomew and Company, a firm with an address in (?) Berkeley Square, who had formed a company under the name of the Hejaz Development Company, with a small capital of which £15,000 was paid up. The registration of this company was «o recent that Shedid had only heard by telegraph after his arrival here on January 9 that the formalities had actually been completed. He gave the names of certain directors, but as Mr. Philby was not sure of these and as we could not identify two knightly names, which he thought he remembered, I refrain from reproducing them. Indeed I would ask you to regard all the details in this despatch as being open to doubt, as I wnte from memory of what Mr. Philby told me from his own memory of a conversation. ^ The promoters hoped, according to Shedid, to interest considerable per- sonsln London, like Viscount Goschen (Westminster Bank), Lord Glenconner, ^ir F Mountain (presumably the insurance magnate) and a Mr. Brown ot Andrew Weir and Company. ' He did not, however, represent their support as assured. The scheme propounded bv Shedid was to create a Bank on the same lines t ,.' nroiected when he was acting or professing to act for the er-Khedive nst vear with the exception that the loan of £ 200,000 gold was to be paid m two Vvn-ts i e £50 000 when the concession was granted and the balance at some later date'’ The croup sought in return various concessions including the construc tion of a port at Jedda, the reconditioning of the railway to Medina road-build ing and any other industrial objects which might be available, e.g., gold-mining. 4 Air Philbv is one of those who were deceived by Shedid last year and were disappointed of the hopes to which he gave rise His present attitude, therefore is one of interest combined with much scepticism. He said he had ,ii aiipiiiii that he could not wonder, if on this occasion he found the Sa udi Government anions to be assured of his credentials before they entertained t is nronosals though the proposals seemed in themselves attractive enough. He burned a Warded answer when Shedid asked whether he, Mr. Philby, h.msell believed in him. 5 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to the Acting High Commissioner at Cairo.

Fuad informed me confidentially at the end of December that there was a r&gt;ro«- poct ot French assistance to Ibn Sand in regard to money, arms and Mission to help with Military organisation and Air service. I have- heard nothing further but a rather unsubstantial rumour has just reached me of recent land ing of French arms at Uqair. Is there any truth in this ? Repeated to Foreign Office No. 11-Saving.

So far as I am aware Hus Majesty’s Government have consistently held since that time no exception could be taken to the importation of war material Ibn Sand from any source.

Your telegram No. 24 of 1st March. My observations are contained in letter to Sir L. Oliphant, dated February 26th [Serial No. (32)J, which is being sent you by next bag. They are to the effect that in a recent letter received from Ibn Saud through Saudi Legation here His Majesty mentions with satisfaction that his relations with Iraq are progressing amicably. I doubt if he would have written in this way had(f he, orntd.) had serious complaint to make against King Ghazi or Ali. 1 see no sign mat former is intriguing against Hejaz Government while the latter is exclusively occupied at present with his ambition for the throne of Syria.

Letter from His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 56 (5401124] 15), dated the 27th January 1934. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your very confidential Despatch No. 54 (E. 847]72|25) of February 8 relative to the persons concerned in the most recent scheme for creating a State Bank in this country. 1 had already received your telegram No. 22 of February 22 [Serial No. (27)]. 2 . I have not so far taken any action on either of these papers, as I prefer not to seek a special interview with the Minister of Finance. I consider that, if the Saudi Government are willing to be warned, what I told the Minister on February 11 should convince them of the need for the utmost caution. They have also probably been warned by Mr. Philby, who tells me that he has had very unfavourable reports from London on the parties concerned in the Hejaz Development Corporation Ltd. 3. Should I have an opportunity of speaking again to the Minister of Finance, I will carry out the instructions in your telegram No. 22 of February 22 but will use great caution in regard to the detailed information given by the Department of Overseas Trade. I am somewhat disquieted, however, to learn that the Department has doubts as to the confidence which would be inspired in financial circles bv the persons named in the second sentence of my telegram No. 13 of January 25. I fear that I myself regarded those persons as being of unquestionable standing in the business world and that in my conversations with Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman, I urged the importance of making sure that the Corporation had really got their backing rather than the importance of investi gating their titles to confidence. 4 . Mr. Philby mentioned one point of interesT, which I gather he had learnt in Saudi circles. * . This was that Sheykh Hafiz Wahba had been in touch with a Mr. Beckett, who is, I understand, the Chairman of the Westminster Bank. 5 . ’Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid left Jedda on February 21. I do not know what progress he had made with his negotiations. (34) (Received on 7th April 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 12, dated 22nd March 1934.)

I have received an urgent telegram from the Imam stating that two foreijm aeroplanes came from direction of Southern Frontier of Yemen and passed over Sanaa flying on a northerly course on 7th March. The flight has obviously caused great perturbation in Sanaa where population are unaccustomed to aeroplanes and still associate them with threat of air action. The Imam declares in his telegram that lie regards it as impossible that flight has been made with the knowledge or under the authority of the British Government but he makes a strong protest and asks for enquiry evidently under the imriressiou lliat machines must he British. I have replied categorically denying that thev came from Aden or the Protectorate and have assured him that such flio-hfs over Jus country cannot lie undertaken without his consent. I have suggested that machines may have been from some other foreign country and have asked him tor further particulars. I have stated that I am reporting to you by telegram and shall ne glad to know whether you can give information of any civilian or foreign service flights over the Yemen. Pending your reply and instructions I am making no enquiries from foreign representatives at Aden which might be misunderstood. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. ( 34 ).

Their object was to find the' vnhm of the eity from which Balkis, Queen of Sheha, travelled to Palestine to see King Solomon. The search involved a flight of about 1,000 miles over the desert, during which a forced landing would probably have been fatal. Tradition varies as to the site of the Biblical Sheha.

Kamaran .—Hastings sailed from Kamaran on 10 th December and car ried out a patrol at dawn off the Yemen coast near the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb followed by a patrol off the African coast, thence across the Gulf of Tajura and along the western extremety of British Somaliland. No dhows were met. At this time of the year, due to weather conditions dhow traffic practically ceases in the Southern end of the Red Sea except, for coastal trade inside the reefs. r ! rade in dates from the Persian Gulf, which is considerable, has only just commenced and cargoes are conveyed in larger dhows than are usualy en countered in this locality. o. Aden. Arrived at Aden on 12 th December preparatory to embarking the Mission proceeding to Sana via Hodeida with the object of negotiating a treaty with the Imam of the -Yemen. b*. The Resident embarked at 08-25 on 15th December and was saluted by the shore battery on leaving Prince of Wales Pier and again on arrival on board when his personal flag was broken at the force. * * * * * 7. Hodeida. —Bad weather was experienced after passing Perim and the passengers, without exception, were glad to reach Hodeida. A national salute was fired on arrival and returned immediately by the shore battery, whose gun, drill was a distinct improvement on the last visit. (November 1932.) The ship was met by a deputation headed by the Governor of Zediya who came on board to welcome the Mission on behalf of the Governor.26 8 . At 15-30 the Resident disembarked accompanied by the Commanding: Officer and Aide-de-Camp and was accorded a salute of 13 guns following which his Hag was struck. ******** 9. The Resident was received by the principal officials and a large guard and band (the latter in uniform) ; also by the majority of the populace who had assembled in their best attire at every available point of vantage. He was conducted to a house near the landing place which had been specially prepared for his accommodation and the party was introduced to the Governor of Hodeida, Saif-al-Islam Abdullah, a younger son of the Iman. Abdullah is aged about nineteen, of slight build and unprepossessing in ap pearance which is accentuated by a receding chin and an attempt to grow a beard ; his eyesight is presumably weak as he wears glasses. After welcom ing the Resident on behalf of the Iman and ordering refreshments he had little to say although Colonel Reilly speaks Arabic fluently. 10. The Mission consists of :— Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E., Chief Commissionier. Resident and Commander-in-Chief of Aden, and appointed Ills Majesty’s Commissioner and Plenipontentiary to the Iman of the Yemen. Mr. R. S. Champion, Political Secretary, Aden. Lieutenant the Hon’ble R. A. F. Hamilton, Aden Protectorate Levies A. D. C. and Transport Officer, attended by a Staff and Retinue of ten persons including :— 1 Arab Officer, Aden Protectorate Levies. 2 Orderlies, Aden Protectorate Levies. 2 W.|T. Operators, Aden Protectorate Levies. 1 Medical Officer (Indian). 3 Personnel servants and 1 cook. 31. Mr. Champion, Political Secretary, in whose hands all the preparatory work had been ably accomplished was unable to travel at the last moment owing to illness. He is an experienced Arabic Scholar and his absence would have been greatly felt by the Mission. He was, however, able to join the Mission later, flying to Kamaran, thence by dhow to the Mainland and motor car to Sana. 12. A portable R. A. F. W. T. set was carried by the Mission and communi cation established with Aden shortly after arrival at Sana. It had also been hoped to obtain permission from the Iman for aeroplanes to land at Sana and thus maintain more direct touch, but this was refused. 13. The Resident arranged to leave for Sana at 07-00 on the following morn ing, stopping for one night on the -way. The road has recently been improved and Ihe journey can actually be done in a day. The negotiations were expected to take until towards the end of January it was not thought that much would be accomplished until after expiration of Ramadan 16th January. Proceeded at noon on 17th December, information having been received that the Mission had started their journey according to plan—a creditable feat in an Arab country on the part of the Transport Officer. Before sailing generous gifts of bullocks, sheep, chickens, pigeons, fruit, coffee and vegetables were received—a present from the Imanic Government and a suitable letter of thanks sent. *•* * * * * * * 16. Political .—It is understood that the situation between Ibn Sa’nd and the 7man is improving and reported that they are again exchanging telegrams. From all accounts fighting has been entirely restricted to Najran and a rumour that Sa’udian troops had infracted the Southern border of Asir has been denied. • * * * * * * ! *27 (38) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E. 1848|72|25, dated 24th March 1934. {Received on 4th April 1934, unth Political Secretary’s letter No. 13, dated the 29th March 1934.)

Ibn Saud had also asked the Polish consortium to supply him with aeroplanes, and to reorganise the Government workshop. 2. Mr. Benis again asked whether the Polish consortium would do well to accept this offer and was again informed that the matter was not one in which we could advise him. 3. He professed anxiety to do nothing which might embarrass His Majesty’s Government whose paramount interests in Arabia he recognised, and said that if His Majesty’s Government preferred that no arms or aeroplanes should be supplied to Ibn Saud the Poles would not supply them. Was there, he en quired, any risk that, if the Polish arms-manufacturers accepted the Saudi terms, Sir Andrew Ryan would oppose the settlement ? Mr. Benis was re minded that Sir Andrew Ryan had a certain number of British debt claims against the Saudi Government to sponsor, the settlement of which he would not wish anything to prejudice. 4. Mr. Benis took this point at once and stated that he would recommend his Government to enquire of your Department whether Polish acceptance of the Saudi Government’s conditions would in any way embarrass His Majesty’s Government. If so, the consortium would be advised against acceptance. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister in Jeddah.

Woods, Esq., M.Y.O., No. E.-2104j 72|25, dated the 17th April 1934. We have sent you officially in our letter No. E.-2104|72-25 of the 17th April a copy of Kyan’s confidential despatch No. 76 (737jl24|18) of the 20 th March regarding a project tor a bank in Saudi-Arabia which has been started by a certain Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi. Ydlibi is a British subject of Syrian origin ^ 10 ^ company in Manchester. \V e had some dealings with him in 1932 when he was attempting to form a syndicate in order to prospect in oil and minerals in the Hejaz. His prospects v r ere thought by the Department of Overseas Trade to be poor and he himself did not inspire confidence. Beside the bank project referred to in Ryan’s despatch, he is now attempting to secure from I bn Saud an oil concession in the neutral zone between Koweit and Saudi- Arabia on behalf of a syndicate, some at any rate of the members of which are also connected with the Eastern and General syndicate. 2 . He apparently expects to obtain the support of a British bank for his own bank scheme. If you should learn anything of any moves in this country con nected with the latter project, we should be glad to know of them and we should ot course welcome any observations you may wish to offer on Ryan’s despatch. 3. 1 am sending copies of this letter to Farrer at the Department of Overseas Trade, Biaxier at tiie Colonial Office and Laithwaite at the India Office. (47) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 17th April 1934. (Received on 5th May 1934, with Political Secretary's letter No. 16 dated 19th April 1934.) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 67 (666j 124{16), dated the 13th March 1934. With reference.to my despatch No. 56 of February 27 [Serial No. (33)], I have the honour to state that 1 had occasion to call on the Saudi Minister of Finance on March 11 and took the opportunity of speaking to him further about the Hejaz Development Corporation, Ltd. 1 said that the further informa tion 1 had received since our last interview added little that was material to what I had then told him, but that it certainly confirmed the view that the com position of the Corporation was not such as to inspire much confidence. I then ^ explained that the registration of a company in England was a mere formality, ^ by which any group of persons could invest themselves with a corporate exist ence, and meant nothing more. 2 . Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman said that the Government had not wished to leave the telegram, which he had shown me on February 11 , unanswered. They had, therefore, exnressed readiness fo receive pronosals from any properly authorised person. ’Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid had not been able to get any thing definite from the Corporation before he left Jedda, but had since telegraphed that they were sending a representative who was expected to arrive in Egypt on March 12 or 13. The Saudi Government had not replied to this telegram.' 3. The Minister of Finance mentioned that, apart from their information from His Majesty’s Government, the Saudi Government had had unfavourable, accounts of the persons concerned in the Corporation from other sources. He gave me the impression of being quite wary. I gather from Mr. Philbv, who is doubtless one of the other sources mentioned in the first sentence of this para graph, it not the only one, that the reason for not answering the latest telegram from ’Abdul Hamid Shedid is that the Government do not consider that it complies with the terms on which they had expressed readiness to receive pro posals. Enclosure 1 to Renal No. (47). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda. to the Foreign Office, No. 76 (737 (124! 16), dated the 20rn March 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 67 of 13th March [Serial No. ( 47 )], relative to the Hejaz Development Corporation, Ltd., and the proposal to create LcIOGFD32 a State Bank in this country, I have the honour to enclose a record of part of my conversation with Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi on 17th March, when he same to * bee me about the projects of the Arabian Development Syndicate, Did. 1 he earlier part of tne conversation related to oil concessions and 1 have reported sepaiatel) wiiat Mr. Ydlibi said to me on that subject. 2 1 have embodied in the enclosed record a few general obser\ations of my own. ' 1 may add here that Mr. Ydlibi impressed me very* unfavourably at this, my first meeting with him. 1 should say that the Saudi Government, ignorant us they are of the intricacies of finance, would find it very difficult to control tne operations of gentlemen so astute as Mr. Ydlibi himself and his local repre sentative Mr. ’Awayni. They might find it far from easy to limit the volume of the note issue and they would almost certainly be incapable of coping with the mysteries of foreign exchanges. 3 I do not feel competent to express any view of the feasibility of the pro ject in itself. I do not know for instance enough of the arrangements in force in Iraq to judge whether the anlogy suggested by Mr. Y r dlibi is sound and whe ther it would be practical to combine ordinary banking with the functions of a currency board. 1 am also puzzled as to what working capital would be available for the banking business, if the whole of the subscribed capital were nmnobihsed to secure the note issue. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (47). Memorandum by Sir Andrew Ryan, dated the 19th March 1934. After speaking about other matters, separately recorded, Mr. ’Abdul Ghani Ydlibi explained to Mr. Furlonge and myself on March 17 the bank scheme which he said he was propounding to the Saudi Government. The scheme is to create a Bank with a capital of £1,000,000 sterling. The Saudi Government would put up half of this , (or £550,000, Mr. Ydlibi threw m) and a British bank the other half. This capital would be applied to the purchase of British War Loan, to be deposited in the Bank of England. The Bank would issue notes on a sterling basis, which would be the only currency in this country—- apparently a forced currency. Such notes would be issued up to the limit of the capital ; not beyond. All Government receipts would be paid into the Bank and it would conduct all transactions in foreign currencies. I asked {a) whether Mr. Ydlibi had reason to think that the Saudi Govern ment could put up the proposed share of the capital ; and (b) whether he w r as assured of the support of a bank in Great Britain as regards the other half. As regards (a) Mr. Ydlibi said that the Government would doubtless have to make its contribution bv stages. Mr. Furlonge understood him to sav that, if they could not find all of some of the money, the^ British partners would lend it to them at interest, an important point which I missed. As regards (b) Mr. Ydlibi said that he had not yet enlisted the support, but he anticipated no difficulty. The business would be perfectly secure, as the capital would be held by the Bank of England. I tried to elucidate the position which would be created as regards general banking. Mr. Ydlibi clearly contemplated that the Bank would have a monopoly of all banking and foreign exchange business. He was less clear as to whether this would result from the attractions it would offer or from the establishment of a legal monopoly. I suggested that in the latter contingencv, it would require a very strong financial police to enforce the monopoly and that it would mean ousting two established interests, viz., the Dutch Bank and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey arid Company, a British concern. Air. Ydlibi said that the Saudi Government would gain (a) by having a stable and secure monetary svstem on a sterling basis and (b) by receiving a half share of the profils of the Bank. He said that the scheme was similar to that which had been adopted in ’Iraq and which had yielded a profit of some £100,000 in 1932. T asked whether the Saudi Government were to get a loan. He replied with a definite negative and said that he had made this quite clear to the Saudi Gov ernment. • Mr. Ydlibi said that the Minister of Finance had approved the scheme. He seemed to hope that this, like his oil concession, might go through before he leaves Jedda on March 21.33 As for Mr. Ydlibi, I told him that his scheme sounded interesting, but I refrained from asking him too many questions. It is, I think, a definite part of his method to represent his projects as being much more advanced at any given moment than they actually are. I cannot believe that the Saudi Govern ment would in present circumstances jump at any scheme, which did not promise immediate ready money. In this connexion, it is worth noting that on March 11 , Mr. Philby spoke of ’Awayni as having come back a week before without any concrete financial offer. At the time I took this to refer to the oil schemes, but it may be that it really arose out of the nature of the Bank scheme. Al though the Ydlibi— ’Awayni combine have hitherto been little heard of in con nexion with definite proposals for a Bank, they have doubtless been considering the matter for some time. It will be remembered that a year ago “ Awayni went to Riyadh, to try and dissuade the King at the last moment from proceed ing with tlie concession to the ca;-Khedive and Abdul Hamid Shedid. Anything said by Mr. Philby must be considered with reference to the fact that he is hostile to the Ydlibi—Awayni combine.

Hodeida. 13. The country was saluted on anchoring ; the return salute extended inter mittently for a quarter of an hour. The British Mission, who had left San A on 12th and arrived at Hodeida on the evening of the 13th, embarked without difficulty in the motor-boat and the dhow with the baggage was cleared by 1130. 15. A present to the Ship of bullocks, sheep, poultry, coffee, fruit and vege tables was sent off by the Yemeni Government. Space in the cold storage did not, however, allow of the retention of the bullocks, which in bovine i&lt;morance of the narrowness of their escape, were therefore returned to the shore accom panied by a suitable letter of explanation and thanks, composed by the Mission Interpreter. The sheep, less bulky, and hence less fortunate, were slaughtered m the dhow by a Somali Stoker. 16. The work and achievements of the Mission have formed the subiect of a separate Report In one matter only do they appear to have met with refusal when a tentative proposal tor the establishment of a Landing Ground—though not on the San A plateau—was put forward. This proposal was strongly discouraged by Qadhi Mahummad Bey (Minister for Foreign Affairs), who explained the Imam’s great aversion to this form of “ exploitation ”, adding that he had previously refused similar requests from the Italian authorities for Air faci lities at Medi and Saliff (on the mainland, opposite to Kamaran Island). • * • • •Aden. 22. H. M. S. Penzance arrived at Aden at 0900 on 17th February. No dhow traffic had been observed south of Kamarau. Colonel Keilly was accorded a ceremonial reception on the return of the Mission ; a salute of 13 gains was tired by the Marhut Hatteij as lenzance approached the anchorage, and an escort of one Flight from No. 8 Squadron Hew over the ship. ^ On anchoring, the Acting Resident (Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Wight wick), the Officer Commanding the British Forces (Group Captain 0. T. Boyd, O.B.L., M.C., A.F.C.), and their staffs proceeded on board to welcome the Resident, Shortly after their return to the shore, Colonel Reilly and the Mission landed, and a salute of 13 guns was bred by Penzance as his flag was struck. After receiving the congratulations of the Foreign Consuls, members of Public Bodies and leading- residents, Colonel Reilly inspected the Guard of Honour mounted by the Royal Air Force, finally proceeding to the Residency where a further Guard was paraded by the Aden Police Force. Lieut.-Colonel Wightwick, after handing over the administration, sailed for India on the 19th. A nti- S l a v e ry 0 per at ions. 24. At 1615 of the 21st, the following telegram from the Government Agent, Perim, was passed to Penzance by the Chief Commissioner— “ Please inform II. M. S. Penzance report received that 3 slaves awaiting shipment at Jebel Siyan by dhow hatch el Ivhaii, nacoda Abdul Razack, or dhow owned by Sheikh Admed Anbari ot Sheikh Seyd. Embarking probably to-night. (Time of origin not stated.)” Jebel Siyan (or Ras Siyan) is situated on the French Somaliland coast, 12 miles S. S. W. from Perim and 100 miles from Aden. 25 Although it was clear that the ship could not arrive in the vicinity of Perim until early on the following morning, it was decided to proceed to sea with all despatch (4j5th power), and the ship sailed at 2015, working up to 14.o knots. This decision was based on the following facts : ( a ) No such positive information of slaving activities has been received in Penzance—nor, as far as is known, in any other sloop—tor some &gt;ears. (1) The name of the dhow and the persons quoted already figured on a “ suspect ” list in the ship. ( C ) The possibility existed that the dhow might be delayed in sailing until late at night, or might decide to remain at anchor off the Atiican coast until after moonset (0045). (d) Although fresh and favourable winds for the passage from the x\fiican coast are to be expected at this season, the possibility ot lighter winds and consequently of a slower passage could not be ignored. ^6 The ship was darkened, and at 0600 passed through the small Strait, when the armed motor boat was lowered in the lee of Perm Island and com menced a north-and-south patrol outside the limits of territorial waters m the approaches to Sheikh Sevd. Meanwhile Penzance proceeded to the northward at power until north of Dubab-a suspected landing place for slave traders when a sweep was made to the west and south. Nothing, however was sight ed, and the motor boat, which also had drawn blank, was picked up at 0650 on (he 2 27 The ship then entered Perim at 0730 to enable the Commanding Officer to discuss the situation with the Government Agent, but immediately after anchoring a dhow, known to be similar to the Path el Khair, was sighted to ”, 1 .;,,,, to the east. The ship at once proceeded to sea, and the board ing boat examined her, but much to the disappointment of all concerned, her papers and a thorough search proved her innocence. 28 On return to harbour, Mr. Davey stated that his informant was a trust worthy native of Suqiya (a Ullage in the Protectorate) who, although he hadconveyed reliable information on other subjects on previous occasions, had not before given any slave trade intelligence. It further transpired that t ie -ui.- nected dhow had been in Perim during the previous day (21st), and than, although given clearance on that morning, she had m fact remained in haiboin until 0000 oh the 22 nd, when she had sailed, presumably for lias Sna . - though it was evidently possible that the presence of Penzance had become kmnvn to the in,coda, the chances to the contrary were felt to be sufficient to render desirable another night patrol. oq After nassino' the day in harbour, the armed motor boat was accordingly directed to iwaSh^an area in the centre of the Small Strait (^h about one mile) from 2200, while Penzance at the same time proceeded to patrol on a east-west across the Large Strait. The S S E. wind, which had been light throughout the day, died away to lirrTit nir*R Vbmm* the niffht and by 0100 on the following morning (23rd», i became clear that, even shimhl the wind subsequently freshen, the dhow could not make the passage under cover of darkness, and might therefore be counted upon to remain in harbour. The patrols were therefore abandoned, and the ship anchored off Perim until daylight During the early morning a light northerly breeze sprang up, which, coupled with the fact that the ship’s presence in the vicinity was by now thoiou 0 hl&gt; advertised,'destroyed any further prospects of success ; Penzance therefore pro ceeded at 0600 to Aden, arriving at 1600. 30 It is a curious coincidence that the information leading to these opera tions should Imve been received within a few hours of the despatch of Penzance » submission referred to in paragraph 16, in which, in connection with the nego- Ih,lions with the Imam, it was stated that no recent evidence as to the continua tion 0 f (be Slave Trade to Yemeni ports had come to the knowledge of Red bej Sloops. “ * - In view of the Imam’s promised support in the suppression of this traffics It now becomes increasingly important to produce proofs positive that, the 1 iadc stlH exists, if only on a much reduced scale, in order that pressure may be applied to him through diplomatic channels to make good his undertakings.

These patrols are stated to be employed mainly on the Abyssinian frontier, and their function from an anti-slavery aspect is therefore the prevention of the entry of slave caravans into Eritrean territory. Doubtless all innocent traffic follows well-defined routes through the mountains of the interior, which may be adequately watched, but to regard the frontier as being closed effectively to small gangs engaged on this or any other illegitimate trade appears optimistic when the total military force is but 130 strong.

He stated—as has been said before—that their function is to “ protect ” the fishing boats working there, as the area falls within the limits of a fishing con cession, covering most of the Eritrean coast, which has been granted to an Italian Firm. 10 . By wind stretch of imagination the Hanish Group can properly he con- ’ sidered lo lie within Italian jurisdiction and against whom protection is required are points upon which comment is superfluous. As, however, Doctor Caraccioli appeared somewhat ill at ease on this topic, and the facts having already been fully reported, the matter was not pressed to the point of posing such embarras sing questions.

During my recent visit to San’a I was informed that in 1933 Bailey had borrowed money from various local people, the repayment of part of \vhich he had offered in the form of a Bill on the Western and General Company, Ltd., of 19 Bloombury Avenue, W. Payment of this Bill had later been refused, and, Bailey having left the country, his creditors in San’a had been unable .o get satisfaction Other private debts that he had contracted there still lemam unsettled, aiid he has left behind him an unsavoury reputation. 3 Bailey had also, in March 1932, been associated in Aden with Charles Lazarus, a South African, and W. Keiller, a local sea-captain, in an unregistered company called the Red Sea Guano Syndicate Ltd which was formed for tne winning of guano from localities in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In he name of the Syndicate he obtained a concession from a Treaty Chief m the Aden Protectorate, but was unable to develop it, and the project tailed m cn- cumstanees that reflected little credit on the promoters. 4 In view of the possibility that, following the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship with the Yemen, British enterprise may be attracted to that country, Ms important that British firms who wish to operate there and the represen- 'utives whom they send should be of the highest standing and character, Bailey is in mv opinion not the example that one would wish ot British conmK.iual integrity and T recommend that if he applies to the authorities m the Cmted Kingdom for papers or facilities for the purpose of revisiting Aden or the l r emen, they should be refused.

Twiielull. an United States citizen, who has made several stays in the country, at first as an expert employed by the Saudi Government for various surveys, etc., and later as a private person with commercial interests. In February of last year he was closely associated with Mr. Hamilton, the representative sent here bv the Standard Oil Company of California to negotiate the Hasa Oil concession, and it was understood at that time that he had interested one or more American concerns, whom he would himself represent, in other mining enterprises, and more particularly gold mining see inter alia para- graph” 15 (c) of the Jedda Report for February 1933 (F. No. Q I-N/33). His earlier explorations had disclosed the existence of gold, though not necessarily in important quantities, in various places, notably the North- Western Heiaz, and two districts not far from Taif and Medina respect ively. Some or all of these places are known historically as sources of gold in ancient times. 2. For some time after February 1933 little more was heard of gold. Nothing appears to have come of Mr. Twitchell’s efforts to interest the American concerns more actively. He pursued his own activities, how r ever, and the continued interest of the Saudi Government in the subject was demonstrated by the inquiry regarding gold mining legislation in the British Empire, which I reported in my despatch No. 372 of the 20th Dec- embtr last. 3. Mr. Twitch ell has now succeeded in obtaining the backing of what appear to be important interests in the United Kingdom. He returned to Jedda cn the 27th June as representative of the recently formed “Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate Limited”, which, it would appear from the press, has been registered in England as a private company with a capital of twenty thousand pounds in one pound shares. 1 understand from Mr. Twitched that the controlling interest in this new concern is that of the Anglo-Oriental and General Investment Trust, one of wdiose directors is on the board of the Syndicate but that the composition of the Syndicate as a whole is unusually varied. Among the other persons and firms interested are a Mr. McDermott and Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company Limited, • whose Jedda manager confirms information from other sources regarding their participation on a small scale. 4. On this occasion Mr. Twitched appears to be entirely independent of the Standard Oil Company of California. He or they or both have indeed been at pains to mark the dissociation. It would have been natural for him to stay in Jedda with his only compatriot, the representative of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, but he has instead taken up his quarters in the local hotel. I believe him to be also entirely disconnect ed with Mr. Philby’s firm, Sharqieh Limited, who have in the past had some interest in gold and who still, I believe, control that old-established but now inert concern Midian Limited. As regards his connections in London, I gather that he explored the possibility of working with the Hejaz Develop ment Corporation Limited. See the correspondence ending with my des patch No. (»7 of the 13th March [Serial No. (47)], but was not impressed 613(C) F&amp;PDby the interests represented in that concern. I think that he regards the Arabian Development Syndicate, in which Mr. Ydlibi and the Eastern and Oneral it! rate Limited are interested, as potential rival v bui of this I am not sure. 5. I gather that Mr. Twitchell’s immediate objective is to treat with the Saudi Government for prospecting rights in any areas likely to pro duce gold, in the hope of eventually obtaining concessions to be worked by subsidiary companies. 6 . It may be worth adding that Mr. Twitchell has acquired some in terest in certain gold mining propositions in the Sudan. In this area he is associated with Messrs. Foley, Bishop and Clark, who appear to have formed or to be forming a company to handle three propositions at places called (?) Wadi Aw, (?) Makraf and a third of the name of which I am even less certain. They are not interested in the proposition at Gebeit, which is being handled by another British subject independently. 7.

Many thanks for your letter E.-4624/2792/25 of August 3rd about Mr. Twitchell’s company for gold mining in Saudi Arabia. 2 . Upon receipt of Ryan’s despatch No. 204 [Serial No. (78)1, we had already asked for a status report which has now been received and of which I enclose a copy. 3. I do not know personally anything about any of the shareholders. Gellatly Hankey told me that they did not expect much to come of this and merely took up their share in order to be informed regarding what was going on. As you know, there is considerable activity in speculative gold mining shares at present owing to the price of gold, the big and first-class gold mining companies frequently take a share in these speculative companies^ but usually are at pains to keep their own name out of the business.

In reply to your letter of the 27th July in which you ask for a report on the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited, I have now made enquir ies and secured the following information :— It is a private company which was registered on the 16th May, 1934 “to acquire any concessions, leases or rights for any mining objects or pur pose”. The nominal capital is £ 20,000 in £1 shares, of which £ 10,000 has been issued for cash and of the issued capital, £1 has been paid on each of 1,252 shares and 4 on each of 8,748 shares. The directors are:— f Louis Hardy (British), Director of Anglo-Oriental and General In vestment Trust Ltd. , Hugh Robert Edwards (American). E. D. McDermott (British), Director of Consolidated Mines Selection Co., Ltd. , ;There are twenty-six shareholders including the following: — Shares. Karl Saben Twitchell (London) 1,000 Louis Hardy, Director ........ 500 William H. Edwards (London) ...... 500 The Rt. Hon. A. S. Lord Castle Steward ..... 750 Hugh Robert Edwards, Director ...... 500 S. H. Verrall, Accountant ....... 600 L. Wm. Payne, Secretary ....... 1,000 Wm. C.

With regard to the control being in the hands of Anglo-Oriental and General Investment Trust Limited, it will be seen from the above that this company does not hold any shares in its own name, but some of the shareholders may be nominees. It will be observed that Louis Hardy is a director of both concerns. (79) {Received on dth September 193£, with Political Secretary's letter No. 54, dated the 23rd August 193£.)

It is related that His Majesty Imam Yahya Hamiduddin, King of the Yemen, has appointed Sheykh Muhammad Ziyara, the Minister of the Palace at Sana, as Representative of the Yemen in Egypt. His Excel lency will be in Egypt at the end of this month (July) and will carry a letter to His Majesty Fuad I from His Majesty Imam Yahya.I 60 £ The first act of the Yemeni Representative in Egypt will be to establish a Yemeni Agency in Cairo and then to negotiate with the competent autho rities with a view to their recognizing him (? the Imam). News from a reliable source says that some Yemenies in Beirut have received a letter from Sana to say that Jlis Majesty Imam Yahya has appointed Siyyid Ali Rida al ’Alavi ts Representative of the Yemen in Syria and the Lebanan; Qadhi Ahmed al Unsi as Representative in Iraq; and Siyyed Muhammad Ibn Ziyara as Representative in Egypt, Siyyed jHussayn Ibn ’Abdul Qader as Representative in Turkey.

It transpired that a friend of his named Hussain al Awayni (Aoueini), now resident in Haifa, desired “to open a shop and received permission to take up permanent residence in Palestine.

The Acting Administrator, Dr. Chohan, informed me that he had received a communication from the Governor of Hodeida, Abdullah Wazir, pointing out that a number of Yemeni subjects, chiefly from Loheiya, who had recently left the mainland for Kamaran, had not yet returned. As the majority of them owed money in Loheiya, he (Wazir) would be very grateful if they could be ordered to leave Kamaran forthwith. 8 . Dr. Chohan caused an immediate census to be taken, which re vealed the fact that there was no less than 16 men and 172 women and children from Loheiya and 20—25 women and children from Khoba still remaining in Kamaran. They were dispersed in small groups throughout the native village, unknown evidently, to the Administrator, Captain Wickham, who had reported Kamaran clear of refugees some weeks previously. 9. An immediate announcement was made by town crier that they would all have to leave within 48 hours, and in spite of arguments, protests and excuses, the sergeant of police was able to report that they were all afloat and clear of Kamaran Harbour at the expiration of this period, viz., noon on 14th August. Abdullah Wazir was informed accordingly. #***##* Aden, 22nd-30th August .— 16. . y . . . Sailed for Hodeida at 0900 on 30th August, having previously embark ed the Political Mission consisting of Lieut.-Colonel M. C. Lake, Political Secretary, Wing Commander R. H.

Arrived at Hodeida at 1400 on 31st August, saluting with 21 guns before anchoring. (Hodeida is now again a saluting port). A boat was atonce sent in for Seleh Jaffer, the Political Clerk, who came off with all information as to the arrangements which had been made as regards land ing, calls, etc. He was followed shortly afterwards by the Secretary to Abdullah Wazir, who sent his greetings and welcome. The Mission, accompanied by myself, left the ship at 1530. Lieut., Colonel lake, as Head of the Mission, being accorded as salute of 13 guns. Large crowds thronged the waterfront to witness the landing and a full sized guard of honour was drawn up outside the house allocated to the Mission for the night. Here Abdullah Wazir received us most affably and with genuine pleasure, whilst a brass band played selections beneath the window. 18. After about twenty-five minutes, Abdullah Wazir, proceeded to the Palace where he subsequently received the Mission again. I excused myself from this second call, and also from the dinner which was provided for the Mission at their house. 19. I cannot refrain from mentioning the rusty ladder , which constitutes the official landing place. The ladder had disintegrated, and the part which remained above water leant, unsecured, against the jetty at a broad angle Consequently, as the boat rose with the swell, so we were borne further from our first objective. The alternatives were a soaking when the boat was alongside in the trough, or a leap when the boat was well (dear cn the crest. Neither of these alternatives was conducive to dignity, particularly as we were suitably dressed for calling and were being watched by hundreds of pairs of eyes. Having gained the ladder, thesecond objective remained, viz., the top of the jetty. This was achieved on landing, by being dragged from the top rung by two Yemeni soldiers, and on leaving, by sitting on the jetty and lowering oneself by hand. Damage to the boat’s hull was certain in any case. Had I been aware of the state of affairs, I should have requested that suitable arrangements might be made before the Mission landed. I have since made the necessary representations. 20 . The Mission left for Sanaa at 06-30 on the following morning (1st September) A description of the gift carried by them from His Majesty to the Imam may be of interest. It was a sword. The scabbard of which was of scarlet velvet, with fittings of gold. The sword itself had a handle of ivory and a hilt of gold. The blade was inscribed, in English on one side and in Arabic on the other :— “From His Majesty King George V of England to His Majesty the Imam Yahya Bin Mohamed Hamid-ud-Din, King of the Yemen.” lieutenant Colonel Lake kindly allowed this beautiful object to be displayed on the Quarterdeck, where it was greatly admired by all. The Mission also carried two gold watches, suitably inscribed for the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary respectively. **#### 21 . Our short stay culminated in a present from Abdullah Wazir which he must have regarded as part of the Ratification, consisting as it did of 1 calf, 4 sheep, 2^ dozen chicken, 3^ dozen pigeons, 20 lbs. ot grapes, 7 dozen eggs, 4 bags of coffee and baskets of bananas, cucumbers, tomatoes and limes I responded with a letter expressing my appreciation of and gratitude for his generous gift, and sent him a consignment of treacle and preserved fruit on the usual scale.

With reference to my despatch No. 286 (2620/115/13) of the 18th September, in which I briefly reported Ibn Sa’ud’s return to Riyadh from Taif, 1 have the honour to inform you that although the King’s movements convey the impression that the general situation in this country give no cause for disquietude. I have recently received reports from two sources which would suggest that Ibn Sa’ud’s triumphant assertion of power in his recent struggle with the Yemen has not altogether overawed certain disaffected elements within his own country. 2. Discontent is said to exist in the Jauf and Teima areas and forces are being sent there to stabilise the situation. My Indian Vice-Consul has just returned from a visit of several weeks to Medina and reports that re cruiting is being unobstrusively ■ carried on in the town, the troops being destined for service in those northern districts. That there was trouble, of an undefined nature, in respect of three tribes in the north whose names however were not specified, I gathered a few days ago indirectly from a subordinate in the Governorate here.—— j 65 S. These reports lend interesting corroboration to the information which has recently been appearing in the Royal Air Rorce Monthly Intelli gence Summaries for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, of which the most recent example is contained in paragraph 261 of the Summary for August, 1934. 4.

The incident occurred on the landing ground Trans Jordan 220 situated intersection Shaib Thanayya Tarais (see Asia 1 over 1,000,000 map) and armoured car track. During the last three years routine patrols have been carried out along this track by the Royal Air Force Trans Jordan Frontier Force and Desert Police without any protest by Ibn Saud. The whole of this track is shown as running within the Hadda Agreement frontier as defined on 1 over 1 , 000,000 map. As you are aware however the recent survey cast doubt on the accuracy of the map, but in view of strategic importance of retaining whole of armoured car track in Trans Jordan if at all possible I submit that it would be inadvisable to disclose this doubt to Ibn Saud at present stage and sug- „ E est that it would be sufficient to reply to the Saudi Arabia Government that the incident in question took place on spot within Trans Jordan Fron- ^ tier as defined by the Hadda Agreement on above map and in the course of routine patrols which have been going on for the last three years.

Immediately before Saudi protest was received His Majesty’s Gov ernment had decided to carry out in near future further survey of this area (lasting 3 or 4 days and involving a few flights and short ground trips to fix 3 or 4 key points) with a view to clearing up various obscurities on points about which accurate information is essential before decision can bereached a,s to line to be taken with Saudi Government on whole question of Transjordan frontier. Arrangements have been made, subject to con currence of acting High Commissioner, for survey to start at end of this month and it is most important that it should not be unnecessarily delayed. I am most reluctant to make any communication to Saudi Government regarding this survey, since it is not intended that aircraft should in any circumstances fly over indisputably Saudi territory and communication might only give impression that His Majesty’s Government were doubtful of the strength of their case in maintaining that car-track and adjacent areas are definitely within Transjordan. Hitherto it has been assumed that this survey could be carried out without risk of difficulty from Saudis since adjoining areas of Saudi terri tory have been believed not to be under effective Saudi administrative control. Present Saudi protest has, however, somewhat modified the situation,, and if you consider that survey in these conditions is likely to lead to danger of serious incident and that this danger might be reduced by some communication to Saudi Government, please telegraph immediately in order that matter may be further considered.

F. intelligence summary from Jerusalem for August paragraph 261 (see also my despatch No. 294 September 25th) reports creation of new Saudi frontier posts and increases in garrison of some of the existing ones. It occurs to me also that presence in this area of tribes migrating into Saudi Arabia might give unwelcome publicity to movement of a survey party but I am unaware whether such migration will still be proceeding at the end of October. If key points are not wide of track and if survey which I note is to be brief be conducted discreetly there may be little to differentiate it from activities of routine patrol (which I assume will not be discontinued on account of present protest). If key points are well east of track obviously much greater discretion must be exercised. In view of the foregoing and inadequate information on material points I find it difficult to size up possibility of serious incident though personally doubt whether anything more serious than a further protest may be expected and to reduce risk of that is not in my opinion worth commu nicating with Saudi Government. Generally I am strongly averse to any such communication. I suggest as to danger of serious incident Transjordan may be in a better position to advise.68 Memorandum No. 1030-S of 1934, dated the 2nd November 1934, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to 1 .

When I was at home on leave recently I expressed the v^w m casual conversation to the India Office, and I think also to the Foreign Office, that in spite of Ibn Saud’s ostensible victory in the Yemen war his—Ibn baud s— stock had probably gone down amongst the Arabs of the 1 ersian Lriixt. The reasons I gave were that when Ibn Saud made his victorious invasion of Yemen territory as far,down as, and including, Hodeidah, there was much talk, not only in the Arab but in the English Press, °f how he was going to follow up*these initial successes: capture Sana, install his son teisal as .Viceroy of the Yemen, exact enormous indemnity from the Imam Yahya, and so forth and that the final result fell far short of these expectations. 2 . I further expressed the opinion that the net result of the campaign in Arab eyes was that while Ibn Saud had secured Nejran, he had evacuated the whole oY the Yemen coast-line, including Hodeidah, without extracting a penny of indemnity from the enemy That the average Arab s idea of statesmanship was :— “The good old rule, the ancient plan, That he shall (take who has the power, And he shall hold who can”, * and that he would refuse to believe that Ibn Saud would have given such easy terms to the Imam if he had been strong enough to impose severer, ones. 3. During an interview which I had with the Shaikh of Kuwait when I nassed through there recently on my way out, he touched on the question of the Saudi-Yemen war, and said definitely that Ibn Saud’s prestige had gone down on the Arab Coast of the Gulf as a result of that campaign. I enclose for ready reference an extract from a recent Kuwait Intelligence Summary, which is to the same effect. The factor of Arab public opinion with regard to Ibn Sand is of some practical importance as his authoritv over his subjects, especially over the tribal elements, depends a good deal on prestige.

Bin Saud and Yemen Campaign. — {a) Since the writer returned from leave, he has found many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border Chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. On all sides he has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much “prestige” as a result of the war. Everywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya He, however, found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and his armies destroyed, so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas—for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Saud to with draw, without so much as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory or paying a rial by way of indemnity? (fc) The barren Nejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, but has merely been given ito her own people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Murra and Ajman tribes.

I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Hamza Bey, arrived in Rome on 9 th September and on the following day visited the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution accompanied by the Italian Minister at Jedda. Later he was the guest at luncheon in the Scacchi Club of Signor Suvich, with whom he subsequently had an official conversation. 2. On 11 th September, His Excellency was received by Signor Mus solini, with whom, according to the official communique, he had &amp; a “cordial conversation on problems interesting the friendly relations between the two countries”; and later on the same day the talks were resumed with Signor Suvich. Other points in his programme included a visit to the “Institute per TOriente” and to an open-air opera. After a reception at the Institute, Fuad Hamza Bey left Rome on the evening of 12th September An interview with him subsequently appeared in the “Giornale d’ltalia” but apart from rather fulsome praise of Fascist Italy and the Duce and the reiterated intention to preserve good relations with this country, it did not contain any statement worthy of special mention.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. *2945/196/40, dated the 6th November 1934. I find at present little in the general situaition to justify a more formal report, but there are one or two matters which appear to call for mention though perhaps inappropriate to a despatch. Amir Feysal left (with Sheykh’ Abdullah Suleyman) for Riyadh yester day evening, a visit which has been impending, according to report, for some time. It was said he was awaiting the arrival of Talaat Pasha Harb by air from Egypt, but the Pasha has failed to appear, (though tents were erected and the landing ground prepared several days ago) and is now said to be due aboujt the 22nd November. Feysal is reported to have been summoned to Riyadh by his father in connexion, the know-alls here would have us believe, with certain differen ces which have been making themselves felt between Feysal and Saud. Jealousy between these two brothers is, I believe, an old story but is said to have grown considerably sharper of late. As I have generally indicated in the Jedda Report for October the reasons given are numerous. Saud is said to be sore that Feysal should have got the lion’s share of the kudos out of the late war with the Yemen- He is jealous, too, of Feysal’s growing popularity in the Hejaz where .the latter’s more easy-going and pleasure- loving temperament suits the public taste more than the Nejdi religious intolerance to which they have been accustomed. Saud' may, moreover, have an eye on the possibility of the demise (or abdication) of the King and may distrust the presence of his younger brother, gradually establishing himself more securely in the saddle, in the Hejaz, the chief source of the wealth of Saudi Arabia. He may, also, imagine Feysal’s relations, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and after his journeys abroad, with foreign powers to be specially intimate; and probably has little use for Fuad Hamza and may suspect the tour of European capitals upon which he has recently been engaged. Feysal, I believe, has denied the report that he goes to Riyadh to be married, and confided to his intimate friend, Suleyman Gabil, recently that he was thoroughly fed up. I must apologise foij retailing so much gossip, but it is, I feel, interest ing and should, I think, be recorded. For the rest, there is nothing fresh to report about the situation at Teima; and Fuad Hamza has still to arrive back frpm his tour (thoucj/l gather from a recent despatch from Baghdad that he might go over there first).

Will your Excellency tell me in detail what was the aim in present circumstances of your visit to the European capitals ? A . I went to Europe on a private visit to take a rest, but I also took the opportunity of meeting the men of Italy, France and Great Britain of discussing with them questions of interest to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz and of solving some of the outstanding problems. I visited Italy and met Signor Mussolini. This visit served to confirm the good relations existing between the Italian and Arabian Governments. I visited the French capital and met the men of its Government and spoke to that experienced politician the late M. Barthou, whose death was a great loss to the French nation He was an energetic man, and he wisely steered French policy in the stormy sea of politics I visited the English, capital and met the Hon’ble Sir John Simon, the Foreign Minister, and other men of the British Government. I am glad to be able to declare that we succeeded in overcoming many difficulties and in coming to an understanding about many questions which are of interest to the Arab Saudi and the British Governments. &lt;2. Hejaz being one of the Governments that inaugurated the League of Nations, is it the intention of His Majesty to use that right, having neelected so far to claim ii t _ &gt; &amp; &amp; A . Hejaz, which was one of the Governments which founded the Leacm* of Nations, was then an independent country by itself. Now it is not &amp; 6i3(C) F&amp;PD - - \7J. t Q. But the Government of His Majesty Abdul Aziz has inherited the Rejaz Kingdom! A. If we had inherited that, we should have inherited also some other things which are not in our interest. So is it better not to have inherited anything. Q. Then is it not the intention of the Government of His Majesty to enter the League of Nations ? A It is possible that this question is now under discussion. Q. What about the negotiations concerning the Hejaz Railway? A . Negotiations on that subject are taking place between the Arabian, French and English Governments. Probably a conference will be held shortly to take a final decision about this railway. Q. Is it not to the interest of Hejaz, Syria and the Moslem world to have the line between Maan and Medina repaired and put into action, and leave other questions to be discussed later ? A . Among other questions considered during the negotiations, which took place a long time ago, was the repairing of the line between Maan and Medina. One of the subjects to be discussed by the conference is the way for securing the necessary funds for repairing this part of the line.

M. the King have a week ago noticed the presence of two aeroplanes of the British Air Force at Thaniya Tarif, north of and one “Marhala” (a day’s journey) distant from Fajr. They have also seen six of the armed soldiers of the Camel Corps of the Transjordan frontier forces. Your honour is not unaware of the fact that the above mentioned place lies within the frontiers of the territories of the Government of H. M. the King and that the presence of aeroplanes and armed forces therein must be rpcnrded as a transgression and violation of the rights of the territories belonging to His Majesty. I am therefore directed to express strong regret at such aggression ami to lodge the protect of the Government of H. M. officially for such ‘manifest aggression against their territories. I await adequate satisfaction for this incident and (hope) to learn of the measures which will be taken to avoid its recurrence. i . _ , : .75 &lt; (103) {Received by Air Mail under No. P. 2,.-7££5/34, dated the 8th December X934-) Telegram from the India Office, to Political Resident, Bushire, No. 2897, dated the 7th December 1934.

The point is, of course, of importance, since, as Fowle says, “Ibn Saud’s authority over his subjects, especially over the tribal elements,, depends a good deal on prestige”. 2.

( 105 ) (Received on 23rd December 1934, u\ith Political Secretary s letter l\o. 49, v dated 6th December 1934-) Letter from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 91, dated the 4th April 1934. 1 have the honour to refer to your despatch No 1, dated 4th January 1933 in which you authorised the payment to His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla of the arrears of his stipend for a period of three years &gt;nlv from 1st April 1930 to 31st March 1933. The Sultan has been informed &gt;f your decisioi, but he has not yet drawn the amount which you have sanctioned. 2 In vour despatch under reference you anticipated that difficulty • —vif Hp pvnprienced in resisting payment of the whole of the arrears which f a v g e accrue P d in Ae event of the Sultan invoking his Treaty obligations. This difficulty has now arisen, as the Sultan has addressed a letter to me fn the 27th February in which he asks for reconsideration of this qrestion ' e ground that he is entitled to the full arrears under the terms of his Treaty of 1882 with the British Government m which there is no stipula tion that he is bound to draw his stipend annually, or that he will be deprivedof it if he fails to do so. He further represents that his stipend was allowed to fall into arrears because of its small annual amount, that his predecessor Sultan Ghaleb was permitted to draw arrears accumulated for a large number of years, and that neither his predecessor nor he himself was warned that arrears would in future be forfeited. 3. All the Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, including His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, have now been told that their stipend must be drawn punctually or not at all, but I consider that there is a good deal of ioice in the Sultan s contention that a retrospective insistence of this con dition m contradiction of a comparatively recent precedent and without previous intimation of its adoption is opposed to the spirit, if not to the letter, of his Treaty. The existence of the Aden Protectorate is based on mutual obligation established by treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the local Chiefs, and a scruplous observation of the conditions of these treaties is essential to the maintenance of our relationship with them. I feel very strongly that there should never be any doubt that obligations under the treaties will be fully honoured, and I consider that in a case of some uncertainty, such as the present one, it is better to accept rather than to repudiate a claim for which there appears to be a good though perhaps not a conclusive case. For this reason I venture to recommend a considera tion of the orders conveyed to me in your despatch of the 4th January 1933, and the payment of the arrears of stipend due to the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla in full from 1 st October 1917. 4. I base my request primarily on a point of principle, but I desire to add a plea for generous treatment in this case on account of the consistently loyal and helpful attitude of the Mukalla authorities in all matters in which their co-operation or assistance is desired by the Aden Residency. This has been notably evident in connection with landing grounds and other facilities for the Royal Air Force in Mukalla territory and its neighbourhoods Mukalla is the most important place and the pivot of our policy in the eastern part of the Protectorate, but its Sultan nevertheless receives one of the smallest of the stipends paid to Protectorate Chiefs, and he is never given money presents such as are often bestowed upon others in the Pro tectorate The amount of his stipend—Rs. 60 a month—is, in fact, so low that it can be regarded as little more than a token of the mutual rela tionship between him and His Majesty’s Government; and, as such, I con sider that it ought not to be allowed to lapse, even temporarily, in a case such as the one which I now submit for your reconsideration. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (105). f * j • Letter from the Treasury, to the Colonial Office, No. S. -32316, dated the 7th November 1934. I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Cowell’s letter of the 3rd July (37953/34), and subsequent semi-official correspondence, relative to the payment of arrears of stipend claimed by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla. In reply, I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister that, having regard to the terms of the treaty under which this stipend is paid, My Lords are now prepared to agree to the payment of arrears accrued since the accession of ithe present Sultan in 1922, amounting to approximately £675. They note however that Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is advised that, as the treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consideration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles I and 3 of the treaty, the obligation of His Majesty’s Government is not to be regarded as extending to arrears which his predecessor had waived or failed to .secure, and in these circumstances. They are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to the present Sultan’s accession.77 My Lords note that savings are available on the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote from which this payment can be met, and that one- third of the amount will be recovered from the Government of India under the usual arrangements. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (105). Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, No. 136, DATED THE 23RD NOVEMBER 1934. I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 91 of the 4th of April | Serial No. (105)], regarding the arrears of stipend claimed by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, and to inform you that this matter has been further considered in consultation with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. 2. The legal position under the Treaty of 1882 has been examined, and I am advised that as the Treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consi deration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles 1 and 3 the Sultan could reasonably claim arrears of stipend which accrued during his own reign; but not arrears which his predecessor had ^ waived or been unable to secure. 3. In these circumstances the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury aoree that the Sultan should be paid the arrears of stipend which have accrued since his accession in June 1922 amounting to approximately £675, but they are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to that date. I am accordingly to convey to you my sanction for the issue to the Sultan of the arrears of the stipend from the date of his assumption of Chieftainship n June 1922. 4 . In order to prevent any accumulation of arrears of stipends in future, I consider that all stipends should be paid automatically each year without awaiting applications from the stipendiary chiefs. By this method the strict obligations of Government to the Chiefs will be discharged and the accumulation of arrears will be prevented. Unless you see any objection I have /to request that you will arrange for this procedure to be adopted in future. .

We have come across rather a curious point in connection with the division of agencies. In a Gazetteer issued by Geo. Philip and Son, Ltd., it is stated that Aden,including the Protectorate of Perim, is officially part of the Bombay Presidency, that the Government is administered jointly by the India Office and the Foreign Office through a Political Resident, and that the principal coinage is the Indian rupee. In appointing agents we have hitherto considered Aden and Perim as a separate territory from the Bombay Presidency, and are anxious to continue doing so, but if the official status is as above, it will be necessary for us to make a distinction within the agency agreements we have. We should very much appreciate any comments which would show whether they may legitimately be considered quite separately from the agency point of view.

You may be glad to know that the Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, intends to spend about a week in Baghdad on his way to S^-udi Arabia on leave. We cannot say exactly when he will be in Baghdad, but he told Rendel he was leaving London on the 3 rd December and would travel via Palestine to Baghdad, leaving Alexandria by rail on the 24th December.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 34 (3035/5/52), dated the 24th November 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 341 (2992/5/49) of the 16th November [Serial No. ( 1 )], with which I transmitted to you a copy of my despatch No. 2991/5/ 49 [Enclosure 2 to Serial No. ( 1 )] of the same date to H. M. Ambassador, Baghdad, 1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the Saudi Arab Government’s reply to my note No. 194 of the 16th November (Enclosure 3, ibid) regarding the violation of Saudi territpry by three aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force which forced landed on Jinnah Island in the Persian Gulf on the 26th October last. 2 . The tone of the Saudi note, it will be observed, is stiff and a definite under standing regarding incidents of this nature is regarded by the Saudi Arab Govern ment as essential. That some hardening in their attitude was to be expected was foreshadowed by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 206 of the 3rd July last [endorsement to Serial No. ( 6 ) in File No. 7-N/34)] and in an instance of this sort, where a considerable delay supervened before the incident was brought to the notice of H. M/s Ambassador at Baghdad, is scarcely a matter for surprise. 3 . I am at present unable to say when the discussion of this question is likely to commence. Fuad Bey Hamza has not yet returned to this country and though he might possibly arrive tomorrow, the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, I learn to-day in connection with another matter, are still in ignorance of the date of his arrival. 4 . I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambas sador, Baghdad, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Enclosure to Serial No. (3). (Translatim.) Letter from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, No. 5/2/87, dated the 22nd November 1934.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 358, dated the 4th December 1931. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 219 of the 9th July last, in which he reported the d$partur$ of Fuad Bey Hamza from Jedda, I have the honour to inform you that Fuad Bey returned to this country on the 2 nd December. Accompanied by his brother Said Hamza, he travelled from Suez by an Italian ship of the Tirrenian Line and on arrival was met on board by Sheykh Ali Taha, the Deputy Governor of Jedda and Jedda representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by Signor Persico, the Italian Charge d'Affaires. I have reason to believe that several of my colleagues attended at the Quarantine Quay to welcome Fuad Bey on landing, although no formal notification of his arrival had been com municated, as far as I am aware, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Deputy Minister was also met on landing by a number of local notables. I understand that he attended a lunch given in his honour by liis Syrian compatriots and in the ev ning left for Mecca. 2 . Fuad Bey’s return, therefore, took place under more cheerful auspices than those which marked his departure last July. I am not yet aware of his immediate movements, whether he will remain in Mecca for the present, or whether he will, as upon his return from abroad last year, go direct to Riyadh to see the King. The latter alternative seems not improbable, as AmirFeysal is also at present with Ibn Saud at Riyadh.

He will return to Kamaran, when fit to travel, for the purpose of winding up his private affairs. Captain Wickham has been at Tvamaran for some 15 years, and his illness and consequent retirement will be much regretted not only by the present peisonnel of the Red Sea Sloops but also by his many naval friends of earlier days. ******** Mai alia. 13. Arrived and anchored at 1030 on 22 nd October. The Commanding Officer called on the Wazir, Salem Ahmed Alkoati, His Highness the Sultan having sailed for India some ten days previously. The Wazir, who has only held the post for nine months (i.e., subsequent to the last visit of a Red Sea Sloop in January 1934), is dull and unprepossessing in comparison with his predecessor. He returned the visit at 1530 on the same day, and was recorded a salute of 11 guns on his departure. 14. Business in the town appears to be flourishing; the bazaar is full and active, while the inhabitants present a remarkably cheerful and well fed appear ance, the latter in marked contrast to that observed in most South Arabian ports. It is understood tha the construction of the motor road to the Hadramaut, referred to in previous Reports of Proceedings, has made little, if any, progress m the mountain districts. 15 On the 23rd I visited the English School, by the invitation of the Indian Schoolmaster, Ibrahim Soogan, who for many years had taught in the Danish Mission School in The Crater, Aden. The school, which was established some *6 months ago by the Sultan, is row attended three times weekly by about 60 boys, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years, of whom a third are Indians. After the inspection of the Guard of Boy Scouts, an Address of Welcome was read by the senior student, and was followed by a demonstration of the principal subjects of instruction. Proceedings terminated by the singing, with much zest, of the National Anthem, first in English and then in Arabic. In a short speech I congratulated the Schoolmaster and his pupils on the results achieved in so short a time, and laid emphasis on the great value and universal appeal of the Boy Scouts’ Movement. In the evening the Schoolmaster and nine of the senior Scouts came on board and were shown round the ship. 16. It had been arranged with the Chief C mmissioner that a short visit should be paid to Bal Haf while on passage to Aden (Bir Ali was not included, as the Sheikh is at present in bad odour), but on the receipt of instructions (Admiralty message timed 1416/20) that Their Lordships were to be kept informed of the details of the reception ceremonies proposed for the forthcoming visit of His Majesty the King of Italy to Aden, it became necessary to allow a larger margin of time for consult ing the Chief Commissioner and transmitting the required intelligence. With his concurrence, Bal Haf was therefore omitted from the programme, and “ Pen zance v sailed at 0415 on the 24th for Aden direct, arriving at 0700 on the following day.5 * 8 Aden. 17. The forthcoming visit of H. M. T^e King of Italy was immediately dis cussed with the Chief Commissioner, when it was found that some uncertainty prevailed as to the policy whi h should be adopted for his reception. On the one hand a telegram from the Secretary of State for India ^No. 2455— the equivalent of A miralty message timed 1416/20) indicated the pleasure of His Britannic Majesty to be that full honours and compliments should be rendered, whether His Majesty was travelling incognito or otherwise, provided that his Standard was flying, while a further message \No. 2484) stated that such would be the case. , On the other hand, the Italian Consul had received information that the Stand ard would not be flown, and that His Majesty desired to land privately. He wa‘ therefore requested to obtain confirmation of this fact, pointing out that it was at variance with the information received from London, and to st te that should the Standard not be flown, no royal honours would be accorded (“ Penzance’s message timed 2132/25.) 18. On the following day (26th) the Secretary of State informed the Chief Commissioner (telegram No. 2521) that no notification had been received of any c hange in the King’s plans. Further passages in the message were taken to indicate that the intimation that the Standard would be flown had originated from His Majesty and had been accompanied by a personal letter of thanks to His Britannic Majesty. This message was followed and reinforced on 27th by a further one (No. 2537), stating that information from His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Rome was to the effect that Italian officials stated that it was His Majesty’s invariable practice to fly his Standard, and that, in their opinion, the Italian Consul had been misin formed. It was conside ed by the Embassy that Italian wishes would be met by the reception of His Majesty with a gun salute, and that, as he wished his visit to be private, he should be spared all unnecessary ceremony ashore, other than the parading of a Guard of Honour. On the same day, however, the Consul obtained a positive statement from the Royal Yacht that the Standard would not be flown. As this was in answer to the enquiries referred to in paragraph 17, it was held to constitute a clear indication that His Majesty did not desire to be received with any ceremony, and the Consul was therefore asked to state that in deference to these wishes honours would not be rendered. The main situation thus appeared to be clear, and was reported in my message timed 1237/27. 19. A minor complication, however, arose from the fact that at a Residency Meeting that evening (27th) the Consul announced that the escorting cruiser “ Gorizia ” was flying the flag of Admiral of Division Conte Luigi Mira glia. In the absence of the Royal Standard it appeared to me evident that his flag should be saluted by “ Penzance ”, although the presence of His Majesty, admittedly in a private capacity, made such a procedure appear somewhat illogical unless what I take to be the strict interpretation of the situation, viz., that in the absence of the Standard, His Majesty was not, from a ceremonial aspect, present in the yacht, was constantly borne in mind. The Consul was therefore asked to ascertain the wishes of the Rear Admiral as regards the marks of respect to be paid to him and I reported the matter in my message timed 0107/28, receiving in reply Admiralty message 1352/28. 20 . On the evening of the 28th I was summoned to a further conference at the Residency at which the Chief Commissioner quoted three further messages receiv ed during that day from the Secretary of State (Nos. 2541, 2542 and 2554). These were to the effect that the earlier reports that the Standard would not be flown has caused considerable surprise in London and that His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Rome had notified that the Master of Ceremonies, in a personal inter view, had again emphasised that His Majesty invariably flew his Standard and would expect gun salutes, and, if he landed, a Guard of Honour, notwithstand ing that Ids visit was of a private nature. MS89FD21 . Influenced by these repeated expressions of the opinions held by London and Rome as to His Majesty's wishes, and taking into account the complication referred to in paragraph 19 (particularly as rrgaids its effect on the huge native population of Aden who, being unable to appreciate the circumstances of an un official visit, would regard the omission of Royal Honours as most unusual), it was decided that full compliments should be paid, it being held that in the un usual circumstances of a Sovereign paying a visit to a foreign military port of a status such as that of Aden, without flying his Standard although under naval escort, an excess of ceremony was to be preferred to a deficiency. In his advance message of welcome which he sent that evening, Sir Bernard Reilly therefore stated his desire to render the usual honours on the arrival of the \acht, unless the King desired to the contrary, to which His Majesty replied with an expression of thanks. Apart from the fact that it was evidently impossible for His Majesty’s Ship under my command not to fire a Royal Salute when the military forces were render ing this honour, but instead to salute the flag of the Rear Admiral, I myself con curred in the decision recorded above. The rendering of other naval honours, in my opinion, followed as a necessary corollary, and arrangements were therefore made to dress ship, man ship, and cheer. It will be appreciated that these decisions taken only a few hours before the expected arrival of His Majesty could not under the circumstances be submitted to Their Lordships for prior approval. Monday, 29th October. 22 . H. M. S. “ Penzance ', the military signal stations and merchant vessels in port dressed ship overall at 0800. On approaching the Fairway Buoy “ Gorizia ” saluted the Countrv, which was returned by the Marbut Battery. The Royal Yacht “ Savoia ', followed by “ Gorizia ” entered the Inner Harbour at 1330, when a Royal Salute, synchronised by V/S signals, was ffred by “ Penzance ” and the shore battery. On the near approach of “ Savoia “ Penzance ” manned ship, rendered military honours and cheered ship. “ Savoia ” proceeded to No. 4 buoy, head west, and was thus in close proxi mity to “ Penzance ” (No. 2 buoy, head east), while “ Gorizia ” proceeded to No. 2 fuelling berth, military honours being paid by “ Penzance as she passed. The Royal Standard was not flying, neither was it hoisted at anv time through out the visit. As far as could be seen, no marks of respect were rendered by Gorizia when passing the \ acht, either on entering harbour or on departure. 23. The Chief Commissioner, flying his Flag and accompanied by Group Captain C. F. A. Portal, D. S. 0. M. C. (Officer Commanding British Forces), proceeded at once on board Savoia to offer his respects and welcome to His Majesty. even ^ n 8 &gt; Sir Bernard Reilly, the Group Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, ^. M. McLeod (Commanding British Troops) and the Aide de Camp had the honour of dining with His Majesty; these invitations had been issued by the Consul. 24. Before the operation of securing was completed the Officer of the Guard from “ Gorizia called on me (having passed “ Penzance’s ” Officer of the Guard between the two ships) and presented a request from Rear Admiral Conte Luigi Miraglia that in view of the short duration of the stay I should refrain from call ing on him. 25. A police boat patrolled round the Yacht during the whole of the visit. Tuesday, 30th October. 26. As on the preceding day, “Penzance”, the shore signal stations and merchant shipping dressed ship overall at 0800. . Hls Majesty landed at the Prince of Wales’ Pier at 0700, and was received with a Royal Guard provided by the British troops and Royal Air Force.7 A field battery of the Royal Artillery was temporarily sited on the Post Office 1 ier, and fired a Royal Salute as His Majesty stepped ashore. Penzance mounted a Guard of Honour, hut no ceremony was observed in “ Gorizia / ns P ect \ n £ t ^ e fhiard, His Majesty accompanied by his suite and oy the Chief Commissioner and certain British officials made a tour of the town by car, visiting first the Tanks in the Crater and then proceeding to the Italian Salt Works where the Italian staff were presented. Here His Majesty displayed his remarkable memory when, on beii g informed of the regiments in which certain members of the staff had fought during the Great War, he recalled in many instances the names of the Commanding Officers. The Settlements Gardens at Sheikh Othman were then inspected, after which the procession returned to the Residency. Here a number of other officers and officials, among them myself, had the honour of being presented to His Majesty, with each of whom he found time to have a short conversation. * His Majesty speaks excellent English. J J After light refreshments His Majesty re-embarked, the Guard of Honour being now provided by the Aden Levies. A Royal Salute was again fired by the field battery. “ Penzance’s guard paraded, and on this occasion it appeared that a Guard was also mounted in “ Gorizia ”, although elsewhere the work of the ship proceed ed without apparent interruption. 28. *' Gorizia ’’ proceeded to sea at 1130, followed by “ Savoia” at 1210. As the Yacht passed “ Penzance ” the same honours were rendered as on her arrival, and as she reached the entrance to the Inner Harbour, Royal Salutes were fired by the ship and Marbut battery. 29. The Chief Commissioner informs me that from his bearing and g meral demeanour throughout the visit he is confident that His Majesty was genuinely pleased with the arrangements made for his reception ; this opinion was fully confirmed by subsequent reports from the Consul, to whom His Majesty and lead ing members of his entourage had expressed their complete satisfaction. Sir Bernard has since received a telegram from London, expressing His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the arrangements made, and congratiTlating him on his tactful handling of the situation. ************* * ( 6 ) (Received on 2nd February 1935, with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated the 17th January 1935.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 11 th January 1935. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affairs, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 349, dated the 27th November 1934. With reference to my despatch No. 360 of the 12 th December 1933 [Serial No. ( 12 ) in F. No. 17-N./34], relative to the visit to this countrV'by air of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission headed by Muhammad' Talaat Harb Pasha, I have the honour to inform you that on the 22 nd November a similar mission arrived from hgypt by aeroplane, almost a year since the first visit was made. The mem bers of the mission this year are Midhat Yeghen Pasha, chairman of directors of the Banque Misr ; Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha, deputy chairman of directors of the Banque Misr and Egyptian Senator; Fuad Bey Sultan and Ismail Bey Jad Barakat, members of the board of directors of Banque Misr; Kemal Bey Aloui, manager of Misr Airwork, S.A.E. ; and Mukammad-al-Masiri Bey, manager of the Egyptian Steam Navigation Company. The party, which is considerably stronger in its composition than that of last year, arrived towards sunset in two aeroplanes, and were officially welcomed on arrival by the Amir of Jedda, who was accompanied by local officials, and notables and members of the Egyptian consulate.•s 2 . I understand that the two aeroplanes, a De Havilland Dragon (as last year) and a Tigar Moth, made the journey from Egypt in one day, leaving Cairo at 5 a.m., an improvement on last year's performance, when the flight was made in two stages. Short halts were made this year at Tor, Wejh and Yanbu. The pilots are Mr. G. S, Brown (flight-lieutenant R. A. F. Reserve) and Ismail Effendi Sidky. 3. Talaat Pasha, who called on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires the day after his arrival, left with his associates for Mecca by car on the 25th November. He i&amp; expected to leave here on the 28th November by air for Yanbu, whence he will visit Medina by car, and return to Egypt by air on the 1 st December. 4 . I hope to be in a position to report more fully in due course on the objects of this second visit to the Hejaz. Generally, I think, it may be assumed that the mission will interest itself, as last year, in makirg arrangements for the reception of Egyptian pilgrims coming to this country by the Egyptian steamers Zamzam and Nil, and in taking further steps to establish here branches of the Banque Misr. 5 . The mission do not appear to be the guests of the Saudi Government this- year, and whilst in Jedda have been accommodated in the new premises taken by the Banque Misr during the past year, which were originally intended, it is believed, for the Soviet legation. Generally, it may be said that less publicity has been given to this visit than to its counterpart of last year ; I have still to hear of the broadcast distribution of piece-goods, etc., of Egyptian manufacture, whilst this year the aeroplanes have not been activly engaged in treating the Jedda popu lace to joy-rides. 6 . I was informed by my Egyptian colleague, some time before the arrival of the mission, that Talaat Harb Pasha had requested permission of the Saudi authorities to be allowed to fly to Riyadh to meet the King. I understand that the Saudis have been unable to accede to this request. 7 . I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majest ’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt. Enclosure to Serial No. ( 6 ). Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon. (Received December 18.) Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 360, dated the 4th December 1934. With reference to m.y despath No. 349 of the 27th November last [Serial No. (())] relative to the Egyptian commercial and financial mission to this country, I Lave the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, Midhat Yaghen Pasha and party (with the exception of Kem.al Bey Alui, who left the same day for Egypt by Khedivial mail steamer) left for Yanbu by air on the 28th November and after visiting Medina by car resum.ed their return journey to Egypt on the last December. 2. Talaat Pasha’s visit this year is shorter than was expected and only two- whole days were put in at Mecca. By some this is thought to be due to his dis satisfaction at being refused permission to fly to Riyadh to see the King. His donations to schools and hospitals were on a modest scale, according to report, but free distribution as charity of piece-goods and other Egyptian manufactures, which had not taken place when I wrote my despatch under reference, was subsequently undertaken on behalf of the Egyptian mission by the Jedda municipality on the 4th December. 3 . I learn that Talaat Pasha was primarily interested in arranging with the Saudi authorities for further facilities this year for Egyptian pilgrims. The ship- ing agents will continue to be Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., according to their own account, and financial arrangements, which are said to include the perception of Saudi pilgrim dues from the individual pilgrims by Banque Misr and payment to the Saudi Arab Government in a lump sum, will be handled by Banque Misr or separately appointed agents here. Two large motor-launches, to seat 100 passengers each, are to be brought here by Banque Misr in order to facilitate the transport of pilgrims from, the outer anchorage in the heavy seas. The present charges for sambuqs are to remain undisturbed, and the local interests involved9 fire not to suffer. Indeed, it appears that Talaat Pasha has been at pains to assure local merchants and shippers that his objects are not to deprive them of the bene fits they now enjoy from the pilgrimage, but to ensure greater comfort for Egyptian pilgrims, and increase their numbers, which this year he estimates at about 8 , 000 . Pilgrims of the wealthier sort are to be accommodated in the new premises, in both Jedda and Mecca, now partly occupied by the offices of Banque Misr. 4. It is stated with some confidence by Mr. Philby that the Saudi Govern ment have obtained from Talaat Pasha a loan, probably small and probably in the nature of an advance on account of pilgrims’ dues, which will be paid by Egyptian pilgrims coming on Haj. 5. Two small steamers, the Mariut and Manzaleh, flying the Egyptian flag, have called at Jedda during the past few days from Suez and have proceeded to Port Sudan. They have carried small quantities of cargo, and are stated by Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., who have been appointed agents by Talaat Pasha, to be testing the possibilities of a more regular service. 6 . The transport of pilgrims by air was not pursued, in view of the quarantine and other difficulties in the way. The Saudi authorities were not very ready to discuss the question of air development with members of the mission, as I have already reported in my despatch No. 351 of the 30th November. The question of a concession for the construction of a railway between Mecca and Jedda is said to have been touched on, but quite tentatively and without further more serious consideration. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade and to the Acting High Commis sioner at Cairo. (7) (Received on 2nd February 1935 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated the 17th January 1935.) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident, Aden, dated the 9th January 1935.

In this connection I may mention that reports have appeared recently in the Daily News Bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency to the effect that restrictions have been placed on the entry of Jews from the Yemen into Aden. I appreciate that such restrictions may well be necessary in order to prevent an influx of refugees. 1 shall, however, be obliged if you will keep me informed as to the position in this respect. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (7). Letter from the Joint Foreign Committee of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association, dated the 24th Decem ber 1934. 1 have the honour, at the direction of my Committee, to request your assistance in the following mat er. The Committee has received a report that the Imam of Yemen has issued an order imposing severe restrictions on his Jewish subjects who wish to leave for Aden or other places abroad ; and further that the desire of such Jews to emigrate is due to their alleged persecution in the Yemen. MSS9FD * 010 My Committee is desirous of discovering what substance there is in the report and would, therefore, much appreciate the privilege of receiving any information on this question that you may be able to obtain through the Resident in Aden. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (7). Letter to the Joint Foreign Committee of the Board of Deputies of Bri tish Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association, No. 37976/34, dated the 9th January 1935. 1 am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to your letter of the 24th December ^Enclosure 1 ante) (which has been passed to this Department by the India Office) regarding the restrictions alleged to have been imposed by the King of the Yemen on his Jewdsh subjects, and to inform you that the Resident at Aden is being asked whether he can supply any information on the matter. ( 8 ) (Received on 16th February li/35 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 5, dated the 31st Jart nary 1035 .) Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 335, dated the 6th November 1934. 1 have the honour to inform you that on the 23rd October a consignment of six thousand rifles and three cases of machine-guns was landed at Jedda from the Ellerman, Hall boat S. S. “ City of Christiania ”, chartered for the voyage by the Strick Line. These munitions, which were shipped at Antwerp, were imported by Khalid A1 Qarqani (Jedda Personalities No. 57) on behalf of the Saudi Govern ment. The rifles, which are Mausers, are stated to be old and used German war- stock, dated from 1916. 2 . The fact that Khalid A1 Qarqani has imported these articles from an ob viously German source is of some interest as it is stated that he is now associated in business with a certain Machtig (?), or Haji Qasim a he is now better known, formerly a clerk in the service of Herr de Haas, the last German (trading) Consul here before the German Consulate was closed about two years ago. Haji Qasim is a young man of somewhat ambiguous antecedents, is of Balkan origin, is said to have served as an officer in the Great War, subsequently drifting, for unknown reasons, to Jedda where he embraced Islam and exchanged Machtig (?) for Haji Qasim. 3. It seems not improbable, therefore, that this consignment of munitions was ordered by Khalid A1 Qarqani through Haji Qasim, who would place the order through Herr de Haas in Germany. I am at present unaware of the latter’s whereabouts in Germany, but I am making discreet enquiries and, should 1 succeed in obtaining his address, will forward it to you in case further investigations into his business associations should promise information of interest. ^ 4. That the enquiry may be worth pursuing is suggested by reports here that Khalid A1 Qarqani and Haji Qasim are making a strong bid for the Jedda-Mecca Railway Concession, in the market again since Dr. Jeelani failed to follow it up, and it may be surmised that if anything at all is done it may be with the help of German capital and the use of German material. 5.

With reference to my Confidential despatch No. 335 (2941/215/26) of the 6 th November last [Serial No. ( 8 )] relative to the importation into Saudi Arabia of a consignment of rifles and machine-guns, 1 have the honour to inform you that I now learn that the address of Herr de Haas is Rudolfstadterstrasse 89, Wilmersdorf,Berlin. T understand, moreover, that he recently left Germany for India, where he is sa d to be at present. I am unaware whether this is a short visit, or whether he is visiting India for a more prolonged stay. 2 . With regard to the reports current here during the summer that Khalid el Qar qani is interested in the Possibility of obtaining the Jedda-Mecca Railway Concession, to which an allusion is made in the fourth paragraph of my despatch under reference, I gather from Mr. Philby that he is unawa e of this report and regards it as unlikely to be true. 3 .

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 346, dated the 26th November 1934. With reference to your despatch No. 394(E.-6322/2429/25) of the 2nd Novem ber relative to the interest evinced by the Italian Government in the recent visit to London of Fuad Bey Hamza, I have the honour to inform you that m the course of a conversation on the 8 th November my Italian colleague, Signor Persico, made a somewhat vague allusion to our interests on the Arabian shores of the I^ rsi ^ n Gulf and asked me whether it was true that a conference was to be held shortly over there. He continued interrogatively and with an air of ingenuous innocence. “ Those parts are now very important, are they not ? As his reference to the matter was rather casual I was able to reply evasively and he did not pursue the subject. 2 Signor Persico is still fairly new to this post and from the few an unimpor tant conversations I have had with him since his return from Europe gives me the impression of being only superficially acquainted with questions to which he has, always spontaneously, referred. For example, he has twice adverted to the ques tion of meeting between Ibn Saud and Amir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan, professing to have seen passing references to this subject in the press of neighbouring countries. The second occasion he mentioned this matter was during the conversation of the 8 th November, when I felt myself able to reply somewhat more explicitly that there was no immediate prospect of a meeting. 3 When Signor Persico left Jedda on leave of absence on the 8 th July last he travelled to Port Sudan in the same Khedivial Mail steamer as Fuad Bey Hamza and I believe they continued their journey together by an Italian steamer as far as Suez. He has since avowed that he had frequent opportunities for conversation with Fuad Bey, and his present curiosity in regard to Saudi Arab affairs in the Persian Gulf m^iy have its origin in that association during the voyage, or on the other hand, may perhaps have received a stimulus from reports of Signor Fracassi s conversations at the Foreign Office, which could have reached him here by the 8 th November. 4 .

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office No. 370, DATED THE llTH DECEMBER 1934. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 31.) , cm I r i’ ave , tbe honour to refer to my despatch No. 351 of the 5 th December 1A33 [Serial No. (6 m F. No. I7-N./34], in which I ventured to submit a short review of the general financial situation in this country. I again propose to attempt, ith the modest material available in a country where statistics of any value are unknown an appreciation of the general financial and economic condition of Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2 . Since the despatch under reference was written, the intervening months have witnessed little real alleviation of the financial difficulties with which Ibn Saud was then finding himself increasingly confronted. The principal drain on hit resources, due to the lorg^rawn struggle with the Yemen! the necessity of pro- f f h iT ^ army J n j tlle and at tlle same tlme cementing the loyalty , ttV,' Ne]d b J subsidles and supplies in kind, can scarcely have db ishoxl until the operations came to a successful conclusion and the troops intXed tl h „ eir T n ( C ° U f y. durirg dul &gt;' and Au g ust - Even Aen demobilisation involved the grant of gratuities in rials and in kind to each individual soldier, a tiRiv! ? ) blcb bega ' at T aif upon the immediate return of the troop? and continued at Riyadh until mid-November. Mr. Philby estimates the cost to Ibn Saud of these gratuities alone to be in the neighbourhood of £ 100,000 gold. Thus the whole thTwaHnd TT &gt; been ° ne ° f abn ° rmal mi,itar y ex P end *t ur e, in prosecuting the war and, at its conclusion, in paying m hard cash a handsome insurance pre- mmm against tribal discontent at a lootless victory. P 3. It may not unnaturally be asked where are the resources upon which the \mg could draw so liberally. Mr Philby is convinced that the explanation lies in the receipt of a war indemnity from the Imam of the Yemen. I am not alone ll fnT lT 8 th if S VleW ‘Ij ® 011 . 1110 acc ept» and incline to the belief that the King d '', uself compelled, in order to content his returning soldiery, to make serious inroads upon the Royal Treasury, a reservoir of unknown dimension™ 4. That the Saudi Exchequer could have proved of much assistance can hardlv !i?n»l P r te t : eV6n m ‘I 1 ® r f° ur f ful hands of tb e Minister of Finance. Little addi tional taxation, except in the almost negligible form of a stamp duty, was imposed and m spite of certain reports to the contrary, no resort was made, as far as can be ascertained, to the exaction of forced loans.I**. V 13 5. The revenue, which in the despatch under reference was represented as exiguous, has probably shown some improvement, but not of a nature to offset expenditure. The pilgrimage of 1934 exceeded 25,000, in comparison with 20,000 of the year before and pilgrim dues to the Government and activity in the bazaars were stimulated in proportion. The prospects for the forthcoming pilgrimage are % still conjectural, but it may not be excessive optimism to expect a slight increase again in 1935. The remarks in last year's report in regard to the general level of poverty of latter-day pilgrims still apply, although the efforts of Talaat Harb Pasha, upon whose activities T have reported elsewhere, are directed towards in ducing Egyptians of the wealthier sort to perform the Haj. 6 . Customs receipts are still one of the several urkown factors in Saudi Arabia’s economic equation. One might perhaps hazard the opinion that there has this year been a slight improvement. The small increase in the pilgrimage and the partial liquidation of old stocks of goods in the hands of local merchants must have exerted a favourable influence. Receipts, however, are mortgaged as has been now the practice for some years by the system of drafts to which a reference was made in the despatch under reference. 7. The Saudi Government’s revenue has been augmented this year, it is stated, by the receipt during the early summer of £ 20,000 gold from the Standard Oil Company of California, a sum believed to represent the second instalment of the initial loan promised by the company under the terms of their Hasa oil con cession. A further loan, said to be very small, is reported to have been obtained in November from Talaat Harb Pasha, and is thought probably to be secured on Saudi pilgrim dues, which will be paid by Egyptians during the forthcoming Haj. Mr. Philby, at any rate, was made happy by being paid “ £ 2,000 or £3,000,” half in cash and half in a draft on Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha and Co., confidential agents and importers to the Saudi authorities, not in respect, I understand, of out standing debts, but to finance the import of motor vehicles in accordance with his concession. 8 . Indeed, the position of the Saudi Government in regard to both their internal and foreign obligations is as unsatisfactory as ever. Certainly no attempt has been made during the year under review to meet the long outstanding debts due to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and Ibn Sand appears unlikely to manifest any great readiness to do so in the near future. 9. The Minister of Finance has continued to pursue a policy of rigid economy in Government expenditure, although the opinion has been heard that money, for day to day requirements of an essential nature, is not so tight as was the case a year ago. Official salaries are still seriously in arrear and for more than the first six months of the Arabic year 1353 (until the end of October) Government servants had received a bare two months’ salary, and that at the “ par ” rate of 10 rials to 110 piastres miri gold (£l gold), whereas the current rate for rials had fluctuated between 24 and 22 rials to the gold pound. 10 . Saudi currency during the year has remained relatively steady and did not show any marked tendency to depreciate after the last pilgrimage, as I anticipated in my despatch under reference. The rial rate varied with in the limits indicated above, and at the time of writing is 22 , betraying again the customary appreciation which marks the arrival of pilgrims from abroad. 11 . The general tone of trade in theHejaz is stated to be somewhat healthier, the manager of the Dutch banking concern here, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maats- chappij, stating that during the past year there had been slightly more movement and much less reluctance on the part of merchants to take up bills. This applied particularly to the past six months. I am indebted to him for the following figures compiled by himself and, he insists, very tentative, of the imports and exports for the Arabic years 1351 and 1352 :— 1351. £ sterling. . 2,028,000 1352. £ sterling. 1,657,850 150,685 Imports Exports Piece-goods and flour, amongst the more important commodities, showed an in crease in 1352 over 1351, most others falling away in the second year. The number MS89FJD * d14 of different headings of commodities imported was only 108 in 1352 as comparer! with 149 in 1351. These figures, partial and approximate though they may be and although they relate, except for the last part of 1352, to the years prior to the period covered by this survey, are nevertheless of some interest. 12 . The picture drawn in the foregoing paragraphs may indicate a far from satisfactory condition, but it is not one of wholly unrelieved gloom. Whilst « ti t re is still considerable and serious destitution amongst the poorer classes, which the distribution of food and clothing by Ibn Sand and the charity of the well-disposed do little to alleviate, the cost of living is not appreciably higher to the Hejazi. Rents, on the other hand, have fallen considerably in Mecca and Jedda, and, in the latter town, building of new houses, in itself not a symptom of economic depression, is going on on all hands. Rains in the Hejaz have been plentiful everywhere duiing the autumn, and reports are satisfactory from many parts of Nejd. I bn Sand therefore is issuing, it is announced, seed to cultivators and a good harvest in due course will do much to repair the ravages of past privations. 13.

Demi-official letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the India Office, No. 163-S., dated the 31st January 1935. I was interested to see that in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 1 of 1935, paragraph 6 (d) confirmed Philby’s opinion given in paragraph 300 of Jedda Report for December 1934 that Ibn Saud was incurring some unpopularity by wasting his time hunting instead of attending to business. 2 . Paragraph 6 (g) also confirmed the statement in the same paragraph of the Report that the rumours of jealousy between Faisal and Saud were at least ex aggerated. 3. Paragraph 6 (A), however, if correct, indicates that there is a serious rift in the Saudian lute between Ibn Saud and his brother, Mohammad, and this is possible as being more or less in the nature of things amongst Arabs. On the Arab coast of the Gulf, for instance, where enmity exists in a Shaikhly family, more often than not it is at its acutest betwen the Ruler and one of his brothers.

Arrived at 16-00 on 6 th November and saluted the Country with 21 guns ; the shore battery replied with 23. Mr. Saleh JafTer (British Political Clerk) and the new Port Otncer (ex-royal barber) called to welcome the ship. 7. The weather being unsuitable for the use of ship’s boats, I landed on the morning of the 7th in the harbour launch at the celebrated Iron Ladder, now tempo rarily rejuvenated by the addition of another ladder of slightly stouter build, and was received at the shore end of the pier by a Guard of Honour and a large crowd. Driving to the Palace in the courtyard of which another Guard was parad ed, I was shown into the presence of the Amir, Seyyid Abdullah al Wazir, who received me with much friendliness and every appearance of genuine pleasure. This was the first occasion on which I had met His Excellency, as Penzance had sailed for Malta before he assumed command of the town in early July. His Excellency begged to be excused from returning my call in person, as he was carry ing out a preliminary fast in preparation for the more serious business of Ramadan, and feared the effects of the prolonged boat passage to and from the ship under the prevailing weather conditions. These were, indeed such that I readily agreed and suggested that, in the interests of his deputies, the return ceremony should in any case be deferred until the weather moderated. 8 . A gift to the ship of 2 sheep, beef, 30 dozen bananas, 30 dozen eggs, 10 bags of coffee, vegetables and fruit was received from the Amir during the'after noon, to whom a return present of tinned fruit was sent, accompanied by a suitable letter of thanks. 9. Officers landed in the afternoon for tennis. The improved standard of play among the habitues, a new box of balls and a locally constructed net of striking colour bore witness to the continued popularity of the game, which is suck that even the re-surfacing of the court itself is seriously mooted. *********** 13. The Amir appears to be taking at least some steps to develop the town ; the seav'all has been built up and the foreshore cleared of much accumulated rubbish, while a small icemaking plant, purchased second hand at Port Sudan, has been installed but is not yet in working order. The bann on the importa tion of gramophones and alcoholic drinks has, however, been re-imposed with renewed severity. The foreign community has changed but little. The Italian Doctor Tazzi maintains a clinic in the erstwhile Government store near the seafront, at which free medical attention is dispensed The Italian Agent Jamecili is still in the town, but the French Vice Consul, in a state of extreme decrepitude, has retired to his home at Beirut. 14. With regards to the Petroleum dispute with the Sa’uid Government in ,lune last (Penzance’s No. 0/59 of 25th June 1934) (F. 311-N./34) it wtis ascertained from the representative of Messrs. Liveratos that after the assumption of Yemeni control the firm presented their account, which was settled without demur. The SaTidi receipt for Customs dues was also adm'ttad without question. It is understood that the same treatment was accorded to Messrs. Besse, but it is not known what attitude was adopted with regards to the Italian “ S. A. N.

This evidence of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s determination to strengthen and improve the present standing army of Saudi Arabia is of considerable interest. The development may be the fruit of experience gained during the war with the \ emen, though I am unable to believe that the Saudi regular forces are to be largely increased.

Relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, since the recent dispute, have to all appearances pursued an uneventful course and have ceased to occupy the forefront of public attention locally. Nevertheless reports, vague but persistent, have not been wanting that all is still not well in the Yemen. Frontier difficulties are hinted at, and perhaps somewhat exaggerated stories are current of the restiveness of the Seif-ulTslam Ahmad, said to be under arms still at Sada and chafing under the restrictions imposed by his father the Imam. 2 . I have been disposed to attach little importance to these rumours, and it is perhaps unnecessary to treat them seriously. My French colleague, M Maigret, spoke to me yesterday, however, on this subject, and whilst admitting that his own information was indefinite, expressed the opinion that there undoubtedly did exist trouble it was, at present, difficult to diagnose. He hoped to leave Jedda shortly on a three weeks’ visit to Sana, and expected to be able to arrive at a more accurate appreciation of the situation in the \ emen during that time. 3 The unrest may be of purely internal significance, and may be a natural reaction after the Imam’s ill-success in the late war with Saudi Arabia. The press of both countries have, however, not entirely allayed misgivings recently by protesting with vigour that the two countries are now on the most friendly terms and denying with emphasis the ‘'false reports ’ put about by interested persons to the contrary. The Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd November quoted an article from the Sana newspaper the Iman in which reports of the concentration of troops on the Saudi-Yemen frontier were categorically denied. Peace and tranquility prevailed ; conditions had returned to normal; and concord reigned between the “ two Moslem sects ” (presumably the Zeidi and Shaft sects of the Yemen). From the Hejazi press, the Iman continued, it was understood that a similarly fortunate situation existed in this country. The Umm-al-Qura delightedI v welcomed the article with lengthy variations on the themes of Arab brotherhood, the Treaty of Taif and the wiles of unscrupulous mischief-makers inspired by hatred and jealousy of the Arabs and of Islam. I do not propose to transmit to you a translation of this article. 4 . It may not be out of place here to inform you, in regard to the Saudi-Yemen treaty settlement, of the insistence with which Mr. Philby continues to express his conviction that Ibn Saud did in fact receive a war indemnity from the Imam He has more than once reverted to the subject. Ibn Saud, Mr. Phil stated quite recently, has for some two or three months been paying daily to his tribal visitors at Riyadh (as I have recorded in Jedda reports for October and November last) large sums in cash and kind, which my informant estimated at MS89FD K19 to him by Ibn Saud as alleged in theTrkc^s leS SUbS1&lt;ly haVing be6n Pr0miS6d Wales' mightassfsT the'sWf the P ™ cess suggests that the Prince of ^.u^l^ , Sl^Sr Ih,,8 * wi Weareia “ r= «^ (Received on the 9th March 1935, with Political Secretary's letter No. 8, dated the21st February 1935.)

Fetter from the Foreign Office, to the Secretary to His Royal Highness 1935 PRINCE ° F WALES ’ ^°' E ' 498 / 498 / 35 ’ dated the 12th February 1 am sorr\ that there has been some delay in replying to your letter of tho 22 nd January enclosing a letter from the Princess Fatma Haider to the Prince of Wales, but it has been necessary to consult our own archives on certain noints connected with the Sherif Ali Haider and also to ask the India Office whether they had any observations to offer on the Princess’s letter from the Moslem point of view. It may be useful for you in the first place to have a brief account of the Sherif He belongs to an aneuent family of the Hejaz, which claims descent from Mahmot and members of which have frequently in the past held the office of Grand Sherif of Mecca, a position of varying political power but of great religious prestige through out the Mohammedan world. Shenf Ah Haider, used formerly to live at Con- stantmople, where he worked in with the ‘ Young Turks ’ and was at one time a Turkish Cabinet Mimster. In or about 1917 he was appointed Grand Sheriff of Mecca by the Ottoman Government, to supersede King Hussein, who had 'one over to the Allies. He was, however, naturally unable to take up his post in the Hejaz which was m revolt against the Turks. Early in 1920 he tried to obtain British support m obtaining the post of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under King I bti Saud, who had by that tmie driven King Hussein’sfamily out of Arabia but His ^lajesty s Government were unwilhrg to intervene in a politico-religious question of. this kind : he appears to have been, and certainly claimed to be, on fairly friendly terms with Ibn Saud, although, when he attempted in 1926 to pay a visit to the Jejaz, bn Saud politely requested him not to do so. We have no knowledge of any subsidy or promise of a subsidy to him from Ibn Saud, apart from the complaint contained in Princess Fatma s letter. We have referred this point to Sir Andrew Ryan at Jedda, who has some personal knowledge of the familv : it need not how- ever, affect the question of the reply to be returned to the Princess. Since 1926 the Sherif has lived at Beirut with his English (or Irish) wife (n£e Dunn) whom he married at Constantinople He has several sons, the eldest of whom is married to a dang iter of the ex-Sultan of Turkey, while another studied at St Andrew's University. We have nothing against the Sherif, who, so far as we know, is a respectable person and is genuinely in reduced circumstances. On the other hand, we have no political reason for wishing to assist him, and in fact any assistance which could be construed as m any way coming from a British official source might prove embarras- sing. I he India Office have no comments to offer from their point of view Unless therefore, His Royal Highness is personally disposed to assist the Sherif indirectlv we cm only suggest that a regretful reply in the negative should be returned to Pnn ^ess Fatma s request.(19) (Received on 16th March 1935, with Political Secretauty's Utter No. 9, dated 2Sth February 1935.)

I have been instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain the certificate of the Stipendiary Magistrate under the Aliens Order, 1920, with respect to certain Arab seamen who have been in receipt of relief, with a view to the men being deported. Some of the Arabs claim that they were born in Aden, and, hence, although they are registered as Aliens, some question may arise in the course of the proceed ings as to whether they are not British Subjects. I am aware, of course, that the onus is entirely upon the alleged Aliens to show that they are British Subjects, but for the purpose of the proceedings I am desirous of having an authoritative statement as to the status of the various parts of the Aden territory. The position, so far as I can gather, would seem to be that the town of Aden itself, together with Perim, form for legal purposes part of British India and are part of the British Dominions, while there is a considerable territory in addition which is merely a British Protectorate. If this is correct a person born either in the town of Aden or Perim is a British Subject, while one born in the Protectorate is an Alien. I shall be glad to be furnished with a statement from the Colonial Office as to the status of the various parts of the territory, and also as to the dates on which the present status became operative as, of course, the aliens with whom I am con cerned will have been born some considerable time ago.

The peninsula of Aden proper, extendirg to Khormaksar, was vested in the Crown, as part of India, by the Government of India Act of 1858. In 18(i8 the island of Sira and the peninsula of Jabal Ihsan, or Little Aden, were acquired by purchase and in 1882 the flat strip of coast was also purchased. Ali the above territory forms the Aden Settlement and is part of British India. 3. Perim was occupied in 1799, was subsequently abandoned, but was reoccupied in 1857. It is attached to the Aden Settlement for administrative pur poses. The remainder of the territory is a British Protectorate.

Jedda, to the Foreign Office. No. 4-Conf., dated the 7th January 1935. I have the honour to refer to my confidential despatch No. 204, of the 2 nd July last [Serial No. (78) in File No. 17-N/34] relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitchell, icpresentative of the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate (Limited), and to Jedda report for December 1934 (on Fde No. 72-N/34), para graph 304 and preceding reports, where the varying fortunes of Mr. Twitchell, engaged over a period of some six months in negotiating with the Saudi Arab Government a concession to exploit minerals in this country, have been periodi- eally recorded. The successful conclusion of these negotiations was noticed in the report under reference and was announced in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 28th December in a short article which described the concession, signed on the 23rd December 1934, as one for the exploitation of the gold and other mineral resources of the countiy, with the exception of oil and other liquids, over a res tricted area. The agreement, the article stated, would shortly be ratified, and thereafter the text would be published. 2. Pending the publication of the text of the concession, the following parti culars, partly disclosed in conversation by Mr. Twitchell himself, and partly receiv ed from other sources, are of interest : (a) The Government are to be assigned 15 per cent, of the shares in any companies to be formed to work particular concessions, a provision which it is gathered, proved unplatable to Mr. Twitchell, who favoured the assignment of 15 per cent, of the initial nominal capital rather than 15 per cent, of shares actually issued, as and when issued, a point on which he found him self obliged to yield. Mr. Twitchell stated that he successfully resisted the desire of the Saudi Government to participate, to the extent of 15 per cent, of the shares,ItfSV.’tD—'7-6-35—£5—GI I'B In tlie existing syndicate, a holding for which the Government were even prepared to pay. (b) Tlie Government is to receive 5 per cent, of any gold eventually extrac ted. (c) Customs duty is to be paid at a flat rate of 10 per cent, on all material, etc., imported, (d) The area finally agreed on under the concession is, roughly, the whole of the Hejaz and Asir as far south as Birk, with the exception of certain re served areas, notably about the Holy Cities. This general description was given by Mr. Philby, who said that the area first approved by the King extended as far as meridian 44 degrees, thus including a considerable slice of Nejd, but that it was later decided to set the eastern limits much more to the west. Mr. Twitched, who did not allude in any detail to this point, expressed himself generally as quite satis fied with the area actually allotted, (e) The agreement, according to Mr. Twitched, must be ratified by the syndicate, after which it will be published. 3. It is gathered that Mr. Twitched is to be joined by M. Van de Pod, the D itch Moslem who has for some years resided in this country, where formerly he had commercial interests in work connected with the concession, although presum ably in some non-technical capacity. Mr. Twitched left Jedda for Egypt and Syria on the 26th December and is understood to be actively engaged in making arrangements for prospecting, and, if a report from Messrs. Gedatly, Hankey &amp; Co. that a large consignment of pit-props has been ordered tnrough them by Mr. Twitched is tfo be believed, for early mining operations as wed. 4.

As you are aware Tbn Sand makes it his annual practice to give a great banquet in Mecca for notable pilgrims of all nations just before the Pilgrimage. I find that I sent no separate report on this event last year but I included some account of it in my despatch No. 88 of March 31st, 1934, on the Saudi Yemen situation. This year the occasion merits separate treatment. 2. This year’s pilgrimage has brought to the Hejaz an unusually large number of Moslems of high standing and a good many politicians of less note but of some importance in their own countries. The former have included ca^-King Amanullah of Afghanistan ; His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur ; the chief Begum of His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, with Sir Nizamat Jung in attendance ; another Begum of the Hyderabad family ; the (Jlawi from Morocco ; Abdullah Tbn Wazir, the Governor of Hudayda, who was here last year as Yemeni delegate at the peace negotiations ; Nawa'b Sir Umar Hayat Khan, honorary A.-D.-C. to His Majesty the King : and a brother of the Sheykh of Dibai. 3. Most of the male personages just mentioned were among the five hundred guests or so, whom the King entertained on the evening of March 12 th. As the King had arrived only on March 10 th, the arrangements were made hurriedly. Among the absentees were the Nawab of Bahawalpur, who pleaded illness, and Sir Umar Hayat Khan, the reasons! for whose non-appearance I do not know. The Nawab may have been worried about questions of precedence but members of his suite attended the dinner. The King had e^r-King Amanullah on his right, with Sayyid Hasan A 1 Idrisi and, I believe, the Glawi beyond. The second place of honour on his left was given very significantly to Abdullah A 1 Wazir. 4. The King’s principal speech was reproduced, as usual, in the Umm-al* Qura, probably in an edited version. The published version is not worth sub mitting to you in full but a few points may be noted. He began with his customary exhortations and insistence on the importance of close adherence to Moslem tenets, especially the doctrine of the Unity. He and his w^ere Beduins, possessing nought except the blessing of God and desiring the co-operation of Arabs and Moslems. The King then spoke of the events of last vear and refer red specially to the past enmity between himself and the Idrisi’and A 1 Wazir, who were now sitting at his table. The war had shown, he said, the dis advantages of discord to both sides. Moslems generally had welcomed the peaceful ending and he invited them all to work together/ The most interesting passage in his speech was that in which he scouted the idea that foreign influences had caused the quarrel. Moslems and Arabs were themselves responsible for their differences. In their press utterances they raged rudely against each LS156FX)K .25 other but were polite to occidentals. If,they respected themselves, co-operated and followed the right path they would succeed. , . . 5. Ex-King Amanullah delivered a speech which was also reported in the Umm-al-Qufa but in a very anodyne form. The published version contains no mention of his two principal points in trying to make which he dropped two bricks. He urged the desirability of general Moslem conferences at pilgrimage time and boggled when his remarks were coldly received. You will remember that Ibn Saud convened such a conference in 1926 and has never repeated the embarrassing experiment. Amanullah Khan’s other point was that traffic in slaves was all wrong and should be abolished in Saudi Ajrabia. The moment was clearly ill-chosen for the expression of this sentiment, so admirable in itself, and means were found to silence the orator. ' , ' 6. There were I understand numerous other speeches including one by a speaker whom 1 have not identified, who applauded the present regime in Afghanistan. The only orators named in the official report, besides the King and Amanullah Khan were Muhammad A1 Ghuneymi A1 Taftazani and a certain Muhammad Sadiq al Mujaldd. The latter I take to be the adversary of Ibn Saud on whom His Majesty’s Government have long had their eye but who recently returned to this countrv under the terms of the recent so-called amnesty. Al Taftazani belongs to a family of some religious consequence in Egypt, who claim descent from the Prophet. His importance lies in the fact that in the past he has been a violent critic of Ibn Saud, especially, if I remember rightly, but I have not verified this, at the time of the Idrisi revolt in Asir in 1932. He is understood to have praised the King highly in his speech at the dinner. The sincerity of these conversions may be doubted, but the lip-service of such former enemies shows how greatly the events of last year have enhanced Ibn Sand’s credit in outer Moslem and Arab circles. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Aden and Cairo. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. (28) MEMORANDUM.

' (31) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 8th April 1935. {Received on 23rd April 1335, icith Political'Secretary’s letter No. 15, dated 11th April 1035.) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 56, Dated the 24th February 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 4 of the 7th January [Serial No. (24)], 1 have the honour to state that the text of the agreement between the Saudi Gov ernment and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) was published in the Umni-al-Qura of the loth, February, together with a Royal decree dated the 12th February sanctioning the agreement. It may 1 be assumed that' the syndicate had already ratified it. 2. The agreement is a fairly lengthy document, and T consider it unnecessary to trouble you with all the details. I enclose a Synopsis showing the principal conditions. In the absence of the annexed map it is difficult to trace the exact boundaries of the assigned area on the south and east, but a very fair idea of them can be formed with the aid of the ordinary maps and the Handbook for Arabia. You will observe that the northern boundary is the de facto frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan, starling from “ Point E ”, the position of which is defined as in the Hadda Agreement. 3. Mr. Twitched duly visited Egypt and Syria as foreshadowed in my despatch under reference and travelled as far east as Rutba, whence he went to see the alleged gold mine at'Gaara. He then proceeded for a short time to England. He returned to Jedda on the 17th February and is now making active preparations to start Ins prospecting campaign at four places, all of which are in the northern part of the assigned area and the most important of which is the “ Cot of Gold ”, where he has previously done some preliminary work. He has collected two mining engineers, a British subject named George, who has had much experience in India, and a United States citizen named Ballard, besides a clerical assistant named Bisshopp. He expects a third mining engineer from Australia. M. van de Poll, who was mentioned in my despatch under reference, has already been busy up Medina way and Mr. Twitched describes him as having done magnificent Work. I gather that the genefal headquarters of the prospectors will be in the first instance at Yanbu’, where a house has already been rented. Mr. Twitched is certainly tackling his enterprise with great energy. 4. T am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade and His Excellency the High' Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem. Enclosure in No. 1. Synopsis of the Principal Clauses in the Agreement of December 23, 1934, between the Saudi Government and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate {Limited).

Payments to be made in any currency at current rate of exchange into a bank designated by the Government. The Syndicate to notify the Government of any transfer of rights to any other company, but the Government shall not refuse sanction unreason ably. 5.

Engage ment of foreigners for work which cannot be done by Saudi subjects to be subject to the sanction of the Government, which may be assumed if no answer is returned within a month of notification.

This article also provides for ratification of the agreement. *28 (32) Memorandum from II. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 54 (904J226]36), dated the 7th April 1935.

I have the honour to icfer to your confidential despatch of the 9th January 1935 LSerial No. (7)], regarding certain restrictions alleged to have been imposed by the King of the Yemen on his Jewish subjects, who wish to. leave for Aden or elsewhere. 1 am making enquiries on this subject, and shall communicate the result to you in due course. 2. As regards paragraph 2 of the despatch under reference, I enclose, for your information, a copy of this office despatch No. C.-641 of the 18th July 1934 to the Director, Department of Immigration, Palestine. Tf will be seen that the restriction imposed is aimed at preventing an influx of indigent Yemeni Jews into the Adjen Settlement as they constitute a possible menace to public health owing to overcrowding. 3. BeforeShe restriction was imposed I consulted Mr. Selim Menahem Messa, Head of the Jewish Community in Aden, who was in favour of restriction. 4. No restrictions have been imposed on the entry into Aden of Jews' of sufficient means, and careful arrangements have been made to ensure that no legitimate traders are hindered in any way. The system whereby the Yemeni Jewish population in Aden is kept in the neighbourhood of 500 is, at present, worldi ig satisfactoriiy. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (33). Letter from the Chief Commissioner, Aden, to the Director, Department of Immigration, Palestine, No. C.-fi41, dated the 18th July 1934. 1 have the honour to State that Yemeni Jews numbering about 890 have arrived in Aden, and 640 during the past few months still awaiting emigra tion to Palestine. Most of these families are indigent. As the limited accom modation at our disposal has been overcrowded to the danger of the general health of the public, I am unable to permit further immigration into the Aden LS 156 FD ‘ n29 Settlement. Therefore from 15th August 1934 until such time as the present number of Yemeni Jews has been reduced to 300 at Sheikh Othman and Crater all indigent Yemeni Jews will be prevented from entering the settlement. 2. I shall therefore be glad if you will kindly inform the leading Yemen Jews and the Zionist Executive Agency in Palestine of the restriction to be imposed by this Administration so that they may be enabled to use their influence to restrict further immigration until the present numbers are absorbed by the Immigration Certificates and embarked for Palestine. Due notice of the cancel lation of this order will be given to you. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (33). Letter from the Coloxiah Office, to the Foreign Office, No. 78076135 dated the 13th March 1935.

(33). Demi-official letter from Mr. R. S. Champion, Poliitcal Secretary, Aden, to Mr. Max Xurock, Chief Secretary’s Office, Palestine, No. C.jl89, dated the 23rd of March 1932. With reference to your demi-official letter No. I.A52|31 of the 31st January 1932 regarding the national status of Jews in the Yemen, I have made a number of independent enquiries from my Agents in that country, and from Jews of Yemeni stock in Aden, one of whom is a well-known and prosperous merchant of San’a. The following information will serve, not only to answer your specific ques tion, but to give you an impression of the social position of the Imam’s Jewish subjects :— (a) There is no formal Nationality Law in the Yemen, the national status of the inhabitants of which is regulated by custom or by the Imam’s decree. (b) Jews born or having their permanent resident in the Imam’s terri tories, and not having other nationality, are considered to be his subjects. I presume that foreign nationals residing in the Yemen and their children born in the Yemen do not lose their foreign nationality save by their own act, in the absence of specific Yemeni law in that respect. This question has, as far as I know, never been tested. (c) The Imam appears to be reluctant to allow his Jewish subjects to emigrate. If the prospective emigrant is poor and owns no pro perty he is obliged to provide a surety against his return ; if he owns property he must transfer it to administration by the Imam and can recover it on his return to the country. There is a special department in San’a for the administration of such trust estates. (d) The Jewish subjects of the Imam between the ages of 13 and GO, and male, pay a poll tax annually. The tax is assessed in three grades, of M. T. dollars 4, 2 or 1, in accordance with the financial status of the tax-payer. No other direct tax is levied on Jews. Customs duties are levied irrespective of race or creed. (e) There is a Rabbinical Court in San’a with jurisdiction in disputes between Jews, but such cases may also be heard by a Moslem Qadhi specially appointed for the purpose. “ Mixed ” cases go to the Shar’ia Court, where however (I am informed) Jewish evidence against a Moslem is not accepted. (f) Jews in the Yemen are permitted to manufacture and consume “ arak ” and wine in Jewish quarters, but are prohibited from selling or distributing such liquor to Moslems. (In this connection &lt;/. Aden Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 1858.) (/?) Jewish children, having no parents or other relations and no means of support, are collected and absorbed into the Moslem Orphanage in San’a where they grow up as Moslems without distinction from their fellow orphans. I do not know the method of their conversion nor at what stage it is effected. And although there was at one time a good deal of talk about it in Jewish circles here, I do not think that the system, objectionable as it must be to Jewish susceptibilities, has been accompanied by undue compulsion or deliberate disregard of evidence. {h) Jews in the Yemen are subject to certain traditional disabilities relat ing to the wearing of silken garments (except on holidays in their own quarters) ; the riding of horses, or of mules and asses except on journeys, and then only sideways ; and to behaviour when pass ing or accompanying Moslems. I am under the general impression that the life of Jews in the Yemen, while it is subject to many disabilities and prohibitions, which, however repugnant to the more enlightened of them and to western ideas, have long been established by tradition and custom, is not unhappy and need not be unprosperous. The present Imam is tolerant to them and lends a ready ear to their complaints. The Crown Prince ” Seif A1 Islam Ahmed, may be less so when he succeeds, but they have friends among the other Princes. Most of the foregoing is irrelevant to your question, and much of it may be old news, but I send it to you for what it is worth./ 31 Enclosure 5 to Serial No. (33). Letter from the. Colonial.

These concessions, which have been the subject of official correspondence between the Saudi-Arab Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explain the article in the “ Saut-al-Hejaz ” news paper quoted by Sir A. Ryan, but they do not, of course, connote the full recogni tion suggested by the Egyptian journalist. 2. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah.

M.’s MINISTER, JEDDA, TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE, No. 80, DATED THE 18th March 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 24th Febrnary [Serial No. (31) ], relative to the concession recently granted by the Saudi Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to state that the Royal decree sanctioning the concession referred to an agreement and contract as having been signed by the Minister of Finance and the representative of the syndicate. It now appears that these were two separate instruments as, after the agreement summarised in the enclosure to my despatch under reference had been published, the Umm-al-Qura proceeded to publish, in instalments, an even lengthier document described as a contract concluded on the same date as the main agreement. \ 2. Although the further document is described as above, it is clear from internal evidence that if is a form of mining lease for fifty-eight years, in respect of areas to be finally selected for definite mining operations m accordance with article 3 of the main agreement. The procedure contemplated would appear to be that the Government will lease these areas to the syndicate on the conditions laid down in (he “ contract ”, and that the syndicate will form subsidiary com panies to work the individual properties. As the general conditions are stated m the main agreement, I do not think it necessary to report at length on the “contract ”, the detailed stipulations of which appear to follow normal lines. The following points, however, may he noted (a) The Government are to receive during the period of the lease a rent of £1 per feddan of the leased area plus the excess, if anv, of 5 per cent, of the product of the mine over the rental so fixed. (b) The special arrangement for payment of customs duty on imported supplies, etc., at a flat rate of 10 per cent, will operate throughout the period of the lease.o 32 (c) The Government are not only to receive gratis 15 per cent, of the share capital of the eventual subsidiary companies, fully paid up, but they are to have the right to nominate a director to serve on the board of each company, the total membership of which shall not exceed six persons. 3.

Letter from H.'M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 128 (1096: 282119), dated the 30th April 1935. Since writing my despatch No. 861|282|9 of April 4th, to the High Commis sioner for Palestine, a copy of which was enclosed in my printed despatch No. 106 of the same date to the Foreign Office, I have received from the Deputy Inspector General of the C. I. D., Jerusalem, an English version of a long memo randum in Arabic regarding the alleged machinations of the Jews in Palestine, with a request for-information as to its circulation here and its probable effee f s in Moslem circles. In my reply to the Deputy Inspector General, sent under flying seal via the High Commissioner, I drew his attention to the despatch referred to above and said that the Arabic pamphlet circulated in Mecca appeared to be a shorter version of that which had come to his notice in Palestine. 2. After I had written to the Deputy Inspector General I had brought to my notice a large collection of other pamphlets in Arabic, which would appear to have been circulated in Alecca this year. I am unable to forward the texts of these but the following list of titles may be of interest :— (1) The Statutes, etc., of the Moslem Congress, published in Jerusalem, 19 pages, no date. (2) The decisions of the Congress held in 1931, published in Jerusalem, 27 pages, no date. (3) Proclamation to all our Moslem brethren, published in Jerusalem. 1347 (1928), 11 pages. (4) Account by the Association for the protection of “ Al-Masjed Al- ^ Aqsa ” and the Moslem holy places in Jerusalem, published in Jerusalem, 10 pages and 6 illustrations, no date. (5) Regulation of the Arab Exhibition Company, Limited, established in 1934, published in Jerusalem, 18 pages, no date. (6) Principal instructions for the second Arab Exhibition of Jerusalem, published in Jerusalem, 10 pages and a specimen form, dated 4th March 1934. (7) “ Warning and advice to repent ”, An account by Muhammad Rashid Rida, editor of ” Al-Mahar ” newspaper of Egypt, 16 pages. (8) Proclamation to the Moslem World by the Committee for the defence of the Hejaz Railway Line, published in' Damascus in 1931 21 pages. (9) The Black-Red Atrocities 6r Civilization by fire and sword, published in Damascus in 1931, 115 pages. 3. Although several of these publications are not new, it is significant that all or most of theih appear to have been brought to the Hejaz this year for distWbutiOji to pilgrims. In this connexion I would refer to the account given in my despatch No. 114 of ( April 13th, of my conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the exploitation of the pilgrimage for purposes of political propaganda and of Fuad Bey’s reaction to my remarks. 4. Further efforts have been made to obtain a copy of the alleged Urdu version of the anti-Jewish pamphlet, which I mentioned in my conversation withFuad Bey. They have been unsuccessful and I am inclined to accept Fuad Bey’s statement that, if anything was produced in Urdu, it was not printed. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department and to His Excellency the High Com missioner for Palestine at Jerusalem.

The Resident has ascertained that the King of the Yemen has im posed restrictions on the emigration of Jews from the Yemen to Palestine through Aden and by any other route. 3. The Resident states that the Yemeni Government had previously discouraged emigration to Palestine by the confiscation of property in the Yemen belonging to the emigrants, but no penalties were inflicted on their relatives who remained in the Yemen. When it was realised that the majority of the Yemeni Jews who left for Aden were bound for Palestine the Yemeni authorities decided to prevent the emigration of Jews to any foreign place, and new restrictions were made some months ago to efiect this purpose. 4. If a Jew now wishes to leave the Yemen to do business in Aden or elsewhere he is required to produce a surety for his return witout which he is not allowed to proceed. Certain restrictions have also been imposed on the movements of Jews from place to place in the interior of the Yemen.

(Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated $th August 1935.) Minute,\ Lord Castlestewart called this morning. Mr. Ward was also present at the interview. ^ After giving me the necessary particulars regarding his Syndicate’s concession, Lord Castlestewart began by explaining that the Saudi Govern- ^ ment had asked the Syndicate for a loan of one million silver rivals to be N minted by the Syndicate. His views on this point and the enquiries he made in connexion with it are recorded in the attached draft telegram, which I agreed to send, at the Syndicate’s expense. Lord Castlestewart then discussed the general position. The gist of his enquiries was very much as we had expected, his main point being an enquiry whether His Majesty’s Government might not think it worth their while to give some kind of financial assistance to Saudi Arabia, with a view to maintaining the present regime in power, since, if they did not do so, other countries such as Italy might well take the opportunity of getting a finger in the pie and might then, if Ibn Sand’s regime should eventually collapse, find an excuse for political intervention in Arabia, more parti cularly as the mining concessions which his Syndicate had obtained were certainly of very considerable value. Lord Castlestewart also wished to know whether there might not be some possibility of securing the appoint- ^ ment of a British Financial Adviser, or of getting some arrangement with ^ Saudi Arabia by which the Saudi customs receipts should be assigned as security for a loan. He asked for any general information we could give him. I told Lord Castlestewart that we were on excellent terms with Saudi Arabia and had, generally speaking, a high opinion of King Ibn Sand, who had dime a great deal for his country and was much more direct in his methods and satisfactory to dead with than the great majority of rulers in the East. At the same time, the country was organised on an extremely primitive basis and was exceedingly poor. It had no real budget and lived ^ verv much from hand to mouth, chiefly on the pilgrimage and on grazing taxes the collection of which was farmed out to local governors. I would not hazard any prophecy as to what might happen on the death of King „ Ibn Saud particularly as he had comparatively few reliable officials. But Saudi Arabia was in definite treaty relations with a large number of coun tries and with all her neighbours, and I doubted whether there was any real danger of any European Power attempting adventures there m the circum stances Like other countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was intensely nationalist and jealous of her independence, and it was most im- nrobable that Ibn Saud would consent in any circumstances whatever to assik anv revenues as security for a foreign loan. The assignment ofk K ’~- r ■ 39 revenues for foreign loans was generally regarded in the Middle East as a prelude to foreign intervention and a derogation from national independ ence. This applied also to some extent to the suggestion for a Financial Adviser. It was most unlikely that Ibn Saud would accept a foreign Financial Adviser with any real powers. As to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, it was their policy to keep on good terms with Saudi Arabia and to do what they could to help Ibn Saud when occasion arose. But I could say quite definitely that the Treasury would never look at any thing like financial assistance. If there was to be any question of financial assistance, it must therefore, be on a purely commercial basis and it was for the private interests concerned to decide whether it was worth their while to run the obviously serious financial risks involved. Nor would it help Ibn Saud to maintain his position if he had to rely on our, or on any other foreign assistance. We had some further conversation on the above lines, and I think Lord Castlestewart realised that we could not commit ourselves in any way or give him any kind of lead. Indeed, I doubt whether he really expected us to do so. Meanwhile. I promised to send off the attached telegram and told Lord Castelstewart that the department would let him hear further (as I hoped myself to be away on leave), as soon as we received Mr. Calvert’s reply.

Syndicate have no intention of complying with this request, but are c0 !?tem- plating possibility of minting £2,000 worth of silver rivals a month, to be used m paying their employees and meeting their other expenses Arabia 2 They have been informed by Mr. Twitchell that, owing to shortage of silver rival exchange has recently risen from 12 to 10 nyals to the pound and mav rise further. 8 This presumably refers to pounds sterling and not to oouncls 'old (c/., Eastern Department’s letter of Apnl 4th to Chancery nhnnt currency of Saudi claim for assistance in searching for lost aircraft)., They are anxious to obtain confirmation of Twitchell s statement. 3. Please telegraph any information regarding riyal exchange, and any observations on above proposals. Enclosure 3 to S. No. (52). ^(Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 8th August 1935.) Telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the 1 Foreign Office, No. 136, dated the 9th August, 1935. That thereTa^tortage of Silver Coinage would appear likely to sug gest lasL for importation mentioned in Jedda report for May, paragraph 271(C) F&amp;PD145 F. No. (92-N/34). There are believed to have been further importa tions of Silver rupees since. Twitchell’s associate of Van Der Poll also recently mentioned he had experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient silver rivals here for Company’s purposes. I had a conversation with Twitched the night before he left, reported by despatch No. 227, August 6-th, which left by bag yesterday, but he made no reference to the proposal of Saudi Government. He saw Minister of Finance on July 22nd. 2. Rates show keen appreciation of the riyal; vide Jedda report for June (F. No. 92-N./35), paragraph 192. In terms of Egyptian pounds rate rose after the pilgrimage (when normally it should fall, below the usual figure of 14 to 15) to 11 riyals, then for one day, July 30th(?) to 8J riyals falling to 10 riyals and 8 piastres, subsequently steadied to 10 riyals one piastre at the end of July where it still remains. 3. Reasons for shortage are obscure. No reports have been received of export of silver coinage and stories of hoarding (by Banque of Misr inter alia) for sale at a profit during next pilgrimage are difficult to accept. Rates are likely to rise as usual when pilgrimage season commences in Jedda and do not for other reasons before then.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to His Excel lency the High Commissioner for Palestine, No. 861/282/9, dated the 4th April 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 819/282/5 of March 29th last, re garding the remarks about Palestine, which Ibn Saud made during an interview granted to journalists after the recent attempt on his life, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has been drawn to the fact that a pamphlet, produced by the Association for the protection of “A1 Masjid-ul-Aqsa” and the Holy Places in Jerusalem and dated the 15th Dhu’l Qa’da, 1353 (February 19th), has been distributed in Mecca during the pilgrimage. I presume that this pamphlet has already been brought to Your Excellency’s notice but it may be useful to indicate the general nature of its contents, if only for purposes of identification. 2. The pamphlet begins, after the usual invocation, with a glorifica tion of the Mosque of Omar and declares that the Arabs of Palestine, who have been appointed by God as guardians of this shrine, feel it their duty to appeal to the Moslems of the whole world and warn them of the danger to the sanctuary and the country from the Jews. The latter, having been piomised a national home in Palestine, have openly proclaimed their inten tion of seizing the Mosque of Omar, which they allege is “the Jewish temple”. 3. Then follow various pronouncements by the Jewish leaders and instances of propaganda by newspaper and by picture. The gi owing menace to the Arabs of the acquisition of land by Jews, the increase of the Jewish population and the steady flow of immigrants from all parts of the world is emphasised. 4. The Moslem counter-efforts are related, including a large meeting in the Mosque of Omar which resulted in the issue of a “Fatwa” forbidding the sale of land to Jews and enjoining the boycott of all who participate in such sales. This “Fatwa” was confirmed by Ulama in Egypt, Iraq, India, Morocco and other countries. 5. The pamphlet ends with an appeal foi general Moslem co-operation to avert the danger. The Jews all over the world are working for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine and the Arabs of Palestine are not able to fight them unaided. If all Moslems unite to preserve the mosque and the holy land their object will, with the help of God, be achieved. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs., i * —* 1 • . . . (54) (Received on lAth September 1935 with Political Secretary's letter No. 35, dated 29th August 1635.) (Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering note, dated 12th August 1935.) Letter from the Foreign Office, to Lord Castlestewart, No. P.. Z.- 5596/35, DATED THE 13th August 1935. In Mr. Rondel’s absence on leave, I write to inform you that we have now had a reply from our Charg^ d’Affaires, at Jedda to the telegram which we sent at your request to enquire the present position about the exchange rate of silver riyals.^ »42 2. Mr. Calvert thinks that there must be in fact a shortage of silver coinage and he quotes as evidence of this the importation by the Saudi Government of 400,000 Indian rupees last May, and further importations of silver rupees which have apparently taken place since then. 3. Mr. Calvert reports that there has been keen appreciation of the silver riyal recently. As you know, the Saudi Government attempted at one time to maintain an artificial rate of 10 rivals to one gold pound, but the rate steadily depreciated, until at the end of 1933 it was over 24 riyals to the gold pound. The following figures show, however, the appreciation which has taken place this year in the selling rates of exchange for riyals to the gold pound :— : [ * 1st April—Riyals 21. 1st May—Riyals 20^- 1st June—Riyals 20. 30th June—Riyals 17, 18. 4. In terms of Egyptian pounds the riyal rate apparently rose after the Pilgrimage to 11, and then for one day to 81, falling subsequently to 40 rivals, 8 piastres, and then steadying to 10 riyals, 1 piastre at the end of July where it still remains. This is the more remarkable as the rate normally falls after the Pilgrimage below the usual figure of 14-15 riyals to the Eygptian pound. 5. When attention was first drawn to the steady appreciation in the vaule of riyals, observers were uncertain as to the exact cause behind it, but it now looks as though the main influence might in fact be a shortage of silver coinage. Mr. Calvert reports, however, that the reasons for this shortage are obscure. He has not heard any stories of the export of silver coinage and he finds it difficult to believe rumours of hoarding of coinage for sale at a profit during the next pilgrimage. The rates for Saudi cur rency normally rise when the pilgrimage season begins, but do not generally do so for other reasons before then. 6. As Mr. Rendel mentioned in the course of your interview with him on 7th August, we are obliged by our standing instructions to ask yon to be so good as to refund the cost of the telegram despatched at your request to Jedda, and of the reply thereto, and our Finance Department will m due pourse send you the customary official request for repayment.

(Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter, dated 13th September 1935.) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident, Aden, dated the 9th September 1935. I hawe the honour to refer to Sir Bernard Reilly’s confidential despatch No. 94 of the 17th April 1935, regarding the policy to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government in the Hadramaut. This question has been considered at a meeting of the Standing Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence for questions con cerning the Middle East, at which Sir Bernard Reilly was present, and gave further explanation of his proposals, which have my general approval. Details of the scheme for implementing the proposals will no doubt be submitted to me in due course. (57) (Received on 2nd November, 1935, with Political Secretary's letter, No. !&gt;2, dated 17th October, 1935.) (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 10th October 1935.) Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affa,tres, Jedda, to the Ioreign Office, No. 227, dated the 6th August 1935. With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 80, of the 18th Maich [S. No. (35)], concerning the concession granted by the Saudi Arab Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to submit a general report on the activities in the Hejaz of the syndicate since the ratification of the concession by King Abdul Aziz on the 12th February last. 2. It will be recollected that the concession allowed the syndicate three months in which to get to work, a year for general prospecting and another year for further research in selected areas, after which leases were to be granted to subsidiary companies formed to work the individual property. Mr. Twitch ell seems at present to be well ahead of this schedule. He set to work with great energy, immediately after his return to Jedda on the 17th February. The Australian, a Mr. Shanks, mentioned by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 56 of the 24th February [S- No. (31)], arrived with a British clerical assistant on the 27th February, and the whole party set out early in March for Yanbu and the Northern Hejaz. 3 After four months prospecting and assay work Mr. Twitchell seems to have decided to concentrate, for the moment, his attentions on the gold workings at Mahd-adh-Dhahab (“Cot of Gold”), and has withdrawn Mr. Shanks from Yanbu-an-Nakhl where he has been working without success ful results. 4 Mahd-adh-Dahab was visited for three weeks in June by Mr. E. D, McDermott, one of the directors of the syndicate. On his return to Eng land early in July, followed on the 24th July by Mr. Twitchell, who hoped to travel from Egypt by air, it was reliably reported that a subsidiary company had been formed to work the area containing this mine.5. The Mahd-adh-Dhahab gold mine, which is situated at 24° 15' N., and 41° 10' E. at a height of 3,550 feet above sea level, is said to have been worked by Harun-ar-Kashid and perhaps even earlier in the times of the Jahilfya. The extensive workings and the large area covered by ruined build ings show that a great number of workmen were employed in those times. Mr. Twitchell is now seeking to prove that the workings were not exhausted of their gold, but were abandoned either through the lack of engineering equipment and the knowledge how to mine deeper, or through the failure of the water-supply or from political reasons. 6. Mr. TwitcheR has been working at this mine himself and says he is very gratified with the results so far obtained in the mining of gold. There are, I believe, also subsidiary metals. He foreshadowed early developments and hoped to start diamond drilling, the machinery for which was on its way. Mr. Twitchell is, however, faced with many pro blems. I am not competent to judge the scheme from a technical mining point of view, but engineering problems may well be small compared with other factors such as the supply of water and communications with Medina and the coast. 7. Mr. Twitchell confessed to me in conversation that the water supplv was indeed a problem and said it might be necessary to sink a well. At present water is found in the surrounding districts at Maden (3 kilom.), Jiiaisiya (10 kilom.), and Suwaijiya (50 kilom.), while at the mine itself Mr. Twitchell has discovered a shaft containing water, estimated at about 7,000 gallons, which he intends to reserve for use in connexion with the diamond drilling. 8. With his usual energy and with Mr. van de Poll’s local knowledge in support, Mr. TwitcheR has set to work to solve the problem of communi cations. Mahd-adh-Dhahab lies, as the crow flies, some 100 miles from Medina and 240 from Jedda. The original plan was to use Yanbu as a base, being only 200 miles from the mine, but during these four months the road has been found very difficult. Non-Moslems have to leave the beaten track from Yanbu to Medina and circle the forbidden area to the north, making the road distance about 315 miles, and mostly over abomi nable ground of Harat lava, where in the winter the trucks were once or twice held up bv rain floods. This combined with the abandonment of the workings at Yanbu-an-Nakhl have induced the syndicate to consider the possibility of a road from Jedda, which will be a little longer than the Yanbu road/ and which would give the advantages of quicker external communication through the larger port. They are accordingly now occu pied in prospecting three alternate routes :— (1) Jedda-Asfan-A1 Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahab. (2) Jedda-Rabigh-Madh-adh-Dhahab. (3) A route between these two. None of these routes is at all practical at the moment; to quote Mr. van de Poll, who made a preliminary prospecting journey through to the mme on the Rabigh route, he only went forward because he knew he could not go back. It remains to be seen which, if any, of these three routes are chosen. 9. Well sinking, road making and the provision of food and medical treatment in the middle of unknown desert can only be a costly affair; it argues a wealth of optimism in the promoters in the possibilities of tne undertaking. 10.

Ibrahim Shanti, the chief editor of “Al Difa”\ newspaper had a conversation with His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamzeh the Sa udr Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. He discussed with His Excellency the evolution of world events which might lead to the outbreak of war, the attitude and the future of the Arab countries and the political me,nt between Baghdad, Mecca and Sana a The chief editor of Al Difa’ ” summarised the conversation as follows : His Excellency said that the outbreak of war inevitable and the pre sent political situation shows that it cannot be long delayed. We should f .tincb much importance to the political alignments in Europe, which afpiXong but change easily. France, the refuge of the White Army and the enemy of Russia and Bolshevism, worked hard until Monsieur Barthou who was killed with the King of Yugoslavia, succeeded in having Russmto whom France extended a hand filled with gold admitted to the League of Nations.

We .the Arabs, will in aU ouTpi fSLw the dictates of our interests not of our feelings.46 The editor enquired : “As you believe that a war will soon take place is it possible for the Arabs to be sure of their Governments’ readiness to take advantage of the opportunity to bring nearer the day of unity?” His Excellency kept silence for a while, then he said : “1 believe so. We are ready and I think Iraq is also. Another proof that the glorious day is drawing near is the ra'pproachment which will soon take place between the Governments of Mecca and Baghdad. Successful efforts were made to that end but the situation in Iraq delayed the project- These efforts will be resumed in such a way as to satisfy Arab desires. The pursuance of parallel policies by the Sa’udi and Iraqi kingdoms means, as you will readily understand, the partial attainment of this aim and it will be a good 1 step towards the realisation of national aspirations. The small emirates which you see on the coasts of Arabia will not stand before the hurricane as their existence is contrary to the law of nature. Our rela tions with Sana’a are friendly and intimate.” The editor ended the article thus :— “His Excellency made these statements with a thoughtful man’s quiet smile. We look forward to that glorious day when the Tigris and the Euphrates will unite with Zamzam and the historic capitals Mecca (Baghdad and Sana’a will be joined under one flag, which will lead the Arabs to the long awaited day, the day of unity; such is the demand of all Arabs and the aim of sixty million persons”. !</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000077_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/344</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000077</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/344</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 11/2 Diaries and Report: Arabia Series'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-02-20T22:15:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (109 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 111; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
