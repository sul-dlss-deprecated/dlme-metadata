It notes that as the Governor is determined to retaliate against the Persians at sea, the Resident has deemed it necessary to send the matter for the consideration of Government.Enclosed for the information of Government is a dispatch addressed by the Resident to HM Charg&#233; d'affaires at the Court of Persia on the subject, with enclosures.The item has four enclosures:1. Letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to William Taylor Thomson, HM Charg&#233; d'affaires at the Court of Persia, dated Bushire 27 February 1854.The enclosure is stating that reports indicating that Tahmasp Meerza had given up his intention of marching against Bandar Abbass have proven to be premature. It notes that should the British fail to preserve the territory of the Imam of Muscat and Oman, they can expect naval retaliation in the form of a blockade of Persian ports and trade.It explains that instructions from the Government of India &#8212; dated 17 June, 18 and 19 July 1848 &#8212; instruct the Resident to limit his interference in disputes between the authorities of Oman and other powers to mediation only. Though it explains that it is the Resident's view that any mediation he can provide will prove ineffective, not to mention difficult unless he can obtain intelligence on the true intentions of the Persian Government.It also notes that the Resident has opposed the formation of a coalition of 'uninterested parties' on the Arabian Coast; its purpose being to provide naval forces to side with Oman. It is explained in the letter that the Resident believes that this was likely to lead to piracy, and that they had no business being involved.This enclosure gives cover to a dispatch, which is enclosing No. 2-4.2. Translation of a letter from Syed Soweynee, Governor of Muscat to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 17 February 1854.The enclosure is reporting that a Persian force from Shiraz has commenced hostilities against Bunder Abbas, despite the fact that the Prince Governor of Fars had entered an engagement not to molest the settlement.3. Letter No. 63 of 1854 from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Commodore George Robinson, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf, dated Bushire 24 February 1854.The enclosure is instructing the Commodore &#8212; should the report in enclosure No. 4 prove be true &#8212; to inform Shaikh Saeed bin Tahnoon, Chief of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi], that getting involved in the struggle over Bundar Abbas would not be in accord with his engagements with the British Government. It also notes that he should be further reminded that once neutral ground is invaded it will be difficult to distinguish the 'actual belligerents' from those seeking an excuse to engage in plunder. The Commodore is instructed that if Sultan bin Suggur [Sul&#7789;&#257;n bin Saqr], the Joasmee [&#256;l Q&#257;sim&#299;] Chief, also shows any indication of getting involved he should be similarly warned.It further instructs the Commodore to warn the Chief of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] that conveying armaments to the Persian Coast would transgress the limits of the 'fixed line', and violate the spirit of the Maritime Truce.This enclosure is itself forwarding enclosure No. 4.4. Translated substance of a letter from Mulla Ahmed, the Agent at Lingah [Bandar-e-Lengeh] to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 7 February 1854.The letter is reporting that a Persian force has marched against Bundar Abbas, and that Syed Soweynee has requested assistance from Sultan bin Suggur and Shaikh Saeed bin Tahnoon.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x00002b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods>	</en_metadata>
