Reference External affairs Department memorandum No.D.10-N/38, dated the 5th January 1938. 2. The infomation contained in the despatch from His Majesty’s Minister Tehran, No.227(664/2/37)., dated the loth December 1937, is vague and such a general accusation is difficult to refute or substantiate. It is pointed out that the three places mentioned in paragraph 2 thereof, i.e. Chahbehar, Sarbaz and Qasri-Qand are all in Iran. 3. The only clue appears to be the name of Mir Abdi Khan coupled with the fact that the complaint is preferred against n a number of relatives and followers of the late Sardar Dost Loham ad Khan Baluch'. The late Sardar Dost ^ohammad Khan was the son of Mir Ali Mohammad Baranzai who now ekes out a meagre existence in a ju^gi in the bed of the Rakhshan Khor about two miles from Panjgur. Mir Ali Mohammad is Mir Abdi Khan’s maternal grand father and the latter may thus be placed as Mir Abdi Khan Saddozai of Dashtiari son of b.Din Mohamnad Khan, uhen Mir Ali 1 ohammad fled to British territory, his wife Bibi Zargul v.as escorted as far as Suhtsar post by her grandson Mir Abdi Khan whence he returned to Iran, while she proceed ed to Gwadur where she still resides. 4. There is no evidence whatever to show that Mir Abdi Khan or others have been wandering on the British side of the frontier, inducing or trying to induce Iranian Baluchis to migrate across the frontier. The number of migrants is admittedly large, but it is due to deeper causes than the inducement of any small Sardar.

It is understood that in September last year Fir Abdi Khan’s son Dost Mohammad was arrested by the Iranians. In October his brother Mauladad and a party of 30 were allowed to proceed to dwadur. It is reported that in January last efforts to reconcile Mir Abdi xfoan and his enemies were being made by the Iranians. 6. Mir Abdi Khan owns lands in Dashtiari on which he raises a few poor barani crops. At present he is said to be iesiding at Sarbaz (31.F/B.2) in Iran with his recently acquired wife, a daughter of Sardar Syed Mohamed of that place. 7. No Iranian is allowed to settle in British territory without producing ample security for good behaviour and abstention from hostile activities on the frontier. 8.

Mohsen Rais, Politicafl Director- GenersJ of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told me that for some time a number of relatives and followers of the late Sardar Dost Mohammad Khan Baluch had been wandering on the British side of the Baluchistan frontier, and had been inducing, or trying to induce, Iranian Baluchis to migrate across the frontier. 2. M. Rais explained that one of the members of the party was said to be called Mir Abdi Khan, and that places mentioned in the reports were Chahbehar Sarbaz and Qasr-i-Qand Some Iranian subjects had, he went on to say, crossed the frontier and liad later returned in a destitute condition. 3. M. Rais asked whether the persons about whom he was j complaining could be extradited or removed from the frontier where they were becoming a serious nuisance. I told him in reply that it would be quite impossible to arrange their extradition, but I said that I would enquire whether the Government of India could take any other measures to prevent the men in question from remaining a source of trouble to the Iranian authorities. 4. I fear that on the information furnished effective action will be difficult, but I should be grateful if I might be informed in due course whether it has proved possible to take any ste£s in this matter, if the information brought to my attention should prove to be true. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Agent to the Governor-General of Baluchistan unnumbered and to His •Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan No.85.

In reply, the undersigned has the honour to state that from the correspondence there appears to he no time limit to the visit of the two Perso-Buluchis desiring permission to come to Karachi. Abdul Samad, ^arbazi of Gul Muhami.iad Lines, Karachi, hails from ^arbaz in Persia and is known as ^arbazi. He came to India about 12 years ago and visited Delhi where he took a 4 years course in Heiigious Education after which he came and settled down in Gul Muhammad Lines in Karachi and became Pesh Imam of the Masjid Jamia. In addition he has been work ing for the past two years as a teacher in the Madressah Mazharul- Uloon at Khadda, Baghdadi, on Rs.3Q/- per mensem. This institution is run by MOULVI MUHAMMAD SADIQ, a listed member at page 334 of the Bombay Presidency Political '¥ho # s Who'. Prom enquiries it is learnt that Mir Ali Muhammad Khan wrote requesting Abdul Samad to invite them to Karachi as they desired to come here, stating that the invitation would be a means to getting a permit to visit Karachi. Undersigned sees no objection to these two individuals being permitted to come to Karachi provided a time ±s limit Is imposed. If their stay becomes indefinite other members will follow on, until Karachi is burdened with all the Baranzai Refugees, which burden it can ill afford to take in view of the present unemployment and distress prevailing particularly in the Lyari Quarter locality (where Baluchis reside and from which area anti-Baluchistan Government agitation emanates) where they will naturally take up their abode.
