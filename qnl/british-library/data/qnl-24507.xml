KEMBALL, Lieut-Col,, Offg. 'Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,ADMINISTRATION EEPORT on the PEliSIAK GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY and MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY for 1902-1903. Pakt I.— general summary. Bainfall and Harvest. —Generally throughout Southern Persia, the rainfall I. during the winter of 1902-1903 has been good, and the prospects of the harvest are better than they have been for many years. Locusts have done some damage to the crops in the districts adjacent to Bushire. In the Karun districts the crop prospects may be said to be excellent, and at Shiraz there is every hope of a really good harvest. The prices of foodstuffs have fallen and are likely to fall very considerably later on. In Bushire, at the close of the year, wheat was selling at 25 Krans and barley at 18 Krans per Hashmi Man of 124 lbs. 2. The Governorship of Bushire and Grulf Ports. —His Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim has been Governor throughout the year, and it is understood that he will remain in office for the coming year. 3. Fuhlic Peace and Tranquillity.—Qooti. order was maintained in Bushire and its neighbourhood during the year. In January 1903, the Governor sum moned to Bushire Zayer Khader, the Zabit or Headman of Pangistan. llelying on the assurances given to him, Zayer Khader complied and came to Bushire, but on the 3rd February, as he was leaving the Governor's residence after an apparently friendly interview with His Excellency, he was arrested. A scufllo ensued between Zayer Khader's men who had accompanied him and the Gov ernor's, and three of the latter were killed. Zayer Khader, however, remained in custody where he still is. It was thought at one time that local troubles would arise on account of this incident, and threatening letters were addressed to me and other Consuls in Bushire by Zayer Khader's following in Tangistan w ho came to the Imam Zada in Bjeshire. Nothing, however, resulted and matters are apparently now quiet in Tangistan. 4. Public Health.—k very severe epidemic of small-pox occurred in Shiraz during the summer months and a large number of children tell victims to the disease. In Bushire small-pox broke out during the winter and many persons succumbed to the disease. Cholera in epidemic form appeared m Ju y at Gwadur and lasted until the end of August. _ During this period 265 j3ersons are reported to have died. In October the disease again appeared an lastec for a month carrying off 256 persons. On the 18th Decembei a rep or was received from the Telegraph Station at Jask that cholera had broken out there. The disease originated in some villages in the vicinity of the Te eg rap i a ion. By the end of the month the disease died out, but during this period, according to the report received from the Assistant Surgeon at Jask w 10 s ^P ei J^ s( J c e observation camp in the neighbourhood of the station, 52 cases wi ea is occurred. The disease also appeared about the same time at Mmai, mi es Badministeation kepoet on the persian gulp political from Bunder Abbas. No autlientic details regarding the progress of the disease at this place have been received, but many people are said to have died. The epidemic died out towards the end of January. The measures taken by the local authorities at Bunder Abbas in accordance with the advice of Assistant Surgeon Kirkpatrick were successful in keeping the disease out of Bunder Abbas. The measures for the prevention of plague throughout the Gulf have been efficiently carried out under the superintendence of the Residency Surgeon. 5. Administration of the Customs in the Tersian Gulf.— Ok the 23rd Sep tember 1902, a satisfactory settlement having been arrived at between the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the management of the Customs at Mohammerah and on the Kamn was taken over by the Belgian Customs Administration, and was placed under the charge of the Director- General in Bushire. In February 1903, the Customs Department at Moham merah was separated from the Gulf Customs Department and placed directly under the Minister of Customs at Tehran, Monsieur^Waffelaert being the first Director-General of what is now termed the Arabistan Customs Department. Customs Houses have now, it is understood, been established at Bunder Nasri on the Karun and also at Dizful and Shushter. On the 14th February 1903 the hitherto prevailing duty of 5 per cent. ad valorem on imports and exports was abolished and a new specific tariff was introduced. It is too early as yet to say for certain how the new tariff will affect trade generally, but the first impression was that the Indian tea trade would receive a serious check. I, however, am inclined to doubt if this will be the case, as the commodity, although the duty has been considerably raised, is a cheap one and its consumption has taken a hold upon the people of the country. The heavier classes of Manchester cotton goods may, it seems, be adversely affected. Export duties have generally been abolished; but the duty on opium, which is the most important article of export from Persia, has been largely increased. The introduction of the new tariff caused much consterna tion amongst the native merchants throughout Southern Persia, and telegrams were sent from Bushire and other places to the Shah and to the Minister of Customs praying for a postponement of the tariff for a period of three months to enable the merchants to dispose of their goods then lying in the Customs Houses and on the way to Persia. The request was refused and consequently for some time goods were not cleared from the Customs Houses and there was much talk of a general agitation against the Government. At Shiraz the excitement seems to have been greater than elsewhere in the south. At the close of the year the agitation seemed to be generally dying out though goods belonging to up-country merchants still remained uncleared in the Bushire Customs House. The importance of Lingah as the port of transhipment for the Arab Coast ports has declined, and steamers of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company now make regular callings at Debaye which has now become the distributing centre for the Arab Coast. 6. Settlement of Claims. —Notwithstanding the efforts made by His Majesty's Legation and this Residency, the settlement of our claims against the Persian Government and Persian subjects has made no progress. The Special Commissioner alluded to in last year's report left for Tehran, having effected nothing. A new Karguzar has recently arrived with special orders to take these cases up. 7. Coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII. —The Coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII was celebrated on the 1st January 1903 at all the places in the Gulf within the jurisdiction of this Residency. Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., was Political Agent at Maskat throughout the year. With the exception of occasional inter-tribal quarrels, the Sultan's terri tories continued to enjoy peace and tranquillity. In December His Highness the Sultan sent his eldest son Saiyid Taimur to represent him at the ^Delhi Coronation Darbar. The Political Agent s report of the principal events in Maskat during the year forms Part II of this compilation. The pearling season was a good one and high prices generally ruled. The peace at sea has been maintained and no case of piracy or disturbances at seaEESIDENCY AND MASK AT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. 3 occurred. A disturbing element _ however in the politics of the Oman Coast has lately arisen owing to the renunciation by the petty Sheikh of Pujeyrah on the Batmeh Coast of his allegiance to the Joasmi ruler of Shargah. All efforts to bring about a satisfactory arrangement between the Pujeyrah Sheikh and the Chief of Shargah have failed, and it is owing to this matter that the Chief of Shargah has fallen out with his neighbour, the Chief of Debaye, who is suspected by the Shargah Chief to be encouraging the Sheikh of Pujeyrah. Mr. J« C. Gaskin has been Assistant Political Agent throughout the year, iv.— Bahrein, which has been, so far as the internal affairs of the islands are concerned' exceptionally quiet and prosperous. The new house for the Assistant Politicai Agent was completed towards the end of September. Sheikh Rashid, the third son of the Chief of Bahrein, died of consumption on the 16th December. Two Frenchmen, Messieurs Dumas and Castelin, arrived in Bahrein in Pebruary for the purpose of opening a business there. A German Assistant to Herr Wanckhaus also arrived in Bahrein during the year. One serious case of piracy occurred in August off the Coast of Katr on a Bahrein boat, property of the value of 5,400 dollars being carried off. The leader of the pirates was the notorious Ahmed bin Selman originally from Bahrein and an outlaw from that place. Ahmed bin Selman returned with the booty to Turkish territory where he now is. Eepresentations were at once made to the Turkish authorities at Basrah through His Britannic Majesty's Consul, but so far the pirate has not been captured. The only news of importance from El Katr is, that in October last, the Mutassarif of El Hassa wrote to Sheikh Jassim bin Thani, the Chief of Katr, expressing a wish to make his acquaintance and desired him to go to El Hassa or else to send his brother. Sheikh Ahmed. Both declined the invitation. This part of Arabia under Turkish rule has been, as usual, in a marked v -El Hassa state of disorder. The caravan route between Ojair and El Hassa was unsafe aild El Katlf - for the greater part of the year and three large caravans were attacked and plundered by the Arabs, One of these caravans which left El-Hassa for Ojair on the 29th April was escorted by 120 cavalry, 80 mounted irregulars and 30 infantry and was attacked by a part of the A1 Murra, A1 Safran and Beni Hajir Arabs. It is said that nearly all the escort was killed and the few who escaped were held as hostages for the safety of the Arab tribesmen who were in Turkish custody at El Hassa. The new Mutassarif of El Hassa, Saiyid Taleb, son of the Nakib of Basrah, who took up his appointment in July, is said to have restored a certain amount of order in the districts, and it is understood that a series of posts are to be established between Ojair and El Hassa, each to be garrisoned by Turkish cavalry and infantry. Constant and conflicting reports have been received during the year regard- vi ^-Koweit ing the progress of the fighting between the Amir of Nejd and the partisans of the Wahabi dynasty. In last year's report the capture of Riadh by the latter was mentioned, and there appears to be no doubt that all the efforts of the Amir of Nejd to turn the Wahabis out of Biadh have so far failed. Abdul Rahman bin Peysal has, it appears, gained influence and supporters throughout ^ the country-side and it is generally thought that the power of the Amir of IS ejd is on the decline. In the early part of 1903, the Amir was reported to be within a few marches of Koweit where he was joined by Yusuf bin Ibrahim of Dora, the well known enemy of Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit and the espousei of the cause of Mubarek's nephews. Koweit itself was never actually threatened, though Mubarek complained of raids committed on his tribesmen. Towards the close of the year the Amir drew off towards El Kaseem. He has been followed by Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Peysal, and it was generally expected la a decisive battle would have been fought ere this. iSo reliable news howevei o any encounter has as yet been received. His Royal Highness the Salar -ed-Dowleh was Governor-General of Arabis- VilgPersian tan throughout the vear, with Azem-es -Sultaneh as Lieutenant- i o\eiiioi. ie province has generally been in a disturbed state.

In October a party of Arabs looted a barge of the Moin-nt-Tnjar at Uriss and afterwards attacked a caravan. On the 3rd February the Ferahan Hegiment, some 800 stiong, while on the march from Khoremabad to Dizful, was attacked in the hills by a section of the Pishkuh Lurs. After some resistance in which the regulars are said to have lost 80 men, the remainder surrendered. The Lurs took their rifles and ammunition and other stores, and also looted the caravan, which was marching with the troops, of goods said to be of the value of 40,000 Tomans (equal to about **1,15,000)° The Bakhtiaris were ordered to levy a force to chastise the Lurs and it is believed that the punishment has been carried out though no reliable report has been received. His Excellency the Muez-es-Sultaneh, Chief of Mohammerah, was, in August, given the exalted rank and title of Sardar Arfa and a jewelled sword. His son Sheikh Chaseb was also decorated and given the title of Nasret-el-Mulk. The Beni Truf tribe have given trouble during the year and the Sardar Arfa had prepared an expedition to deal with them. Ihey however came in and submitted before operations against them w T ere undertaken. In November the Turkish Government reduced the export duty on horses at Basrah. Consequently fewer horses were taken to Mohammerah for shipment. viii .—Ears and {1) Shimz.—llis Excellency the Assaf-ed-Dowleh was Governor-General Persian coast. 0 £ p ars the year. A new Governor-General was, however, appointed on the 21st March, or Persian New Year's day, and the Assaf-ed-Dowdeh left for Tehran, the Ala-ed-Dowdeh being then on his way to succeed him. The Assaf-ed- Dowleh though generally liked by the people of Shiraz, was not a strong ruler, and was quite unable to maintain order amongst the turbulent tribesmen of the districts. The roads were generally unsafe, highway robberies were frequent and the Persian Post between Shiraz and Bushire was stopped and robbed on three occasions. The Legation Courier on his way from Tehran to Shiraz was stopped by Kashkais in the Tangi Bulaki in the neighbourhood of Sivand and stripped of every thing. The robbers, however, restored to him the letters which he brought in to Shiraz. During April and May the city of Shiraz was in a state of considerable excitement owing to the scarcity of bread. The bakers closed their shops and there was every fear of disturbances. The timely arrival of the Assaf-ed-Dowleh on the 23rd May somewhat allayed the anxiety of the people and arrangements w T ere made for the bakers' shops to be opened and for bread to be sold at lower prices. Later on, the harvest being a satisfactory one and new grain being brought into the place, prices fell considerably and all anxiety was removed. The Kow r am-el-Mulk, who, as reported in last year's report, had been obliged to leave Shiraz, was allowed, as a special concession consequent on the death of his wafe which occurred in Shiraz on the 6th July, to return to his home for a short period. He arrived in Shiraz on 2nd August and left again for Kerbella, where he had been ordered to take up his abode, on the 20th Septem ber, He was later on in the year pardoned by the Shah and received His Majesty's permission to return to Shiraz. The new Eesidency building at Shiraz w r as completed during the summer. I visited Shiraz in May and remained there during the summer, returning to Bushire in the end of October. There was an exceptionally severe winter in Shiraz. (2) Zar. —The district of Lar has been in a disturbed state. About the middle of January reports reached Lingah that Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Deputy Governor of Lar, being on bad terms with Baker Khan, Deputy Governor of Ishkanan, invaded the latter province with a large force and sacked the village of Biram. Later on a reconcilition was effected, Baker Khan agreeing to pay the Government revenues for the Gilahdar, Ishkanan and Shib Koh districts. During Haji Ali Kuli Khan's absence, his two nephews created a disturbance and killed two Saivids who were in charge of the Government affairs at Lar. They then, with their father, hearing of Haji Ali Kuli Khan's approach, took refuge in the fort at Art. The fort was invested and subsequently surrendered, Haji Ali Kuli Khan pardoning his rebellious brother who was, however, fined 16,000 Tomans, one of his nephews being kept as security for the payment.RESIDENCY AND MASKAI POLmCAL AGENCY F OR THE YEAR 1902-1903. 5 (3) LingaJi—Agha, Muhammad Amiu wlio W - d • ^ t Lingah for many years died on the 3rd August.

H. S. Boxer, Assistant Resident and Vice-Consul, died suddenly at Bunder Abbas on the 4th June from hyperpy- ttma consequent on an attack of bilious remittent fever. He was succeeded in August by Captain W. G. Grey. Owing to the scarcity which prevailed during the year the districts round Bunder Abbas were m a very disturbed state. The routes to Eerman and Yezd were very unsafe and frequent robberies were committed by the Baharloo and Bashbrditnbes. The Persian Post from Kerman was robbed on three occasions and the village of Sultanabad between Bunder Abbas and Kerman was sacked towards the_end of Apnl by Baharloo raiders who are said to have killed some 15 oi. the inhabitants. In May and June Minab was raided by Bashkirdis and trequent reports were received of robberies and disturbances. Severe shocks of earthquake were felt at Bunder Abbas and Kishm on the 9th June and continued for some days. Many of the houses suffered and two lives were lost at Bunder Abbas. The damage at Kishm was, it is believed, more serious than at Bunder Abbas. Mr. H. Whitby Smith was in Political charge of the Mekran Coast durina? ix.— Persian the year. ^ Baluchistaa. The districts of Bahu and Dashtyari were at the close of the year 1901-1902 in a disturbed state owing to the misdeeds of Mir Mahmud Khan. At the instigation of Saiyid Khan of Gaih this same Mahmud Khan was appointed by Sardar Hashim Khan, Governor of Bampur, to be Chief of Bashtyari, Mir Abdi being driven out of the place. Representations were made by His Majesty's Legation to the Persian Government regarding the state of affairs prevailing in those districts and the arrest and punishment of Mahmud Khan and Saiyid Khan were pressed for, but without success. In July, how ever, the new Governor of Bampur, Murteza Kuli Khan, who succeeded Hashim Khan, arrested Saiyid Khan who was released in November after a large sum of money had been taken from him. ]S T o steps have been taken for the arrest of the principal offender Mahmud Khan who still remains at large and con tinues to do mischief. Owing to the long continued drought, much distress has prevailed during the year in all the districts between Gwettur and Jask. Sixteen slaves were manumitted during the year: of these three took refuge x.— Slave Trade, m Bushire, three in Lingah, and ten in Bahrein. On the 8th April a Bahrein boat bound from Bahrein to Basrah i n XL-Piracies, bailast was attacked near the second buoy on the Shatt-el-Arab bar by a party ot 16 Arabs who carried off Rs. 400 in cash and other property. The matter was represented to the Turkish authorities who arrested a few suspected persons whom, however, the Nakhoda of the boat could not identify. On 27th May, a Koweit boat was attacked off Bubyan island near the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab by pirates who are believed to be in the employ of nsut bin Ibrahim of Dora.

Representations made to the Persian and^ Turkish authorities produced no result, but Sheikh Mubarek visited the Chief of Mohammerah in connection with these piracies, and it is not known what arrangement was come to between the two Chiefs. Early in September an expedition was organized at Dora by Yusuf bin Ibrahim, with the object of either attacking Koweit and getting rid of Sheikh Mubarek or else of committing piracies on Koweit boats. The Commander of H.M.S. Lapwing having received news of the expedition made a search for the dhows. On 5th September two dhows containing some 150 armed men were discovered in the Khor Abdulla and were ascertained to be the suspected dhows. Lieutenant and Commander Armstrong gave chase in four of the ships' boats. The Arabs finding that they could not escape, ran their dhows ashore on the Persian side of the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab. The Lapwing s boats which were in hot pursuit came up and a fight ensued between the boats and the Arabs who had got ashore. After a sharp fight, in which one blue jacket was killed and two wounded, the Arabs fied, losing, it is believed, some six men killed ana several wounded. The dhows were captured and later on destroyed. The gallant action of Commander Armstrong and his men in pursuing and capturing these dhows, is deserving of the highest praise. Several of the men belonging to the dhows were subsequently arrested while trying to cross the river to the Turkish side and were detained in custody by the Chief of Mohammerah. In consequence of the representations made to the Turkish authorities, Yusuf bin Ibrahim has been ordered to leave Dora and it is understood that he has left the place. On the night of the 26th November a Maskat buggalow owned by two British Indian subjects was pirated in the river while she was lying off Maamer on the Turkish side. One of the crew was killed and the Nakhoda wounded, 400 dollars in cash and other property being carried off. In Pebruary another Koweit boat was attacked in the Khor Musa. A passenger and the Nakhoda and four of the crew were killed and a large amount of cash and property was carried off. The Turkish and Persian authorities are being pressed to take action against the pirates who have of recent years done so much mischief in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab. Sheikh Mubarek invariably charges Yusuf bin Ibrahim with responsibility for the piracies, but with the exception of the Lapwing incident no definite proof against the man has been adduced. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy visited the Gulf during the year:— Fomone, Sphinx, Redbreast, Lapwing, Amphitrite, Cossack, Assaye, Fox and Renown. The Russian cruisers Ashold and Boyarin, and the Prench cruiser Infernet also visited the Gulf. In January an addition was made to the Persian navy by the purchase of the Belgian yacht Selika, now named the Mozafferi. A Belgian Captain is in charge and she has two European engineers. She is understood to have been purchased for Customs work. Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., was Resident throughout the year. Captain Vere de Vere Hunt, who succeeded Mr. Davis as Pirst Assistant, arrived at Bushire on 23rd April. Lieutenant C. L. Peart, 4th Sikhs, arrived from India on 1st July on a year's deputation to Persia as Assistant to the Resident and proceeded to Shiraz where he now is. Major E. Wickham Hore, I. M.S., was transferred to Baghelkband and was succeeded as Kesidency Surgeon by Captain de Vere Condon, I.M.S., who arrived in Bushire on 25th November. Dr. Reinhardt was Consul for Germany throughout the year. He visited Shiraz during the summer and quitted Bushire for Europe on leave in the end of March. He has been succeeded by Herr Von Mutius. Monsieur Chaloin was Vice-Consul for Prance during the year. Towards the end of March he took over the duties of Consul for the Netherlands from Mr. Moesmann who resigned the appointment. -HeuleD' p®)RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY POP.

Btjshire ; The 15th May 1903.10 Paet II.— ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION EEPOr.T OF THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR, 1902-1903. Internal Politics. Saeb. Awabi. 1. The internal politics of Oman during the past year have displayed little or no divergence from the prevailing type. In the spring, and again in the autumn, the usual rumours were rife regarding a supposed intention on the part of the tribes of the Sharkiyeh to raid the small coast-ports near Maskat, but no developments ensued and it is doubtful if the rumours had any serious foundation. At the same two seasons there were signs of unrest among the tribes of the Upper Semail Valley, the outcome, in a great measure, of the drought which has been prevalent for the last three seasons and has reduced some of the tribes to sore straits. 2. Beyond the foregoing little has transpired calling for special remark except that, on two occasions, when incidents have occurred calculated to lead to further trouble if not specially dealt with. His Highness the Sultan has found it advisable to proceed in person to the scene. The small coast town of Seeb, 30 miles from the capital, where rnanv of the well-to-do inhabitants of Maskat own date-groves, to which they migrate in the hot weather, afforded the first occasion calling for his presence. ^The town is inhabited by a motley assortment of Arabs and Baluchis, but the tribes most strongly represented are the Beni Hina, Beni Hadid and Beni Awamir, who, in a desultory way, are perennially at feud with one another. In recent years these three communities, partly for self-protection and partly with a view to being in a better position to annoy their neighbours when any quarrel is in progress, have, as opportunity offered, quietly built themselves 'fortified towers in their respective parishes, if I may use such a term, and when any incident occurs affording sufficient pretext for a rupture of the peace they are in the habit of taking cover in their towers and exchanging random shots with their adversaries or picking off individuals among them who expose themselves unwarily. As their tribal settlements are a considerable distance apart promis cuous long range practice of this kind naturally disturbs the general tranquillitv of the place and endangers the lives of unoffending inhabitants and on this account the tribal Sheikhs have been repeatedly ordered by the Sultan through his local Wali, to vacate or dismantle their fortifications. The Sheikhs however, were contumacious, owing to the orders not being backed by anv show of force and continued from time to time to break the peace and paralvse the trade of the port. Accordingly His Highness the Sultan taking advantage ot an occasion when hostilities of the nature described were in progress owino- to the murder of an Awamir man by a negro belonging to the Beni'Hadad set out for Seeb m the month of April for the purpose of demolishing the objectionable towers Accompanied by a small force taken from the Maskat garrison, he carried out his plan without any opposition to speak of and returned to Maskat on 14th idem after ]0 days' absence.

The murderer was subse quently executed, ou 6th May, but apparently on further inquiry the Sheikh was found not to be implicated personally and was released. A punitive fine was however levied in cash. 4!. Later in the }eai an unfortunate incident was reported from Nezwa ^szwa. Saiyid Seif bin Ilamed the Wali of this important town, who is by birth an Al-Bu-Saeedi {i.e., of the same stock as the ruling house) and having risen to his present position under tragic circumstances, now leads an insecure existence within the confines of the JSTezwa fort, had reason to suspect a plot against his life among a party of Jennebeh tribesmen visiting the town and ordered his Negro guard to effect their arrest. The guard proceeded to do so, but the Jennebeh shewing fight the Askaris used their rifles and killed four of them. A good deal of consternation was caused by this regrettable occurrence when the report, which lost nothing in the telling, reached Maskat, and it was feared that it might result in a general rising of the Jennebeh and an attack in force upon the Nezwa fort. Indeed, if matters had so turned out, there would have been small cause for wonder, but the Sultan lost no time in dispatching a deputation to the vicinity to pacify the Jennebeh, and fortunately with a successful result, no further bloodshed ensuing. This took place in October. Later on as soon as matters had subsided sufficiently to enable him to travel with any degree of safety, the Wali journeyed into Maskat to present his report personally to the Sultan, and has since returned to Nezwa. 5. The affairs of this appanage of the Oman Sultanate have been a good deal Gwadur. in evidence during the past year owing chiefly to the results of a change of Walis. There were, no doubt, at the time of his transfer, a number of petty complaints against the late incumbent, and, as he had been there many years, the Sultan thought it expedient to give him a transfer. His successor has how ever shewn himself unfitted for such a responsible post and it is confidently hoped that now the Sultan realises that Gwadur affairs are not working as smoothly as they ought, he will definitely decide to try a new man or reinstate his former representative, Saif bin Saeed, whose return seems to be generally desired by the public at Gwadur. It must not be overlooked that His Highness is in a difficult position in such matters owing to the extreme paucity among his Arab subjects of officials upon whom sufficient reliance can be placed when they are deputed to positions of authority away from head-quarters. Tor this reason he naturally hesitates to make changes in appointments until thoroughly convinced that no other remedy is left open to him. 6. The Political Agent was absent from Maskat during the year under Political report on four occasions, as follows : — Agent's Tours {a) On the 6th April 1902, he proceeded to Bushire on H.M.S. Redbreast to confer with the Resident on various matters, and from thence, under instructions from the latter returned to Fujeyrah, on the Oman coast, north of the Batineh, to endeavour Fujeyrah. to bring Sheikh Hamid bin Abdullah, Chief of the Sharkiyyeen, to reason in regard to the actively hostile attitude which he has latterly assumed towards the Joasmi. The stubborn old veteran, however, refused to be convinced. His case is still engaging the attention of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, in connection with the Pirate coast questions, but it nevertheless claims passing mention in a chronicle of Maskat affairs, in that bheikh Hamid, at an earlier stage of the case, applied to the Sultan for assistance against his alleged oppressors, the Joasmi. ^ On the advice ot the Resident, however, His Highness has wisely abstained irom espousing his cause or otherwise participating in the quarrel. 7. JEn route to Pujeyrah H. M. S. Redbreast touched at the islets of Parur, Nabi-ul-Farur, Sirri, Abu Musa, IS abi-ul- Tanb and Tanb and it was noticed that the Persian flag was still flying over the main Arab village on e •sian Flag on island of Sirri, as it was in 1C87-1888, vide Persian Gulf Admimstratxon Report sirri Island, for that year. The fact was duly reported to the Resident in the 1 ersian (jiut.12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Jourrey from Abu Thabi to Maskat. Delhi Coronation Durbar. 8. After leaying Fujeyrah the Redbreast cruised round to Abu Thabi on the Pirate coast where the Political Agent was landed on 30th April and journeyed to Maskat by land, a distance a little over 400 miles. The utmost assistance and hospitality was afforded to him by Sheikli Zaeed- bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abu Thabi, without whose cordial co-operation the first portion of the journey could not have been performed; and on disembarking the Political Agent, H. M. S. Bedhreast returned to Maskat with a despatch requesting the Sultan to be so good as to send his trusted Lieutenant Sheikh Eashidbin-Uzaiz, Governor of Semail, or some other influential Sheikh, to meet the Political Agent at Ibri in the Dahireh. His Highness cordially and promptly responded and Sheikh llashid duly kept tryst at Ibri on 14th May. Some portion of the country passed through in the Dahireh district had not been visited before by a European, so far as is known, and of the remainder of the route much had not been traversed for many years. The principal places visited were Abu Thabi, Bereymee, Hafit, Hthank, Ibri, Nejd-ul-Makharim Gabrin, Bahla, Nezwa, Tanoof, the villages of the Jebel Akhdar range, Semail, Saroor, Bidbid, Pinjah and so on to Maskat which was reached on 29th May. No serious opposition was offered to the Political Agent's progress and when the difficulties and occasional risks of first contact had been got over, and his identity and credentials made known, the villagers and Bedouins met with were uniformly friendly. The chief impediment to the security of travel in Oman, as in other parts of Arabia, is the suspicious nature of the bucolic Arab, who is ever ready to believe any exaggerated or lying story that may happen to get abroad regarding the identity and motives of the stranger sojourning in bis country. The peasants were found to be much better armed in this, the Northern half of Oman, than they are in the South ; in fact obsolete rifles were altogether at a discount. 9. (&amp;) On 8th June His Majesty's 1st class Cruiser Amphitrite, 11,000 tons. Captain 0. Windham C.V.O., arrived at Maskat fromEngland and, in the absence of the B)esident at Shiraz, the Political Agent accompanied her on her cruise in these waters, returning to Maskat on 25th June. {c) On 11th July he proceeded to Simla on duty and returned on 13th August. {d) On 13th December he left for India to attend the Coronation Durbar at Delhi with the deputation of His Highness the Sultan. 10. The latter was cordially invited by the Government of India to attend this great pageant himself as the guest of Government, or to send a deputation in the event of his own inability to avail himself of the invitation. Unfor tunately His Highness did not feel able to absent himself from Maskat for the period which his presence at Delhi in person would have necessitated, and there fore sent his eldest son Saiyid Taimoor to represent him, attended by Saiyid Yusuf Zowawi, a close friend and adviser of the Sultan, and Saiyid Miiharamad bin Ahmed bin Nasir, Governor of Muttra. The Political Agent accompanied the deputation as Political officer. On arrival at Karachi Saiyid Taimoor was received with his father's salute of 21 guns and was escorted on shore by the Port Officer. He was accorded similar honors on arrival at and departure from Delhi, and was in all matters treated as representing His Highness the Sultan. In spite of the severe cold the party kept good health and were able to attend all the preordained functions and to enter heartily into other pleasures during theprogress of the festivities, which they thoroughly appreciated and eil 3 0 3 During the fortnight Saiyid Taimoor and his companions had an mterview with His Excellency the Viceroy, taking with them a set of handsome gold chased articles of local pattern and workmanship which the Sultan had had ma e tor His Majesty the King and which His Excellency the Viceroy had kmdly undeitaken to have forwarded to their destination. During the interview w aiyid aimoor delivered messages of congratulation and friendship from his a icy, and His Excellency expressed his pleasure at being able to honour the occasion y t le presentation to His Highness the Sultan of 2 guns as an arma- ment for the steamer which he has lately purchased, through the good offices of the Government of Incua, for his own use.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. 13 ore . ^ r e . ;Dmto .^ e l J? Goyernment of India were pleased to de corate Saiyid laimoor with the Gold Delhi Durbar Commemoration Medal After leaving De hi on 12th January Saiyid Taimoor and party proceeded direct to Bombay, where a fortnight was spent while communications passed with His Highness the Sultan regarding a proposed tour to Agra, Aligarh and Calcutta. In the meanwhile, at his father's wish, Saiyid Taimoor visited his great uncle, Saiyid Abdul Aziz, at Poona, and Saiyid Abdul Aziz subsecracntlv journeyed to Bombay for a few hours to return his nephew's visit. On 26th January the party left for Agra where three days were spent seein^ the sights of the neighbourhood. From Agra a short excursion was made to Aliovarii Saiyid Taimoor having been invited by the Principal and Council to pav a visit to the Saiyid Ahmed M. A. O. College. A long morning was spent there and the party were received with much kindness and distinction by the College authorities, and appeared to bo greatly interested and impressed by what thev saw j in the afternoon a stait was made for Calcutta, where another week wjis spent and various places of interest visited, by the end of which it was time to think of returning to Maskat, which was reached safely on 18th Pebruary. It is certain that the whole party thoroughly enjoyed their tour, especially Saiyid Taimoor, who displayed much intelligence and good sense under the novel surroundings, and there can be no doubt that besides the pleasure which he derived from what he saw both at Delhi and afterwards his experiences have opened his mind considerably and will leave upon him a lasting impression for good. On his safe return His Highness the Sultan fired a salute of 21 guns as a mark of his acknowledgments to Government for their entertainment of his deputation and this was followed by a salute of 13 guns in honour of Saiyid Taimoor. At Maskat Durbar Day was appropriately celebrated. A salute of 101 guns was fired and the Union Jack flown from the Sultan's saluting battery from sunrise to sunset and His Highness with his usual suite called officially at the British Consulate to offer his congratulations, as did the representatives of Foreign Powers. The members of the British Indian Communities closed and illuminated their shops in honour of the occasion and deputations of the several persuasions called at the Consulate to express their congratulations and loyalty to the crown. A telegram was at the same time sent by them to the Govern ment of India for favour of transmission to His Majesty the King conveying similar expressions of congratulation and loyalty. 11. Customs. —His Highness still continues to administer his own Customs i and has during the year under report resumed the direct administration of the Gwadur Customs also. The revenue of the Oman Customs has this year touched the highest figure that has yet been reached, there being an increase of one million dollars in the value of the trade as compared with last year. The items which have mainly contributed to this substantial improvement will be seen from the trade statistics. It is worthy of remark here, however, that the large increase in the date export was mainly due to the Turkish Arabian crop having been a poor one, resulting in the transfer of part of the Gulf demand to Maskat. It is satisfactory to be able to report that the work inaugurated last year in connection with the improvement of the Custom House premises has been continued by the local Government. The wharf, which was ^quite inadequate for the accommodation required, has now been enlarged by taking in more of the foreshore and roofed sheds have moreover been erected on it for the better protection of merchandise from the elements. At the same time suitable offices, and warehouses for the storage of goods are in the course of erection^ and when finished will much improve the appearance and utility of the premises ^ (which have for years lain in a most dilapidated condition), to a very considerable degree. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining suitable building material locally and also no doubt in order to carry on the work with as little financial strain upon himself as possible, progress cannot be as^ rapid as the Sultan would wish, but he is to be congratulated on the inception of a work of real public utility. The Steamer, N ut-u I-J^ahr^ late Richard Greek of 295 tons gross^ register which the Government of India lately purchased for His Highness baiyid Peisal, eADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL as mentioned earlier in this report, has been acquired by him primarily for use in facilitating the Customs Administration of his smaller Oman ports and will, it is hoped, serve its purpose and indirectly recoup its owner for its cost and upkeep. It is at present undergoing alterations in the Government Dockyard at Bombay, but is shortly expected at Maskat. Apart, however, from questions of revenue, the power which the possession of the vessel will put in the Sultan's hands, and which he does not now possess, of appearing at short notice, and with force at his back, at any given point on the coast line and consequently in the hinterland, of his territory, should prove of very material assistance to him in keeping a tight hand upon his more distant possessions. Arms Trade. 12. There has been a further decline in this trade, the value of which is about 1,70,000 dollars less than that of last year and 50 per cent, less than it was in 1897-1898. The foundering of Messrs. Bucknall's ' Cam ' en route to Maskat contri buted to some extent to this result but a similar catastrophe occurred last year in the case of the ' Basuto' so it must be presumed that the decline in the imports represents a falling off in the demand. It may also be in a measure due to the fact that British merchants have for one reason or another been less energetic in this branch of trade; and it was noticed too that probably by reason of the scarcity of money in Persia owing to drought, fewer persons than usual hailing from Persian territory appeared at Maskat. In this connection it is to be noted that while the value of arms imported from the United Kingdom has decreased 40 per cent., that from Marseilles or other foreign ports has increased 30 per cent., which means that the trade is quickly passing into the hands of persons over whose operations we can exercise no check or supervision. The reception of the arms on arrival accentuates this aspect of the question, as the following figures will show. Of the total number of cases of arras and ammunition landed at Maskat during the course of the year 22 per cent, were taken delivery of by British subjects, 10J per cent, by Arab subjects and 67^ per cent, by foreign subjects. Other details of the trade are furnished in the separate Trade Heport. Health- 13- Maskat has been quite free from epidemic disease of any sort and this must be regarded as a matter for much congratulation, considering its proximity to Karachi and Bombay by sea. The duties of Health Officer continue to be per formed for the Sultan by the Agency Surgeon, and without the slightest friction. Slave Trade. 14. Owing to His Majesty's Ships being employed elsewhere there was no slave cruising during the recognised slave running seasons, and no dhows were captured in these waters, but if any contirmation were wanted to the reports of this Agency as to the lively survival of the traffic it is furnished by the i olio wing items of information which came to hand during the current year. («) In January 1902 the Portuguese authorities at Mozambique having been informed that several Arab dhows had entered the small rivers in the Angoche district for the purpose of capturing slaves, the Governor-General of Mozambique organised an expedition v composed of 180 men, detached from Portuguese men-of-war in those seas and proceeded to a spot where the slave dealers were leported to have constructed a fortified position for themselves. After a severe conflict two dhows were captured and two burnt and a number of the Arabs are believed to have been killed. It -i\ a 1S - nC ^ known how many slaves were released. ( ) &amp; ain in Maich 1902 further information of a similar nature having reached the local authorities the Portuguese cruiser San Rafael en ered the Port of Simoco in the same neighbourhood and ere, alter a sharp fight, captured a slaving fleet of 12 Arab clnows, liberating 725 slaves and making prisoners of about 150 of e Aiab slave runners. The Arabs are still in confinement awamng trial; but meanwhile it is known from the statements of individuals who were present and escaped capture and have since itturned to Sur that most if not all the Arabs were Oman subjects and hailed from Sur and the vicinity, fw ^r^5 0in £ incidents seem^ to constitute sufficiently incontrovertible c Ye rumnn S flourishes in an organised form and on a large scalePersons tii W l eesidency and maskat political agency for the year 1902-1903. and that the port of Sur continues to be, as it has been for many generations the distributing centre for these waters. ® traiions, Of individual fugitive slaves 66 have taken refuge at this Consulate during the year, out of which number 64 have been given manumission papers with the concurrence of the Local Government. 1 1 15 The cable rates from Maskat to India and elsewhere were reduced from 1st June 1902 m spite of which reduction the receipts at the Maskat office have averaged over £900 monthly. 16. It having been decided that under the conditions at present holding; in Maskat it was desirable xor the Agency Surgeon to live near the Consulate and not m Muttra, as had for many years been the custom, and fresh accommoda tion being also required for the Consular Staff and Officials of the Telegraph Department, the Government of India permitted the Political Agent to pmchase the premises of Huttonsie Purshotam, adjoining the British Consulate and during the present year plans and estimates for the building of suitable residential quarters for the Agency Surgeon and Consular and Telegraph Staff on the site in question have been sanctioned and it is hoped that the next year will see them completed. 17. Maskat was visited during the year by His Majesty's ships Redbreast, Ponwne, Sphinx, A.niphitfite, Lapwing, CossacJc, A^ssaye, Fox, Renown, and P erseus and by the Eoyal Indian Marine Steamers Investigator and Lawrence. Foreign Navies were represented as under:— R ussian.— Askold and Boyarin, French.— Friant and Infer net. United States or America.— Isla de Luzon. 18. Captain J. W. Grant, I.M.S. proceeded on furlough and handed over his duties to Captain W. Lethbridge, I.M S., on 14th March 1903. Monsieur R. Laronce, Yice-Consul for France, left for Europe on 14th March 1903 and was relieved by Monsieur C. Dorville. 19.^ Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., arrived at Maskat on 30th March in the R.

II imADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL TEADE REPORT FOR MASKAT, 1902-1903. The total value of trade for tlie year according to the figures furnished hv His Highness's Customs is returned at 5,711,950 dollars, as against 4^637,764 dollars of last year; shewing an increase of 1,074,186 dollars. This amount represents an increment of 208,747 dollars in the export side and 865,439 dollars on the imports. The items chiefly contributing to this result are:— Coffee. The increase in coffee imported represents a greater capacity for the Bedouin to buy with the proceeds of his dates, the export of which was above the normal owing to a poor season further north. Sugar.—\i will be noted that the importation of sugar is nearly double the normal figure. The explanation is that large quantities of Austrian sugar were imported vict Bombay with a view to re-export to India tlnough the ^ati've State Ports the enhanced duty being thereby evaded. The Customs authorities concerned were however, by arrangement, apprized of the destination of all craft clearing with such sugar for Indian ports, and duty was presumably levied in due course. Specie. —Eor the last two years there has been a large increase both in the import and export of specie. The reason for this is that the rupee value of the dollar in Masqat does not, from local causes, always correspond with the current Bombay rate, and is constantly fluctuating. When therefore Maskat mer chants can buy dollars cheaper in Maskat than in Bombay they export largely to Bombay, keep in bond and re-export at Bombay rates to foreign ports where there is a demand for them. In the same way when they are dear in Maskat they import from Bombay. This exchange speculation is facilitated by the cable communication which now exists. Two years ago there was a disposition to smuggle dollars into India via Kattiawar ports with the same motive, but the attention of Government was drawn to this traffic and it is believed to have since ceased. During the year the dollar exchange has fluctuated between E139 and R112 per hundred dollars although the actual silver value of 100 dollars is R125. Dates. —There was a considerable increase in the export to India due, it is believed, to the dearth of the article in Persia and Turkish Arabia. Limes. —There was a large export to Persia owing to the abnormal scar city of the fruit in Persia itself, where it is understood to be extensively used for dyeing purposes. Other items seem to call for no special remark. P. Z. COX. Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul and ^Political Agent, Maskat.20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL P art III.—REPORT ON THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OE THE PERSIAN GULE FOR 1902 BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL C. A. KEM^ALL, C.I.E., HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S CONSUL GENERAL, BUSHIRE. General. —The depression of trade noticed in the last year's Report became more pronounced during the year under review owing to the serious failure of the crops, and operations in all the chief articles, both of import and export, proved unremunerative, not to say ruinous in some instances. But fortunately the timely and abundant rains which fell at the close of the year materially improved the prospects, and the splendid condition of the crops throughout Persia promises a good harvest. There is thus every hope of the trade assuming its normal proportions in the ensuing year. It may, however, be useful to point out that the long credit system largely resorted to by some of the chief British importing firms, constitutes an unsatis factory feature in the Persian trade owing to the absence of any honest legal machinery for bringing the defaulting native customers to justice. Imports. —The imports into Bushire exclusive of specie declined by nearly Rs. 80,07,000, as compared with the previous year; while those into Lingah improved by about Rs. 14,94,000, due to large importation of pearls from the Arab Coast. Exports. —The exports from Bushire declined by about Rs. 30,75,000, while those from Lingah record an increase of Rs. 33,69,000, due also to the large exportation of pearls. The failure of the crops was more marked than in the previous year, resulting in the importation of large quantities of food-grain and flour from India. Exchange. —The highest point reached in the Sterling Exchange was in November last, when the price was 59J Krans for £ sterling. The lowest was in January preceding, when the Imperial Bank of Persia quoted 54i Krans. The average for the three years works out at 574 Krans. The highest rupee exchange was 397 Krans per Rs. 100 in October last, and the lowest in January preceding, viz., 364^ Krans per Rs. 100. Mule Hire. —Transport has throughout the year been maintained at a high level, and at no time has less than Krans 80 per 100 maunds of lbs. 7*75 been possible. This rate too could only be secured by agreeing to a delivery date of 50 days to Shiraz. The dear prices of fodder, combined with the transport of the material for the new telegraph line, have contributed to the maintenance of this high rate. As the year closes, the rates are rapidly rising owing to an improvement in the Shiraz markets. Freights. —Freights to London for the first three months of the year were fairly steady at about 20 shillings, but during the date season fell to 14 shillings, owing to keen competition brought about by a third British line having com menced to run direct steamers to the Gulf. At the close of the year the freights again recovered, owing to steamers of all the three lines having been diverted to India on their return voyage to load, opportunities for shipment having become infrequent. t kk Shippinghundred and thirty-eight steamers with a tonnage of loo, 392 entered the port of Bushire, showing an increase of 26 steamers of the tonnage oi 2o,ll J, as compared with the previous year of total number entered, 133 were British with a tonnage of 148,229, 1 Austaan of 1,280 tons, 1 Turkish of 1,613 tons, and 3 Russian of 4,270 tons, i ie increase of 26 steamers over the previous year is due to a third British line having appeared on the field., \ I EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1902-1903. 91 The number of steamers which cleared from Bushire was 121 with a tonnage of 1,39,062, or an increase of 10 steamers of 6,708 tons, which is all British. Of the total number cleared, only 4 steamers of 5,979 tons belonged to other nationalities, viz., 3 Russian of 4,270 tons, and 1 Turkish of 1,613 tons. C. A.

The considerable decline in the figures for some of the principal articles of trade may be explained by the insecurity of the caravan routes to A1 Hassa and Nejd throughout the last quarter of 1901 and the following five months during which period ail trade between Bahrein and those districts was stopped ' Cotton piece -goods were seriously affected, and the local market was overstocked owinj* to the merchants holding over a large number of bales which were imnortpd the latter end of 1901 for the A1 Hassa trade. impoited at The improvement in the condition of the islanders and the influx of Persian settlers during the past two years are creating a demand for a better class of prints, woollen cloths, cheap velvets and silks. Gold thread and lace of conti nental manufacture of medium qualities are in demand. The trade in coffee shows a decided increase notwithstanding the unfavour able conditions prevailing in the A1 Hassa district during the past year. The improvement is due to the cheap Brazilian coffee imported, which has brouo-ht the article within the reach of the poorer classes. With the fall in price a larger consumption on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf may be anticipated, and British firms are recommended to turn their attention to the possibilities of the commodity. The pearling operations were a success as far as the divers were concerned. But the same cannot be said of the dealers who have suffered losses from 15 to 20 per cent, on their transactions. The quantity obtained was less than the preceding season by about 8 per cent., and keen competition between the dealers drove up prices 30 per cent. It is not expected, however, that the losses experienced by the dealers will seriously affect the general trade for the current year, owing to the fact that the high prices received by the divers for their pearls have improved their spending powers. The shell transactions show a large fall. This is due to a large quantity of shells having been taken by sailing craft direct to Bushire, which offered better facilities for shipment to Europe, and for want of transport about 600 tons remained in stock at the close of the year. The advantages of this trade, as well as of the general business to be done in Bahrein, appears to be better appreciated by foreign trading houses than British merchants. The Erench firm of M. M. Dumas and Guien of Marseilles has recently opened a branch office. It is hoped that some energetic British firm will realise the importance of this growing trade and will endeavour to obtain a share in it before it is too late. The stability of the Indian rupee is being appreciated by the Arabs, and the circulation of the Maria Theresa dollar consequently is decreasing. Large profits on the latter coin can no longer be made. The exchange in the two coins closely followed the Bombay market prices plus freight and interest. At the end of the year the dollar stood at Rs. 120 per 100. Exchange transactions with Europe are arranged principally through Bombay Banking houses and in some instances through Bushire, the^ rates are, therefore, much higher than those obtaining at ports where Banks icxist. The building of a stone pier is under consideration, and when it is completed, the shipping will have little cause to complain about the arrangements for dis charging their cargoes. To meet recurring expenditure^ required for the up keep of the pier, fees will be charged on all exports and imports. Steamers for Europe will generally be able to obtain shells when calling here for cargo in the last quarter of the year, at rates 10 shillings in advance of those offering at Bushire. Also at about the same season dates for the Red Sea ports are obtainable. j, CAI jc ott gaskin, Assistant Folitioal Agent.

In addition to the steamers of Bucknall's lines and the Anglo-Arabian Company, those of the West Hartlepool Company also called. The two com panies running from Bombay called regularly. Freights to London ranged from 18 to 11 per scale ton. Eiver. —The one river steamer ran fortnightly to Bunder Nasri (Ahwaz). The S.S. Shnshan crossed the rapids early in March and resumed running on the Upper Karun. Eiver Trade. The river trade, especially by steamer, consists largely of shipments on through Bills of Lading to and from Ahwaz and Shuster from and to Europe and India transhipped at Mohammerah. There was considerable delay to such cargo during the latter part of the year owing to the Customs claiming to collect the duty at Mohammerah. A Customs house has now been re-opened at Ahwaz, and is to be at Shuster also. Caravan Eoutes. Ahwaz and Ispahan. —There was a considerable increase in traffic by the Ahwaz-Ispahan route, which shows a considerable saving in time against the Bushire-Ispahan route. The road is, however, blocked by snow for about four months in winter. Dizful and Khoremabad.—ThQ Lizful-Khoremabad route was closed owing to the lawlessness of the tribes, even the post for places outside the Province being now sent via Bushire. Shuster and JDizful. —The road between Shuster and Dizful was insecure at times owing to raids principally by Arabs from the Turkish border, on one occasion the S.S. Shushan was attacked near Shuster by a gang of such raiders. Agriculture. Wheat. —The wheat crop was very small owing to scarcity of seed, and the surplus was retained in the grain districts. The prospects for next harvest are good, a large area having been sown, and rains having been good. Prices ranged from 28s. Qd. to 22s. 10 (i. per maund of 3J cwts. Dates - -The dates crop was large, about the same as last year; but some varieties suffered from continued dry winds and dust. Prices range rom 6s. id to. 4s. per maund of 1J cwts. _ W.

Expectations of famine in this part of the country were fully realised during 1902, and the result was a great increase in the amount of grain imported (most of which came from Karachi), and a decrease in the importa tion of other articles, notably ' wearing apparel ' and 44 piece-goods ' owing to lack of demand. There was a considerable decrease in exports owing to the effect produced by the drought on rates of transport. The prospects for the ensuing year are however, very good, the rainfall having been above the average. During 1902, the duty on ' planks and beams ' was removed, and, in consequence of this, a considerable number were brought in, chiefly from Zanzibar. 2. The want of a bank in Bunder Abbas is much felt. There has been some talk of the Imperial Bank opening a branch here, but nothing has been done as yet. There is an opening for trade in sulphur, which at present is exported only by the Agent of the Russian Steamship Company. Correspondence has been opened on this subject with one or two Indian firms. Something might also be done with regard to direct export of carpets t 0 Europe ; at present there is none. Brir iS h take d 0f • 3 * Enou ° h care is not sllown in dealing with the Persians. The extreme 1 is traders, difficulty in getting debts recovered should make foreigners more careful than ever in their transactions. 4. Progress or decline of rivals. 2. Opening for British trade. 5. Difficulties in the way of trade. 6. Communica tion between traders and Consular Officer. 7. Legislative and Tariflf Regu lations. 8. Shipping and Transport, etc. 4. Export to Black Sea ports by the Anglo-Arabian Steamship Company has received a check during the year, owing (1) to the lower rate of freight ollered by the direct line of the Russian Company, and (2) to facility given 0 by Russian Customs regarding goods forwarded by their steamers. 5. The difficulty of getting debts recovered has already been alluded to. Thefts from cargo boats and from goods already delivered to the Customs were of common occurrence during the greater part of the year, and in most cases the drcumstances rendered it difficult to trace the offender and consequently difficult to obtain redress. Arrangements have now been made which, it is hoped, will do away with this nuisance. For nearly haif the year no European was in charge of the Customs at Bunder Abbas. It would seem advisable that, whenever possible, local Agents of British Companies and landing contractors should be British subjects. The Consular iniluence over them would probably be greater. 6. No remarks appear to be required on this head. 7. Five per cent, ad valorem customs duties were levied throughout the year, a new tariff having been introduced from 14th February 1903. 8. Steamers of the following companies call at Bunder Abbas. B. I. S, N. Co., (Mails) call weekly Anglo-Arabian S. N. Co. (Messrs. Strick Ss Co., London) Bucknall Bros. ... Persian S. N.

Y ezd and Kerman throughout the year were rerv lii'h owins to the drought, which prevented many animals from coming down.P0t l% EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903 The rates to Yezd fluctuated between Tomans 60 {Us 150 or iilO) and Tomans 36 (£6 or Es. 90) per load of MOOR), and those to Kerman between Tomans 22 (£3-13-4 or Ks. 55) and Tomans 18 (£3 or Rs. 45) per load of 700ib The routes were unsafe as usual, particularly during the earlier part of the year, when some serious robberies were committed. The Kerman post is fre quently looted. 9 Specie to the amount of Rs . 70,730 was imported during the year, chiefly 9. specie and from India; and Ks. 1,86,900 was exported chiefly to Persian ports. Exchange. The rate of Krans per rupee rose gradually from 3^ to 4. The latter rate is 60 to £1 sterling. 10. The climate of Bunder Abbas is proverbially bad, malaria boing - moreio. Health, or less prevalent throughout the year, to which not only foreigners but natives also are to some extent subject. October to December (inclusive) and July are probably the worst months, and January to March the least unhealthy. 11. The want of telegraphic communication is badly felt, and should then. Telegraph, cable be extended to Bunder Abbas from Jask, the effect would be excellent in many ways. (Sd.) W. G.
