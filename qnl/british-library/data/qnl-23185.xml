Sir Trenchard has been considering for some time the desirability of shifting the responsibility of these funds on to the Bahrain Government.

Sir Trenchard mentioned this to me on one of his visits here, and I said then that unless it involves a great deal of work for the Residency office I should advise leaving things as they stand. Particularly at the present juncture I consider it to be undesirable to make any alterations involving changes in Belgrave's and de Grenier’s contracts, and as I read them such alterations would be necessary.

The majority of the papers are receipts, covering letters, and letters of acknowledgement relating to payments made into the trust fund account by the Government of Bahrain. This correspondence is between the Political Agency in Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Charles Belgrave, and the Eastern Bank in London, where the trust fund account was held. By the end of the file a proposal is made to transfer responsibility for the accounts to the Government of Bahrain.Inserted near the back of the file (folios 234-245) are letters (in Farsi and Gujarati, respectively) from merchants Abduljalil and Abdullatiff, and Bhagwandas Askarandas. The letters concern the trade of commodities such as textiles and dates. The papers are not connected to the rest of the file and were probably inserted by mistake.Folios 254-264 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Trust funds</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Dalrymple Belgrave</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00037f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
