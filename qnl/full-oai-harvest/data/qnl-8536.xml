The file chiefly comprises extracts of intelligence summaries and various diaries (consular, political, confidential) from a number of British officials in the region: the British Consul at Khorasan, Clive Kirkpatrick Daly; the Baluchistan Agency; the British Legation at Tehran. The file covers: intelligence reports on the activities of individuals and tribes in the border region, including Sardar Juma Khan, leader of the Ismailzai tribe; reports of robberies, raids and border infractions; correspondence exchanged between British officials in Persia and the Government of India, dated 1939 and 1940, in response to the beginning of the Second World War, and a perceived ‘weakness of the military situation’ reported by the Political Agent at Chagai, making the region prone to attack from hostile forces through Persia and Afghanistan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Baluchistan Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Occupied territories</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Chagai</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indigenous populations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00002a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
