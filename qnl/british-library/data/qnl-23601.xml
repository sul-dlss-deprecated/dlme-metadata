U — V- i%u /-// ^ o *&gt; Dear Sir, I have reoeived your letter dated the 17th oeptemher 1928 in which you ask for information in connection with your contemplated visit to Kuwait and Bahrain and to Hafuf. The British India Steam Navagition Company's steamers call at Kuwait and Bahrain from Basrah on the same trip every fortnight, so if you wish to spend a day or two at Kuwait it would 'be advisable to motor from Basrah to Kuwait a few days 'before the steamer which takes you to Bahrain calls at Kuwait. At Bahrain you would have to wait for a fortnight before the next steamer to India called. You could, however, avoid this hy taking a passage to Buahire hy a steamer going up to Basrah, and then catcty^he fast mail at Bushire for Karachi where it reaches within four days from Bushire. There is no objection to youfvisiting Bahrain &lt;&amp; Kuv/ait 'but it will 'be necessary to obtain the permission of His Majesty Ibn iaud King of Hedjaz to visit Hofuf. I am doubtful whether the present is a suitable time for Foreign Subjects to visit Hasa and I could not be responsible for British subjects doing so. Yours sincerely, Lieut-Colonel J .K.
