CG of 13TO&gt; From, The Political Agent, Khelat. To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier U pper Sind. Khelat, 20/^ August 1870. Sir, In continuation of my letter No, 55, of the 12th instant, T have the honor to report that Sirdar Meetah Khan, Shaook of Beyla, arrived on the IGth instant with about twenty followers, to pay his respects to His Highness. 2. On Wednesday Sirdar Meetah Khan visited me, and the information given by a man in his position may be considered of importance. 3. He stated that for generations past they had always looked upon the Khan of Khelat as their Sovereign, and the Jam, whoever he might be, as his representative. 4. That when His Highness took the Government of Beyla into his own hands, grain was at famine prices, but that the ample fall of rain this season, had relieved them of all anxiety, and that every one was looking forward to a good and plentiful harvest. 5. The behaviour of His Highness' Detachment was said to be most exemplary, and that they had not caused the slightest annoyance to any one. 6. Sirdar Meetah Khan stated that they were perfectly satisfied with the new Government, and that Ali Khan, Jumootee, a subordinate Chief, was the only discon tented person, but from want of sympathy and confidence in present arrangements, any efforts of his, against the Government, would be futile, 7. Other principal men from Beyla have expressed their intention of visiting His I have, &amp;c. C. W. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat.No. 1219 of 1870. P olitical D epartment. Jacobabad, 30th August 1870. 1. In submitting tViis letter, No. 66 dated !20th instant, trom Captain Harrison, tho Political Superintendent on the Frontier is not sufficiently acquainted with the local history of Beyla to offer any remarks, except upon the general question involved in para. which is rather at variance with General Jacob's opinion, expressed in his letter No. 343 dated 21st June 1858, which says— * * » « The j am 0 f Beyla is the Sovereign Prince of that Province, he is a feuda- ' torv of the Khan of Khelat, to whom he owes allegiance, military service, and some ' trifling specific dues. ' The Jam, and his subordinate Chieftain, Oomed Ali, arc, as I have long since reported, ' in rebellion against the Khan of Khelat; but the Jam of Beyla has an undoubted right ' to levy any taxes he may think proper within his own territory, except transit dues on ' general merchandize passing through Beloochistan.' 2. The above is somewhat different from the position ascribed to the Jam m this letter, viz. ; that for generations, his subjects have looked upon the Khan as their SoA -ereign, and the Jam as merely his representative. R. PIT AY RE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Frontier Lpper Sind. No. 555 of 1870. P olitical Department. Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee, 6th September 1870. Submitted to Government in continuation of previous correspondence. 2 Had the Political Superintendent been better acquainted with the previous history of Kheiat, had he even taken tho trouble to study the best description of that country, its people, government, and customs, (Masson's) he would have found no difficulty in reconcding the circumstances slated by Captain Harrison, and what General Jacob wrote. 3 The term Sovereign Prince, in the literal sense of the first word, was not quite coi- rectly applied to the Jam of Beyla, for though, from the timo of the grandfather of Sirdar Meer Khan, the Jam of Beyla was allowed to exert almost supremo power over the province, and to levy taxes therein, he was ' a feudatory of the Khan of Khelat, did him ' military service,' and paid him ' some trifling specific dues,' as stated by General Jacob. He was not permitted to levy transit dues on general merchandize passing through Beloo chistan, those were only payable to the head of the whole country, the Khan of Khelat. The subjects of Beyla considered themselves also subjects of the supreme ruler, accom panying their immediate head, the Jam, when called on to do military service for the Sovereign. 4. There was nothing therefore so very far wrong in the statement of Sirdar Meetah Khan, W. L. MERE WETHER. Colonel, Commissioner in Sind. B B j 1!
