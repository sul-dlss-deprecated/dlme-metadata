The motifs include men and women from the court, banquet and hunting scenes, animals in combat, and fantastic creatures; some are placed in medallions to give them prominence.  One of the male figures in the lower left border of the right door is dressed in Portuguese clothing, demonstrating Iran's contact with Western cultures in the 17th century.\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1928", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/36351", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris;  Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1928, by purchase;   Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Qajar Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.317", "Creator": "Iranian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_67.634_Fnt_TR_T96III.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_67.634_Fnt_TR_T96III.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_67.634_Fnt_TR_T96III.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_67.634_Fnt_TR_T96III.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_67.634_Fnt_TR_T96III.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL1_67.634_Fnt_TR_T96III.jpg, PL7_67.634_DetA_TR_T96II-tms.jpg, PL7_67.634_DetB_TR_T96II-tms.jpg, PL7_67.634_DetC_TR_T96II-tms.jpg, PL7_67.634_DetD_TR_T96II-tms.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
