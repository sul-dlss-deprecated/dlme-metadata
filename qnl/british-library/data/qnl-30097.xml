P7 THE embassy has been asked urgently to bring to the attention of the Foreign Office the following observations of the State Department on recent developments in Persia :— The Government of the United States has, in the course of the past year, felt that it had an increasingly direct interest in Persian conditions. It is primarily because of the importance of Persia in the United Nations’ war effort, an importance which, it is felt, is given full recognition by the British Government, that the Government of the United States has been led to adopt this position. In common with all of the United Nations, the United States Government has a general interest in the successful conduct of the war in all theatres, but, in addition to this,dt has, for the reasons given immediately below, felt a special responsibility so far as Persia is concerned r f (1) It is believed that American prestige in Persia is such that it makes it possible for the United States Government to bring considerable influence to bear on the interests of the United Nations, and it is felt that an asset of such importance ought to be conserved and used. (2) With a view to strengthening the internal administration of Persia, the Government of Persia has asked for a considerable number of American advisers. The Government of the United States naturally feels obliged to see to it that these advisers can begin and carry on their work under conditions favourable to the success of their efforts. The British Government, it is understood, has been wffiole-heartedly in favour of the sending of these advisory missions to Persia. As a matter of fact, the British Government has on several occasions been the first to urge that such missions be organised. Obviously, such advisers are in a position to exert on behalf of the common cause a most effective influence. (3) Heavy commitments in connexion with furnishing the Soviet Union with supplies have been made by the Government of the United States, and, consequently, the United States Government is concerned in a direct way in maintaining the route over which, necessarily, a large part of these supplies must be carried. Furthermore, an agreement was recently reached under which the military authorities of the United States undertake the physical operation of the ports, railroads and highways of Persia by which supplies for the Soviet Union are handled and transported across Persia. On a number of occasions the Government of the United States has been given to understand that the interest in Persian affairs shown by the United States was welcomed by the British Government, and that it was desired that the United States actively co-operate in settling the questions arising from time to time. The Government of the United States feels certain that it is understood by the British Government that considerations of self-interest in no way motivate the policy of the United States, but that this policy is concerned only with the furtherance of the war effort of the United Nations and with the laying of the basis in Persia, as well as in the rest of the world, for satisfactory and lasting peace-time conditions. The Government of the United States has, with this in mind, as the British Government is aware, since the middle of October taken an active part in the negotiations and exchanges of view on the acute economic and political situation that has prevailed in Persia. The State Department has consistently maintained that the problem could be satisfactorily solved only if, in one way or another, adequate provision were made for the.minimum economic requirements for the people of Persia and Persian authority and responsibility in the internal affairs of Persia were maintained to the maximum possible extent. It has been the view [37—14] b2 of the State Department, quite apart from the obvious moral principles involved, principles to which the United Nations are pledged and to which the British Government subscribes without reservation, that considerations of a purely practical kind, in any event, would dictate that the civil responsibilities and the military forces of the Governments of the United Nations concerned ought to be held to a minimum in that country, so that the civilian personnel and these military forces could be employed in areas where, in the prosecution of the war, their services would be of the greatest immediate value. The State Department accordingly, in communications to the British Government and to the American Minister at Tehran concerning the crisis which started in October, expressed its wish repeatedly that adequate early arrangements be made for transporting supplies of wheat to Persia, which would serve to prevent famine from arising in those areas which were deficient in stocks of grain. The State Department, in taking this position, has recognised that the Government &lt; of Persia might be at fault in part at failing to take the steps necessary to ensure the best use of the food supplies that were available within Persia. It was felt, however, that the matter was so urgent that there was no time for prolonged discussions or for a reorganisation of those Persian agencies which were concerned. Moreover, it was felt that resort to coercion on the authorities of Persia would not only lead to many undesirable repercussions but probably also to failure to achieve the desired objective. The State Department gathered, from the exchange of communications which has taken place between London and Washington, that the Foreign Office took substantially the same view. It will be recalled by the Foreign Office that the State Department on more than one occasion expressed the view that the occupation of Tehran by military j forces, or the setting up of a puppet Government, would be undesirable. The State Department believed, in the light of views expressed by the Foreign Office to the American Embassy in London, and to the Department by the British Embassy at Washington, that the British Government was in agreement with this. Likewise, on a number of occasions the fear of the State Department was expressed ( that, unless handled with great care, action by the British authorities in Persia against subjects of Persia alleged to be implicated in activities inimical to the United Nations, would have unfortunate and serious repercussions. The State Department urged particularly that such matters be handled by the Persian authorities themselves. The American Embassy at London, it appears, understood that the Foreign Office also felt that caution should be employed, and that, in fact, the British Minister at Tehran had been telegraphed to that effect. It appears also to have been the understanding of the embassy that the Foreign Office hoped that it would not be necessary to proceed in this matter against the wishes of the Government of Persia. As the Foreign Office and the State Department were apparently in agreement with respect to the principal questions involved, the State Department notes regretfully that events which have taken place in recent weeks in Persia do not appear to have been entirely in keeping with the policies of the two Governments. The events in question, as reported to the State Department, are briefly :— (1) The signature and publication of the Anglo-American-Persian Agreement for Wheat for Persia, although recognised by all three Governments as urgent, was held up for a period of several weeks, largely, it appears, because the British authorities in Persia wanted successively to impose on the Government of Persia, before proceeding with the signing, more difficult conditions. It was only on the 4th December that the agreement, whatever the reason, was concluded, and by that time it failed to have the reassuring effect anticipated because popular dissatisfaction in Persia had become so great. (2) In spite of what was thought to be the view of the Foreign Office that , caution should be exercised with reference to the contemplated arrests I of prominent Persians, the Governor-General of Isfahan was interned by the British authorities in Persia on the 8th December. The State l Department understands that this was done without first consulting the Government of Persia and that a most unfortunate effect was produced. (3) On the 9th December the British Minister at Tehran informed the American Minister that on that same afternoon a battalion of British troops would enter Tehran. (4) On the 9th December the American Minister at Tehran reported that for some reason the British authorities in Persia had failed to arrange the transportation to Tehran of the 1,500 tons of flour and 3,500 tonsol barley earmarked at Basra for Persia. The British Minister, / likewise on the 9th December, advised the Shah that, unless the Government of Persia were favourable to the Allies, the importation I of wheat into Persia would not be viewed favourably. The same state ment, it is understood, was made by the British Minister to the Prime Minister of Persia. This attitude, of course, conflicts with the action which it was understood was previously taken by the Foreign Office ^ when it instructed the British Minister at Tehran and the Minister of State at Cairo to try to arrange the prompt shipment to Persia of wheat and barley from neighbouring sources, including Iraq. It is also in contrast with what was understood to be the view of the Foreign Office, that the extreme shortage of wheat, particularly in Tehran, was causing unrest and disorder. The foregoing, the State Department points out, is placed before the Foreign Office solely for the purpose of effecting closer co-ordination of action between the Governments of Great Britain and the United States and in the hope that % whatever is done in Persia will be entirely in keeping with the views maintained London^ and Washington. December 14, 1942. ( 2 ) Memorandum to the United States Embassy in London. rHE United States Embassy’s memorandum of the 14th December, communi eating the observations of the State Department on recent developments in Persia, has been considered in the Foreign Office with the greatest care and sympathy. It is believed that the policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Persia corresponds very closely with that of the United States Government. At the same time, it is felt that a full and frank exchange of views on this subject will be of great value, lest misunderstanding should arise on points such as those enumerated in the latter part of the memorandum under reply. 2. In the first place, the Foreign Office wish to confirm their entire agreement with the views expressed in the embassy's memorandum as regards the increasing importance of the United States Government’s interests in Persia. Indeed, the growing interest which the United States Government have shown in Persian affairs has been very welcome to His Majesty’s Government, who, as the State Department point out, took the lead in suggesting that United States advisers should be sent to Persia to strengthen the internal administration of the country. His Majesty’s Government therefore fully understand and share the anxiety of the United States Government that these advisers should be enabled to carry out their work under favourable conditions, and are confident that their work will prove of the greatest value in reorganising the finances of Persia and m putting the administration on a sound and efficient basis. His Majesty’s Government also recognise that the arrangement whereby the military authorities of the E nited states aie to take over the operation of Persian ports, railways and roads greatly increases the interest of the United States Government in the maintenance of law and order throughout the country. 3. .His Majesty’s Government also confirm that it has for long been their desire that the United States Government and the United States authorities in Persia should co-operate more actively in settling the questions arisino- from time to time. Until recently the task of maintaining the interests of the United Nations at Tehran has fallen almost exclusively on the British Legation It is hoped that it may henceforward be possible for the United States representative at Tehran to take an equally active part in helping to solve important problems of common concern to the Allied Governments; and it is believed that the task of the two legations may be greatly eased by the steadying influence which will be exercised on the Persian authorities through the United States advisers. 4. As the State Department are aware, it has been the poliev of His * Majesty’s Government not to occupy Tehran by military forces, but to allow the Persian Government to continue to administer the country with as little inter ference as possible. In order to encourage a spirit of collaboration in the Persian authorities, His Majesty’s Government took the initiative in the ne°-otiations which culminated last January in the signature of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of Alliance. By this treaty Persia acquired the status of a non-belligerent ally. This policy has on the whole been successful hitherto- the deoree of [37-14] ’ B 24 collaboration afforded by the Persian authorities has in general proved sufficient, but on three problems of major importance it has been necessary, in the interests of the United Nations’ war effort, to bring strong pressure to bear upon the Persian Government and to contemplate measures which have, as it appears, led the Persian Government to put forward complaints to the Government of the United States. 5. These three problems are: — (1) The provision of local currency for the United Nations’ forces in Persia: (2) The wheat problem; and (3) Security measures against Axis agents in Persia. 6. In the United States Embassy’s memorandum under reply, it is stated that considerations of self-interest in no way motivate the policy of the United States, but that this policy is concerned only with the furtherance of the war effort of the United Nations and with the laying of a basis for satisfactory and lasting peace-time conditions in Persia, as well as in the rest of the world. His Majesty’s Government readily accept this assurance, and they must request the United States Government in return to accept a corresponding assurance on their behalf. In dealing with the three problems mentioned above, and in all their dealings with the Persian authorities, His Majesty’s Government have not been moved in any way by considerations of self-interest, but have been concerned with the furtherance of the war effort of the United Nations. 7. The difficulties raised by the Persian Government in connexion with the supply of rials to the British forces in Persia were, in fact, difficulties which had to be surmounted by some means or other in the interests of the war effort. Without rials it would have been impossible for the Allied forces in Persia to pay for local purchases and local labour. It was absolutely essential that rials should be forthcoming. Otherwise, the Trans-Persian lines of communication for supplies of war material to the Soviet Union would have broken down. After difficult negotiations a solution appeared to have been reached through the conclusion of an Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement on the 26th May; and it was therefore all the more deplorable that the Persian authorities, despite the clear terms of this agreement, should again have sought only a few months later to withhold the necessary currency from the Allied forces. The State Depart ment are aware how, mainly as the result of the common front displayed on this occasion by the Allied representatives at Tehran, it proved possible to solve these difficulties without having recourse to forcible measures; and it may be hoped that, with the forthcoming arrival at Tehran of the United States Financial Mission, a further Persian threat to withhold the currency essential to the United Nations need no longer be apprehended. 8. Again, as regards the wheat problem, the policy of His Majesty’s Government has been directed solely towards furthering the essential war interests of the United Nations, with due regard also to the minimum require ments of the Persian people. It has been based upon two governing considerations. The first is that, quite apart from the shortage of shipping, the clearance capacity of Persian ports and transport routes is strictly limited, so that every ton of wheat imported into Persia for Persian consumption involves a reduction in the quantity of vital war supplies sent to the Soviet Union by the Trans-Persian routes. The second point is that Persia in normal times grows sufficient cereals for her own use, and the 1942 harvest is believed to have fallen very little short of a normal harvest, so that there must exist in the country sufficient stocks of cereals to last nearly until the harvest of 1943. It will be recalled that, during the period between the military operations in August 1941 and the summer of 1942, some 50,000 tons of wheat were imported from British and United States sources to satisfy in the exceptional circumstances then existing the needs of the Persian civil population. But the Persian Government, almost immediately after the harvest of 1942, complained that there was already a serious shortage and requested that further wheat should be imported for their use. It was evident that they were reluctant to take drastic and unpopular measures against hoarders, speculators and profiteers, and thought it easier to appeal to the Allies- to solve their difficulties for them by arranging further imports. This attitude was clearly inadmissible. It would have meant a reduction in the supplies sent across Persia to the Soviet Union, for reasons which could not have been justified to the Soviet Government. His Majesty’s Government agree that it is in itself desirable that steps should be taken to save the Persian 'people from want, but it is clearly necessary to insist upon the Persian authorities making the best use of the food supplies available within Persia; and the only wheat importsi 5 o w ich His Majesty s Government have hitherto agreed during the present season are the 25,000 tons of wheat which are being imported to replace the -Persian-grown cereals required by the Soviet occupying forces. • Jpecu 1 ity measures against Axis agents have also been the cause of serious dimculties with the Persian Government. For many years past German influence m i ersia has been very extensive, and it was largely owing to the ^presence of Germans and German agents in kev positions throughout the country ~tnat it became necessary for British and Soviet forces to undertake the military -wcupation of certain areas in August 1941. At the present moment there are still some Germans in hiding in the unoccupied districts of Persia, there are still German agents who are active throughout the country, and there is still a considerable amount of pro-German sympathy in influential Persian circles. His Majesty s Government regard it as absolutely essential to take such steps against German agents as may be required to safeguard the Allied troops and communica tions m Persia. Some Germans and some German agents have already been arrested; others have been allowed to escape by the Persian police or are said to be untraceable. ^ But proof has been obtained of a widespread conspiracy organised by the Germans with the help of a number of influential Persians, involving definite plans for sabotage against Allied communications, and risings against the Allies in the event of a German invasion of Persia. It is clear that drastic action is justifiable and necessary against those implicated in such matters, though such action has hitherto been confined to a minimum. i The foregoing general observations are intended to cover the main aspects of British and United States policy in Persia, and although emphasis has naturally been laid upon these points which have caused most difficulty, and on which differences of outlook are most likely to arise, the Foreign Office believe that on the whole the views of the two Governments are very closely in agree ment as regards the major issues. There remain the four questions referred to at the end of the United States Embassy’s memorandum under reply. (1) It is true that the signature of the Anglo-United States-Persian agree ment for wheat was delayed because it was desired to ensure, in connexion with the Wheat Agreement, a satisfactory long-term settlement of the currency dispute. As stated above, rials are absolutely essential for the United Nations'’ forces in Persia. His Majesty’s Government felt therefore that it was essential to insist on some new currency arrangement, whereby the Majlis would no longer create difficulties on every occasion when they were asked to provide the necessary rials. As soon as a satisfactory solution on these lines was reached there was, so far as His Majesty’s Government are aware, no further question of delaying the signature of the Wheat Agreement in order to impose on the Persian Govern ment more difficult conditions. And, as distinct from the agreement, His Majesty’s Government have at all times, and irrespective of their disputes with , the Persian Government, sought to accelerate the despatch of the wheat which was urgently needed owing, primarily, to the Soviet requisitions in Northern Persia. (2) General Zahidi, the Governor-General of Isfahan, was arrested because he was implicated in the serious conspiracy referred to above. Careful consideration was first given to the question whether the Persian Government should be consulted in advance, but it was decided that to adopt this course would involve the risk of leakage, and would, in addition, be most embarrassing to the Persian Government themselves. The information at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government indicates that the effect locally of General Zahidi’s arrest has been very salutary. (3) The sole reason for the despatch of a battalion of British troops to Tehran during the recent rioting was to protect Allied property and military stores. (4) The Foreign Office were surprised by these reports from the United ; States Minister at Tehran, which implied that the despatch of certain consign ments of food-stuffs to Tehran was being delayed by the British authorities for political reasons. This, as in the case of the wheat shipments, would certainly have been opposed to the views and intentions of His Majesty’s Government. They therefore telegraphed to Sir Reader Bullard, who has explained that there is, of course, no foundation whatever for any suggestion that the despatch of this flour and barley to Persia had been deliberately delayed in order to put | pressure on the Persian Government. On the contrary, the British Legation I had done everything possible to hasten its despatch. (Such delay as occurred seems, in fact, to have been due partly to an unexpected fall in the level of theKarim river while the barges conveying the grain were on their way to Ahwaz, but mainly to the physical difficulty of moving it from Shaiba to Margil, thence by water to Ahwaz, and thence by rail to Tehran.) Nor did Sir Reader Bullard speak to the Shah or the Persian Prime Minister on the lines mentioned, or threaten them in any way with the possibility that supplies already arrangec might be withheld. It is hoped that it may be made clear to the United States Minister at Tehran that he has been misinformed on these points. , Foreign Office, January 4, 1943.Tt.7: @ under Secretary of State ^ Foreign Affairs R L£_QQPV , ,rp L ’ EXT ] P i; n &lt;■• n With the Compliments of the Under Secretary of St« ^ ^ „s £sste&gt; f ess *4- . /. i942 [CYPHER], i'V r- mPT i l i - ^flVlMEfo FROM W^HINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICE |^ TE D EP^RTMEHT/iL No, 2, Viscount Halifax No: 4678 September 16th, 1942.

I trust this will not happen as I should deprecate the introduction of second system of training into an air force which is equipped with British material and depends upon a British factory organisation for its repair and maintenance. Further we have already inaugurated scheme for training of Persian air force pilots in Tehran with some of our own and this is working happily. I have ventured to speak in this sense to my United States colleague. [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong]. tlrS'L h/'C . 1 £Cd.

[Copies sent to Mr. Jittnstrongj,of t hpx With th® Compliment*.*''it- /?. tt /Z^/ M-P IfciAU6 194-2 Dear Matthews, Many thanks for your letter of the 28th July, informing us of the State Department’s proposal to send a United States representative to Persia in the immediate future to collaborate with the Persian and British authorities in directing the distribution of all civilian supplies sent to Persia from the United States as a result of Persian Government orders or requisitions for Lend-Lease aid made by or on behalf of Persia* This proposal is very welcome to us. There is undoubtedly need for closer Anglo-United States cooperation in this field, and the appointment of a United States representative who will concern himself in questions of supply distribution in Persia should fill a long-felt want. Indeed, I may remind you of the contents of my letter of the 26th March last, in which I emphasised the importance which we attached to the principle of Anglo-United States co-operation in Persian questions, and went on to explain our hope that United States experts might be sent to help the Persian Government in revenue and finance work and in the distribution of imported supplies. This problem of the distribution of supplies imported into Persia is by no means an easy one. The/ Mr. H. Freeman Matthews, United States Embassy, 1, Grosvenor Square, W.l. Cis&lt;? /L eSc ^ ^The most important supplies which the Allies have had to send to Persia during recent months are, in the first place, wheat, and secondly, lorries and tyres* ihe distribution of imported wheat, lorries and tyres has been giving rise to great difficulties, largely because,.in spite of the serious shortage of these commodities throughout Persia, the Persian G-overnment have hitherto been unwilling to take adequate measures of control. As regards the wheat situation, for example, the lo.st Persian Government failed to take proper measures to prevent hoarding and speculation. It was so much easier, from their point of view, to come to the Allies with a request that they would import still more wheat, as the solution of all their troubles, than to take drastic action to control the crops grown in the country, to ensure that the stocks available are properly used for feeding the civil population instead of being hoarded, and to take vigorous proceedings against the machinations of corrupt but influential officials, merchants and landowners. Similarly, as regards transport, the Persian Government have taken no steps to control the lorries in private ownership. Instead of being used for vital civilian needs, many-of them are still carrying unessential loads. The lorry-owner often finds that he can charge more for the transport of luxury loads. Again, many of the lorries in the country are held up for lack of tyres, of which there is a great shortage. Nevertheless, the Persian authorities have not taken sufficient steps to control the distribution of imported tyres, and prevent the activities of speculators and profiteers. The result is that tyres sent to the Persian Government have a habit of finding their way on to the black market. It/It is therefore good news that the State Department are now sending out an expert in the distribution of supplies, and we note with satisfaction that the United States Government also hope to send a food and supply adviser to Persia within the next few weeks. The introduction of efficient arrangements for supply distribution in Persia, as a result of the efforts of the United States and British representatives in that country will not only have a good effect upon the local economic and political situation but will also facilitate the despatch of larger quantities of supplies to the Soviet Union by the Trans-Persian route. t You suggest also that, in making shipments to the Persian Government, it may in some cases be desirable to name a consignee other than the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. We had ourselves been considering this point, about which there has been a good deal of discussion recently in Washington. I am told that it was recently agreed there that tyres from the United States might be consigned to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation on the understanding that United States interests would be properly represented on whatever body was responsible for supervising the distribution of the tyres. Meanwhile, discussion between the United States and British Ministers at Tehran, and Sir Frank Nixon of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation who has been visiting Persia, has resulted in the conclusion that Persian civilian motor transport, not hired by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, should be controlled by a body representing United States, British and Persian interests* The functions of this body would include the control of the distribution of tyres. We have informed Sir Reader Bullard that this proposal is acceptable to us, and it is one which would appear/appear to meet the State Department’s wish to share in the control of the distribution of tyres. '■S We are grateful to the State Department for their offer to discuss with us the instructions to he given to their expert on the distribution of supplies. We feel that the details can best be left to Mr. Dreyfus and Sir Reader Bullard to settle on the spot. In general, the instructions will, we hope, be to co-operate as closely as possible with the British authorities in Persia, and to do everything practicable to ensure that the supplies imported by the Allies for Persian civilian consumption shall be used to the best advantage; the United States representative will doubtless be reminded how important it is that the. largest possible percentage of the available shipping, space and transport shall be reserved for supplies going across Persia to the Soviet Union, and he will appreciate that this involves the restriction of imported Persian civilian supplies to the absolute minimum. We are glad to note that the proposed appointment would not involve any modification of existing arrangements whereby Persian import requests are considered in the first place by the Central Supplies Committee at Tehran and are forwarded through the Middle Bast Supply Centre. We assume from this that, if Mr. Dreyfus and Sir Reader Bullard consider that it would be helpful for the United States .representative to serve on the Central Supplies Committee or any sub committee of the Central Supplies Committee, that may be set up to deal with special problems of supply and distribution, the United States Government would see no objection. I need hardly add that if the United.States representative passes through London on his way to Persia, /xelT^graph. Setftion, Coloiri^l Office.

Two able American advisers in that Ministry would be invaluable and once established they could probably persuade their Government to lend additional personnel if required and could secure experienced assistants to supervise rationing system, I will continue to press the Persian Government to ask for two such advisers.

Minister for War is in favour of an American Mission but there is much opposition including I believe the Shah, It would be unfortunate if the Persian Govern ment Asked for a Military Mission only for it to be refused (as my United States colleague believes it would be) by the United States Government.

They have also asked for two agricultural experts. United States Government are trying to find good men for these jobs. 2 . Embassy add that so far no request has been received ^for finance and supply advisers, but that State Department are prepared to consider such requests sympathetically. 5. I am not sure whether Persians can be expected to engage these latter advisers and also a United States military mission, in addition to advisers mentioned in paragraph 1 . If not, we must decide which is the more important. We attach considerable importance to the reorganisation of the Persian^ Army, but United States are now to provide one Army officer lor this purpose, and may be reluctant to provide more. Do you think'it essential that there should be more advisers for the Army ? If so, you may do what you can to induce the Persian Government to apply to Washington, and I leave it to your discretion whether you should say anything more about finance and supply advisers at present stage.

I think I had better start by explaining the position with regard to tha proposal that United states advisers and relief workers cdLidit be engaged by the Persian Oovcmioent to help there in revenue and finance work, and in the distribution of imported supplies. This suggestion was put forward sor?e weeks ago by our Minister at Tehran on his own initiative to U Freemen Matthews, United States nib assy, /thethe Persian Prime Hinister and Minister i‘or Fbreign sfThira, and air Header Bullard telegraphed on the 5th February that hie suggestion eeemeu to hare been receiv d with favour. Bullard hoped that his suggestion would be approved by His Hejesty’s Ceverment and he expressed the view that its adoptio • wouiu hel to solve any difficulties. Mr. &amp;d©n replied to Bullard th- t he wsa entirely in favour of the suggestion. Inetruetions were also sent to Lord Halifax in Washington to inform the State department of the position and to add that if the seraian Government decided to as&gt; for the loa^; of United states advisers and relief workers* we noped that the State Department would feel able to co ply with the request. We expressed the view tiv t effieient United States personnel could undoubtedly afford very valuable assistance to araia &amp;t the present time. ^e havi not heard that the , ereian Govern; ent have decided to follow up this suggestion by asking the United States Govern ent for their assistance in engaging United States euvis^rs or relief workers. /k1542 A further telegram i* therefore now being sent to Bullard to ask him how the matter stands. The reply should show whether or not the Persian Gowerrv ent are likely to follow up the suggestion which Bullard put ts them early in February. e are glad to note th&amp;t the State ^ apartment are prepared to piv© careful anti aynpathetic consideration to suggestions on these lines. There ie no doubt in our opinion that, if the Persian Gowemaent should in fact decide to request the United States GoTemnent to assist them in this matter, it would be to the advantage not only of Persia, but also of the Allied cause as a whole, that the Persian request should be met by the despatch or suitable United States adviser© and officials. The presence of these 8nitec States nationals in Persia sue thz assistance which they would render to the Persian Government would tend to strengthen the position of the Persian administration, and this, as the State Department rightly point out, ia mmt desirable at the present juncture. The influence of United itates advisers would certainly hel*, to /encourage© «necwra$t efficient end honest elementa in the ereien ttdrsinictpati ?n* Hie State Apartment here expressed their fears lest the work of United States advisers and relief workers should be hampered by the incompetence or corruption of so*se £ersian officials. Th; t is admittedly a contingency that aay arise* and it la largely beeauee Persian officials are unfortunately not ell as honest or as efficient as they inieht be* that United States advisers are so urgently needed* The task of United States advisers ana relief workers will not be an easy one, and the State Department will no doubt do well to obtain in advance the most explicit assurances fraa the Persian Govern rent that effect will in practice be given to the recormnendstions of United tates personnel ^ent to Persia* end that their won will not In an, we, be obstructed. W# should of coarse be prepared to authorise Sir eader Bullard to give full support to action by his United States colleague in the event of theie undertakings not being properly carried out. /asAs r#g**te the State jeparti^ant* s further suggestion, that the United States and British Ministers at Tehran might he instructed to cooperate, in such manner as right be proper, with the aim of encouraging the assumption of high posts by Persians of tested integrity and competence, our view is that it will be necessary to proceed in auc questions with considerable caution, The dtate Ihrpartoent will, I am sure, agree that it would not be desirable for the United otates and British representatives at Tehran to incur resentment by promoting the interests .it certain personalities whose appointment to important posts right be particularly acceptable to ourselves, but perhaps less eeeeptabls to Persian opinion, or even to the Soviet authorities who have also to be taken into aeoountjfor Persian officials ust be prepared to cooperate with the Soviet Governn'ent as well as with ourselves, and they must also enjoy sufficient support in the country to enable them to carry on their work without relying emtirely on British or United mates support. Any 'ereian officials kno^n to owe their positions to foreign intervention would find themselves /corres ondinglycorresponding!- weakened. The position of the present goYspnent under M. Soheily ie in fact considered to oe th«: stronger for having been established without an;/ foreign interference. Sir ieader Bullard reports that he has discussed the suggestion with his United States colleague, and th*t they are agreed as to the undesirabllity or their attempting to undertake the task of salacting Paraian Ministers and high officials. The; feel that it would be dangerous to attempt to iorco th ir own candidates on the 1 ersian adrainietration. We *+*l&amp; therefore prefer to refrain froin sending explicit instructions to them to act in the sans# proposed, but to rely on them to use their influence with the Persian authorities, to the extent to which the that this can safely be done, with e view to encourage the best and most efficient elements in the country as a whole.

It explains the origin of the proposal that American advisers and relief workers might be engaged by the Persian Government, and adds that we have not heard whether or not the Persian Government intend to follow up your suggestion. We consider that if the Persian Government should decide to put forward such a request, it would be to the advantage, not only of Persians but also of the Allied cause as a whole, that request should be met. American advisers would tend to strengthen the Persian administration, as is most desirable at present moment, and their influence would encourage efficient and honest elements in the.administration. As regards State Department s apprehension regarding incompetence or corruption of Persian officials, it is largely because these are not all as honest or as efficient as they might be that American advisers are so urgently needed. Their task will not be an easy one, and State Department will no doubt do well to obtain in advance the most explicit assurances that effect will in practice be given to their recommendations, and that their work will not in any way be obstructed. We would authorise you to give full support to action by your United States colleague if these undertakings were not properly carried out. 2. As regards suggestion that you and your American colleague might be instructed to co-opcrate in encouraging the appointment of honest and competent Persians to high positions our letter explains that it will be necessary to proceed in such masters with considerable caution. It would be undesirable to.incur resentment by promoting interests of certain personal ities who might be particularly acceptable to ourselves, but perhaps less so to Persian opinion, or even to tho Soviet authorities. Persian officials must be prepared to co-operate with Soviet Government as well as with ourselves, and must enjoy sufficient support in the country to enable them to carry on without relying entirely on foreign support. You have dis cussed suggestion with your United States colleague, and are both agreed as to undesirability of your attempting to under take the task of selecting Persian Ministers and high officials-We v/ould prefer therefore to refrain from sending,you instructions as proposed, hirjr to rely on you and American Minister to use your influence v/ith the Persian authorities, to the extent to which you feel that this can safely he done, with a view to encourage’the best and most efficient elements in the country as a whole.

J’ I I aopke to Mr. Wallace Murray in the sen fee af F.'cf. telegram No. IO 63 today. Mr. Murray expressed gratifiestion and said that any proposals on the lines mentioned which they might receive from the Persian Government would he given most sympathetic consid- ^ eration. He thought it was of importance to us as well as to the U.S., both on the short-term and on the long-term view, that we should help Persia to keep on the right line. He told me that no request had yet been received from the Persian Government but at rny suggestion said that he would inform U.S. Minister at Tehran of what I had 6 old him and suggest his get ting into touch with H.M. Minister and taking any steps he thought useful to find out from the Persian Government whether they wanted advisers and relief workers. Mr. Murray went into a very lengthy statement of his views about Persia, its present condition and its future. He thought it of the greatest importance both from the point of view of the present war situation and from that of the future intereot of us all tnat Persia should be orderly, and well governed. He was concerned over the possibility that internal disintegration might be in process. He asked whether we had any reports in our printed despatches which would throw any light on this. He had heard that arms which it had taken some 20 years to take away from the turbulent tribesmen were finding their way back into their hands. This he thought a very serious question especially Just now when the safety of the highways was of importance from a military point of view# He said he hoped that H.M. Minister would use his influence to promote good and honest government, to secure the appoint ment in positions of authority of honest men (such men, Qthe happy fact that the honest Persians came so largely from the American college, and the prospect of such alumni being in power in Persia probably offer glimmering vistas to Mr. Murray^ roving eye] the product of the American College ex isted in ^ and prevent the resumption of power by the old and utterly useful rum- corrupt men who had flourished before the time of the late bers Shah- Such men he heard were emerging once more from their holes but they should be pushed back into them. For instance he heard that Faroughi, who was very old, was thinking of re tiring and that there was a possibility that one of tne most corrupt of the old gang (whose name was I think Sharvan Sultaneh) would taxe his place. This would be a disaster and he much hoped that H.M. Minister would do his utmost to prevent this man and his like from getting office. The Persians though they might in some respects be anti-British and feel that they had old grudges against us, nevertheless had a great respect for Great Britain ana H.M. Minister could make what he said go. M-. Murray hoped that H.M. Minister would co operate in this sense with the U.S. Minister. As an instance of the unfortunate present trend Mr. Murray said that the late Minister of Education had been superseded by an old and rectro- grade man and that the proposed mission by Mr. ku^roe, though it would probably take place, was likely to be much hampered by the new Minister of Education unless we and the Americans took a firm line. This question of education was in Mr. Murray’s view of the greatest importance. In this order of ideas Mr. Murray said that if the country was to be governed by the gfc corrupt elements it was unlikely that the U # b.G* would agre® to help in the way of sending advisers etc. since their task would be made quite hopeless.2 During the conversation kr. Murray said t information I had given him about the possible de the Persian Government for advisers etc. fitted with things since there was a Persian economic expert i this country at the moment with whom they were in telose touch and in whom they had complete trust, (he was, the American College graduates). one P£-&lt;2 He also said that the U.3.G. had received a request to appoint a U.S. police official to organise constabulary for the country and the highways. The U.o.G. were doing their best to find a man. Mr. Murray also said that he thought we should try to persuade the Persian Government to put its revenue to better use than the late Shah had done. His expenditure on the army had oeen quite unnecessary and futile. There must be quite a large revenue. Mr. Murray said that the State Department attached much importance to the return of American school properties. He hoped H.M. Minister would cooperate with the American Minister for the purpose of securing this return. 1 emphasized throughout that the U.S.G. enjoyed a position of great influence in Persia Mr. Murray brought in Mr. Ailing and Mr. Parker to be present at our interview. This is a curious habit of his. I wonder what is his reason. R.C.

My telegram No co-operation in Persia],, c 32 5. 1 of March 4th. Anglo-iimerican I have now received from American Embassy a memorandum shedding further light on State Department’s attitude. State Department feel that an American financial adviser and relief organisation could not competently perform their duties without 'che complete support of competent Persian officials. Concern is expressed at recent deterioration in political situation resulting from the emergence of politicians with unsavoury reputations to Cabinet posts and positions of influence. The rise 'co pov/er of persons of such character would tend to nullify the beneficial reforms of the last fifteen years. In the event of a breakdown in internal administration* arising from the incompetence and corruption of local leaders* the occupying forces might well have to devote their energies to the maintenance of law and order necessary for.safe transport to Russia of military supplies. It is in the interests or the allies and of Persia that men &lt;?f ability and integritydiould assume positions of leadership, in order that Persia may adopt the role of a willing partner resisting aggression. State Department therefore suggest that both British and American Ministers at Tehran might be instructed to co-operate in such manner as might be proper with the aim of encouraging the assumption of high posts by Persians of tested integrity and competence. State Department invite co-operation of Foreign Office in these Questions. They regard strategic petition of Persia at this time as of the utmost importance in view of Japanese sudeesses and German threat, and hope that the British authorities agree that no time should be lostin strengthening the position of Persia as greatly as possible on foregoing lines* 3. I am sending interim reply, stating that Foreign Office unreservedly welcome the principle of iinglo- American co-operation in Persian ^uastions and think that such co-operation is the best method of strengthening the position in Persia to the advantage of the Allied cause. 4o Please telegraph your observations urgently, if you have not already done so. I assume that you will see no difficulty in maintaining close co-operation with your United States colleague in such matters as those referred to by State Department* [IND1Y. ]5 * e o ./EXT /■s I 1604 Q) T [Cypher] S \i 05 r DSPAR'E.iEhTxiL No, 2 FROH TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE, Sir R e Bullard No , 555 I4th March, 1942 IMPORTANT, D. 2,44 p e m s loth March, 1942 R. 3.50 p„nu 15th March, 1942 a, a, a, a. a, a, a Your telegram No, 525, State Department are remote from reality.

While the State Department ~are'”anxious' i'of 'return of/Aiiiencan schools local American missionaries are sceptical/(se£ niy telegram No. 217). O Cf &lt; United States Minister who has received similar telegram does not know where the State Department acquired these views. I think he would agree that they are vitiated 'by omission of two vital considerations: Persian statesmen at this moment must work with Russia as well as with us and they must have such support as will enable them [5 grps. undec. ?to take immediate steps to cope with the present] general state of insecurity. 'It would be most dangerous for American and British Legations to try to force on the country Cabinet of young men without experience or political support. Soheily s position is the stronger for having been established without any foreign influence. 5. I do not agree that Qawam al Saltana is the worst of his type and he may be serious candidate for Premiership one day. Although he is strongly supported by the Russians I do not think he would be their tool.' Late Minister of Education referred to is presumably Tadayun. He succeeded Sadiq, number 178, who was much too openly in favour of British and American methods, who therefore found little m ular support, and if he appeared re-actionary in policy some re-action was probably essential after the anti- religious policy of the late Shah. (2) Cabinet he was in prevented religious demonstrations during Muharram and did nothing whatever to encourage retrogressive movement in social affairs. (5) He showed his influence by removing many bad officials without this being followed by the usual uproar. In my opinion Tadayun is another serious candidate for the Premiership and I hope he mil not be judged on the narrow ground of his supposed attitude to American schools. 4 . I assume that you do not require me to telegraph special report on 'present and prospective internal conditions 11 . You nave full information and I keep my United States colleague well informed, I trust the United States Government will be able to spare official to reorganise Persian gendarmerie and will not wait until they see in power Cabinet composed of honest graduates of American schools. Situation calls for help and we must make the best of.the material at hand. Persians look to America and American police officer would find many ready to work well v/ith his backing.. _§• Perhaps to soi ten the discouraging reply v/hich I consider should oe given oo the State Department- we might ask for a list of Persians ox the kind approved by them. I suspect it would include badic[ and also Akkohyar Salih, i\ T o. 184, now in the United States who is the brother of the Persian Secretary to the United States Legation here. I think we are entitled to add that there are many decent young men trained in C.M.S. schools whose career we should not feel entitled to push merely for that reason.

Another symptom was the replacement of the late Minister of Education by an old obscurantist who might make any^educational progress impossible. The hope was expressed that His Majesty’s Minister would co-operate unofficially to prevent the return of corrupt politicians and to promote the appointment of young honest men of whom there was a supply among the graduates of the American colleges. Persians haa healthy respect for Great Britain and influence exerted by His Majesty's Minister was likely to have effect. The State Department was assured that His Majesty's Minister would be anxious to keep the Persian Government on the right lines, and that it was felt certain he would be very ready to co-operate for this purpose with the United States Minister. The x strength of the United States’ influence was emphasised to the Department. 2. The State Department shows concern over the internal situation and feared possibility of disintergration. In particular, reports had been received that arms were finding xheir way back into the hands of the tribesmen. The Department would welcome any information we can give with regard to present and prospective internal conditions. ' The United States Government have been asked by the Persian Government to supply a police official to organise a force of constabulary for the country districts and highways, and are doing their best to comply, although the choice of the men presents difficulty. 5.

As the Persian Government are obviously anxious to interest the United States in the affairs of Persia, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has suggested to the Persian Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs that American advisers should again be engaged for revenue and finance work. The suggestion was favourably received and it appears that the Ministry of ¥ar had already thought of engaging American advisers for their Supply and Finance Departments. 2. His Majesty's Minister has also suggested that the Persian Government should ask the United States Government to lend them some experienced relief workers to assist in organising the supply and distribution of bread, sugar and cotton goods, which requires greater ability, experience and honesty than Persian officials possess. This idea also was viewed with favour. 3. You may inform State Department accordingly and add that if Persian Government decide to ask for the loan of American advisers and relief workers we hone that thev will be able to comply with the request. Theieis no doubt that efficient American personnel could afford Persian Government valuable assistance at present moment in effecting economics and reforms and checking dishonesty.

I have suggested to Minister for Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister that Persian Government should ask United States now to lend some experienced relief work ers to assist them. Both appeared to think the plan good. They may have been influenced by ahope that America would supply some of the food for distribution either free or on credit. Mr. Bullitt implanted this hope by suggesting that Persia might share in benefits of Lease-Lend Act. 2 , I trust that you will approve of my suggestion.

(E 1499/888/34). r MESSAGE PROM WASHINGTON Dated March 3, 1942 ? _ _ ^he Department of State has been informed by the British Embassy of the anxiety felt in London regarding the _deterioratirg economic and financial situation in Iran and the Embassy inquired whether the United States Government would be willing to lend its assistance in obtaining the services of an American financial advisor who would assume also supervision of. the importation of supplies badly needed by the civilian population, principally bread, cotton piece goods and sugar. It was suggested also that it would be desirable if some experienced American organization could undertake supervision of the distribution of such supplies. According to the British Embassy this matter has been discussed with, the Government of Iran which is anxious to see these proposals put into effect as soon as possible. The Department advised the Embassy informally that c careful and sympathetic consideration will be given to these suggestions. ' e c ■ oc o At the same time, however, the Department felt that an American financial advisor and relief . organization could not competently perform' their duties without the complete support of competent Iranian officials. In this connection the Department mentioned to the British Embassy its concern with a recent deterioration in the political situation in Iran resulting from the emergence of politicians unsavory reputations who might be slated?for cabinet posts and positions of influence! The Department felt that the rise to power of persons.of such character would tend to nullify the beneficial reforms that during the last fifteen /yearsyears have heen instituted in Iran. The Department mentioned to the British Embassy that as a result of a possible breakdown in internal administration arising from the incompetence and corruption of local leaders,*^ the ^occupying ■ forces might well be forced to spend considerable energy and time in the maintenance of law and order. The maintenance of a state of law and order was imperative if the safe transportation to Russia of military supplies was to be secured. pointed out that it is in the interest of the United Nations and Iran that men of, ability and cc integrity should assume positions of leadership in Iran, in order that the country may adopt the role of a willing partner resisting aggression. The suggestion was made, in the light of the above considerations, that both the British and American Ministers at Tehran might be instructed to cooperate in such manner as might be proper with the aim of encouraging the assumption of high posts by Iranians of tested integrity and competence. ^ *n ' ^ v v v The Department would greatly appreciate the cooperation of the Foreign Office in these questions. As a result of Japanese successes in the Far East and the threat of German, action in the Near East, the strategic position of Iran at this time is of the utmost importance. The Department sincerely hopes that the competent British authorities will concur that no time should be lost in strengthening the position of Iran as greatly as possible along the lines above outlined.OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, am - 2 EXT kept under Lock and Key.] E 1499/888/54 [CYPHER] 1359 I 942 DEPARTMENTAL NO. 2.
