Walker in 2000 as "Occasional Papers: 3" for the Archive of the Turkish Oral Narrative (ATON). In this paper, Dr. Walker, one of the three original founders of ATON, authors an account how he, his wife and Professor Uysal came up with their oral folktale narrative project, how they went about the process, issues encountered while collecting the tales, political upheaval and safety concerns they encountered while travel across Turkey in the 1960s-1970s, and issues with technology in both collecting the tales and making the tales accessible to researchers.</dc:description><dc:date>2020-01-28T19:57:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2020-01-28T19:57:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:identifier>https://hdl.handle.net/10605/357703</dc:identifier><dc:rights>The images in this collection are for study purposes, teaching, classroom projection and research only.
