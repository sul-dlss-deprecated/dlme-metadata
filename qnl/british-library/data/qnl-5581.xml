(i) Prices at the opening of the 1934 season were considerably lower than the prices of the last season. With the arrival of a few Hindu pearl merchants, however, the price of f al asnaf 1 (small assorted pearls) increased by approximately lOffo and later by 20$ on the arrival of Mr. Ghandmal Gashimal. There has been no increase in the price of ^hashin* (big pearls). (ii) Two nakhudas from the mainland are reported to have found big pearls. One weighing 20 chaws was sold for Rs.8,000/- (it is said to be worth not less than Rs.20,000/-), and an offer of Rs.20,000/- was made for the other, which weighed 40 chaws. (iii) Another Bahrain nakhuda is also reported to have found a big pearl, but this has not yet been offered for sale. (iv) On the whole the catch of the Bahrain divers is said to be poor compared with the catch of the last seasonIMPN.OPgR. 809/33 D.O.No.10706.

My Lord, With reference to my telegram No.56 of the 8th August last, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that Hans von Bassewitz is a German Journalist who has 'been residing in fehran for some time. 2. He is known to have written articles of an anti-British nature, one of which, written in February, 1933, concerned the treatment of pearl fishers in the Bahrein Islands. The account was maliciously distorted and was animated with marked hostility to Great Britain. The article was published in a Berlin newspaper, the cutting from which was returned to the Foreign Officer after perusal, being too long to be translated. 3. In these circumstances a visa for India was refused to Mr. von Bassewitz and His Majesty ! s Consular Representatives in Meshed and Kabul have been warned by iELegram not to grant him a visa; a circular despatch has also been sent to all Consular Officers in Persia instructing them to refuse a visa to Mr. von Bassewitz should he endeavour to obtain one elsewhere in this country.

Hans Von Bassewitz, Journalist, German national, has applied for visa for India which was refused on the ground that he has written grossly exaggerated and harmful articles in the German Press about British policy in the Persian Gulf. His passport bears ' visa applied for' stamp, but it is highly probable that he will obtain new passport. He says that he has renounced trip to India but he (gr. omitted? is ?) proceeding to Kabul via Meshed and Herat. He should be refused visa for India should he apply to you. (G.

V 1935 My dear Walton, In the demi-official letter of March £4 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the subject of the treatment of the pearl fishers in Bahrein, a copy of which was enclosed in your official letter,. No. P.Zof April BO, it was suggested that the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society should be sent a copy of a further account of the riots which occurred among the pearl divers at Bahrein in May, 193B, and it was further suggested that it would be an excellent thing if some first-class English paper would send a responsible special correspondence to 'write up' the Arab coast of the Gulf. z. As regards the first suggestion, I doubt whether the information enclosed in Fowle's letter of March &lt;s4 adds enough to what we have already told the Anti-Slavery Society/ J.C.W&amp;lton, Esq., C.B India Office. li. c 3 ' vSociety in our letter of April 6 last (of which we sent you a copy in our official letter No. E 1653/55/91 of April 7) for it to be worth writing to the Society again. Meanwhile, I have put Fowle's second suggestion to our News Department on the chance of their being able to do anything with the press, but they tell me that, in these days of financial stringency, and with so many events of major importance happening all over the world, they fear that it would be impossible to persuade any paper to send out a special correspondent to the Persian Gulf at the present moment Yours very sincerely,3 ! 3 A A iAI R i Colonel Fowle, Your D.O. of 24tn March, No.280-3 to Walton crossed copies sent to Bushire and the Government of India of an official reply sent hy the Foreign Office on our advice to the Aborigines Protection Society regarding the recent Bahrein pearl riots. This, a S you will see, is on much the same lines as you have independently suggested ana it is to he hoped that it will dispose of the matter. Ii the Society, however, return to tne charge, or there are further misleading articles in the German Press, we can consider more active counter-measures. On general grounds our policy hitherto has been to keep the Sheikhdoms so far as possible out of the limelight, but obviously (while we are not, I tnink, anxious to attract public attention unduly to them) this will become increasingly difficult and it may well be that S* a case such as the pearl riots b* might be used oy the Persians mi an attack against our method of administration of island, in ** article 111 'Times'' or the like would be very useful. * Ve have ’ k° weve r&gt; an uncomfortable feeling that, even wit] the reforms which have been introduced of late years, the condition of the divers may still not stand too close scrutiny and this has been one with other factors in our ieluctance to attract special attention to conditions^*Please refer to your endorsement ■wo # * , «2« 1081/1933 forwarding a copy of a letter from tne Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society dated 7tn February 1933 to the Foreign Office, on tne subject of certain allegations made in a Berlin paper regarding tne treatment of pearl fishers in Bahrain. 2. The Society fails to give tne name of the newspaper concerrwd ,30 one does not know whetner tne latter is a ’rag* or a paper of standing, and tne translation of the German article reads queerly in parts: 'They relate in the Gulf that if a small sailing boat should ever become suspect or trouble some there, then, rammed by a gun-boat, it can quickly dis appear into tne farewell for ever.” In these times, however, one cannot afford to ignore any form of hostile propaganda however foolish it may seem. I suggest therefore that the Anti-Slavery Society, which is of course a very influential body, be sent the attached account of the riots summarised from Priori letter No.C/83 of 30th May 1932, forv?arded to the Government of India under Biscoe's despatch .No#3t&gt;4-3 of 4th June 1932. It will be seen that the affair has been grossly misrepresented by the German journalist. It was excellently and humanely handled by Prior, and the Government of India expressed their appreciation of his services on this occasion - vide their letter l!iOei).2l52-lsl/32 of 30th June 1932. J. G. Walton, Esq., G.B., M.C., The India Office, London.S.W.l.- 2 - On tne general subject of pearl divers at Bahrain I attach a note which is an extract from Belgrave*s report alluded to in paragraph 9 of the note accompanying Biscoe's despatch No # 637 ofc18th March 1930. I suggest that this extract should also be sent to the Society. As you will see it snows that both ourselves and the Bahrain Government have done much to ameliorate the condition of these people. With regard to publicity in general and the Arab States at the Gull, As the various departments concerned have concurred (vide correspondence ending with Foreign Office letter No.E 5737/4009/91 of 6th November 1930 to the India Office), the days have gone by when we can prevent journalists, whether German or otherwise, from visiting these States, Even could we do so temporarily we would merely antagonize tne Press, (vide paragraph 4 of Government oi India*a telegram No*3283-S of 30th September 1930), and give the impression that we mve something to conceal, when in fact our work and influence in that area nas been admirable. With the establishment of the air route, and oil interests along tne Arab coast, increasing publicity is inevitable, and we snould do our best to see that iz i3 or tne ri S nti complexion. It would be an excellent thing ii some first-class Englisn paper, THE TIMES for instance, would send a responsible special correspondent to ’write up* the Arab coast ot the Gulf, I I am sending a copy of tnis letter to Metcalfe.@ BAHRAIN RIOT• MAY 1932. On 26tn May 1942, consequent on unrest due to economic causes following on tnree baa pearl-fisning years among tne pearl divers of Munarraq lan Island of tne Banraln Group), a body of some loOO divers from tnat island, armed witn sticks, clubs and bars of iron, broke into tne police station at Manama (tne cnief island of tne Banrain Group), and released a diver wno nad been impriaonedo Tne only forces immediately available to restore order were a small party of some 10 Indian sepoys of tne Banrain Armed Police and some ’nature* or local Arab watcnmexi. Tnis small party, led by tne Political Agent, Banrain, and tne Financial Adviser, Banrain State, wno instructed tnem not to open fire unless tney were ordered to do so, formed up in line, advanced on tne rioters and, after a nand to band struggle, succeeded in dispersing tnenu No snots were fired by tne Indian sepoys, wno benaved witn admirable restraint, but two of tne rioters were killed and four or five wounded by sporadic firing by tne Arab watchmen* One Indian sepoy was wounded.

Captain Prior later received the commendation of the Govern ment of India for nis action on tnis occasion. A question was asked in the House of Commons on tne matter of tne riot, which - together witn the reply given by the Secretary of State for India - is given below. ****** Question in House of Cornmoa gQuestion in House or Commons Monday 2d.11.1942. Question No»13 dated 28tn November 1932 . Mr.David Grenfell. - To ask tne Secretary or State for India, wiietner He nas received any information regarding tne action of tne Britisn Adviser ol tne Snaikn or Banrain in May last sanctioning tne arrest and imprisonment or pearl fisners in tne Persian Gulf wno were dissatisfied witn tneir pay, and tne subsequent action of tne consul involving tne snooting by Hindu sepoys of a number of tne pearl fisners, tne result being tne total suspension of pearl fisning; and wnetner ne will institute an inquiry into the circumstances which led to tne affair. Answer to Mr. David Grenfell*s question Bo.13 dated 2dtn .November, iy32. A serious riot, tne reasons for which appear to have been partly economic, took place in Bahrain on the 26th May, in tne course or which a mob broke into tne police station and released a diver who had been imprisoned. The situation was rapidly brought under control. Bo shots were fired by the Indian police but two divers appear to nave been killed and four or five wounded by sporadic firing by local Arab watchmen. There was no suspension or the pearl fishing, tne pearling boats leaving for tne banks in the first week or June. I see no occasion for further inquiry into the incident which appears to have been satisfactorily dealt with by tne local authorities. SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION . Mr. Grenfell* Is it true that the casualties amount only to two ? Were there not a larger number killed in addition to the number seriously injured ? Sir S. Hoare* The information at my disposal is that two people were killed and four or five wounded. *♦**#*Note by Mr.Belgrade, Financial Adviser to tne Bahrain Government, on Bahrain Pearl Fishers. ********* The diving community in Bahrain consists of 3 categories: the shore merchants who do the big buying and selling and who either own or finance the boats, the nakhudas or boat captains, and the large inarticulate mass of divers, illiterate Arabs who were previously cheated and oppressed fcy their employers, or rather their owners, the boat captains. About 15,000 local divers go out from Bahrain every season and it has been estimated that about 100,000 men from the whole Gulf are employed on the banks every year. Attempts to improve the diving system met with difficulties. The divers were suspicious and apathetic, the merchants and captains were violently opposed to changes that would loosen their hold over the men and until the present Shaikh succeeded his father it was considered unpolitic to press for reforms. In 1924 His Sxcellency Shaikh Hamad in conjunction with Major Daly, who was then Political Agent, and with the support of the Government of India, took the matter in hand. Only a very few of the more far sighted merchants, and the Shia and Sunni Qadis, supported the movement, but the reforms were finally pushed through mainly owing to the keen ness and energy of Major Daly. The principal features are as foil owe:- The amount of the advance and the amount of interest permissible is laid down by law. No other charges may be debited against a diver. Merchants and boat captains are compelled to keep regular accounts, which were made out by a humber of diving clerks who are authorised by the Government. Every diver keeps a small book issued Xxy the Government which shows his account with his captain. Boat captains are for bidden to sell the pearls privately but must do so in the presence/presence of not less than three of the divers. When a diver dies his children are not made to take over his debts and dive for his captain, the debt becomes an ordinary one against the estate» BveKx&amp;xxsxsxgaxxdtakfcx These, and various other rules, have greatly improved the diving conditions. Although men who have been diving for a long time are still hopelessly indebted to their captains, and will remain so until they die, the new generation of divers are no longer in the position of slaves. Previously a diver had no redress against his captain, a court existed, but it consisted of boat captains and its reputation was notorious. Divers now realize when they are cheated,and appeal to the courts when they find that the diving rules are not being carried out by their employers. There still remains an influential party of merchants and captains who bitterly resent the improved conditions and who continually try to upset and evade them. The strictest supervision is needed by the Government and the Courts to prevent a return to the previous state. ****♦#=5 / / tv Sir R. Glancy, ; Sir D.

We should have had much more difficulty if they*d raised the general question of the divers. As Captain Prior says in paragraph 13 of his &gt; letter of 30th May last, it may become a question this year whether the Bahrein Government will be justified in making divers go to work for their &gt;|akhudas.

Prom ancient times the riches of the Persian Gulf in pearls have been a source of prosperity in the Sast. Umost all pearls which do not originate in Japan come from the coasts of Persia and mainly from the Island group of the “Two ^eas* ^Bahrein) situated on the opposite coast of Arabia. There one hitherto counted some 500 boats with which the natives went to the pearl banks and 15,000 pearl divers. Pull of hardships and dangers was their calling in collecting the sh«ll fish from waters swarming with sharks. They seldom grew old. And often enough in the whole heap* of shells not one was found which had covered a small injury inside the shell by a growth of its mother-of-pearl substance, the coveted pearl. Then the catch yielded no profit. Last....Last year the Largest pearl so Xar known to the world, If It has not becorae also the most beautiful and most valuable, was found near Bahrein. Many people were able to fill treasure chests, like the ihelkh of Kewelt whose riches in pearls are talked of as a marvel. Indian princes in theirpredellction for valuable Jewellery were also good customers for the valuable catches. Recently the whole guild of boat proprietors and pearl divers of the Bahrein Islands was combined Into one organisation, directed by j-ligllshmen, which replaced the natural risk of the Industry Incurred by the small enterprises formerly working Independently, by a slender fixed wage. For the world crisis cast Its shadow even in these circles. The collapse of prices In the inter national jewel market Mso affected pearls. Their value sank In 1^31 to about one-half fche prices attained In the previous year. If It was really desired to stop the continuing decline In the price of pearls, only one means could avail, namely that which people have years ago learned to apply in the case of th* inrrensely Increased production of diamonds In louth Africa, which Is to shut down the whole Industry. Quite extraordinary measure® were required for such a high-handed move. How did the British actually come into the Persian r, ulf ? Very few Europeans are accustomed to seek for pleasure or sport these waters overheated by the tropical sun. Merchant ships at best en route for Iraq and the Persian coastal ports, where moreover in the course of recent.3. rcc'” t ve-.rs the Oanian flag la moat, frequently counted after the British. In the course of •'fflall naval expedition?! to protect the Indian frontiers the British in 1369 had occupied the Bahrein Islands which belonged to Persia, '^hah Nafreddin, who did not possess a single vessel which I could be utilised in war. could not prevent the last Persian soldiers and officials being sent away a few years later. But when after the world war Ki*a % 9 .h Pahlevi succeeded in regaining Persia'a ancient independence, in 1927 he claimed back also the Bahrein Islands on | behalf of his country as a rightful possession and despatched lOv soldier* there to proclaim hia right*. But the small force returned poat haate to Bushire at the sight of threatening British protecting vessels which did not see any Joke and since then the decision, If one can still call it so, lies with the League of Nations. Without desiring to discuss here how the commissions of the Geneva club of nations appraise foreign rights as against tn© interests of the British Kmpire, it may be mentioned that Great Britain in the meantime has developed the Bahrein Islands, like the coast towns of her paid vassal *1*1 tans of Koweit and Muscat, into strategic naval, flying and wireless bases. Since Great Britain wap obliged to evacuate Southern Persia occupied In the war and knows that sooner or later she will also be com pelled to give up the Iran mandate, these are Great Britain's rearward fortresses for the defence of the route to India or - to-day more than previously - on the way....way to the rich ell fields exploited by Great Britain. Many million tone of petroleum ere annually carried to the nm through the Persian Gulf on British account. The Bahrein Islands were to remain shut off from foreign curiosity. They relate in the Gulf that if a ^rall sailing boat should ever become aspect or troublesome there, then, rammed by a gun-boat, it can fjulckly disappear into the farewell for ever. nut the news of the tragic fate of the pearl fishers has, however, penetrated to Persia by an authentic channel * In Merama, idle capital of the largest of the Bahrein Islands, covered with strange tall Arab houses, a native ^heikh rules but he has no cormande to give: the British ■adviser* and financial administrator there en tirely relieves him of those cares. A few weeks ago he Issued, In turn on instructions from superiors, the order that this yearhpcsrl-diving 'season* should last from the 15th of the Mahommedan month of Moharram until the 15th of the first Jornada month, which nearly corresponds to the period from May to October, and that moreover every pearl diver should receive in respect of this season a fixed wage of twenty-five rupees but every helper who pulls the diver out of the water and assists in look ing after the boat only twenty rupees in all. The value of the Indian rupee current in the Persian Gulf is sabout 1*15 marks to*day and has declined compared with former cuotations in relation to the British pound. An intelligible discontent therefore arose among the pearl divers of the Bahrein Islands, and they despatched a deputation of four persons as interpreters of tneir wishes to the British 'responsible adviser' of theirsuperior Theikh. But before the envoys had said a word, they were overpowered by the police, put in fetter* and imprlwoned. The population began to agitate and the men of Muharrak, a armll island situated in the north of the Bahrein group, assembled, 2,000 in number, maimed their boats and marched on the 20th of the holy Moharram month in procession of protest to the police station of Wenama. The adviser had opportunely made himself scarce and had only hastily given order* to refuse all negotiations. Notwithstanding their strong claim the pearl fishers did not however resort to any violence but shattered only one window and rescued one of their im prisoned comrades, Abdul ftahld. The other three could not be found. They peacefully withdrew, ©nbarked again in their boats and made for their native island with sail and rudder. JPrecieely at this moment the British Consul, warned in the meantime, appeared on the scene, at the head of hie bodyguard of armed Indian lepoya (soldiere) and, when the 'adviser' also put in an appearance again, caused a running rifle fire to be opened immediately on the pearl divers* departing boat*. The descriptions of the native eye witnesses, who have now come to Bushire, report dreadful detail r of this shooting. In their desperation the fugitive boatmen threw overboard their severely wounded comrade* in order to lighten the load. Subsequently the men brought out of the water five dead and six hopelessly wounded men. It 1* said that over thirty wounded re turned to Manama and three dead and many wounded were taken to ^iharmk. Even there the pursuit continued, and6 If one may believe the witless® from Bahrein, over one hundred men were arrested and all the houses on the island destroyed. But then, to complete the tragedy of these unfortunate people, there was published the obviously 1 an*? prepared ordinance of the British ad ministrator instructed by higher authorities. The state of the market imperatively required a cesmtlon of the pearl output. K few thousand Arab pearl divers thas became victims of the world economic crisis. uid heikh Ahmed, the paid chieftain of the Island of UuharroJt, in view of the choice allowed between a purse of gold and a bullet from the barrel of a sepoy's rifle, was obliged to express his thanks to the British 41 responsible adviser* for the destruction of the tradition al occupation of hie peopled \nd another document with the heading 'Bahrein Inlands* ia getting du^ty at the league of Nation* head quarter* in Geneva whilst noble *peechea resound. * .fcitt.iiftlsre.itt lalaada ,1a,a rJ I am greatly obliged to you for your letter of th® 9th February dealing with th^ matter to which Kr Belgrave refers and I am sure your explanation and th® general opinion held of Mr Belgrave and his work, will b» a vpry gr^at encouragement to him in his by no means easy task in Bahrain.

WHITFKALL.S.W.l.As I an the Sinister primarily responsible for British interests in the Persian Gulf, Cunliffe-Lister has passed on to me your letter of the 1st February, with which you sent him a letter you had received from ir. Belrrave. I am afraid that I do not know the source of imormation from which Lir. Grenfell, M«P*» heard about the disturbance in the Persian Gulf, about which he asked the question in the House on the 2&amp;th November, to which Me* Belgrave refers* Mr* Grenfell is not himself one of the Members of the Labour Party who have recently visited India, but he takes considerable interest in Indian affairs and is probably in touch with a £ood nany people in India. I believe that there are fairly close commercial contacts between business men in Bahrein and Bombay, and I am inclined to think, although I do not knoa, that this is probably the way in which he came to hear of the arrest and the imprisonment of the pearl fishers about whan he made enquiries. I made it perfectly plain in ray reply to Mr. General Sir Reginald Gipgate, GCB-, GCYO., GR-., KCRG., DSC.© *• ^p. Grenfell that in the opinion of the Government the affair had been satisfactorily handled by the local authorities, and that there was no occasion for any sort of enquiry* I have seen no further signs of any attempt to make difficulties for Mr. Belgrave, and I can assure you that according to all my information his record is very satisfactory.Ivt. Turnfcdll, I attach the tile. There is nothing to show from where ^r. Grenfell got his information, hut there are close commercial connections between various Indian firms in Bahrein and Bombay ana we haa rather assumed that this was the channel. If iur. Grenfell is an amenable person Captain Knatchbull might be able to get some information from him. On the whole, however, I should rather be inclined to leave matters as they are, (it seems prima facie very unlikely that Mr. Grenfell woulu give us any information which coula be passed on, for it might obviously be embarrassing to his source) and reply accordingly to 3ir Reginald '.Vingate, aading that Mr. Belgrave is an excellent officer whose work in Bahrein has always beenvery satisfactory, ana that the reply given by the Secretary of State in the House and quoted by him maae it quite clear that no reflection was regarded as lying on him or on the local authorities. The Publicity Department have been unable to trace the reference in the 'Morning Post'. Probably itis no more than a casual comment provoked by the Question ana answer in Parliament.Dear Turnbull, I enclose copies of correspondence which Sir Philip Cunlil'fe-Lister has had with Sir Reginald Wingate, together with the enclosure to Sir Reginald Wingate*s letter in original, about some incidents in the Bahrain Islands.

Dear Cunliffe-Lister, Please forgive a dictated, typev/ritten letter from my bedroom, but 1 am laid up with an attack ol that very painful and unpleasant complaint known as 'shingles’ - I have never had it before and I hope I shall never have it again! I do not know if the enclosed letter from Bahrain will be of any special interest to you because 1 really do not know exactly under what Office the Administration of that remote part of the v/orld comes - I suppose it has something to do with Iraq, Persia, India and Arabia and that it has no particular dependency on any, but in any circumstances, I am inclined to think the contents of the letter will be of general interest to you, as Bahrain, owing to Imperial Airways communications, is coming more into the lime-light than it did before. I may as well tell you who the writer is - Captain Dalrymple Belgrave was an officer of the Territorial Army who served under me in the Sudan in the early days of the War and later on, when I became High Commissioner for Egypt, I ^— ^ I got him transferred to the Egyptian frontier Defence Force and he was sent to the lonely Oasis of Siwa, where he spent two years and, instead of vegetating, he took very careful notes and many sketches and turned out an interesting book known as 'The Oasis of Siwa' to which I wrote a somewhat lengthy Foreword - it was published some years ago. Later on, when Egyptian re-organisations took place, he was at a loose end and I advised him to apply for the vacant post of a sort of vizier or tutor to the Sheikh of Bahrain for which an advertisement had appeared in the 'Times'. To my surprise, he got the appointment and has been there ever since. He writes to me from time to time - he has married a charming girl who was grand daughter or grand-niece of my old chief - Field-Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood, and, as you will see from his letter he is 'the right man in the right place.'. I am particularly concerned in the latter portion of his letter where he represents the unfair treatment meted out to him by an M.P. named Grenfell. I understand that this Grenfell is an ex-miner and not really a bad fellow, ■■lellow, but tinged of course with a kind of Socialism which believes that an Englishman, as soon as he leaves England to take up a job in a Dominion or Colony, becomes a villain of the deepest dye! In all likelihood, the source oi Grenfell’s information is some member or somebody connected with the Congress if such people are in touch with Bahrain and it's problems. I doubt if you are in any way able to put a stop to what is going on, but if not, perhaps you could very kindly advise me privately, as to the direction in which I could move, as I cannot bear to see an old officer and one who is really doing sterling work in the Outposts of Empire, being downed by our irresponsible legislators. My son-in-lav;, Dane, whom you were kind enough to see when he was in England, has now gone back to his post at Ipoh and is up to his eyes in work. Please forgive me for troubling you, Yours very sincerely, (Sd.) REGINALD WINGATE.

Answer to Mr. David Grenfell’s Question No.13 dated 28th November, 1932. A serious riot, the reasons for which appear to have been partly economic, took place in Bahrein on the 26th May, in the course of which a mob broke into the police station and released a diver who had been imprisoned. The situation was rapidly brought under control. No shots were fired by the Indian police but two divers appear to have been killed and four or five wounded by sporadic firing by local Arab watchmen. There was no suspension of the pearl fishing, the pearling boats leaving for the banks in the first week of June. I see no occasion for further inquiry into the incident which appears to have been satisfactorily dealt with by the local authorities. Mr* Grenfell: Is it true that the casualties amount only to two?

The letter from the Political Agent, Bahrein, together with the Resident’s covering despatch now submitted, give a full account of this |incident. The riots seem to have been fairly serious, but to have been satisfactorily handled by Captain Prior, the Financial Adviser, ana the police. The underlying difficulty is, of course, economic, and it is to be feared that there may be further difficulties next year unless the pearl market Improves. It may be of interest to note that the &gt;L^tVK. Police Force at consists at present of 29a 2000 5.8148 Indians and 57 Arabs. The 48 Indians are ultimately to he replaced by Arabs as a measure of economy. This force of 105 carries arms. In addition, there are 12.1 Naturs, or unarmed local men, who perform watch and ward duties in the bazaars. The report emphasizes the value of the Indian element in the Police and there may be a dispositioi&gt;r'tiespr&amp;e ^Se pressing need for economy, to retain that element for a longer period or at any rate to reduce it more gradually. On the other hand, paragraph 4 emphasizes one of the difficulties presented by an Indian force unless it is commanded (as was the case mrtei Bahrein up to the spring of this year) by a Hindustani speaking European.(Copy to India Office ana Tehran) m w52 P. «0.

In continuation of my telegram No. 300 of the 31st May 1932, I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, regarding the riots at Manama on the 26th May. 2. My Secretary, Captain Gastrell, was at Bahrain at the time and has given me some further details. Although some unrest amongst the divers was apparent on the preceding day no disturbances on a large scale were apprehended, and it is surprising that so large a number should have been able to collect without the authorities at Manama obtaining prior information. The divers seem to have left Muharraq not from the recognised embarking place but from some side inlet and to have got half way over to Manama before being seen. Their object was to release one or two divers who had been arrested, but there is no doubt that the b&amp;sic cause of the trouble was economic, and that the demonstration was intended as a protest against the smallness of the diving advances. As I have pointed out in many despatches recently, the economic position on the Arab coast is exceedingly serious. It is essential that divers should receive advances to support their fami lies during their absence, and merchants, boat owners and others have g6t the capital now to pay the customary advances owing to the fact that they have been unable to dispose of last year’s pearls. 3. The situation appears to have been well handled by Captain Prior and the Adviser, and the regular police behaved with admirable restraint. The naturs are merely watchmen with little discipline or training, while all along the Arab coast the people are accustomed to let off guns in the air on the least provocation, or even merely to express joy. The divers, as Captain Prior points out, are a heterogeneous community—Baluchis, Arabs, Negroes, Nejdis, Persians, etc.—and are difficult to control; I hope however that they have now realised that a resort to force is not the best method of Representing grievances. On the other hand so far as economic conditions permit steps will have to be taken to remedy these grievances, though the problem is an exceedingly difficult one. Enclosure. Letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. C/83 of 1932, dated the 30th May 1932. I have the honour to say that a serious riot took place at Manama on the 26th May and to submit the following report. 2. On Wednesday, the 25th May, I received news from the Adviser that some unrest had been noted amongst the divers at Muharraq and that a number had gone to meet Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa-al-Khalifa to ask for enhanced salaf or advance of pay before proceeding to the banks. Shaikh Abdulla was believed to have told them that if they had a grievance they could go and lay it before the Adviser in Manama. 3. Shaikh Hamad was informed of this unrest but instructed the Adviser and Shaikh Abdulla to settle it “ by making the divers hearts good ” and did not dis cuss the matter with me at the Joint Court. He then returned to his distant out post of Rumaitha. A few men suspected of stirring up trouble among the divers were arrested and brought to Manama and placed in the police lock-up near the pier. On Thursday morning the Adviser telephoned to me that Shaikh Abdullah and the Amir of Muharraq had come over to see him and had told him that a number of divers appeared to be moving here and there and that although some had ex pressed a desire to see Shaikh Abdulla no disorder had yet occurred. At a quarter to one I received a telephone message from the Adviser’s head clerk to the effect that a body of 1,500 divers were said to be proceeding towards his office. As soon MC212FD LctT* r to™ ^ JUS. 1932 Rsoeiveo i OLL'iit l A 11 no 89 . v: If 1as I Lad finished what I was doing, some 5 minutes later, I went over to the Ad- ser s office and found that he had proceeded to the police station. I returned got into my car and followed him there. Halfway along the sea front I met a mob of at least 500 men armed with sticks, clubs and bars of iron. As a retreat would have encouraged them I forced my way through and some struck at the car with their sticks and others shouted “ waqaf ” “ waqaf ” or ‘ stop, stop ’. I realised immediately that the situation was serious and that something very different to the divers disturbances of former years was at hand. On arriving at the police station a minute or two later, I found the Adviser with some 3 or 4 local policemen and 3 oi 4 naturs and the police station windows smashed into smithereens. He i j me ^ m °k l ia( l gcd there before him and rescued a ringleader arrested I the day before. I asked him what arrangements he had made for reinforcements and he told me that he had sent for as many Indian police from the fort as could be spared to patrol the bazaar and prevent looting. He suggested that we should go to the fort and see what was happening there and we both got into our cars and proceeded there. At the fort I found some 15 couple of Indian sepoys being rapid y fallen m and provided with ammunition. It seemed to me that it would be far better i this force were used to break up the mob and the bazaar left to the care of the naturs and Mr. Belgrave agreed to this. They were then sent to the police station and after arnnng ourselves we followed them. The Superintendent, Ghaudri Sultan Ahmad, was left in charge of the fort with a few remaining Indians and some 20 recruits who were also armed. This body seemed sufficient to control the prisoners and hold the fort against any attack by a portion of the mob. 4. On arriving at the police station it was obvious that the mob which I had met had returned for a large number of men, armed as I have described, was spread a ong the sea road for aoout a hundred yards. A crowd of some 1 500 or more persons were watching in a great semi-criole to see what happened but were taking no part in the proceedings, and it was fairly easy to distinguish the rioters and spec tators. As soon as the Indians had collected their breath, I suggested to th» Axivi-er 'f the y sl T; , , d ™ sh right flank of this body and disarm them and, impossible take some of .hem prisoners. He agreed and I assisted him in explaining to the sepoys what was required. Mr Belgrave unfortunately knew no Hindustan and tould only communicate with the sepoys through one or two of the N. C. Os. who happened to know Arabic. This disability also made itself felt later. The Indians formed up in line and attacked the mob at a smart pace, with instructions not o re un ess ordered to ao so Just as they were about to close in with the mob Shaikh Rashid, the brother-m-law of Shaikh Hamad, met them with outstretehed arms as if to stop them and it is uncertain what his object was. I do not know what happened at this moment as my attention was distracted by a burst of fire from the nature and local police immediately behind me. I did my best to stop HisZt it broke out again from time to t.me. It must be remembered that the local forces fire m the air on the slightest provocation and until recently invariably used it as a meams of attracting attention. The danger was that they might find the excellent target formed by the rioters too good to miss and had they fired seriouslv into t ie mob hundreds would have been killed. When I turned back I found that the rioters w-ere holding their ground but the sepoys presently began to force them to give w after some determined scrimmaging and a number of men fled into the^sea It was at this point that the sepoy was wounded, apparently by clubbing A runmiiD- fight now continued along the sea road towards the Agency and the Adviser and I accompanied ,he police with our cars and the lorry, and the rioters were «Xhv forced into the sea, except a few who were captured.

I did not see any except a handful of the local police in action, but Mr. Belgrave tells me that the lance naik and two men in charge at the police station effectually prevented the mob from breaking into a room which contained a quantity of rifles and ammunition, and in the circumstances it is credit able that only one prisoner was rescued. 13. Altogether, the incident has served as a very useful st'ffener to the prestige of the Bahrain Government and the divers have learnt a lesson which they will not soon forget. It must be remembered, however, that the advances have this year reached an absolute minimum, though nevertheless higher than those obtaining on V the mainland, and if any attempt is made to give smaller amounts next year it will be a matter for consideration whether the Government will be justified in making divers go to work for their nakhudas. If the latter cannot find sufficient money to ■ grant an advance that makes it possible for a diver to exist, he will have to release him, though what other occupation the men will find to support themselves and their families I cannot say. Unless an improvement in the pearl market takes place \ before next year, the industry will be bankrupt and untold misery caused to thousands who have no other means of livelihoood.

Disorders which occurred after the issue of a proclamation of the Bahrein Govt # concerning inheritance* Copy of to SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE. 2 8 APB 1932 Previous Papers :— 29a 2000 5.31 FOR INFORMATION. An unfortunate incident occurred in Bahrein last February which showed up again very clearly the extraordinary weakness of Sheikh Hamad as a Ruler and involved the Bahrein Govt, in considerable loss of ” face’ 1 * About a year ago the Political Agent discovered that the provisions of the Order in Council regarding inherita ire were to a great extent being ignored and that the property of foreigners was being disposed of without reference to the Agency so that sometimes the property of minors was even liable to disappear before they were of an age to protect themselves* Captain x-rior accordingly issued a proclamation on the lines of the Order in Council intimating that the Bahrein Court might under certain circumstances take over from executors the administration of estates. As/ rAs a result the Bahrein Government began to notice last year an increasing number of cases where widows and orphans had been defrauded sometimes of their entire inheritance, the trouble being largely brought about by the collapse of the pearl market and the consequent temptation to merchants to get out of their financial difficulties by embezzling funds placed in their charge. It was felt that some action ought to be taken by the Bahrein Government and the matter was discussed between the Political Agent, the Adviser and Sheikhs Abdulla and Salman. The Sheikhs wished to issue a proclamation on the lines of the Agency proclamation of last year and to include the fnrmi waqfs and the 'athlaths' as well as the question of ' protecting widows and orphans, but Captain Prior warned them of the danger of provoking the opposition of the Qadhis and of business men by interfering with the present system by which executors could use the estates of orphans for their own purposes. iilnally a proclamation of three short sections was drawn up (copy on p#lb) intimating that executors must get the permission of the Court before dealing with the property of a deceased person, that wills must be registered, and that the Government would protect the property of persons who died intestate. This proclamation was submitted to the iiuling Sheikh, hamad, who warmly approved of it, and issued on 23rd January last. Unfortunately the Adviser had omitted to obtain the agreement of many prominent men to the proclamation beforehand and had only shoved it to the llffirrti Qadhi and to a few others in Manarna who were in favour of it. The result was that opposition to it was fermented by the Sunni Qadhis in Muharraq which spread to Manama, the wildest rumours being current about it. Sheikh Hamad received a deputation of prominent men from Muharraq/Minute Paper. Department. 214b 3000 8 31 Muharraq before whom he defended his proclamation, refusing point blank to withdraw it, but when they asked him what answer they should take back to Muharraq, he weekly said 11 1 will let you know tomorrow 1 ’! After that he had to be dissuaded by the Political Agent from taking down his proclamation by night, and later he allowed himself to be disgracefully insulted in his own Majlis by the Bahama, whom the alj/halifa regard as canaille. Ultimately the Sheikh's proclamation was torn down together with a proclamati on of the Political Agent which had been issued in support./ According to the Political Agent three things have been fully demonstrated by the occurrence; the utter futility of Sheikh Hamad who left the Adviser and himself to shoulder all the responsibility; the duplicity of Sheikh Abdulla who made no attempt to allay the agitation, though he had been one of the prime movers of the proclamation; and the inefficiency of the police dispositions left by Captain Parke, who had recently proceeded on short leave. Largely owing to the efforts of Captain Prior things have again returned to normal, but the occurrence has been a definite set back for the Government and Colonel Biscoe proposes to consider in due course with Captain Prior what steps can be taken to restore the position. 7 (Tot*. * . . f , crw.ee.

It is the duty of the State to protect the estates of orphans and widows and measures to this end should be enforced, but in view of what has happened it is clear that if difficulties are to be avoided the ground will have to be carefully sown in advance before overt action is taken. 3.

The Bahrain Corernment nac observed my action ana throughout last year began to notice an increasing number of cases where widows ana orphans nad been defrauded sometimes of their entire inheritance,an injustice it was usually impossible to rectify as their patrimony hac literally been swallowed up in tne sea. These instances had been largely brought about by the collapse of the pearl market and prominent merchants found the diversion to their own pockets of funus placed in their charge for the benefit of widows and orphans the easiest way out of their financial difficulties. 5. The employment of the estates of minors for difing is prohitiwd by Shara T a law and this is univer sally admitted and it was also universally aumittea ths many merchants had misappropriated large sums. The gt aeral feeling of the public,however,was tnat it wa.‘ bad luck for those who happened to be caught and tha owing to the bad pearling seasons the Government 3 nj /c *not be too bare on tnem. Goa had sent the bad pearling season so it vas really his affair. G. The matter had been discussed among tne ohaikhs for sometime ana when tnree glaring instances had come to ti tiie instance of the Bahrain Court,it was felt that some thing had to be done if the Bahrain Government were to take their responsibility for justice towaras widows and minors seriously, in one case a certain Ghahin bin Sagar had left an estate variously estimated at 10 to 15 lacs of rupees for his widows ana chilaren. a few months ago hi his widow,who had oeen refused relief by tue &lt;auhis, applied to the Bahrain government for help in recovering her share. After great aifficulty the hanrain government succeeaed in obtaining the so calleu accounts of the administration of the estate, it was admiitea by ili bin v-agar,the executor,taat the widow was due Rs. 1,35,000 apart from lanaed property,but he stated that he was unable to pay her a penny as toe money was all tieu up in pearls (for which there was no sale at the moneat) and tne oulk of the lanaed property nad been mortgagee to others. ±hree similar cases occurred in quick succession,ana the dviser asked me if 1 wouia aiscuss means of combating the evil with him, haikh Abdulla and Shaikh oilman,tue son of tiie leputy Ruler, a meeting was held in ny drawing room and the details of the proclamation it was proposed io submit to ohaikh iiamad were discussed. Shaikh Abdulla or Shaikh Salman,! forget which,wished to include the Sunni waqfs ana tne ’athlaths’ (or one-third of estates given for charitable purposes)as well as the question of protecting widows ana orphans. They wished to issue a proclamation on the lines of the Agency proclamation of last year,but i strongly aaviseu them to postpone the4. question of waqfs &amp;s tne ^aahis fight it to tne last ditch and also the question of athlaths because many prominent men had disposed the one-thirus of their relatives estates in their own businesses ana their united opposition would wreck any attempt to improve existing conditions, i was not much impressed by the project of had interfering in these tnulths for/they nan been faithfully observed in the past,the greater part of the property in Bahrain would now be endowed for vague,and to eur ideas, useless objects,whereas the sums could be much better employed by the living in their own businesses. 7. i pointed out to shaikh Abdulla that any inter ference in the present system by which executors,appointed or self appointed,could use the estates of orphans for their own purposes without let or hindrance would provoke a great deal of opposition,and i said that the /adhis would strongly resent anything that encroached upon or enquired too closely into the powers they at present enjoyed. 1 told him that Bahrain was approaching a step which had long ago been reached in hiigland and recently in Iraq,Syria and Egypt where the ecclesiastical power had had to make way for the secular,but that Sunni r aohis arid the interests they represented were very powerful and could not be ignored, ue laughed and said 'Who are the ^adhis? They are only three old men!* 1 replied ’’Yes: but old men with very long tongues”. 1 advised them to issue some tiring much briefer than the Agency proclamation as anything on those lines would be certain to be mis- interpreted and suggested that they should content themselv* a proclamation which ensured that Government should see that wills were registered,executors appointed and that if a person oieu intestate his property was protectea. A I5. 4 pr©clamiitioa of tiireo siiort scctisns #11 those lines wrs drawn up ana tiie matter was tnen oiscussea with Shaikh Hamad by Simikh Abaulla,Shaikii Salman anc th ^ &gt;dviser. &amp;• vU-tivi r ihe ciiaitLh hi.:iself uad always warmly urged tiie neea lor protecting tue estates of widows ana orphans but has shown himself very unwilling t© prosecute anyone provea to have stolen them. His excellency,I regret to say, feels that the criminal law exists only for the poor ana that * if a wealtny merchant nappens to malversate a matter of a lac or two belonging to his brother’s widow it was a business misfortune ana not a crime. However,he warmly supported the issue of this proclamation which was issued on the 23ra January 1J32. Ihe procla ation was issued while i was in Hofuf ana I imagined that the Adviser would have secured the agreement of as many prominent men to it as possible before it was issued, but apparently he only showed it to the Shiah waohi,Khan :&gt;ahib Yusif bin Ahmad Kanoo and a few other persons in Yanama who were in favour of it and otherwise did little in this direction. This was-a mistake fer the usual method of paving the way for enactments that are likely to hurt people’s feelings is to show to as many as possible who support it and t© get them to place their seals on pt ana then send them to talk over those who. remain recalcitrant. This may appear a curious method,but it is the one which obtains in Banrain ana usually prcauces tne best results, a public meeting to discuss any important project invariably achieves nothing. 9. Jntil Sunday, tne 7th February, I heard nothing to show toat the proclamation nau met with any opposition 7 but on that cay the Aaviser informed me that considerable opposition to it was being fermented by the Sunni ^aahis in Muhnrraq and that though many people must nave died since the proclam ation was issued^ very few deaths had been reported to taeBahrain Court. 1J. a party of prominent men came over fram ^iiuarra^ and told tiie Ad? ser that they haa been to see shaikh ibaulla shout the proclsmatidn ana that he naa tala tueia to go to the Adviser,without giving any explanation of the proclamation to tnem although it was largely nis uanuiwarx. !Tuey oiscussea the matter with the xuviser with same heat and tnen said tuey would go out to Shaikh Hamad, he tola then tuey could please themselves about seeing him. They went eut to Sakhir and the Shaikh told them very plainly tnat he was aetermined to protect the interests of widows ana orphans,that it was his duty to do so as a Ruler,that the proclamation was designed to achieve this,and had been issued by him after careful . consideration. 11. He enquired what objection they had to it and tuey produced a series of fantastic rumours saying tnat they nad heard that Government wished to take over axi the estates of all so as to tax them,taking perhaps one-third or one-half of the estate and that they had even heard that the dead were not allowed to be buried without the sanction of tne Govern- meat and that men had been placed at tne doors of cemeteries to prevent anyone oeing buried without Government permission. UJC They urgeu him to withdraw the proclamation a*** he refused point blank to do so and had the .miter ended here,probably no more would have been heard of the agi tail on 7 which would nave gradually subsided. However,with the weakness which renuers him so futile as a Ruler,when asxed wnat answer they should take back to Muharraq his nerve failed and he said ‘*1 will let you know tomorrow”. 12. He sent a special man tnat night to discuss the matter with the Adviser and myself, anu the man,who is his chamberlain,stated that the Shaikh proposed taking the proclamation down by night anc that when asked next day what7. his reply was,he w©uld say M the preclsraatiaa is geae - tuat is all”. I shawed him that this w»uld make him iaugiiiag stack fram ,’uscat to ^agncad and tnat the excitement had really arisen because tne great majerity af the people had net read ana aia not unaerstana the prociamstien. I aavisea h him to tell the L'haikh to write te ohaikh Abaulla and ask him te collect the leading merchants ef ^.unarraq ana explain tne real ebject »f the preclaraatien to them. i*e th#u|;ht this Afuula oblige .hjaikh Abaulla to ceme aewn en «ne siae or other of the fence. He repliea to the .Shaikh next day that ”the merchants weuld explain their views to him personally. Actually he had done nothing whatever. 12. Next day I paid my Id.calls ®n the hhaikhs at l^uharraq (Shaikh Hamaa,however,being at Sakhir; and on visitia, ohaikh Abculla neticea tuat he seemea uneasy ana that he breug 4 his sens back inte the majlis as they left after greeting me, eviueatly with the idea ef preventing my uiscussiag politics with him. Before the close ef the visi t,hewever, I asked if I might have a were with hiirgana he aismissec his sens. I tela him that he haa been ene ef the prime movers oi the preclamatien and that it was his duty to explain it to tne peeple and allay the agitatien as far as passible. X alse askea him why he had made no/ attempt to explain matters te tne luharraq merchants ana aespatched them te the Adviser witheut a word # He said tuey weula net listen t© him,a palpable • j. lie,since he is all powerful in Nuharraq. I reniin^ea him that UJt I had warned him that trouble might ensue *4to that he ha a laughed at my tfumiug and he replied ”fes:but who thought they would carry ©n like this”. 14. Next day I had to cell on the leading merchants at Muharraq and noticed that there were large crowds about- in a that the shops were all clesea. There srere,however,no signs of aisorder. i enquired from t^e Adviser whetuer he3. believed that the agitatiaa would increase or uimiaish and ne seeraed to think tnat it would die s natural death. &gt;t this time the trouble was localized in Muharraq and i had insufiicient evidence to form a contrary opinion. On ..etnesday however,it was clear that tao trouble hau spread to anama ana all the shops were closed in sympathy. Anotner deputation from Muharraq went to see the Shaikh at Sakhir ? ana a large deputation of haharna also went out anu behaved in a most disgraceful manner in tne Shaikh’s majlis. ihis latter deputation had some revolvers among them and had co.uaandeered tne cars which took them out. They presented a most insolent petition,which the Shaikh unfortunately did not read. They shouted,screamed ana stated tnat they would not have any Government interference or any interference by the ^aohis and that they would anage things just as they saw fit. The Arabs and some of the young al halifa who were present were much put out by tuis impertinent outburst^for they regard Bahama as canaillejbut Shaikh Hamad gave them mild woras and they left having extracted a promise that ne would ’’see wnat ne could do.' 15. 1 had been out to see tne Shaikh the proceeding nay and had found that ne was determined to cancel the offending proclamation. He was much alarmed ana had evident!; heard exag erated accounts of wuat was happenin^ia muharraq. 1 found it impossible to persuade him to take any action against those who were stirring up trouble on all sioes,b**fc tnougn I \ tola him that he would make ni^seif ridiculous aan damage tne prestige of nis Government if he withdraw nis proclamation ^ at the first signs of opposition,without making any attempts to explain his motives or deal witu those who were setting the whole place by tne ears. 1 also told him that i was amazed to hear tnat he allowed tne Bahama to insult him in his own majlis.9. 16. On Tuesday the Adviser asked me to reissue my pro clamation as ne thought this would have a good effect. I doubted this,'it in a slightly abbreviated form. On Vieunesday the foreigners began to take an interest, ill shops in Manama were closed ana on .eunesaay night both ray proclamation and that of the Janrain Government were torn down. Qa Thursday I received news through my own sources that a ersian merchant had sent a launch to iuharraq to bring over -ersians 'to ask the Government what they were going to do'. This put an entirely different aspect on the matter ana the situation became serious as a crowd of ignorant and excited Persians entering the ianama bazaars might have produced a riot at any moment, ihe Adviser apparently knew notning of this, in fact tne outstanding feature of the wnole aflhar had been the fact that no information whatsoever was forthcoming from the official sources in kunarraq until the situation was almost out of control. For this we have to thank the inefficient and inadequate dispositions made by the Commandant Muharr&amp;q with the exception of 6 sepoys of the Indian araea police. These know neither Arabic nor ersian,nor are tuey encouraged to take any interest in local affairs,but had a worthless reptile who was removed from the sane post in Mena a replace him by a more reliable man. At no time did the Amir sena any information whatever that any trouble was brewing, in fact his only message was sent on Ihurscay morning when ne reported that the Bahrain Government and Agency procla atioi of Felice,Captain r arke. There are n© Bahrain police in post of Benrain police been there reliable news would have hen available frora the start. Jrcer is supposed to he .aintained b. the A mir with naturs. The Amir of Guharraq is a had been torn down by persons unknown ^majho©l*).u. On ..eunesaay when a aisturbance might have eccurrea at any mement he retirea to his house ana said that he was - ill. cr.Bel^rave hah considered replacing the inuians by local men when Captain Parke went on leave but had not been able to do so before the trouble started,the result being that he and the hhaikh were completely in the dark as regards happenings in -unarra i. 17. 1 asked ^r.Belgrave to get into touch with the Persian situation immediately anu ae sent some men in plain clothes to iuharr&amp;q at once,but the tide fortunately went out and prevented further incursions, i sent for the merchant alleged to have despatched the launch,but before he iiasan usaibi came to see me sou said that my alan had caused some excitement amongst his community anu the Persians had/asked about it. I xJml tola him that it was a resume of the one which 1 had explained to Aoaul Aziz ^usaibi the year before,ana which the foreigners had tnen accepted. He seemeo satisfied,but asked if 1 would receive some Persians and Nejtiis. 1 said i would be glad to see them. 18. oome half an hour later a mixed boay of twenty Persians and Hejdis came to see me. They said that great excitement was prevailing ana that their communities had been agitated by the Banarna ana Bahrain Arabs. Pome of tnera were men to wnom i had explained my proclamation the year before ana I asked them why they were now so disturbed by that tney naa accepted ana understood last year. They tola me that they haa not understood it properly then ana that all kinds of runours were current. 1 said i knew this ana chaffed them about some of the more ridiculous ones and askea them if they believed them. They said they aid not but that the ’jahil^the ignorant,did,ana that they were the people who would cause trouble. They then askea me to withdraw my11 . proclem?-tion since the Bahrain Goierum&amp;t haa witnurawn t^eijs ana this i refusea to ao. I asieo thaa .vaat the/ objected to, since it was not proposea to do anything that nan not been tne practice in the agency since the Order in council was instituted,and soiiie leplxeo tnai tne tnings oientionea in tne alan had never been done before, i sain that if they referred to the fact that executors were required to give notice of their executorship,tney were quite right,and it was because this was being neglected tn&amp;t 1 uaa haa to issue the notice, i enquired if they nan ever known our Agency courts to deal *ith a Sh&amp;ra ! a aatter insteaa of soncii^ it to W ^.uhis for settlement,and tney admitted that they uau not. 19. They professed to be alarmta by ihe sktehent in tlie &amp;l&amp;n,tn&amp;i ii tnere were no executor appointed in the /ill the oourt would appoint cno. :nal oourt die this mean? 1 said tiiat suen a aw.tter douiu mtui’ally be referred to the Lhara f ajWno aouiu appoint one in accordance with the pro visions ui tne noly jjtiu fox' that particulrr sect. This partly satisfied them,but Inc./ still urged me to withdraw alan. it would have been agreeable and easy to refuse to alter or wituortw it,but they were evidently in a state of excitement and scarcely able to listen to reason. Evince iasan usaibi in particular,and some of Ins others,were obviously trying to help as fsr rs they could,it would have seemed ungracious to iiave refused to do anything and witn all the foreigners in a troublesome mood the situation might have deteriorated rapidly, it seemed to me that though the &amp;lan was nothing but selected extracts from the Order in Councilj some of tl*e paragraphs wero open to wilful mis interpretation snd tiiat if these were deleted the main effect of the alan would be the same though expressed differently. .he principal opposition was to the clause which required executors to give notice to the court,wnich certain professec to believ.e the tnin edge of all kinds of interference anainquisition. I said,howe?er,tnat 1 couia not gi?e way on this point am after three hours ois cuss ion they a-*reea to a modified aian which sounded more agreeable to tnem and at tne same time nan much the same ftf effect as tue one they objected to. « 20. They retired and evidently prevailed upon their communities for further uoubic freu iersians anu hejdis ceasea y and on the next day,Friday,! walked through tne bazaar myself and found thorn aij. opening t^tir shops or willing to do so. There were sufficient police to persuade tne large gangs of suspicious looking loafers to keep taeir hands from any attempt at looting end as the day progressed tue situation became no/e normal. in tne mornin tue ^ofiser came upon a large gang of Lomalis who lieu at Ue signt of him,so efidentiy there were not lacking persons witn guilty intentions. 21. ft ext uay,u : axiama was quiet, out 1 heard tiiat when Shaikii n&amp;ima visited &gt;,unarraq on the huncao couiu not postpone his xU visit any longerj ue was goin^, to be met with a series of concerted demands wnich seemed to cover everything from a request that respectable merchants should not nave summonses served on tnem to a request tiiat the naluaiyahs should be abolisned. 1 went to Takhir and warned the fka.ikh about Inis ana he s&amp;ia ne would be prepared for it. I told His excellency that iansme was now quiet,and that the question of too foreigners had been settled and inquired wiiat steps ne proposed to take a^inst tue instig ators of all the trouble,particularly the two authors of tae particularly insolent petition of the 3anarna. He went off into a long discourse about what Bin Ta T ud did under similar circumstances. 1 again asked him Wxiat he was going to qo. He said 'If I do anything now,the whole trouble will break out again', i agreed that immediate action might produce arecrudescence of the trouble but i to lei hiia tn&amp;t if ne aliowco such instigation to pass without anyone sufiering^is weak ness would be patent to all. lie went of in another long harangue, i again askec him wnat ho proposed to do and he finally ssia 11 1 will wait now anu let onem cool oown. Then ?rs you laiow there is the party of so and so anci the party of so and so (mentioning some four parties;. Presently they will start to qu«rrel ? sna tuen 1 wixi move tnis man against tiiat and that man against tnis,aim tuen pornaps i can ao something”. 2E. Three things have been fully demonstrated, ine utter futility of Juaikh Hamad who remaineu throughout at Sakhir leaving tuo Adviser and my seif to sdoulder ai.1 the respons ibility,when firm action on ms part at cue bi,urt would nave stopped the whole affair. Tne duplicity of uaiich ibuulla, who t no ugh really tne prime mover in tue preparation ano issue of the alan old nothing whatever to assist wnen tne trouble waich i had warnea him of stp.rteu,ana the ineiiicienqj of Captain ?arko f s dispositions of forced of law nun order in Bahrain. 23. Shaikh Hamad displayed a regreutabie lendency to 4ow to agitation when some divers took it into tneir ueaas to create trouble two years ego. I knew him to be weak but it remained for this incident to sho* fas the complete extent \ of his incapacity in an emergency, .he was insulted in his own .‘.ajlis by people who belong to the weakest element in Bahrain.end his only action has Been to dismiss one oi the ringleaders from nis seat on the lanama Municipality.

The disturbances arose following the issue of a proclamation by the Government of Bahrain announcing changes in inheritance law. However, the file states that the basic cause of the 'riots' was economic: a protest against the smallness of diving advances. The papers record the British view of the causes of the disturbances and their circumstances; the role of Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; the response to the events of the British Government; and comments in the German press.The papers include a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior) to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, giving a detailed account of events (folios 65-79); papers concerning Belgrave's reaction to a Parliamentary question by the Labour MP David Grenfell about the events, and Belgrave's role in them (folios 40-51); and correspondence between the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, the Foreign Office, and other British officials concerning an article in the German press entitled 'Swan Song of the Pearl Divers' by Hans Joachim von Bassewitz, which was highly critical of British handling of the incident (folios 4-38).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl divers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Riots</topic></subject><subject><topic>Propaganda, Anti-British</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000161#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
