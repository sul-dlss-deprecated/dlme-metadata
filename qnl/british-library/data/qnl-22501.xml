SNCLOaUHS BJ COLONIAL OFFICE COVERING LluTT&amp;ti DATED 31st JULY 1933, 18301/33. 31st July 1933, Sir, Oonaltion I am airected. by -oecrotary sir Philip cunliffe- Lister to refer to from this Department '1 tile 11th of ik£tv and to your reply (No a8135/11/33) of the 11th of (No.i' &amp; M 17486) of the 18th of May regarding the Bahrein Petroleum Company's oil concession in Bahrein, and to inform you that further questions have arisen in connection with this concession upon which your advice is desired. 2. The points on which your advice is sought arise out oi Condition C scheduled to the Indenture of the 12th ox oune 1930, a copy ox which accompanied the Colonial office letter under reference, a copy of Condition q is, however, enclosed with this letter for ease of reference. By this Condition, the Bahrein Petroleum Company are required to maintain at all times in Bah re in an official to be styled the Company's 'Chief Local Representative', whose appointment shall be approved by His Majesty*s Government, who shall be the sole representative of the Company empowered to deal direct with the local authorities and population in Bahrein, and who shall communicate with the sheikh of Bahrein only through the British political Agent in Bahrein, me Condition goes on to pro viae that for the first five years after the Company starts to operate in Bahrein, or for such lesser period as the Company may operate in that territory, their/ THs TREASURY solicitor.their 'Cfoiel Local Representative* shall be fcajor Frank Holmes, provided that the arrangement between the Company and iv&amp;Jor Holmes continues to be mutually satisfactory and provided that the determination of his appointment shall be subject to the consent of His Majesty's Government. 3. It should be explained that His Majesty's Government attached considerable importance to the Company♦ Chief Local Representative being a British subject, 'mis was considered most desirable not only to ensure harmonious relations between the Company exploiting the concession and the flahreini population and the local authorities, but also because of the special treaty relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Sheiich of Bahrein in view of which His Government were anxious that the Company's Chief Local Representative should be a British subject who would be persona grata to His Majesty's Government. This was explainea at the time to representatives of the American interests, to whom the concession was being assigned, and who were anxious to appoint a United States citizen as the Chief Local Representative. A compromise was eventually reached whereby, although Condition C did not state in terms that the Company's Chief Local Representative should be a British subject, M a jor Holmes, who is a British subject, should be appointed to the post for the first five years. A further reason actuated His Majesty's Government in insisting upon the inclusion of such a provision in the com it ions attaching to their consent to tiie assignment of the Bahrein Oil Concession to American interests, namely, that as in the case of Conditions A and 3 it was desired to safeguard so far as practicable, the interests of Hie majesty's Government. 4/4 tliat the Chief Local Hep: grata to His Majesty's G- hold a watching brief fo; least constitute himself a one toy the Company at ] Government would not app; / &gt; 7z 6* In August 1932, 1 absences from Bahrein wai they were asked Aether 1 Major Holmes would reside of nine months each year.

After oral discussions with the -— P. *114 ( TT ) Company s representative in London, a reply was received to me effect that the Chief Local Hepresentative had been in Bahrein at all times required by the Company for comuiunleations with the sheikh and the local authorities, and expressing the view that, while Condition C decides t-iie medium oi approach, it leaves to the Company 'as necessarily it must% the decision when and for what purposes the company should approach the local authorities.

Before pursuing the matter further with the Company, it is desired to clarify the legal position under Condition C, and I am accordingly to request that you/© - 5 - you will be good enough to furnish your advice on the following points. (a) the correct interpretation of the phrase 'at all times maintain in Bahrein 9 ; i.e. does tnis mean that the Chief Local Hepresentative should spend his whole time in Bahrein, with a reasonable period for leave, or that he need only he in Bahrein when required to transact business or conduct negotiations? (b) If the latter interpretation is correct, does this mean that he need only be in Bahrein to transact business or conduct negotiations when requi red by the Oompanv ? (c) ihether it can reasonably be argued, in view of the considerations mentioned in paragraph 3 above, that it was implied in the arrangement emboiLed in Condition C that the Chief Local Heprasentative, who must be approved by His Ivajesty 1 s Government, should to some extent hold a watching brief for His Majesty's Government, or at least be a safeguard against tilings being done by the Company at Bahreir which His Majesty's Government would not approve? (d) Whether in view of the wording of the Condition, His Majesty's Government can demand the dismissal of Major Holmes, if he fails to carry out his obligations thereunder and X£ bo , whether, in the event of the Company refusing to comply with such demand, the Sheikh on the advice of His iviajesty's Government would be entitled to determine the concession? y. I am to add that on the 1st August the India Office tate over from the Colonial Office th» work connected with the Persian Gulf hitherto dealt with in this Department; and I am to ask therefore that you will be good enough to send to the India Office your reply to this letter. ■ •, I am, etc. (3d.)

He had used his frequent and prolonged absences from Bahrein to mix himself up in several matters connected with oil in the Persian Gulf outside the scope of his duties as CWef Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The chief of these extraneous activities has been his protracted negotiations with the Sheikh of Kuwait on behalf of the JSastern and General Syndicate and the American interests behind the Syndicate for an oil concession in Kuwait, during which time he has been far from open in his dealings either with the Sheikh or with the local British authorities in the Gulf. He has also taken a hand in various efforts on the part of American interests to obtain oil concessions in other part a of the Persian Gulf area and in Kajd. In short, it is probably/1 '■) 9 3. probably not too much to say that the present uneatisfactory position of the t «rious oil duestions in the Persian Gulf (including Bahrein) in largely due to Major nolTnes' activities in the past three years. ■b.z./l6d5/^ IT) ^ 'bua-i.

Some discussion took place as to whether the amendments to the mining lease desired by His Majesty's Government could be linked up with the Company's application for an extension of their prospecting lioenc# under Article IV of the 1925 Agreement, and a reference was made to the Treasury Solicitor's Opinion regarding the Company's right under that Article to secure an extension of their prospecting licence. Some difference of opinion appeared to exist as to the interpretation to be put on .the Treasury Solicitor's Opinion, but eventually general agreement was reached on the following lines (a) The desired alterations in the mining lease can not be made a condition of granting an extension of a/ pI a prospecting licence under Article IV of the 19^5 Agreement* (b) There is nothing to prevent the mining lease being altered b.v agreement with the Company. (The Company had already been warned in correspondence which took place in December 193 2 that His Majesty's Government would wish to make certain alterations, and this position was accepted in the Company's letter of 30th December, 195^.) (c) When writing to the Company about the extension of their prospecting licence, it should be possible to introduce the question of the desired alterations in the mining lease, and whilv. not making the latter dependent upon the former, to suggest that in view of the consideration extended to the Company izi the past. His Majesty's Government anticipate that the Company will make no difficulties in respect of the amendment of the mining lease. The details of procedure ?/ere not, however, discussed. Emmediate 2.

The proposals would be made through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who would, in this case, be acting ae agents for the Iraq Petroleum Company.

Lieutenant-Colonel Powle said that he had re-considered his previous suggestion that the local bank manager in Bahrein should be asked to act as the Chief Local Representative. He thought there would be administrative difficulties about this, and that the Company would be strongly opposed to the idea. 4. The latest information is that Mr. Sampson (the representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) has visited Qatar, and discussed the financial aspect of the matter with the Sheikh. It is said that Mr. Sampson opened with an offer of 1 lakh of rupees, which was countered by a demand for 10 lakhs* lo action is required at the moment, as the comments of the Petroleum Department on the draft concession are awa it ed . . w 5. The position in regard to the Kuwait concession is that the bidding has been called off by the Sheikh. Lieutenant-Colonel Powle said that the Sheikh knows that the free hand accorded to him to choose between the original offers is now cancelled, and that His Majesty's Government must be consulted Q.ATAR t KUWAIT AND KUWAIT 1EUTRAL Z01E. in/in regard to any fresh proposals. Mr. Starling drew attention to Colonel Bowie's despatch of the l6th June covering a note by Colonel Cickson on the possible trend of events in Kuwait. He regarded this as rather disturbing and wondered whether there was any further action which might be taken in the interests of the British Company which was endeavouring to secure the Kuwait concession. Colonel Fowle thought that it was not desirable to do anything further at the moment- He had seen the Sheikih fairly recently. Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle also said that the lull was partly due to the uncertainty in the Sheikh's mind as to the neutral zone. It is not yet known whether the Hasa concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company, includes the neutral zone. It is not unlikely that Ibn Saud added the neutral zone on the understanding that the Sheikh's consent would be obtained, and that the King has already approached the Sheikh on the subject. The probability is that things will work out as they did in 1924, i.e. that Ibn Saud will submit proposals regarding the neutral zone to the Shaikh and that the latter will refer the matter to His Majesty's Government who will be left with the odium of any refusal. There is a possibility that Ibn Saud might, by means of the neutral zone, try to influence the Sheikh's decision in regard to the Kuwait concession. Mr. Hendel expressed the vie?/ that, in this case, there would be good ground for strong representations at Jedda against interference on the part of Ibn Saud. It was suggested that the value of the Kuwait concession depended on the value of the neutral zone, and Mr. Starling undertook to ascertain from the Anglo- Persian/Persian Oil Company whether they regarded a oonoession in the neutral zone as an essential adjunct to the Kuwait concession. Mr. Rendel suggested that it might be possible to make a distinction between the neutral zone and Kuwait proper, in view of the former's history and status, and to make a declaration that on political grounds, His Majesty's Government could not allow the neutral zone to be exploited.1+ 4 J, /2o ' / ^ v „y ■ Ik IHDIA OFFIGE, lf s.wa.

What was its object? 3 ' I said that the object of the letter was to convey the Sheikh of Bahrein's repudiations of Major Holmes's statements specified in it in regard to the offer alleged to have been made by His Excellency. Its effect was that it would be necessary for the Company go start agairi. They were at present corresponding on the basis of an offer which the sheikh repudiated. Ballantyne said he understood the position. He thought it fair at the same time to say that in the s-uort discussion on the telephone and personally which he hcid had with Ifejor Holmes bef ore the latter* s departure on Saturday, Iviajor Holmes had told a very dixfbient story from the Sheikh, and in particular had repudiated the suggestion that the interviews were not iiiifciac ,,j Dy His Excellency. He had oeen given an amended version of the offer to take out for submission. ^ s^id that that would, of course, have to be submitted through the Political Agent. Mr, Ballantyne agreed, I said we attached great importance to a strict compliance with the terms of the Indenture of June 12th8/ - 2 - 19o0.

But it was only fair to say that H.M.G. took a very serious view of the actions which had led to the Colonial Office letter 'being written. also took a very serious view of his direct dealings with the Sheikh. : i n h / i i 1 # ivi # lj iuu Ballantyne said that in the first place Major holmes was no u one Company's sej-ection. He had been forced on uQtmi uy Jn»M»ir» Nor was the Company his only master, were that the case, they could control him more closely. Bug he Wcis acting o* 1 so i.or uwo other different oil Interestp&lt;■ It was inevitable that the Company should give him so little latitude. Hitherto tney had heard no criticism or complainu oi nirn irom H.M.G. It was surely difficult to contend uiiat given the very limited society of Bahrein the Sheikh and Mijor Holmes should never discuss oil natters. Did we conuena tnat there should be no oral communication on tnese matters? I understood him to say further that he bauhered that Mr. Belgrave, the Sheikh's Financial Adviser had in any event seen the offer under discussion before it was formally submitted. 7, x baiu that H.M.G. had been much shaken by the incidents now under discussion and that he would, I thoueht xinu that tney would be disposed to interpret the Indenture June 19^0 ver^ buiictly. That Indenture specified that all communications to the Sheikh were to be addressed by one Cnief Local Representative through the Political Agent ana not tnrougn either Mr.Belgrave or by means of oral dioCUobions witn the Sheikh on oil questions, which there should be no difficulty in avoiding. t8. Mr, Ballantyne said, that If it came to a legal interpretation of the Indenture of June 1930 he might have sometnlng to say, out that he agreed that it was unnecessary to pursue the question of IvB-jor Holmes or of the Indenture fo the moment, pending receipt of the further promised letter as regards the Chief Local Representative. ^• I said in conclusion that we had no desire to put aiiy odscycles in uhe way ox the Company and were anxious to work with them on the same friendly terms as, I understood, the Coiomal Office had in the past. 31st July 1933.

Dear Starling, As you will have seen_frcsn the Political Residents sut: 77 Ou telegram No.619 of 31st July, the Sheikh is pressing for advice from His Majesty's Government as to whether the Bahrain Petroleum Company are entitled as of right to a further extension of their prospecting license under Article 4 of the existing concession. The position appears to be that the Treasury Solicitor gave certain advice on this point in his letter dated 18th May, copies of which were sent by the Colonial Office to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with their confidential despatch of 25th May. 3 - In the light of Sir Maurice Gwyer's opinion, the Ccmpany were asked on 25th May to furnish certain further information to facilitate consideration of their application. This information was duly furnished on 4th July and was sent to you for comments by the Colonial Office. I write now to say that we shall be very grateful if you can help us to clear this point out of the way by letting us have an early report on the information required by the Company, in the light of which we can discuss inter-departmentally if necessary, the answer to be sent to the Sheikh. Starling, Esq. Territorial/nu. h y 2. V Territorial Waters. As agreed inter-departmentally ^ ^ /It?/ we made no reference yesterday in our letter to the Company dated 1st August No.P.Z.4649/33 to territorial waters, in view of the uncertainty as to the intentions of the Political Resident and the Sheikh in this matter. The Ccmpany will, however, almost certainly raise the point, and it would be well to 'be prepared with a reply. So far as we are concerned here our reply can 'be that we have communicated the Sheikh's offer as we received it and we must refer the point to him. Sut we ought, I think, to be prepared simultaneously to advise him as to the line to be taken in regard to it. I have gone carefully through the concession of 1925 and the schedules appended to it. There appears nowhere to be any specific reference to territorial waters. Further, on a reasonable construction of the document as a whole it would, I think, be fair to sajr that it has land and not marine territories in view. On the other hand something must, as you suggested this morning, turn on general practice in the construction of oil agreements, and I gather from what you said that general practice would be constitiedtregarding an agreement such as the present as prohibiting drilling operations even below low water mark. If, in the light of your views and as a result of further consideration we cane to the conclusion that the existing concession can reasonably be construed as extending to the territorial waters of the Sheikh's territories, the limits of any fresh concession to be granted in respect of the area still unallotted once the Company have taken up the area of/3 of 100,000 acres under Article 5 of the Concession of 1925, might Toe identical. We shall be grateful for your views on both the points above as early as possible. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner and Moore. Yours alno©rely* J, Q, UAITHWAITE.^ h&gt; S, THE BaHHEIN PETROLEUM COKI j ANY LIMITED. 19 Moorgate, London, B.G.2. 1st August, 1933. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, &gt; As I told you yesterday afternoon when we talked about the i (z s- sle ctu.) official letter received 'by me from His Majesty's Colonial Office dated the 28th July, 1935, I had then already sent a copy of such letter by the fastest route to the Company in San Francisco for their consideration and reply. I am proposing to follow up with a cable to the Company giving the purport of the Colonial Office letter, as I understand it from you, as this;- That His ..ajesty's Government ^ ff$f cll) wish to make it quite clear to the Company that the letter of the 17th May, 1933, written by Major Frank Holmes to the Political Agent, Bahrein, is not to be regarded as importing an offer made by His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrein to this Company, and further, that such letter deals with proposals which have been definitely repudiated by His Excellency, with the result that the position is now an open oxie and the Company must start its negotiations afresh. I am adding that I have assured you that the Company never contemplated Deing in a position to accept the proposals in the letoer of the 17th May, 1933 as an offer and thereby create a binding contract, and that a further proposal from the Company was already, i.e. prior to the 28th July, 1933, in the care of Major Holmes for submission to His Excellency through the proper channel. It io understood that the Company will shortly receive a further letter from His Majesty's Government concerning Major Holmes. Ihis, when it is received, together with the accusations txiea against Major Holmes in the said letter of the 28th July 1933, will receive the serious consideration of the Company.

A copy of Articles No,5, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, amended as necessary, is attached, and also a copy of the Admiralty specification for oil fnel, referred to in those Articles. 4. My Lords have assumed that the Sheik will, in all cases, act on behalf of H.K.Goverment, and that H.M. Government will not themselves come into the contract, except that it is thought desirable to make the Articles come into operation in the event of a state of emergency or war in which either Bahrein or Great Britain is concerned. 5. As Bahrein is an independent Arab State under the protection of H.M, Government, but not a British Protectorate, it appears that in time of war or emergency the Sheik cannot be forced to exercise his rights under the proposedjpre-emption clause. If this clause is accepted by the Company it will presumably 'be necessary for H.M. Government to conclude an agreement with the Sheikh whereby the latter would agree, if required by H.M. Government, to exercise his powers under this clause in times of emergency or war. 6. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Foreign Office, India Office and Petroleum Department.

If, as was thought possible, Aajor Holmes's health was such that it would not be possible for him to comply with this requirement, the difficulties i/vhich have arisen in connection with his i I ■ *activities might be solved, since the Company might i inci it necessary to ask us to agree to a substitute. 3» The meeting then discussed the line uO ha taken with the Company on the question of the recent activities of the Chief Local Representative. It was agreed, in the light of the opinions ij ts j t'm expressed by the Treasury Solicitor and by the Legal Adviser at the India 01iice, that there was nothing in Conu ibxon G scheduled to the Indenture of 12th Jline 1930 which would entitle H.M.G. to demand Major Holmes's dismissal, he being exclusively a servant of the Company; and that since H.M.G. had approved the appointment of lUjoT Holmes they had no further say under Condition c, except that their consent would be necessary under the terms of that Condition before the company could determine his appointnsnt• The meeting also considered the possibility of advising the Sheikh of Bahrein to exclude Iviajor Holmes from his terrjtorl.e^, in view of his misrepresentations of H.S.'s attitude, tut; Ci.8Ci.ded that the political and other objections to this course were so strong that it should not be considered save in the last resort, 4. After exhaustive discussion the conclusion was reached that the best course would be, without requiring tejor Hdnes's/Holmes* s dismissal, to indicate to the Company the circumstances in which he had oeen appoints a; the fact that the basis of discussion had at the time been that the Chief Local Representative should be persona grata to H.M.G. as well as to the Company, in the Interests of both parties.;, to add that the latest developments made it impossible for H.M.G. any longer to regard him as a satisfactory channel of communication or a satisfactory incumbent of the post; and to suggest that the only satisfactory solution in their view in the interests both of the Company and of h .M.G» would be that he should now be replaced. In the event of the Company responding, H.M.G. on their part would be prepared to release the Company from their obligation to retain Major Holmes under the terms of Condition c. ^ y ^ 0\A CMA-utV (A - 5. It was further agreed that if and when approval was obtained to action on these lines it would be well that the India Office /should see Mr# Baiiantyne informally ana indicate to him the course of action which H.M.G. had In mind, emphasising that this was not an indication of hostility towards the Company, but that the course proposed was one which appeared to be in the best Interests of both parties and, (ii the conversation jast-u-ied this) that would not be iound difficult in regard to the replacement of Major, Holmes and might be prepared to consider as a special caseSkinner, of whom they had now considerable experience. 6. It was recognised that it Major Holmes lost the post of chief Local Representative t hut was not excluded from Bahrein and Koweit, he would still he free to pursue his activities in tnose and other Sheikhdoms of the Gulf as a private individual or as the unofficial representative of oil interests, 'but the meeting generally felt that the blow to his prestige involved in his loss of the post of Chief Local Representative would he such as prejudicially to affect his position In the eyes of the local rulers concerned. ^ ^ ^-e.. OQmpan.v 's application for QXtension of the DrQa peGtiiig ihe meu uxng read the thi-ee letters dated 9th August from Mr. Ballantyne to the India Office,of which copies had been c irculated- and _ al so Mr. laithwaite 1 s letter of 8th August to Mr. Starling recounting a previous conversation with Mr. Ballantyne on the same subject, ft appeared that the Company had instructed fejbr Holmes on 9th August to press forward fmmediately application for one year's extension of the prospecting licence to 1^.34, which hau been put forward m ApM asan alternative to a proposal for an extension of the prospecting licence to :/ | 2.12.35,^.1^.35, coupled with an extension which of the area over/the Company could operate. Their intention, in other words, appeared to be to deal separately with the extension o the prospecting licence and the extension of area, which had bsconie involved with another as the result of the alternative proposal of April 1933.

The meeting in the first place considered whether the Company could demand as of right a further extension of the prospecting licence# it was agreed, in the light of sir iVaurice — rnt Gwyer s opinion of 18th May, that the answer was In the negative, and that the decision must rest with the Sheikh on an examination of the merits of the case# £he Petroleum iiept* expressed the view that the Company hadnow^done enough work to justify the aieikh in refusing any further extension and in claiming that they must select aa a^gregaue area of 100,000 acres under their mining lease on the expiry of the existing extension of the prospecting licence* In Mr# Starling's view the Company might threaten in reply to abandon the concession, but he thought xu unlikely that they would do so, and that any such threat would in any event be bluff, me Company clearly attached great importance to the possib'iHities of Bahrein. | ' 4 : : - - i;':' ^ 8/9. Further Investigation showed that the refusal of an extension of the prospecting licence would apparently !}e definitely in the Sheikh's int erest. In the first place, the A.P.O.G. had -X n* h/i (IS) now indicated that they would be unable to make a firm offer for the feaia balance of the islands until the precise area involved was know. This infornation would not be available until the Petroleum Company had taken up their mining lease. Secondly, a further extension might enable the Company to secure information of such a nature that they would have no longer any interest in acquiring a lease for the balance of the islands, while the A.P.O.G. might decide, in view of the aelay involved, to drop out altogether. Thirdly, refusal of an extension would mke it possible for the rtieikh to indicate his readiness to entertain offers in reepect of the balance of the islands, probably towards the end of this year, once the Company had (if they did) taken out a mining lease and selected their areas. With a definite area in issue better offers might conceivably be expected from the competing interests. Fourthly, the effect of refusal would be to secure at an earlier date than otherwise probable increased royalties for the Sheikh/Sheikh under the mining lease if the Petroleum Company proceeded to take one out. 10. on the other hand, the difficulty in securing modifications of the mining lease might be greater if we refused to meet the Company over the extension of the prospecting licence. The force of this argument was admitted. On the other hand, Sir ivaurice Gwyer's ^ F11% (3*} opinion made it clear that we could not demand such modifications except ex gratia , and could not make them a cond it ion of an extension of the prospecting licence. We should in any event he dependent for them on the goodwill of the Company.. It was agreed that, unsatisfactory as the position was, H.M.G. would not he Justified in advising the Sheikh to extend the prospecting licence merely on the chance that as a result the Company might he better disposed towards granting certain concessions in the mining lease (see in this connection paraSfla below). It was agreed that the Political Resident : should immediately be consult ed on the position generally in the telegram of which a draft is attached hereto. ll * Ms it ion of territorial wRteric under the 1925 Concession . Reference was made to the correspondence which had passed between trie India Office and the Petroleum/Petroleum Department (Mr. Lalthwaite ^ ( to Mr. Starling, dated 2nd August, paras. 4 and 5', and 9tn August). The Legal Adviser at the India Office, to whom the question had heen referred, had expressed the opinion that, although the matter might not he free from ciouht, he would himself hold that 8 the whole of the territories under his control' (Article 1 of concession of 1925) and %11 parts of the territoiy under the control of the Sheikh* (First Schedule Clause 1) were comprehensive enough to include territory lying below the jheikh's territorial waters. On the other hand the meeting, while admitting that this was the case, was disposed to think that in the light of the correspondence which had passed in regard to an extension of the concession/, the American interests were by no mean s sure of their position as regards territorial waters under the 1925 Concession. If this was the case, it might be possible, by agreeing to include territorial waters in the areaunder the prospecting licence, to make them mo re amenable as regards oui modifications in the mining lease. 12 * Amendment^ in the a ininK lease .

(c) when writing to the Company about the extension of their prospecting licence, it should be possible to introduce the question of the desired alterations in the mining lease, and while not making the latter dependent upon the former, to suggest that in view of the consideration extended to the Company in the past, His Majesty's Government anticioate * ^ tnat the Company will make no difficulties in respect of the amendment of the mining lease.

IffllAIT AND K PWAIT rJlU?RAT. 5, he posiuion in regard to the Kuwait concession is that uhe bidding has been called off bv the Sheikh. Lieutenant Colonel Fowle said that the situation had changed since the Sheikh had been given a free hand by His ^jesty s oro/srnmenu to choose between two original draft concessions. Those draft concessions, on which His Majesty's Government nad given their technical advice, had now been superseded, and the Sheikh realised that His Majesty's Government must be consulted in regard to any fresh proposals, and that until their views had been received he could not grant the concession to either side. Mr.Starling drew attention to Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 16th June covering a note by Colonel Dickson on the possible trend of events in Kuwait. He regarded this as rather disturbing and wondered/■ 5. wondered whether there was any further action which might be taken in the interests of the British Company which was endeavouring to secure the Kuwait concession. Colonel fowls thought that it was not desirable to do anything further at the moment. He had seen the Sheikh fairly recently. Lieutenant Colonel Fowle also said that the lull was partly due to the uncertainty in the Sheikh's mind as to the neutral zone. It is not yet known whether the Hasa concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company, includes the neutral zone. It is not unlikely that Ibn Sand added the neutral zone on the understanding that the Sheikh's consent would be obtained, and that the King has already approached the Sheikh on the subject. The probability is that things will work out as they did in 1924, i.e. that Ibn Saud will submit proposals regarding the neutral zone to the SSieikh and that the latter will refer the matter to His Majesty 1 s Government who will be left with the odium of anv reiusal. There is a possibility that Ibn Saud might, by means of one neutral zone, try to influence the Sheikh's decision in regard to tne Kuwait concession, Mr. Rendel expressed the view that if Ibn Saud tried to bring political pressure bo bear on the Sheikh of Koweit in order to force him to agree to the grant of a concession in the neutral zone to Ibn bauo. s nominees, there would be good ground for strong representations at Jedda. It was suggested that the value of the Kuwait concession depended on the value of the neutral zone, and Mr. Starling undertook to ascertain from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company whether they regarded a concession in the neutral I zone as an essential adjunct to the Kuwait concession. Mr .Rendel suggested that it might be possible to make a distinction between the neutral zone and Kuwait proper.The neutral zone had been created for political purposes to constitute a kind of buffer, or vacuum, bet7/een Nejd and Koweit. If we ?/ere to agree to this zone being exploited by foreign cortinercial enterprises, much of the object of creating the zone would be defeated. Might it not therefore be possible for H.M.Government to make a declaration that, on political grounds, they could not agree to any concessions being granted in the neutral zone? This declaration could be made to the Sheikh of Koweit who would pass it on to any of the commercial interests concerned. There was, however, one difficulty in connection with this suggestion. It was still possible that the Anglo- Persia.n Oil Company might acquire the Koweit concession and wish to exploit the neutral zone themselves, and it seemed undesirable to make any premature declaration regarding the neutral zone, the effect of which might merely be to prevent a British company from operating there. It was therefore suggested that the Petroleum Department should take immediate steps to ascertain whether the A.P.O.C. were in fact likely to be interested in the neutral zone. If they were not, the possibility of pursuing Mr .Rendel's suggestion could be further considered. Mr .Laithwaite said that he saw considerable advantages in the proposed declaration which would assimilate our policy in the neutral zone to our policy on the Trucial Coast, where commercial exploitation was also excluded for political reasons of a somewhat similar character.4745/38'. 17486. Sir, I have received from the Colonial Office a letter dated the 31st ultimo (18301/33) asking for my opinion on certain questions arising in connection with the Bahrein Petroleum Gompam^s Oil Concession in Bahrein, and I was requested in that letter to transmit my reply to the India Office by whom it was stated that the work connected with (j the Persian Oulf hitherto dealt with by the Colonial Office had been taken over on the 1st instant. In my opinion a reasonable interpretation of Condition C. scheduled to the Indenture of 12th June, 1930, is that the Bahrein Petroleum Co. is required in the ordinary course of business to have available at Bahrein a chief local V representative who will be regularly at his post save during such periods or such seasons and times as are normally to be regarded as proper periods of absence for a European employed in that place, regard being had to local climatic and other conditions. The use of the words ' chief local representative' suggests the possibility of a subordinate representative, who might no doubt be empowered to act as deputy for Major Holmes / in the latter's absence, though the papers referred to me with the letter of the 31st ultimo do not give any information on this point. But hov/ever this may be, it is not a sufficient answer for the \Gompany to say that they are satisfied that their own interests have not suffered by the absences of Major Holmes, since the other party to the Indenture of the t k J. ru-.h) Storev's G-ate, St. James' s Park, London, S.W.I. 4th August, 1933.2. 12th June, 1930, is entitled to complain if the Company have not observed Condition 0., and that Condition implies that Major Holmes will be available when the Sheikh or any local authority wishes to discuss with him as the Oompany's chief local representative any matters touching or arising out of the Concession. The constant presence of a representative with full powers is obviously desirable to ensure that all questions arising between the Company and the local authorities may be promptly dealt with, and in my opinion this is what Condition C. was intended to secure. As regards the interests of His Majesty's G-overnment, they appear to be safeguarded by the provision that all communications which the chief local representative of the Company may desire to address to the Sheikh shall be made through the British Political Agent in Bahrein. The additional provision that the chief local representative is to be a person whose appointment requires the approval of His Majesty's Government was no doubt designed to secure that he should be a person who might reasonably be expected, consistently with his duty to his own employers, not to act or advise the Company to act in a manner which might be detrimental to the interests of Hi&amp; M&amp;iesty's G-overnment - V «J ' ~ but there is in my opinion no implied term in the Agreement that Major Holmes is to be regarded, in the words of the letter of the 31st ultimo, as holding a watching brief for His Majesty's Government, the latter, as I read Condition C being content to rely upon their personal knowledge of the character of the person whose appointment they approved. The chief local representative is exclusively a servant of the Company and there is nothing in Condition G. which would entitle His Majesty's, Government to demand his __ I3 dismissal. Nor do I think that the olieikh will be entitled to determine the Agreement on the ground only that the Compo-ny nad refused to ciismiss Major Holmes; but if the Company persists in neglecting to maintain the chief local representative at Bahrein,whether Major Holmes or some other representative whose appointment has been approved oy Hiw MajestyGovernment, then I think that the Sheikh would have the right to ao so. I observe however that under the Agreement the question whether the cancellation of che Concession is justified on the ground that the Company have failed to conform to the terms of the Agreement is one which in the last resort falls to be determined by arbitration,and the question whether the Company's action or rather inaction in the matter of Major Holmes' frequent aosences, apparently with the Company's consent, from his post at Bahrein can reasonably be regarded as a breach of their obligations under Condition C, is one of fact and of degree, on which different persons might no doubt arrive at different conclusions. In my opinion there is certainly evidence on which an impartial Arbitrator could properly find that a breach of Condition C* has occurred; but I cannot affirm that an Arbitrator would necessarily take the same view.

Dear Starling, I enclose copy of a telegram from the rolitical 0 Resident about Bahrein oil, which is self-explanatory. It ^ 6 &amp; / /!«: '77 ({!£} is, I think, very satisfactory that the Sheikh should he / prepared to agree to a strict interpretation of Condition G of / the Schedule to the Indenture of 12th June 1930, and this ought considerably to strengthen our hands in dialing with Holmes 2. As regards Colonel Loch's second suggestion, we agree entirely as to the adTisahility of all negotiations on the part of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, whether written or SLoa J./fo. 77 oral, being conducted solely through the Political Agent. As the Resident points out, it is important to avoid any suggestion that we are discriminating against the Bahrein Petroleum Company, and apart from this, it is, I think, on general grounds desirable to concentrate discussions on oil questions in a single channel. If, as we hope, you agree, perhaps you will take the matter up with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company? 3.

Dear Starling, Will you Kindly refer to paragraphs 4 and 5 of (t* a iw*f i* r ' f %' i t my letter of ■ 2nd August, No .P.Z.4660/33, which dealt with the question of territorial waters in connection with Bahrein oil? 2. Since the date of that lettar we have, as you will have seen from Bushire telegram of 3rd August No.632, heard from the Resident that, subject to safeguards for harbours and ports, the Sheikh agrees to the inclusion of the territorial waters in the fresh concession for which the Bahrein petroleum Company have been given an opportunity to apply; to cover the area which will remain unallotted after a mining lease has been taken out by them under their concession of 2nd December, 1925. We are thus in a position to reply affiimatively to the Company if they raise the question whether territorial waters are included in the area for which they are invited to apply. 3.

The mining lease is equally in respect of 'the remaining portion of the whole of the territory under the conuroi of the Sheikh, including its territorial waters (but excluding the 100,000 acres mentioned in Article l) The area applied for equals about 97,920 acres ^j^) ^ ^* mirdly the leuuer from tne Eastern Gulf Oil Company Ho-500 , dated 24th October, 1929, to the 4-300-1910 Eastern and General Syndicate, of which copies were tt-u- 7c ] circulated under Colonial Office letter of 21st November, 1929, No.69035/29, in its penultimate paragraph reads as follows 'In as much as this additional concession would embrace an area of land slightly in excess of one half of the original concession of December 2nd, 1925, and inasmuch as the additional concession would be in large part over water, we feel that in agreeing to making' tho rentals and royalties the same as under the December 2nd2nd, 1925 concession a liberal offer has been made to the Sheikh'. 6., Aduittedly none of the documents quoted above is inconsistent with the view that territorial waters are covered by the 1925 agreement. No doubt my hesitations are groundless and merely due to my unfamiliar it y with the course of the correspondence and discussion which has taken place on this subject. But in view of the importance of the point it seems well to examine it, and perhaps you would consider it in connection with - v- - n ks i paragraphs 4 and 5 of my letter of 2nd August? 7. we have been considering whether there is any risk, in view of the reference to the Sheikh's 'territories' in the Agreement of December, 1925, of a claim being put forward by the Syndicate to rights in respect of Hawar and the area in Qatar to which a vague claim is maintained by Bahrein and to which Colonel Loch refers in his ^ ^ l ^ J nv SI ( HO Arc telegram of 23rd July 3327 to the Colonial Office. The exploration licence granted under the Agreement of 2nd December 1925 (from the area specified in which the areas underunder the prospecting license and mining lease must be selected) is, however, in respect of 'the whole of the territories under' the Sheikh*s 'control'; This seems clearly to exclude areas in Qatar and presumably also would exclude Hawar which belongs in my case geographically to Qatar, and is the westerrmost and largest of a group of islands just off the Qatar coast on the west side of the entrance of cuhat-al- Adhwan. The position in regard to any concession in respect 01 tne balance of the Sheikh's territories outstanding after the mining lease is taken up under the original concession will be safeguarded (as in .-our ✓ C s/li&gt;* / official letter of 1st August P.Z..4649/33 to the Bahrein Petroleum Company) by the use, as recommended by the Acting Resident, of the phrase 'Bahrein Islands'. 8.

This is an unofficial letter of explanation to you why I have not referred to the 'renewal' of the application which has already been made by this Company for an extension of the Prospectin^; Licence. I have since looked into the question and 1 find nowhere any justification for thinking that the application which was made originally in ( f tl ) April'last, has been dropped or rejected; in fact, the reverse is the case, as the sequence of events (including the preparation of the data and maps which were delivered to His Majesty'fc- Government under my letter to the Colonial Office of the 4th July 1933) indicates. Therefore, as it might be the cause of embarrassment to the Company to proceed on the basis of a new application, I am treating the matter as I think you will agree it should fairly be treated and not as I thought it might be treated when I spoke to you yesterday over the telephone. My apologies. Yours sincerely, fSgd). H.B. BALLANTYNE. fiA , G.

Pending the receipt of instructions from the Company I would refer to paragraph number 3 of your send letter and state it is my understanding that the pronosal of His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrein, as transmitted tnrough your Department, is that if the Company should desire to submit, within the given period of six weeks from the 1st August, 1933, a proposal for the so-called additional area, such proposal must provide for terms on tiie lines of those contained in paragraph number 2 of your said letter.

The Company would respectfully urge that its said application merits now an immediate and favourable answer. The Company's view is that in all the circumstances the extension asked for is reasonable and proper and one which should/should be forthcoming in the terns of the Concession Agreement of the 2nd December 1925.

Dear Colonel, Belgrave came to see me thie forenoon (6th, September 1933) to tell me in confidence how perturbed the Ri-m-i ^ hie Fairly are at the turn of events resulting in Major Holmes* ^ r A j, /t© ■ • letter of the Ist September 1933,in which he has indicated that it is possible that he may be relieved from his post. All join in praising Major Holmes* good work in Bahrain during the past years,i.e.,his finding of water and bringing the Oil Company to. work in Bahrain etcetera. 3. The Shaikh,who genuinely likes Major Holmes.is most perturbed at the thought that he should be thought responsible in any way for this drastic action by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Iiimited. The Ruling Family have been discussing the situation and though some of their ideas are fantastic, they feel genuinely aggrieved. 4. As for Major Holmes,they know that between him and the Americans there has been a difference of opinion for sometime and they feel that the Acnerloans have done all they can to get rid of Major Holmes and this is a result of their work. 5. They also feel that the .American Oil concerns have been getting too powerful and with too great a hold in the Gulf and Hasa,and, therefore,the British are determined to get a British Company in Bahrain,where it will be possible to compete with the Americans and oust them eventually. 6. The Ruler has plaintively asked Belgrave 'Why should Major Holmes be changed?*. 'Was an Englishman to relieve him?'. 'Was his successor liable to be changed at the Company's will without reference to him?'.B 2. 7. Shaikh Hamad feels that all eorte of things affecting him have been happening and going on over his head and that he has not had anything explained to him. He cannot 'believe that his letter complaining of Major Holmes* misrepresentations -can be the cause of all this upset. The letter was not meant i . ' ' ' , . i ■ 4 . . , * : ' to have any such effeels and was merely a part of the bargaining. 8. The Shaikh has even been discussing the matter with his wife,Aiyesha,who in conversation with Mrs .Belgrave showed that she knew all about the affair. 9. The Shaikh,who,as I said above,has a great personal affection for Major Holmes,would hate to have Major Holmes leave Bahrain in disgrace after so many years work in this place. 10. Probably on account of this anxiety he has gone out to JAU at the other end of the Island for an indefinite period. 11. The Shaikh and his brothers are dead against having anyone but an Englishman as Chief Local Representative,as they do not feel that they could work with him. These sentiments have been expressed by the Shaikh in his letter of the 14th ■: . . .. . • Jamad-i-Awwal 1352 (4th September 1933) sent you with my despatch HosC/399«lo/l.IV dated the 6th September 1933. 12.

He,himself,is f Iff in a position of great difficulty as it often bappono is impossible for him to explain to them the true aspects of the case as far as tney are known to him. ■ ' 13.

I am now to say that that construction is one which His Majesty's Government are unable to accept. The Condition is unqualified in its terms and intended to benefit both parties.

Dear Lnithwaite, With reference to your letter of to-day's date enclosing the two drafts about Holmes, I concur in the proposal to send the commmication to the Company in two parts, and hare no alterations to suggest to the two drafts. ^ 7 With reference to Loch's telegram 696, I have explained to you that there is nothing unusual in meeting water when drilling for oil, and this information need not affect our decision not to grant an extension of time. In fact the Company is fortunate in striking oil in each of the first three wells they have drilled. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Starling.

These two wells are situated almost in the centre of the island, and about 2t miles apart, in a diiection from Morth toj South# Mea ^r oil was encountered in these two wells at 248 and, 660 feet respectively. Wells Numoers 3 and 4 are still being drilled. Kumber 3 is situated to the North East of Number 2, and some heavy oil was encountered at 640 feet, lumber 4 is situated to the South West of Number 1. When the Report was made, the wells had leached the following depth:- lumber 1 2,008 feet in 7^ months (approximately) w 2 2,008 ' ' 4 » ( •» ' 3 1,650 ' ' 4| ' { « M 4 1,212 H ' l| ' ( ' ) * V .Li The site of a fifth well has been located at the liorth East corner of the island, and provisional work on it begun, and it ia stated that the Bites or two other wells are under consideration. The Company do not give any indication of the conclusions reached by their geologists, and in the circumstances 1 think we can hardly press them to do so. It seems clear that the Company, in asking for a further r extension of time, would like to De able to complete some more boreholes before choosing their areas, but we are of opinion that by December next they will have had enough time, and done enough work (judging fro* the rate of drilling of wells Mumbers 2, 3 and 4), to enable them to choose the area to which they are entitled for the purpose of the mining lease. In regard to territorial waters, we can say that there is some justification for excluding them, in view of the terms of the Agreement as to the exploratory period which only allows exploration of the surface of the Sheikh's territories to a depth of 20 feet. The failure to require them to indicate their areas for the prospecting period was unfortunate as this might have settled the question.

CONFIDENTIAL . ^ Note of an Interview with Mr. Baliantyne of the dahiem Petroleum Company, on the 23rd August, ' As agreed interdepartmentally I asked u. uallan uyne to conie to see me this afternoon to discuss the question of Major Holmes. p. x apologised uo Mr. Ballantyne for the delay L ts J /lo* nr in follov/ing up the Colonial Office letter of 28th July on the subject of Imjor Holmes's recent activities, but said that the whole question had now been carefully considered and a letter had been approved for issue to the Company, we were, however, very anxious to work on xrienaly terms with the Company, it being to both our interests to do so in so far as we were both concerned ) with j ah re in, and 1 had therefore been instructed to invite him to call this afternoon in order to give him the general line of the official letter before it issued and to emphasise that in despatching it we did so not f a om any sense of ho stiliXiy oo the Company, dut » with a view to remedying a situation which we felt was in the interest of neither party. 3. Mr. Ballantyne expressed his appreciation and I gave him the gist of the draft letter, culminating in the suggestion that Msgor Holmes should be replaced, in which event H.M.G, would release the Company from their obligation to retain him as Chief Local Hepresentative. 4. Mr. Ballantyne then remarked that he realised that H.M.G. aid not welcome Major Holmes's presence in Bahrein, and felt that the 'decision' (to use his/2 ~ his own word) which I had inttoiated to him was not a suddsn on©, nor woulci i't coni6 ftlljOgstliGi* ss ^ surpirlss to the Company. He felt that H.M.G. had for some time been working up to the position which it represented. The situation was not altogether an easy one. Ihe Company's Interests were purely cownerclal; they were anxious to work with an absence of friction, and it was arguable in addition that it Ao-o Dad x or the Company uo hctve as tneir Chief Local Representative in Bahrein a man with whom these difiiculties had arisen and who was serving two other oil Interests. This might he particularly the case now that the Company were starting to develop their concession. On the other hand, it might not he easy to aispense with IvBjor Holmes, while his replacement was a really serious difficulty and would require very careful consideration. We would recognise too that the Chiel Local Representative must be a person satisfactory uo the Company as well as to H.M.G. I agreed. 5* Mr. Ballantyne said that he would suggest that if this were possible H.M.G. should not now formulate their charges against Major Holmes. If they did, he thought it would be only equitable that Major Holmes should be given a chance to reply and confront the Sheikh with his (Major Holmes's) version of what had taken place, The result of this would be not only an acrimonious argument, which presumably H.M.G. did not want; but that iajor Holmes would ultimately be in a position to determine the time table. If it proved possible to take any steps for the replacement of the Chief Local Representative/3 Bepi eowuoative it vvas prooably to the interests both of and of the Company that It should, he done with uhe luinimum 01 irictIon. On the Question of time I would appreciaoe that if Ms,jor Holmes was to he replaced it would not oe reasonable to give trie Company a time limit of, say, a month in which to do it, or of two, or even oi three months. The problem of replacement would be oy no means an easy one. He suggested that the best course would be (with a view to giving him an opportunity to coriimunicate with his American principals) that the issue of our letter should be suspended for, aay, a lortnight or thereabouts, at the end of which time he would communicate further with me and might be in a position to offer some suggestion. 6. I said that I saw no difficulty in agreeing to this. It was to both our interests to reach a working agreement. On the matter of time, wMe we had no desire to fix a time limit for the Company he would appreciate that if the Chief Local Representative was to be replaced, his replacement should not be long delayed, for if it was it would defeat our whole object. Mr. Ballantyne said he appreciated this and would bear it in mind. On the question of the replacement of Major Holmes I said that if the Company were disposed to arrange for his replacement they would not find us difficult as regards the choice of a successor. We realised the ir difficulties in filling such a post and they would find us very willing to meet them half way. The suggestion had, indeed, been Informally made that Major Holmes might b e/\ - 4 - be succeeded by Wr. skinner, the present Field ilanager. - I coulci not) bay how tiiati would bo viewed, li iu were put up oiiicially, but thought it not improbable that as a comprouiise it might meet the case. Mr, Baliantyne oojecoed that kx» Skinner was an junerican. I said that I recognised tnat that was, of course, the case, and that while there was no specific term in the conditions of assignment requiring the Chief Local Representative to be a British subject we, as ne knew, had always attached great importance to the post being held by a British subject. Mr. Ballantyne agreed, if, therefore, Mr. Skinner's name were put forward and were to be accepted by K,M,G. in buostitution lor Major Holmes, it would probably be with a specific proviso that we considered that the post should ordinarily be filled by a British subject. We should certainly see strong objection to any suggestion to put In ah American of whom we knew nothing. But Mr, skinner, iiiough an American subject, had, we understood, got on very well with the local officials and population and was, therefore, known to us ana might be not unacceptable, ivir, Ballantyne took note of this ana, without making any definite statement, gave the Impression that the suggestion was one which might form the basis of a compromise. He mentioned that Mr. Skinner was, of course, a technical sxpert and not a statesman. Moreover he had the disadvantage that he was incapable of telling a lie. I ... ♦ saia that that might not be such a disadvantage from our Point of view. 8/f ] | - 5 - 8 ' ferlod of residence..of Chief Local Renresentative. f — jl ' ^ ivir• jDaxlanuyne referrsd 'to India Offics letiter of 21 st AugusOj No. p»Zi.ulOS/oo, on the subject of the ueriod of residence of the Chief Local Representative. He said he coulu not allow to get away with this construction, and proposed to write in about it. As the result of conversation it transpired that what Mr. Ballantyne was afraid of was that H.M.G. would use the fact that tejor no line s nad 'been a o sent for long periods prior to the date oi our letter from his post in Bahrein .as an excuse to determine the assignment of the concession, on the ground that the Company had failed to comply with its terms. I said that he would observe that, while it would no doubt be open to us to take this line, we had deliberately made no reference to it in our letter and that, speaking for myself, I thought, so long as the Company strictly adhered to the conditions in future (we had nine months* residence in the year in view) H.M.G. would be prepared to let bygones be bygones. If necessary he might write to me and ask for an official confirmation of 'this. Mr. Ballantyne expressed satisfaction and suggested that the question of uie period of residence might be left to stand over for about the same period as the question of the replacement of Major Holmes. He did not wish to suggest that the two were linked in any way, but there was a certain relation between the period of residence and the incumbency of the post of Chief Local Representative. I agreed. He added that as regards the specific period, nine months was no doubt a good bargaining figure on which to start. I said our starting figure, was 12 months, as we were advised on the highest legal authority that we could require the Chief Local Representative to spend 12 months of the year in Bahrein./ // - 6 - He replied tnat the matter was one on which it was desir ^Dle to avoid acrimonious controversy and reach a working arrangement, it could be considered further later. 9 * Ex pension of Fro spec tin p; Licence . Mr. Ballantyne said that he felt sore about the refusal to grant an extension of the prospecting licence. While not a technician himself he thought that the Company had proauced sufficient evidence to suggest that an extension //as dooiraole. He had not finished with this subject and would have to pursue it further. I said to ivir. Ballantyne that we were puzzled by Che piecise meaning of a statement alleged in a recent telegram from the Persian Gulf to have been made by kajor Holmes to the effect that he had cancelled the offer aade in his letter of 15th June and that the Company was not prepared to make a fresh proposal for the remaining area (Busnire telegram of 14th August, 681). On the fact of it this appeared to mean that the Company wished to disinterest themselves in the remaining area of Bahrein. Was this the case? Mr. Ballantyne replied that this was not the case; that the Company had impressed on Mtjor Holmes that in, the 11 i t /V / 1 % t light of the India Office letter of 1st August, No.P.Z.4649/ the Company must start its negotiations afresh and cancel previous offers; but that its headquarters in Sen Francisco had intimated that no offer should now be made 1X1 respect of the remaining area until further information was available as to prospects, we were not, however, to think that the Company no longer wished to consider the remaining area. ^'DIA OFFICE. 2 3rd August 1933.

The meeting first considered the position of Ifejor Holmes and the terms of the corrmunication to be made to the Company in continuation of India Office letter of _ A—- C' J*- ^ fi iS'.Ay&amp;Q Lf •* 1st August, No. F.z. 4649/33. 2. In the light of the opinion expressed by the t j , /u: Treasury Solicitor in his letter to the India Office of 4th August and of the fact that the Political Agent, Bahrein was understood to spend as a rule 9 months in Bahrein, and the Financial Adviser to the Sheikh, also a European, a longer period annually, it was agreed that H.M.G. could reasonably require the Company to maintain their Chief Local fiepresentative in Bahrein for a period of not less than 9 months in any calendar year. If, as was thought possible, ^ajor Holmes's health was such that it would not be possible for him to comply with this requirement, the difficulties which have arisen in connection with his activities might be solved, since the Company might find it necessary to ask us to agree to a substitute. ^ The meeting then discussed the line to be taken with Company on the question of the recent activities of the Chief/Ghiex Local Representative. .It was agreed, in the light of the opinions expressed Dy the Treasury solicitor and by the Legal Aaviser at the India Office, that there was nothing in Gomition G scheduled to the Indenture of 12th June 1930 which would entitle H.M.G. to demand Major Holmes' s dismibsal, he oeing exclusively a servant of the Company; and that s ince H.M.G. had approved the appointment of or Holmes tiiey had no further say under the terras of Condition G, (though they had of course the right to insist that the Company saw to it that the terms of that Condition were observed by Major Holmes) except that their consent would Dc necessary under trie terms of the Condition before the Company could determine his appointment. They would thus have to rely on being able to convince the Company that in tne inuerests 01 the company as well as those of H .M.G., it was desirable that Major Holmes should be replaced. The meeting also considered the possibility of advising the Sheikh of Bahrein to exclude Major Holmes from his territories, in view of his misrepresentations of His Excellency's attitude, but decided that the political and other objections to this course were so strong that it should not be considered save hi the last resort. 4. After exhaustive di suUt,sion oile conclusion was reacned that the best course would be, without requiring Major Holmes's dismissal, to Indicate to the Company the circumstances in which he had been appointed; the fact that 'tne basis of discussion had at the time been that the Chief Local Representative should be persona grata to H #M.G. as well as to the Company, in the interests of both parties; to add that the latest developments made it impossible for H.M.G. any longer to regard him as a satisfactory channel of communication or a satisfactory incumbent of the post; and to/to suggest that tne only satisfactory solution in their view in the interests Doth oi the Company and of H.M.G. would be ^ that ne Duould now be replaced. In the event of trie Company responding, n.M.a. on their part would be prepared to release ohe Company from their od ligation to retain iviajor Holmes under the terms of Condition C. It was agreed that a draft 00 tne company shouj.d oe circulated for concurrence* 0 * was ^urtner agreed that if&amp;nd when approval was obtained to action on these lines it would be well that the India Office should see Mr. Ballantyne iniorimlly before any Idut-er actually issued, and indicate to him the course of acuion wnich H.M.G. had in mind, emphasising that this was no t Qii -indication of hostility towards the Company, but that tne course proposed was one which appeared to be in the best interests of both parties and, (if the conversation justified this) that H.M.G. would not be found difficult in regard .to the replacement of Major Holmes and might be prepared to consider as a special case Mr. Skinner, of whom they had now considerable experience. It was recognised that if Major Holmes lost the post of Chief Local .Representative, but was not excluded from Bahrein and Koweit, he would still be free to pursue his activities in those end other Sheikhdoms of the Gulf as a private individual or as the unofficial representative of oil interests, out Colonel Powle had at sin earlier stage been of opinion that the blow to his prestige involved in his loss of the post of Chief Local Representative would be such as P'rejudicially to affect his position in the eyes of the local rulers concerned. ^• The Comoanv's application for extension of the ■££S jagecting licence . The meeting read the three letters aated 9th August from Mr. Ballantyne to the India Office, (P•2.4877-4879), of which copies had been circulated, and also 11 Mr./- 4 - Mr. Laithwalte's letter (P.Z.4750/33) of 8th August to M l. ouciling recounting a previous conversation with Mr. Ballantyne on tiie same subject. It appeared, that the Company he-.d instructed jor Holmes on 9th August to press iorward inniediate^ the application which he had made on theii oenalj- on 4th April 1933 for one year's extension, to 2.12.34; of ulie piObpecting licence. That application had been accompanied by an alternative proposal that the maximum aggregate area to be covered by the Company's mining lease siiould Le increased from 100,000 acres to 200,000 acres, and that tne prospecting licence should be extended to ,2nd ^Til m * rs ' / /» | 19^5. Tne effect of Major Holmes's appl ication of April 1933 ncid onus been to entangle the two questions of the extension oi the area to be covered by the Company' s operations .and of the extension of the Company's prospecting licence. Prom thti instructions wnicn the Company had sent to JvJajor Holmes S» / it i $ * ji on 9 on August, it appeared that their intention now was again to separate one two questions and deal with them independently. 8. The meeting in the first place considered whether the Company could demand as of right a further extension of the prospecting licence. It was agreed, In the light of ^ t ll - : ctx) Sir J^murice Gwyer's opinion of 18th May, that the answer was in the negative, and that the decision must' rest w ith the Sheikh on an examination of the merits of the case. The Petroleum Department expressed the view that with what had already been done and what c ould be done by December 1933, the Company should be in a position to reach a definite opinion on the area. The sheikh would therefore be justified in refusing any further extension and in claiming that they must select an aggregate area not exceeding 100,000 acres under their mining lease on the expiry of the existing extenslon of tie prospecting licence. It was suggested that the Company/- 5 - Company might threaten in reply to abandon the concession, fctout Mr. Starling thought it most unlikely that they would do so ana thao ii tney shoula, there would be no difficulty in getting another Company to take up the concession. In his viev the Company clearly attached great importance to the possibilities of Bahrein. I 9. Further Investigation showed that the refusal of an extension of the prospecting licence would apparently be definitely in trie Sheikh's, interest. In the first place, the A.P.O.G. had now indicated that they would be unable to make a firm oner xor the balance of the islands until the precise area involved was known. This information would not be available until the Bahrein Petroleum Company had taken up theii mining lease. Secondly, a further extension might enable the Company to secure information of such a nature that they would have no longer any interest in acquiring a lease for the balance of the islands, while the A.P.O.C. might ciecicie, in view 01 the aelay involved, to drop out altogether. Thirdly, refusal of an extension would make it possible for the sheikh to inaicate his readiness to entertain offers in ^ respect of the o alance of the islands, probably towards the l end oi this year, once the Company had taken out a mining lease ana selected their areas. With a definite area in issue better offers might conceivably be expected from the competing Interests. Fourthly, (on the assumption already made that the Company would proceed to take out a mining lease), the effect of refusal would be to secure at an earlier date than otherwise probable increased royalties for the Sheikh under the mining lease. On the other hand, the difficulty in securing modifications of the mining lease might be greater if we refu sed/f 1/1 J - 6 - rsfusea to fuest the Company ovsr the extension ox the prospecting ilcance. Ihe lorce of this argument was admitted* On the other hand, Sir Maurice Gwyer 's opinion made it clear that we could not demand such modifications as a conaition of an extension of the prospecting licence, rfe oiiould in any event to a large extent he dependent for thtjm on tile goodwill of the Company, although as had heen pointed out at previous conferences, this matter had already foxmed the subject of correspondence with the uompany, -md ri.IVi»G. had indicated that in return for oonceobiono alxaady granueo. go tne Company they had certain alueiations to suggesu in tne mining lease* It was agreed that, although there might be some difficulty on this aspect of the Question, ruk.ti, would not he Justified in advising one baoiKh uo extena uie prospecting licence merely on the Ciidncd uxiau as a result one Company might 'be oetter disposed towards accepting certain amendments in the mining lease ^ se^ In ohj-s connection paragraphs 11 and 12 below), It was agreed that the Political Besident should immediately be consulted on the position generally by cable (see telegram from Secretary of State for India to political Resident, No.2000 of ilth August 1^33). Positio n of territorial waters under the 1925 Concession Reference was made to the correspondence which had passed between the India Office and the Petroleum Department (Mr. Laithwaite to Mr. Starling, dated'2nd'August, P.Z.4660/ 33, paragraphs 4 and 5, and 9th August, P.Z,4857/33). The Legal Adviser at the India Office, to whom the question had oeen referred, had expressed the opinion that, although the matter might not be free from doubt, he would himself hold that 'the whole of the territories under his control' (Article 1 of Concession of 1925) and 'all parts of the territory/- 7 - ■territory unaer tiie .control of the Sheikh' (First Schedule Clause 1) were comprehensive enough to include territory lying below the aheikh 's territorial waters. On the other hand the meeting, while si mi t finer +h. + xo» uiixxw aaiiuouin^, tixat tins was tne case, wAbuiciposed to think 'thfit in tdTP i i ^H + ^^ ^ 111 L ' xl, -' J-i&amp;nt ox tne correspondence which nad passed in regard to an extension of the concession, the ijUcii lean interests were hy no means sure of their position as regards territorial waters under the 192.5 Concession.

On arrival he intimated that the Company, on a cons id era tion of the position as a whole in the light of our conversa- tion on 93rd August, and after consultation hoth with the Eastern and General Syndicate and with San ^ranclsco, had decided to replace Major Holmes straight away. intimation of his replacement would go to Mm by this week's air mail. He would he temporarily succeeded by Mr. Skinner, 'he question whether Mr. Skinner should 'be proposed as the permanent Representative was under reference to San Francisco and there might be some delay in reaching a decision on this point. Mr. Ballantyne desired to suggest in form all v on behalf of the Company that, in the interests (as he phrased it) of giving a kicking horse room to kick, and in view of the fact that Major Holmes was likely to take their decision exceedingly badly, we should hint to the political authorities in Bahrain that it might be desirable to avoid him until the contents of the air mail had had time to subside. He was likely other wise, they thought, possibly to create a scene and certainly to make accusations against British officials, etc. in a manner which might be very embarrassing. Mr. -Ballantvne added that the Eastern and (General Syndicate, who, in a discussion yesterday, had agreed to Major Holmes's dismissal and had undertaken to confirm this in writing, had, in fact, confirmed it in a very weak letter, copy of which had apparently gone to Major Holmes, suggesting that the Company might find some \ appointment/I 'N m -2- appointnent for hira locallv in fh* -..-u n '' c 11 1 J • Company were not prepared to do thl a.
