This was the first eon of the 1 st (Moscow) Grenadier Division from Tiflis; it was closely followed^ by the remainder of the Division with its brigade of artillery (48 guns) the tail of the column reaching the Russian camp on the 24th. v 'fU p • aS m ’ wboa PP earst o have been kept very imperfectly acquainted with the Russian movements, but who now learnt that the force in his front was beginning to receive strong reinforcements from Alexandropol, and was moreover informed by Ismail Pasha that 8 battalions had been detached from e orce under General lergukasoff to reinforce General Loris Melikoff* oidered 6 battalions to join him from his right wing on the 19th September. * 5?7vro Ascertained from captured despatches, see page 88.On the 23rd, however, the Russians moved a force of 7 battalions of the 39th Division, with 10 guns, from their camp at Kadikler across the Arpa-Chai to Kizyl-Kilisseh. The destination of this force was the vicinity of a lord on the left hank of the river, just above the village of Uzunkend, where it established and entrenched itself, thus menacing the rear of the Turkish positions; but Mukhtar Pasha, believing that this force was detached to reinforce General Tergukasoff, and receiving reports from Ismail Pasha that the forces in his front still consisted of 22 battalions (his own as before consisting of 36)—thus throwing considerable doubt as to whether the 8 battalions had been moved from Igdyr to Alexandropol, as previously reported—gave up the idea ot weakening his right wing for the present, having some doubts in his mind as to whether 'the Russians were not meditating an offensive movement against Ismail Pasha. , The position of a Russian force near the ford at Uzunkend did not, however, escape the Turkish general’s observation, and for the protection of so important a point of his position, he detached 3 battalions of infantry, with 3 mountain guns (afterwards reinforced by an additional battalion and 2 field guns), and caused them to be posted on the heights adjoining the villages of Tashnik and Kizylkuleh, opposite to and watching the Russian force near Uzunkend; the ground occupied was strong by nature and was further strengthened by field-works and entrenchments. On the 28th a Russian column of 6 battalions of infantry, 1 field battery, and 2 regiments of cavalry, coming from Ardahan vid Zarshat, ciossed the Kars-Chai, and took up a position near the village of Aktche-Boyoom, pushing forward some advanced posts to Yeni-Keui, on the Kars-Chai. Mukhtar Pasha, on receipt of this intelligence, ordered a regiment of cavalry to attack and drive the latter back, and on the morning of the 29th, according to Turkish accounts, there appears to have been an engagement,* after which the Russian force in question retired to Parget, where it encamped. The month of September was now drawing to a close, and it may be well to take a general survey of the state of affairs on both sides before proceeding to the more important events in October :— In the centre, before Kars, the Turkish forces had remained much in the same numbers and positions during the month of September, and little had taken place except occasional expeditions and raids of irregular cavalry on either side. The Turkish auxiliaries, emulating the feat of Mihr Ali, had on several occasions penetrated the Russian line of outposts, and intercepted their communications. These acts were retaliated on the other side much in the same fashion—some Russian cavalry, towards the end of the month, penetrating to Nakir-Cheevan and there setting fire to the dwellings of some Koordish chiefs attached to the Turkish camp, being perhaps the only incident worth mentioning. Mukhtar Pasha had, however, now^ to regret the withdrawal of his Circassian and Koordish auxiliaries in large numbers. Debarred from pillage, and receiving no pay from the Turkish Government, they had long since shown a spirit of dissatisfaction at the style of service they were engaged on, and now the approach of winter, together with the failure of grain and grass for their horses, furnished additional motives for their return home. The Turkish position before Kars, at the end of the month, extended from that fortress on the left (with 7 battalions forming the garrison of the place, and 7 battalions holding the intermediate hills, called the Yahniler or Yahni-Tepehs) to the village of Hadji-Veli, whence the 50 battalions remaining to complete the Turkish centre were aligned by Soubatan to Kizyl-Tepeh on the north, and from Kizyl-Tepeh by the Nakir-Chee-Tepeh to the village of Kozlayeh on the east, the triangle thus formed having its base passing through the village of Kerkhaneh, where the Turkish head-quarters were established. This position w r as of course far too extended for the force at Mukhtar Pasha’s * There appears to be considerable doubt as to this exploit of the Turkish cavalry, and from the part the latter played throughout the campaign it may reasonably be supposed that the Russians were not driven but retired from the position they had occupied for other reasons.73 S' 1 ',; 1 ’ f ;»” 't;™ &lt;« .. tb. m.i, , bln sr^ssfts^s; ;r„r b “ i - ii ” ^ rf *• “ h0l f i hlS P°? ltlon &gt; Mukhtar Pasha had 57 battalions of infantry (exclusive of the garrison of Kars), 10 batteries of field artillery (60 gunsf -T ntam ff’ ab S Ut . 1 ’ 800 re S' ,lar cavalr y (including some regiments 3' t ./„ a '! ved t 0D !

The weak point of this position was undoubtedly in the direction of Kars, and the J urkish communications ran parallel to their front in the direction of the town, involving risks which it is unnecessary to describe. The line of telegraph which had been established between Mukhtar Pasha’s head-quarters and the town, facilitated, it is true, the transmission of orders along the extended front, but on the other hand, the many deep and rocky ravines and ic general nigged character of the ground, were a great obstacle to lateral communications, isolating, in fact, to a great extent, the different strong- points which together formed the Turkish position. On the Russian side, very little change had taken place in the positions occupied by their forces during the month but towards its close, not only had stiong reinforcements arrived at Karayal from Tiflis and other places on the frontier, but the gaps in the battalions and squadrons had been made good by fresh batches of men from the interior of Russia. General Goutchine had, moreover, now replaced General Doukhovskoi as Chief of the Staff at head quarters, and many officers of distinction! had been sent from St. Petersburg and Moscow and joined the Grand Duke’s Staff apparently as advisers, the recent failures having, it appears, been attributed to a certain extent to generals who had gamed their reputation in Caucasian warfare. General Lazareff succeeded General Dewel in command of the 40th Division, and Generals Count Grabbe, Von der Schink, Komaroff, and Rydreowski were appointed to commands. General Philippoff, Chief of the Staff to General Tergukasoff, appears also to have been appointed to the Grand Duke s head-quarter Staff. During the night of the 30th September, the Russian force at Uzunkend (seven battalions and eight guns), which had been reinforced on the preceding day by two regiments of Cavalry from the forces before Kars and at Kulpi, crossed the Aipa-Chai, and at daybreak attacked the Turkish force that had been posted on the opposite bank in the hope of surprising and overwhelming it before assistance could arrive. At the same time a force of four battalions, 3 regiments of Cavalry and 2 batteries of field Artillery v r ere pushed forward to make a demonstration towards the Turkish right wing, and succeeded in causing considerable stir and alarm in the Turkish camps before dawn. As day broke, however, it became evident to the Turkish General, from the smallness of the Russian force in the field and the little vigour with which the attacks were pushed forward, that nothing more than a feint was being made in this quarter, the object of which w r as not discovered until the sound of distant firing and the arrival of messages from the isolated detachment covering the right rear of the Turkish position, apprised Mukhtar Pasha that , These battalions had been countermanded by Mukhtar Pasha, but they had left Ismail Pasha s force before the order arrived and reached Kagisman on the 30th September f They arrived on the 1st October. X Among- others, General Obrutcheff, President of the Scientific Committee at St. Petersburg He was afterwards transferred to the army of the Danube, when the success of the Russian armv in Asia was assured. Jthe feint in his front, on his right wing, was evidently intended to cover some thing more serious in the direction of the Arpa-Chai. Two battalions of infantry and a body of cavalry under Ghazi Mohammet Pasha (Schamyl’s son) were now dispatched to the scene of action, but before their arrival (the distance to be got over being not less than 15 miles), the 4 Turkish battalions (weak in rank and file and armed with the Snider rifle) under Ali Chefket Bey had not only successfully repulsed the repeated assaults of the Russians, but taking the offensive, had driven them over the Arpa-Chai with heavy loss, the want of cavalry, according to the Turkish Commander, only preventing the Turks from capturing the Russian guns whilst in the act of fording the river. According to Turkish accounts the Russians left 400 killed in front of the Turkish entrenchments. Battle of the Yahni-Tepeh. Ever since the arrival of the 1 st (Moscow 7 ) Grenadier Division (16 battalions and 48 field guns) and 2 regiments of cavalry from Tiflis, a grand attack had been contemplated on Mukhtar Pasha’s position, and after considerable delays and postponements, owing, it is supposed, to the divided opinions of the Grand Duke’s head-quarter staff, it w r as finally determined to attack on the 2 nd. The object now to be attempted was, briefly, to sever the communications of the Turkish forces with Kars by seizing the Lesser Yahni- Tepeh, whilst they were threatened along their front, and at same time attacked in rear by a force which was to cross the Arpa-Chai somewhere near Uzunkend and seize the summit of the Aladja Dagh. The arrangements finally made to carry out the above was somewhat as follows: on the right. General Roop, with a brigade of the Moscow Grenadiers and the Division from Ardahan (8 battalions, &amp;c.) was to assault and carry the Lesser Yahni, whilst the Great Yahni was masked by the other brigade of same Grenadier Division; next to him, General Heymann with the Caucasus Grenadier Division was to close with and engage the enemy from Soubatan to Hadjiveli to prevent him reinforcing his left and to divert his attention from the real point of attack ; and on the left the Kyzil Tepeh was to be heavily bombarded and threatened together with the Turkish extreme right by General Lazareff with the 40th Division, whilst General Schelkownikow, with 5 battalions, 1 regiment of cavalry and 4 mountain guns, was to seize the summit of the Aladja Dagh, and descending from it attack the Turks in rear. Three regiments, forming the garrison of Alexandropol w 7 ere also brought to the Kara-Yal to hold the camps and positions during the coming engagement, and act as a reserve to the 40th Division should this be necessary. The total force thus brought to bear on Mukhtar Pasha was some 45 or 50 battalions of infantry, 5 or 6 regiments of cavalry, and from 15 to 16 batteries ot field artillery, exclusive of General Schelkownikow’s column and the troops left to guard the Russian positions on the Kara-Yal, &amp;c. As will be seen later on, these dispositions on the part of the Russians, though certainly in advance of the tactics hitherto practised by them, were still defective, inasmuch as the mass of their strength was by no means directed to the points where the resistance of the Turks w 7 as to be overcome; and their forces, though everywhere superior to those of the Turks, were neither able to crush the latter in the defence of the key of the position—the Lesser Aahni—nor direct a serious turning movement on the Aladja Dagh. lour day s rations were issued to all the Russian troops on the 1 st in stant, and during the night the tents in both their camps were struck and by daylight on the next day sent to the rear, together with all their heavy baggage, on the road to Alexandropol j so well indeed was all this carried out and their plan for the 2 nd concealed, that it was not until daybreak on that day when their batteries were all in position ready to open fire that the Turks discovered the serious nature of the attack intended, and found how completely they had been surprised. 'I he Russian guns now opened fire simultaneously on the three salients of the Turkish positions—viz., the Kyzil-Tepeh and the two Yahni-Tepehs, their inlantry and cavalry being drawn up in extended order between the batteries75 bonibardin^the^TnrSh R 'v' an F?* had ’ h ° WevCr ’ scarce l v commenced r P e j^ U1 ? 1S ,^ P osltlons before an attack was made on the village of SfcVZl tUcf S USSianS „ had J )Ushed for '- d 2 batteries of field artillery to shell the camp ot Hussein Hami Pasha near that place.

Thus the objective of the Kussums, who were always perfectly informed as to the number and disposition ot the lurkish troops, was now clearly to the Turkish General, if not the capture of Kars itself by a coup de main, at any rate the interception of the lurkish communmatmns with that place and with Erzeroum, which latter object if attained, considering the defective state of the Turkish commissariat, would b av ® ^olved an issue almost equally pregnant with disaster. With the tall ot the Yahni-Tepehs its attainment would undoubtedly have been assured but it must be admitted, and is reverently acknowledged by Mukhtar Pasha that on this occasion the “Kismet” of the Turkish soldier was as transcendant as the generalship or “ Truppenfuhrung” of the Russian leaders was as obviously at fault. The conduct indeed of the Turkish General and the coolness and readiness of resource manifested by him under the emergency, in spite of his evident anxiety at the seriousness of the crisis, are described by a competent eye-witness as worthy of the highest admiration. By 9 o’clock the Russians had succeeded in taking the greater Yahni- Tepeh*, an acquisition in itself of little importance, and the only one they really gained during the day, the remainder of which they wasted in construct ing well-finished batteries for the bombardment of the lesser Yahni, and in vain attempts to carry it by repeated assaults, in which they emploved no less than 30 battalions, supported by the fire of a formidable array of artillery. The stubborn defence of the lesser Yahni of which the credit is chiefly due to Liva Mohammed Pasha (the “ Captain,” Mohommed Bey of Ardahan) who commanded there, together with the delays practised by the Russians, now gave Mukhtar Pasha time and opportunity of remedying the weak points in his position, and checking the Russian advance. He lost no time in at once vigorously driving back the Russians troops advancing on Hadji-veli thereby clearing the direct way to the Aulia-Tepeh, and after the former place had been secured with 2 battalions and some field guns, proceeded under its cover to form a force under the command of Ferik Rashid Pasha to threaten the flank of the Russians operating against the latter place, and prepare the way for the reoccupation of the heights of Vezinkeui. The latter operation though unavoidably delayed until the following morning, was, fortunately for the Turks, effected before the Russians had recovered from the check they had sustained before the lesser Yahni. The Turkish General further ordered to the front 4 of the Gt battalions posted atTashnik, and despatched messengers to hasten the arrival of the six battalions coming from Ismail Pasha’s force the arrival of which at Kagysman two days pre viously had been reported. Perceiving also the real object of the Russian attack, he instructed Reis Ahmet Pasha by telegraphj to make a sortie from Kars with four battalions§ and a field battery, in order to create a diversion on that side in favour of the Turkish troops holding the Yahni-Tepeh, and learnt with no * * * § * The Russian brigade ordered to mask the Great Yahni-Tepeh, finding it weakly held, attacked instead of masking it only. f Including the 2 battalions sent there in support on the 1st inst., but the order miscarried, and the distance being considerable these battalions did not arrive till the following day. f Telegraphic communication was soon afterwards interrupted. § According to Russian accounts, they were attacked by 13 battalions from Kars. U76 small satisfaction in reply that the two battalions and two batteries expected from Erzeroumhad arrived just in time to take part in this movement finally the Mushir directed 8 battalions with 2 field guns under the command of Liv, Shefket Pasha and Ibrahim Bey-son of Namyk Pasha (who had a hoise shot under him on this occasion)—to repel the threatened attack of Ge Schelkownikow on the Turkish rear by at once occupying the summits of the Aladja-Davh or by dislodging the enemy if he should anticipate them in ta ’ing nossession!’ Unfortunately for the Turks, the latter was found to he case, and the Russians were already posted in the old Turkish entre , ncl ™f V th mountain, some 1,000 feet above where the Turkish General stood, before Turks sent to attack them reached the upper slopes. It was at once clcai t the position could not be retaken without a severe struggle and corresponding Joss' Retaken it was however by dint of hard fighting in a comparatively short space of time, and before 2 p.m. the Russians had been fairly driven out of their trenches and thence pursued over the plateaux and down the ravines and reverse slopes of the mountain to the banks of the Arpa-Chai, where the wa of cavalry on the Turkish side alone prevented their utter rout and discomforture with the probable loss of their mountain guns. n In the meanwhile, the bombardment of the Kizyl- Tepeh (held by 0 e Pasha’s Division) accompanied with severe fighting at its base and repeated attacks on the lesser Yahm-Tepeh continued during the day without mtermission, and it was not until evening that the successful resistance of the lurks was finally confirmed at the latter point, the possession ot which they fully felt was of such vital importance. For had the Russians succeeded here in good time, or had they masked the lesser Yahni and at once proceeded to occupy the Aulia-Tepeh and the heights of Vezin-keui (where they would have found leady to hand the vacant entrenchments formerly constructed by the Turks), establish- ino- themselves at the same time on the hanks ot the Kars-Chai in the direction of the town, they must have effectually closed the road to that place—thus compelling the Turks to take the offensive against superior forces—and probably baffled every attempt on their part to re-open it. Nor is it to be argued that the Turks might have turned the tables upon the Russians by a counter-attack on their positions covering Alexandropol and their communications which t ey would then have exposed. The Russian camps had, it is true, been raised, but the hills on which they had been pitched—the Kara Yaland the Utch-lepe —- had been so solidly fortified, as well as another strong position near 1 ir Ah (halt way to the frontier), as to be practically unassailable, or if stormed by the lurks in a succession of desperate efforts, to have entailed on the latter such a sacrifice of life as to defeat the end they had in view, and which the military resources of the Porte could certainly not justify; moreover, by widening the distance of the Turkish forces from their base, the difficulties of provisioning them would have been much aggravated, in what, after all—with the regulaily fortified town of Alexandropol in their front—must have eventually proved hut a barren conquest. # . J ^ , The reverses suffered by the Russians in their attempts to take the lesser Yahni-Tepeh appear to have paralysed their energies for the time; lor, although their forces bivouacked on the ground, they made no effort on the following day (‘ 3 rd) to retrieve their defeat; but, instead of renewing the attack along the whole line, as was fully expected—with no little concern—by the Turks, confined themselves to a strictly defensive attitude during the process ot removing their killed and wounded, and were' content the ivhile to exchange an artillery fire with the Turkish batteries or to repel the counter-attacks of the Turks from various points, wherever the opportunity was afforded the latter of striking a blow without advancing too far beyond the cover of their own field works. The most serious of these engagements appears to have taken place in the afternoon of this day between the 40th Russian Division, sup ported by the three battalions of the Alexandropol garrison, and a force of Turkish infantry making an offensive movement in the direction of the Kara Yal from Soubatan and the Kyzil-Tepeh, both sides being supported by a numerous artillery. The 40th Division lost, it is said, some 700 killed and wounded in this affair, and the Turks not less than 400 ; though, had General Heymann taken the latter in flank, they would, in all probability, have suffered far more severely. Some recrimination, it is said, took place afterwards on77 this affair between Generals Lazareff and Heymann. A Russian official bulletin, dated Kara Yal, 4th, gives the losses on their side on this day as 3 officers and 40 men killed, and 11 officers and 250 men wounded. r l he same inaction continued on the 4th, when at length, at 8 p.m., the Russians began to draw off their forces; but, being continually followed up and harassed in their retreat, they made a stand at Xabak-Tepeh, when the Turks also stopped, and both sides remained on the defensive, and exchanged a lively artillery fire till dark, without collision, Rachid Pasha then re-occupying the Great \ahni without opposition.^ The Russians were, however, obliged to bivouac on the ground in considerable force and did not finally retire to their old positions behind the Kara Yal until the forenoon of the 5 th, leaving a brigade of the Moscow Grenadiers entrenched on the Kabak-Tepeh and to the south and east of it; here it bivouacked for the night, but again retired on the 5th, leaving outposts only, and occupying the ground at Kadikler with a regiment of cavalry, distributed in the villages. They at the same time withdrew, from Uzunkend, but still held the Utch-Tepeh with outposts at Kizyl Kilisseh. As an illustration of the caution with which their reverses in this part of the theatre of war had inspired the Russians, the battlefield is described by an eye-witness as literally ploughed up and seamed on every side with rifle-pits and shelter-trenches, dug by them in their first advance upon the Turkish positions or in the successive steps of their retreat, both to secure the left flank and rear of their main column advancing on the Yahni-Tepehs and Kars, as well as to repel the expected counter-attacks of the Turks. The Turkish losses in the fighting from the 1 st to the 4th October inclusive, amounted, according to their official returns, to 2,500 killed and wounded. Of these, 800 were killed and wounded (amongst fhe former 6 Bim- bashis)f at the Lesser Yahni. Omer Pasha’s Division lost 117 killed and over 400 wounded in the defence of the Kizyl-Tepeh ; and Moussa Pasha’s Division, 56 killed and about 200 wounded, at Soubatan. The remaining losses ivere chiefly sustained at Tashnik and Kizyl-Kala, on the Aladja-Dagh, at Hadji- Veli, and in the counter-attack from Kars, but details are wanting on the numbers at each place. The Turks lost some 300 prisoners.;); The Russian losses must have been undoubtedly very heavy, especially in their repeated attacks on the Lesser Yahni, and are estimated by a competent eye-witness at not less than 5,000 killed and wounded. Pour prisoners were taken by the Turks. According to a Russian official despatch, dated Kara Yal, 4 th October, their losses on the 1 st amounted to 9 officers and 1,000 men killed, and 60 officers and 2,000 men wounded; and, on the 3rd, to 3 officers and 40 men killed, and 11 officers and 250 men wmunded. A despatch of the Chief of the Staff of the Caucasus Military District afterwards gave the losses as 472 men killed, 2,540 wounded, and 70 missing in the two days’ fighting. According to the “ Invalide Russe,” the Russian losses were 83 officers and 3,300 men killed and wounded ; and according to the “ Moscow Gazette,” there were 2,679 men wounded alone. From the official returns of officers killed and wounded, the troops engaged appear to have belonged to the Caucasus Grenadiers, the 1st (Moscow) Grenadiers, the 19th, 20th, 38th, 39 th and 40th Divisions, some battalions of Caucassus Chasseurs, together with their respective artillery brigades in whole or part. Mukhtar Pasha’s force had a narrow escape in this battle. Had the Lesser Yahni fallen and had the Russians made an attack by a coup de main on Kars, that fortress, in all probability, we are informed on excellent authority, would have been taken. In either case, the Turkish communications must have been severed. The defective state of the Turkish transport, commissariat and administrative services needs no description. They were conspicuous by their absence, and, with the army entirely dependent upon Kars and Erzeroum for its supplies and living from hand to mouth with only one day’s provisions in camp, the critical position of the Turks on the Aladja Dagh—opposed as they * * According to the Russians they were obliged to abandon the Great Yahni from want of wa ^ er&gt; f Battalion commanders. x 140 prisoners were taken by the Russians at the storming of the Great Yahni-Tepeh.78 were to a superior enemy ever ready to attack them and with their line o retreat passing along the rear of their positions— may easily be imagined. Owing to the want of an efficient cavalry, the Turkish Army was com pletely surprised on the morning of the 2 nd; nor was this arm on their si e able or fit to cope with that of the Russians in the field or fan &amp; i • e Tf 1 *S portion of the Turkish horse were massed in the open between the Aulia-i epeh and Vezin-keui during the fighting, and an eye-witness describes them as declining a combat with a single regiment of Russian cavalry which advanced unsupported to engage them to within range of a Turkish battery, from the fire of which it suffered some loss in consequence. Such, indeed, was their quality and the condition of their horses from insufficient nourishment, that little or no advantage could be expected from their further employment, at any rate during the present campaign. Their numbers, indeed, as was shown by a recent muster, had diminished, chiefly by the desertion of irregular horsemen, to an extent far greater than had been supposed, and the total number now available for the field did not exceed, according to the best authority, 3,000 sabres. The Russians, it may be observed, brought a less numerous cavalry into the field on this than on former occasions. This may probably be accounted for by their having detached a considerable force of this arm, it is supposed, to their left wing at Igdyr, where the services of cavalry were more urgently required in the open'country round Erivan, to check the incursions of the Turkish irregular horse. During the period from the 5th to the 8 th, the Russians slowly concen trated their forces at Kerek-Dereh and re-occupied the Kabak-lepeh, still holding the Kara-Yal and the Utch-Tepeh. By the 8 th, they were in strong force behind and to the west of the Kara-Yal, and Mukhtar Pasha, coming to the conclusion that they intended to force his positions at Soubatan and lladji- Veli, determined to abandon these two points together with the Kizyl-Tepeh ; he at the same time ordered five battalions from Pennek to reinforce the garrison of Kars, and 10 battalions to join him from his right uing. These steps were determined on with a view of eventually retiring to winter quarters at Kars, where his forces would be safer than in their present exposed position. The want of transport, however, now began to be felt more than ever, and the Turkish General could only hope to move his force by steps and relays, carrying most of his baggage, stores, and reserve ammunition on casual pack animals and the backs of his soldiers. On the 6 th and 7 th, the Russians received large reinforcements, of all arms, via Alexandropol, though the Divisions, &amp;c., to which these troops belonged are not precisely known. In addition to the complete Division from Russia (the 1 st (Moscow) Grenadiers) and the brigade from Ardahan, the Grand Duke had now been further reinforced by 10 battalions from his left wing and 6 battalions from Soukoum Kaleh, and the total force now at his disposal, as will be afterwards shown, consisted of not less than 61 battalions of infantry, 69 squadrons and sotnias of cavalry and Cossacks, and 246 guns/''* r lhis formid able concentration now enabled the Russians to repeat, on a somewhat larger scale, the tactics that had failed in the recent fighting. It was therefore determined to send a larger force to cross the Arpa-Chai, in rear of the Turkish positions, and take Mukhtar Pasha in reverse whilst he was attacked in front by the main body; thus repeating, on a larger scale, what had hitherto been tried only by small bodies (viz., on the 1 st and 2 nd instant). Lieut.-General Lazareff was accordingly detached from the main body on the night of the 9 th, with a combined Division consisting of 17| battalions, 22 squadrons and sotnias, and 70 guns; he was to march by Kegatch and Koschevan to Uzunkend, where he was to pick up the detachment posted there of two battalions and a regiment of Cossacks, and crossing the Arpa-Chai, advance by Digor, Bazardjik, and Orlok, and attack the Turkish positions at Yezin-keui. He was further to be joined, en route, by a detachment consisting of 4 battalions, 2 sotnias of Cossacks, and 8 guns, under Major-General Tsytovitch, coming from General Tergukasoffs force, via Hadji Bairam. The latter was also directed to push a strong cavalry force to reconnoitre towards Kagisman and intercept any * * Exclusive of the detachment coming from Igdyr to Digor, and which joined General Lazareff on the 12th at the latter place.79 plaofdTdT/Gen^nl^ fr0m „.^ m f 1 . to Pasha.

' of th , e Kizyl-Tepeh—threatening, as it did, the Russian camps— Strate ^ , ; aI objects Of covering Kars and the communi cations of the Turkish forces in the field with that fortress and Erzeroum. The advantages, indeed, of holding the Kizyl-Tepeh had been more than counter- balanced by the reinforcements which the Muchir now knew the Grand Duke ad received; and the former, it may be fairly argued, showed sound judgment in at once coming to the conclusion that it was better to abandon the forward positions he had occupied since the 25th August, and decision and promptitude m at once carrying out the retrograde step when determined on. But however desirable the step may have been from a strategical or tactical point of view, it undoubtedly had the most disastrous effect on the morale of the Turkish troops, they appear, as will afterwards be seen, to have lost all heart on jemg oidered to abandon the Kizyl-Tepeh—a position they had won in fair fight, and to hold which they seem to have made a point of honour in con sequence. Desertion, too, which had lately been greatly on the increase, now gained a tresh impetus, and we find Mukhtar Pasha stating in a telegram on the 12 th or 13th, that upwards of 700 men deserted on the 9th or 10th. the night of the 8 th, the Turkish forces were successfully withdrawn rom Hadji-\ eli, Soubatan, and the Kizyl-Tepeh to their former positions— 4 miles to the rear, on the higher slopes of the Aladja-Dagh—which they had quitted on the 25th August; but at daylight the Russians, who, it appears, were always kept fully informed of every move that took place in the Turkish camps, advanced in force, and at 9 a.m. had deployed in formidable strength from behind the Kara-Yal, and opened fire on the Turks from some 60 pieces of artillery. Before, however, the attack was fully developed—the formidable preparations for which now showed how right Mukhtar Pasha had been, in his \iow of the situation in ordering a timely retreat to a stronger position—the Turks had firmly established themselves in their old lines with°all their baggage and camp equipment safely lodged in rear, save some 800 boxes of ammunition and a quantity of commissarat stores which had been left at Kerkhana, and which, owing to that place being under the fire of the Russian guns, could not be removed till the followirig night. The attack, it appears, was planned for the same or following day, and, had it found the Turks in their old positions, or on the move—as the Russians probably expected—the results would, in all probability, have been different. As it was, the attack was not pushed home though the artillery fire continued till dark, the Turks in their entrenchments only sustaining a loss of some 150 killed and wounded. The Russians, owing to the nature of the engagement, must have suffered more severely; their losses, however, are not precisely known ; they are estimated by the Turks at 1,200 killed and wounded—a figure undoubtedly very much exaggerated; on the other hand, according to their own accounts, the Russians only lost 10 officers, a chaplain, and 132 men wounded (no mention is made of the killed), which is evidently below the mark. During the day, the Russians advanced to the line Hadji-Veli, Soubatan, and Kizyl-Tepeh, and at night bivouacked in force in the positions abandoned by the Turks ; they next day mounted 2 siege guns on the Kizyl- Tepeh, ftom which they threw occasional shells against the Kakir-Chee-Tepeh, but beyond some slight movements within their own lines, nothing of importance occurred on this or the following day. On the 12 th, about noon, a large body of Cossacks made a reconnaissance towards the Great Yahni-Tepeh which w r as now unoccupied by the Turks, but shortly afterwards retired, on coming under the fire of the Turkish batteries on80 the Aulia-Tepeh and at Vezinkeui During the i't seized the Great Yahni, unobserved apparently by the Turks a P°, with 3 battalions and a battery of artillery opened fire on the Little Yahm and Vezinkeui at daylight the following day (13th). The positions occupied by the Russian forces were on y f0ll ° General Heimann with 24 battalions 8 squadrons anc ’ guns, occupied the Great Yahni with a brigade (Scbaak), Hadji-\ eh i . brigade (Avinon), and Soubatan with the remainder as a reserve under Soloview; on his left General Kouzminsky, with 8 battalions, 1 s o tnia *’ and 24 guns,' was posted in front of the Kizyl-Tepeh-towards Kerkhana and Tainalykha—with his cavalry covering Ins left flank. General Dehn, with battalions, 8 squadrons and sotmas, and 40 B , was posted at Gulverein as a general reserve and General C°unt Grabb Kapak-Tepeh with 3 battalions, 3 sotmas, and 8 guns to cover the 'S 11 and act as a support to Count Wittgensteins Cossack force of 20 sotmas, posted at Enghi-Keui, on the Kars-Chai. i n n onrl Tiplm w^re The forces under Generals Kousminsky, Count Grabbe, and Dehn placed under the orders ot General Roop. . frk In these positions the main forces of the Russians awaited the signal to attack from General Lazareff whose head-quarters were connected with the Kara-Yal by the field telegraph, protected by posts of Cossacks. At daylight on the 13th, a diversion was made by the luiks, both from Aulia-Tepeh and the Lesser YTrhni, against superior forces of the Russians near the Great Yahni-Tcpeh ; the Tepeh itself was held by 3 battalions and a field battery, and the Turks threatened it with 6 battalions, supported by some artillery from the Aulia-Tepeh and 7 battalions from the Lesser Yahm-Tepeh. According to the Russian accounts, the Turks were repulsed, losing some men, but it does not appear as if the affair was intended to be more than a demonstration on the part of the Turks, and certainly no serious attempt was made by Mukbtar Pasha to recapture the post. . , „ The Russians, in the course of this day, mounted 3 siege guns at Radji- Veli and commenced a continual shell fire night and day on the Auha-lepeh and Turkish head-quarter camp. TT . Tr . The Turks now held the lesser Yahni with 10 battalions, Vezm-Kem with some 15 battalions, and the Aulia-Tepeh with 4 battalions; some 30 battalions held the Aladia-Dagh, including posts on the Liaret and Nahlend iepehs. Mukhtar Pasha was joined on the 13th by 6 battalions from the rig wino-. Of the 10 battalions that had been ordered to join him, Ismail Pasha would only consent to part with 6 ; these arrived at Vezin-Keui on this day, having encountered and beaten off en route 2 regiments ot Russian cavalry from Digor. The G battalions previously ordered from the right wing had been recalled by Ismail Pasha! . A , In the meanwhile, General Lazareff had reached Digor with the head ot his column on the 12th, with his advanced guard at Akriak, having picked up en route the (detachment at Uzunkend and been joined at Digor by General Tsytovitch’s force from Hadji Bairam. In consequence of the forced maiches his troops had executed, a day’s rest was now given them in these positions. On the morning of the 11 th a reconnaissance was made towards Bazardjik and Hadji-Halil and a strong Turkish force was reported in a position near the former place. In the course of the morning a portion * ot the advanced &lt;&gt;’uard were pushed forward under General Loris Melikofff to seize some strong ground near the Turkish position. This was apparently done without opposition, the Turks being taken hy surprise, but the Russian advance guard was now threatened by the 3 battalions near Bazardjik and 6 battalions from Hadji-Halil,t and some sharp fighting occurred, through the Russians, being * 4 battalions, 2 companies of sappers, 1 regiment of dragoons, 1 regiment of irregular cavalry, and 14 guns. t Not the Commander-in-Ghief. v j r + According to the “Golos” General Lazareff found himself confronted by a strong body ot Turks, which had been sent from the Aladja Dagh, and occupied strong positions at Bazardjik on the south-western extremity of the Orlok heights—and as this contingency was not foreseen, he telegraphed to head-quarters for instructions. General Loris Melikoff immediately sent an order to occupy the important positions on Shatiroglu, and on the two heights flanking that hill m iront81 rapidly reinforced, soon established themselves in force on the positions seized and pushed forward towards Vezin-Keui.* About noon, apparently, Mukhtar Pasha received intelligence that the enemy was advancing in force from Digor and w r as threatening his position in the direction of Vezin-Keui. He was soon afterwards informed that his troops holding the Tiaret Dagh, covering Vezin-Keui, were attacked in force, and that being taken somewhat by surprise, had been anticipated in the occupation of an important hill and had in consequence been obliged to yield a portion of the ground they had taken up to bar access to the valley of the Kars-Chai The Turkish General, now it 'would seem for the first time realized the gravity of his situation and discovered that he was threatened in this dangerous quarter by a far more formidable force than he had been led to believe, for about this hour he appears to have sent Ferik llaschid Pasha with 12 battalions, 2 field and 1 mountain batteries, and some 2,000 irregulars to the point threatened. This General, arriving as he did late on the field, at once attacked the foremost of the enemy, and at first, it appears, gained some success, the Russians were, however, now solidly established in force on the 0rlok-Bazardjik heights, and night soon put an end to the conflict. The sound of the firing was of course heard by the Russians in front, but a report on the situation does not appear to have reached the Russian head quarters at the Kara-Yal until 2*30 a.m. on the 15th, and from the contents of the telegram—in which General Lazareff described his force as being in the presence of the enemy in strength—it was at once decided that the moment had come for a general attack with all the forces available, in accoidance the plan previously determined on, and at 5 a.m. the troops icceived the following dispositions for the day :— . „ . . , General Schaak was to cover the Great Vahni-Tepeh against lurkish attacks from Kars or the Lesser Yahni-Tepeh and threaten any reinfoi ce ments the Turks might direct from Vezin-Keui to the Aulia-xepeh. General Heimann was to attack the Aulia-Fepeh. . General Kouzminsky was to attack the Aladja-Dagh, but nas o threaten it only during the early part of the day. , The remainder of the troops under General Roop (the reserve and 2 battalions withdrawn from the Kabak-Tepeh during the night) were to connect the forces of Generals Heimann and Kouzminsky and advance from boubatan on the Inak-Tepessi. , ,. The cavalry was to act on either flank—that on the right in the direction of Vezin-Keui. , , . . .. Finally, General Lazareff was instructed to regulate his action according to the dispositions and results of the attack in front. __ _ Thus the error of again attacking the Lesser F ahni on which so many lives had been uselessly lost on the 2nd, was this time avoided. It was to be maS The Russian troops were in motion at 6*30 a.m., and before daylight were formed up for attack with their batteries in action ready to open fire. It is not precisely known how far Mukhtar Pasha was aware of the plan his adversaries had now adopted for dislodging him from the positions in vine i he had hitherto defied their attempts, nor at what moment he became conscious that the attack threatened in rear of his positions was somet very different from the feeble attempts made to turn his right flank on the 1st and of Bazardjik. This was at first done by cavalry alone, but the ^ f^wSst drove these back 3 battalions under ' Gurtclnne 'fi^fre^ and shortly after telegraphic communication was ^^^w^rebaSttwere on their way to join Mukhtar Pasha from Ismail Pasha’s force.2nd inst. and which he had so signally defeated. No doubt he was now, owing to the disappearance of his Kurdish and Circassian scouts, kept very badly informed of all Russian movements; he knew, however, on the 13th that a strong Russian force had appeared at Digor, still it does not appear as it he made any preparations to retire on the 14th, ami it was not apparently until the evening of that day that he seems to have fully realised the danger that threatened him, and ordered a retreat to Kars on the same night, as the result of the partial success gained by General Lazareff during the day.* The resolution on the part of Mukhtar Pasha to retire had, however, been too long deferred. During the night, the Russian force in his rear had firmly established itself on the ground it had won during the day, threatening Vezin-Keui, and the first instalment only of Turkish baggage had been safely conveyed to that point, the animals being on their return journey in the morning to remove a second instalment, when the general attack commenced which was to decide the fate of Mukhtar Pasha’s force, and ultimately that of Kars. Battle of the Aladja-Dagh. The point assailed in the first instance by the Russians was the Aulia- Tepeh, held by 4 battalions of Turkish infantry with 3 field and 4 mountain guns. Between 8 and 9 a.m. General Heimann had brought forward 5 heavy field batteries + (40 9-pr. guns), and from these, supplemented by the fire of 3 batteries,]; established on the Great Yahni-Tepeh (9-prs.), and 3 siege guns at Hadjiveli (in all G7 guns), there rained, for not less than three hours,§ such a storm of shell and shrapnel on the Aulia-Tepeh as threatened the utter annihilation of the gallant defenders before the assault took place. Such, however, was soon found not to be the case, for on the position being attacked about noon by 13 Russian battalions,|| so stoutly did the brave fellows defending it cling to their posts, that during the musketry fight which ensued, they repulsed 3 successive attacks of the Russian infantry before a circumstance occurred which caused them to give way and on the fourth attack taking place, to abandon the hill. This they did so deliberately, walking leisurely away and allowing themselves to be fired on by their puisuers without returning a shot, as to convince their comrades on the adjoining Nahlend-Tepeh that their resistance had been prolonged to the last cartridge. The circumstance above referred to was the extraordinary behaviour of 5 Turkish battalions with a field battery, which (in co-operation with other troops from the side of the Aladja-Dagh) had been ordered up from the Sivri- Tepeh to assist in the defence of the Aulia-Tepeh by taking the assailants in both flanks. The battalions in question were observed to be very tardy in * * * § * It is only fair to state, that on the 13th the Turkish General received a telegram from Constantinople, in which he was informed that a serious insurrection had broken out in Daghestan, and that the Russian force he was opposed to would detach 20 battalions to assist in suppressing it. He was, at the same time, informed that he might first expect a formidable attack. According to all accounts, this telegram was implicitly believed in at the Turkish head quarters. It had also been observed by the Turks that the baggage and camp epuipage that had been sent to Alexandropol by the Russians on the night of the lst-2nd instant had not returned, their troops having bivouacked in the open ever since ; and Mukhtar Pasha may have been led to believe that this indicated the probable retirement of the Russian force in his front. Still no sign of a retreat had appeared, nor was it to be inferred that such a step was contemplated by the Russians from any of their movements or manoeuvres up to this date, and certainly not from their continual employment of siege artillery in the open. f 5 batteries of the Caucasus Grenadier Field Artillery Brigade. j The 2nd Battery 1st (Moscow) Grenadier Field Artillery Brigade, the 2nd Battery 21st Field Artillery Brigade, and the 3rd Battery 39th Field Artillery Brigade. § The Russian field batteries at first opened fire at their usual respectful range, biit soon finding the Turkish artillery opposed to them very weak, limbered up and moved forward after about an hour’s firing to within 1,800 or 2,000 yards of the Turks, and now used almost exclusively shrapnel with time fuzes. The precision of their fire seems to have been very remarkable on this occasion, and the summit of the Aulia-Tepeh is said by an eye-witness to have been completely enveloped in the smoke of their bursting projectiles. This was afterwards verified by the large number of Turks found killed and wounded in their trenches by artillery fire. || The 13th (Erivan) and 14th (Georgia) Grenadiers and the 151st (Piatigoi-sk) regiments, and the 1st Battalion Caucasus Chasseurs.83 moving forward, notwithstanding the repeated orders sent to them to acceleiate their advance, and no sooner had they come into conflict with the hussian supports than a panic seized them, and, though by no means hard pressed, they retired precipitately, leaving the garrison ot Aulia-'l epeh to its fate. Still tor awhile the catastrophe was suspended by a sortie which was bravely attempted by a mere detachment of the defenders in order to relieve the detection of their comrades, but the odds against them were tremendous and the effect was on y momentary. A battalion armed with the Martini-Henry rifle, sent to reinforce the garrison, reached it with half its numbers, the other half joining the tioops operating against the left flank of the Russian attack. Ihese men, however, who had witnessed the withdrawal of the Sivri battalions, and who, it ap’tears, shared their panic, were so far from proving an accession of stiength to. e garrison, that they were the first to set the example of quitting then pos s. Three field guns were abandoned in the Aulia-1 epeh, and fell into the mm s o the Russians. Arm i This was the turning point of the day ; by the capture of the Aulia- lepen the Turkish centre was laid open in front, and the whole of General Heimann s force masking the Lesser Yahni, could now be brought to bear on the lurkisii left wing at Vezin-Keui. r 19 Accordingly, after a short pause—during winch his front line of 1- battalions, extending from the western slopes of the Great Yahm-Tepeh to Tchift Tepessi, was reinforced by 4 additional battalions,' and the ' artillery brought forward—General Hermann resumed bis attack on the f ur positions on the Orlok-Vezin-Keui heights, and scarcely had the advaime commenced, when heavy firing announced that General Lazaietl v. s l General Lazareff, it appears, had^not taken ^y active ~es early in KeU General Heimann’s skirmishers and field batteries now gradually advanced SriTer 1 * CUtt TenerameuLff!Tt applamfnow rode forward to the scene of action and having examined the situation, took the following steps to foUow up the successes already gained. Seeing that the Turks were ^ an d make a stand at Vezin-Keui and that their positions ^ t(J the Lesser Yahni-Tepeh were still intact, he ordered Genera He,man t„ attack Vezin-Keui with a portion of Ins force and ’'‘^^Tepessi.

It is doubtful, however, whether such was the case in consequence oi the Russian attack alone, for, on the Turkish centre being pierced by the combined attacks of Generals Heimann and Lazareff, the Turkish troops on the Aladja- Dagh were warned of their danger and ordered to retreat, abandoning their stores and camp equipage; the result was, ot course, that the Russians pressed foi ward both on the front and flanks of the retreating r I urks and the resistance of the latter was soon at an end. As the Russian infantry pressed forward, their artillery had to cease firing, not being able to follow the skirmishers up the broken and rugged slopes of the mountain; the former, however, took many prisoners, and whole battalions of Turks, seeing their retreat cut off, laid down their arms. In the meanwhile the Turks on the Tchift-Tepessi and the heights of Bazardjik were gradually surrounded by portions ot Generals Heimann’s and LazarefF’s forces, as well as attacked by detachments of General Roop’s forces from the Aladja, and finally surrendered. At nightfall, however, portions of 8 battalions, aggregating from 1,500 to 1,800 men, contrived to breakthrough the Russian lines and make good their way to Kagisman; and a somewhat larger number, it was afterwards found, effected their escape in small bands in other directions, but the remainder—about 7,000 officers and men, including two Ferik and three Liva Pashas, with 40 field and mountain guns—fell into the hands of the victors, the whole of the Turkish right wing on the Aladja- Dagh being thus either killed, taken, or dispersed. ' After a final stand at Vezin-Keui, the left wing retired in disorder to Kars, but the pursuit does not appear to have been kept up for any distance, nor was the retreat of the forces holding the Lesser 1 ahni apparently cut off, for, under cover of night, the Turkish forces posted there—10 battalions with 9 field and mountain guns, under “Capitan” Mehmet Pasha, which had been more or less surrounded during the day by the Russians—retired in safety, with its artillery, &amp;c., unmolested to Kars. It is difficult indeed to account for the small amount of courage, determination and endurance exhibited by the Turkish soldier on this day compared with his previous behaviour in this part of the theatre of w r ar, for nothing like a real stand was made after the fall of the Aulia-Tepeh. The events and course that affairs took on the Turkish side after the loss of that important post, are perhaps best given in the words of a competent eye-witness who accompanied the Turkish General and actually saw how things occurred. “ My experience of the enthusiasm hitherto animating the Turkish soldier on the field of battle had not prepared me for the events which hereon (i.e. after the fall of the Aulia-Tepeh) ensued, nor were the Commander-in- Chief and his staff less taken by surprise at the apathetic indifference for which that enthusiasm seemed now to be exchanged. Whether appalled by the heavy losses they had sustained during the recent engagements and the miserable untended condition of their wounded comrades, or subdued by the exposure, suffering, and short rations to which they had been subjected and which had occasioned wholesale desertions, whether conscious that their communications were virtually intercepted, or more probably still, disheartened and demoralised by the first indication of a retreat,t the same men who had before borne themselves so courageously and held their ground so tenaciously in many a hard fight now seemed to be utterly prostrated. Nowhere after the fall of the Aulia-Tepeh did they once attempt to make a stand. As the Russian batteries advanced, they abandoned position after position without firing a shot, and neither persuasion nor threat could induce them to await the enemy’s assault. For the rest of the day, while exposed to the heaviest cross-fire * On the right by the 152nd (Vladikawkaz) Regiment, and Prince Tch avtchavadze’s irregular cavalry and 2 squadrons of the 17th (SiSversk) Dragoons, and on the left by the 1 st (Catherianoslav) Grenadiers and 2 squadrons of the 17th (Sigversk) Dragoons, with 4 horse artillery guns. f During the attempt on the part of the Turkish officers to check the panic and turn back the fugitives, the men denounced the retreat from Kizyl-Tepeh, and one of them, attacking an officer of high rank with his bayonet, asked why they had been required to shed their blood in rain in capturing that post if there were no intention of retaining it; and this sentiment has, it appears, been repeated in various quarters to justify or explain the conduct of the Turkish soldiers on this day.of artillery (for General LazarefFs force and the main body from Hadjivell were co-operating after the fall of the Aulia-Tepeh), Mukhtar Pasha personally visited the trenches of the several positions in succession and was himself among the last to quit them when the failure of his exhortations and remonstrances left him no other alternative. It is a remarkable fact that the Turkish troops in this movement to the rear, though losing their formation and retiring in great disorder, retained every man his rifle and never once quickened their pace beyond a walk though harrassed by the enemy’s projectiles, until they reached Wezin-Keui. There, however, after a last vain attempt on the part of Mukhtar Pasha to make a stand, the contagion spread to the assembled ra' ble of soldiers of all arms, muleteers, and drivers, and the retreat took the form of a precipitate flight over a tract of eight miles which intervened up to the gates of Kars amid the explosion of ammunition boxes and other accidents incidental to a panic. In the case of a force composed for the very most part of raw levies, without other subaltern officers to mould the battalions than serjeants promoted from the Nizam regiments to the command of companies, and devoid also of any kind of organization, that a serious defeat should lead to a debandade is, of course, to be expected, but in this instance, the loss of the Aulia-Tepeh involving the discomforture of 4 battalions only, could hardly be termed a serious defeat. The Turks, it must be remembered, were everywhere fighting behind entrenchments—their strong point—on positions well chosen for mutual defence, and had they held them with equal tenacity, the retreat of the troops on the Aladja Dagh—some SO battalions, including 5 battalions stationed on a hill to the south of the Nalhend-Tepeh— must not only have been fully secured, but their appearance on the field, covered by the guns of those positions, might have retrieved the day by concentrating a preponderant force against the Russian Division operating from Digor. Such an issue was only possible of course by dint of sheer hard fighting against the overwhelming numbers the Russians brought into the field on this day.” The total force engaged on the Russian side on this day was 65 battalions, 71 squadrons and sotnias, and 254 guns, whereas on the Turkish side there were 76 battalions,* 84 field and mountain guns, some 1,500 regular and 2,500 irregular cavalry. Owing to casualties and desertion, however, the average complement of the Turkish battalion, we are informed on the best authority, had actually fallen below 300 rank and file, whereas the Russian infantry recently recruited from the interior and reinforced by two whole Divisions (the 40th and 1st Grenadier Divisions) as well as by the concentration of all available troops from the right and left wings as Ardahan and Igdyr, not only surpassed the former in number in the field, but averaged in each battalion not less than 650 bayonets, thus giving the Grand Duke some 42,250 bayonets and 254 guns against Mukhtar Pasha’s 21,900 infantry! and 84 guns. The preponderance of artillery on the Russian side in this battle is remarkable as not only outnumbering the Turkish guns as 3 to 1, but being in addition mostly of a much heavier calibre.J It was, moreover, worked on this day with a precision and activity which had not distinguished it on former occa sions, and, as was remarked by an independent eye-witness on the Russian side, instead of confining itself to a shell fire at impossible ranges—where neither accuracy nor effect could be expected and where its fire was soon masked by the advance of its own troops—moved forward this time in support of the infantry and materially co-operated towards the general result of the day. It is also worthy of remark that whereas the Turkish artillery fire was almost exclusively one of common shell with percussion fuzes, the Russian gunners recognised on this occasion the superiority of shrapnel fired with time fuzes, and used it in large quantities with great effect.^ The actual losses of the Turks in killed and wounded on this occasion were probably very slight in comparison with the scale of the engagement * * * § * Including the garrison of Kars—some 7 or 8 battalions. t About 19,650 bayonets, deducting the garrison of Kars. , , . , + The Russian 9-pr. fires a common shell weighing 24 lbs. 5 oz.

Several camps, with tents baggage, and large quantities of stores and ammunition also tell into the hands of the victors. The Russians give their own losses as 7 40 officers and 1,162 men wounded. officers and 223 men killed, and THE RETREAT FROM KARS TO KIETJPRI-KEUI. Mukhtar Pasha reached Kars on the evening of the 15th with the debris of his left wing from Wezin-Keui, and was joined during the night by “Capitan” Mohammed Pasha with the 10 battalions, &amp;c., that had held the Lesser Yahni-Tepch duriug the battle. ™ i * i- . Ko time was now lost in telegraphing orders to Ismail Pasha to retire at once on Kieupri-keui, and to Dervish Pasha, at Batoum, to send 10 battalions toErzeroum, vid Trebizond; and Mukhtar Pasha, having collected a small force, at once prepared to quit Kars for the defence of Erzeroum before the tormer place was invested by the Russians. Leaving 31 broken battalions numbering some 10,000 men of all arms and classes to form the garrison of the city under Ferik Hussein Pasha, Mukhtar Pasha left Kars on the morning of the 17th with 9 skeleton battalions and 6 mountain guns, and marched by a mountain path via Bashkeui to Hunkiar Duzi, where he was joined by the remaining battalion fiom Pennck with 4 mountain guns on the 18th. He had however a narrow escape of being intercepted en route, for a Russian force, in strength of about a brigade in ith a numerous Cavalry, marched from Vezin-Keui on the 16th vid Tikma to Begli Ahmet, Nvhere it was only separated by a range of heights from Mukhtar Pasha s line of retreat. The weather however was so had that, though greatly aggravating the sufferings of the retreating Turks, it probably saved them from being observed, or at any rate from being molested. Had indeed the Cossacks shown themselves on the range in question, we are informed on good authority that such ivas the dispirited state of the Turkish force, the men would undoubtedly have at once dispersed. The Turkish Cavalry under Edhem Pasha, in fact, which was covering Mukhtar Pasha’s left flank in the plain, w as obliged to retire to Kars, but eventually retreated thence to Erzeroum, vid Pennek, with 580 horsmen of sorts, and horses for two or three batteries. On the same day that a Russian force marched to Begli Ahmet to cut off the communications with Kars, another force, in the strength of about a brigade, w as despatched to Kagisman, under General Lazareff. Its apparent object was to pursue and capture the fugitives belonging to the Turkish left wing who had escaped in this direction, and according to Russian accounts, the Khoper regiment of Cossacks overtook and captured a Pasha, a Bimbashi, and some 200 or 300 men between the Aladja Dagh and Kagisman on the 17th. Mukhtar Pasha's retreat to Hunkiar Duzi was accompanied by much hard ship and suffering, the weather being very cold, stormy, and wet. Eight Turkish soldiers actually died from exposure en route, and some 200 failed to answer their names at roll call at Hunkiar Duzi on the 18th. On the 19th, Mukhtar Pasha again retired to Yeni-keui, where depots and stores had been established, and where he could hope to recruit the strength * Ferik Omar Pasha, Ferik Hussein Pasha, Mustapha Djavid Pasha, Achmet Radet Pasha, Shefket Pasha, Omar Faghir Pasha, Khamdi Bey, Bimbashis Tefik Bey, Sadyk Bey, Kefat Bey, and Ali Effendi, Ahmed Djeftet Effendi and Ismail Agha were among the prisoners taken, t According to later accounts the number of prisoners was 6,500 of all ranks.87 of his troops, collect stragglers, and endeavour to check the advance of the Russians, so as to cover the retreat of his right wing, under Ismail Pasha, now re triring vid Delihaba to Kieupri-keui. He accordingly again retired on the 23rd and took up a strong position at Ketchek Sood, a village about 3 miles in rear of his old entrenched position near Zewin. His force now consisted of 10 broken battalions (averaging 240 rank and hie), 10 mountain guns and a few horsemen, amounting in all to not more than 2,800 men of all arms. At Erzeroum there were two indifferent battalions which had been recalled from Kieupri-keui on the first tidings of Mukhtar Pasha’s defeat, and at the latter place some stragglers only. The Olti line was now completely denuded of Turkish troops. At Ketchek Sood, distant some 28 miles from Kieupri-Keui, Mukhtar Pasha now halted to observe the advance of the Russians from Milliduz, and from the vantage of a hilly and difficult tract of country, was enabled, though at some risk on the 24th, to surprise a Russian reconnoitring party of 3 regiments of cavalry, with a rocket troop and half a battery of horse artillery that had ventured within his reach ; in the skirmish which ensued the Russians were worsted, and retired on Milliduz. 1 his success, though slight in itself, was of great advantage to the Turks, and their spirited manoeuvre in all probability suggested to the Russians the presence of a large Turkish force near Zewin, menacing their right flank. Anyhow to Mukhtar Pasha’s courage and energy must be attributed the safety of Ismail Pasha's retreat, as will be afterwards seen. On the 26th, however, the Turkish General finding the Russians in strong force on the heights of Milliduz, destroyed all surplus stores collected at Ala- kilisseh, &amp;c., and retired unmolested to Kieupri-keui, where he was joined on the following day by Ismail Pasha with 24 battalions, some 2,000 caialr) (regular and irregular), and 33 field and mountain guns, numbering some 14,000 men of all arms. He was now also joined by three Pashas, supposed to have been taken prisoners on the Aladja Dagh,—viz., the two Circassian com manders, Moussa Pasha and Mehemet Ghazi Pasha, and Hadji Rashcid Pasha, who brought with them some 2,500 men who had succeeded in cutting their way through the Russians on the night of the 15th and reaching Kieupri-keui. These fugitives were now formed into four battalions and told ofl as a rear guard in the retreat to the Deveboyun. z88 OPERATIONS BETWEEN THE TURKISH RIGHT AND RUSSIAN LEFT WINGS. The demonstration on the 29th ult. was only an exchange of artillery fire at long ranges without any apparent object, and the regular troops on either side continued to remain in September in the camps they occupied in August, both sides being apparently either unwilling or unable to undertake anything decisive. 1 . On the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd September, Ismail Pasha leceived some rein forcements in the shape of about 1,000 Arab-koords- Sulimanis, from tie neighbourhood of Hamadan. Of the 10 battalions referred to m the nan a ive of events in August as expected from Erzeroum, 2 (Redif) armed during the first week in September, 3 more with a battery of field guns were on the same date at Karakilisseh, and the remaining b at Zeikidan en route. Six batahons of Mustaphiz were in addition expected from the south. . 1 _ . On the evening of the 6th, 500 of the newly arrived Sulimanis left the Turkish camp at Zor on a marauding expedition against Russian convoys, having obtained leave to do so from the Turkish General after considerable difficulty and only on condition of their giving a solemn promise not to kill or plunder unarmed villagers. They crossed the Araxes, to the \\est of Tgdvi, by swimming their horses, and returned to camp on the morning of the 8th with some captured horses whose owners they had accounted foi, together with a Russian post bag between Kulpi and Igdyr as well as a mail fiom Lman to the latter place, which they had intercepted. From the contents of despatches thus captured, the Muchir learnt that General I ergukasotf had resigned and had been replaced by General Devel, and that 8 battalions had been withdrawn from Kulpi to Alexandropol. In spite of this, however, Ismail Pasha showed no signs of undertaking any active operations against the weak force now in his front, much to the disgust of the troops under his command, who openly showed their dissatisfaction and discontent at his inactivity. Ihe Russians now only numbered some 10 batalions, 5 of which were at Igdyr and the remainder at Kulpi, Gulidja, and neighbouring villages; they were still superior, however, to the Turks in cavalry and artillery. Fearing the advance of a Russian force from Abbasgol, Ismail Pasha had, in the meanwhile, posted a force consisting of 8 or 9 battalions of infantry, 1 regiment of cavalry, and a large number of irregular horse, on the heights to the north of Mussin, in that village itself, and in the valley leading thence to the Bakyklygol. The cavalry outposts of this force extended, in the com mencement of September, to at least 10 miles from head-quarters at Zor. On the 12th, a brigade of 8 battalions of infantry, 2 field batteries, and 4 mountain guns took up a position on the plateau overlooking Khalifalu, about 31 miles in advance of the Turkish position. Of these, 2 battalions and the 4 mountain guns were posted to the left of the ravine running from Zor, the remaining 8 battalions and 12 guns being aligned on the heights to the right of it. Khalifalu and the ground adjacent was occupied as an advanced post by the Russians, with a force of 1 battalion of infantry, 4 squadrons of cavalry, and 8 guns. The Turkish battalions now sent forward their skirmishers for some little distance, and about noon 5 battalions of Russian infantry issued from Igdyr and deployed on the plain, but, seeing that no offensive movement was attempted by the Turks, withdrew towards evening. Ismail Pasha intended, it is supposed, to have followed his advanced brigade with his main body on the following day (13th) and have attacked Khalifalu, to co-operate with a contemplated diversion of the Turkish cavalry from Mukhtar Pasha’s force, but on the same night (12th), the temperature suddenly fell some 40°, and a violent storm of snow and rain ensued, lasting for over 36 hours, and effectually putting a stop for the time to all idea of military movements in the mountains. On the 14th, a Russian force, consisting of 4 or 5 battalions, 4 squadrons or sotnias, and 1 field battery, encamped near the village of Tcharekdjilis, and their advanced camp at Igdyr was strengthened at the same time by 4 battalions of infantry from their camp somewhat in rear of that place.89 On the 16 th, owing to the seventy of the weather and the marshy state of e ground, the Turkish head-quarters and main body descended to the position occupied by their advanced guard, near Khalifalu. Owing' to the presence of a Russian force at Tcharekdjilis, however, a cliange in the disposi tion and strength of the Turkish left was made, and the positions and forces ot Ismail rasha were now somewhat as follows: O rnn T1 - ie ^ wing consistcd ()f 12 battalions, 3 field batteries, and some 2,^00 irregular cavalry; the left wing of 8 battalions, 1 regiment of regular cavalry, 2 field batteries, 4 mountain guns, and “some hundreds” of irregular horse ; and to the rear near Ghimede were encamped some 1,000 irregular Arabs, horse and foot. The remainder of the regular battalions were echeloned along the mountains towards the pass of Mussin, and 9 battalions occupied the ground immediately to the west ot Zor, with a battery of artillery in reserve on the road to Zor-Asma; there were also 3 battalions in the pass above Mussin (1 being in Mussin itself), 2 at Beg 6 re on the road to Van, 1 at Bayazid, and 1 at Kara-Kilisseh. The position now occupied by the Turkish advanced forces above Khalifalu was, from a purely defensive point of view, exceedingly strong, being almost inaccessible both in front and on the flanks, but, owing to the escarped and rugged nature of the ground in front, it had the great disadvantage of hampering the movements of artillery and impeding offensive action. The wings, moreover, were separated by a deep and difficult ravine, and the battalions thinly scattered along the front. As regards supplies, it was most inconveniently situated; there was great difficulty in obtaining water, in addition to which, with the exception of the few deserted villages in the neighbourhood where the logs of the roofs of the houses were taken for firewood, there was absolutely no fuel. The Turks now busied themselves with making roads for the passage of guns down the slopes from this position, and in throwing up batteries at night along the front, gradually approaching Khalifalu. To oppose Ismail Pasha, General Tergukasoff was still weak in infantry; 8 battalions were posted near Igdyr, and 5 at Tcharekjiler, the remainder being encamped or occupying the villages between Igdyr and Kulpi. Perfectly level ground extended all along the front of the positions occupied by the Russians, being at least 5,000 yards wide at its narrowest point. Their front, too, was protected by numerous cuts or water-courses, especially towards their left flank, which a slight increase of inundation would have rendered impracticable. Ismail Pasha was now joined by the 6 battalions and field battery so long expected from Erzeroum; 2 of these were Mustaphiz. There had been a great many desertions en route, some of the battalions on arrival only mustering 400 bayonets. In one battalion alone, 150 men had deserted and about an equal number had fallen out and were left behind sick. Ismail Pasha’s force now consisted of 36 battalions of infantry, 6 batteries of field artillery, (36 guns'), 13 mountain guns, 500 regular cavalry, and some 3,000 irregular horse. To oppose these, General TergukasofF had from 20 to 22 battalions of infantry, 8 or 9 regiments of Cossacks and cavalry, and 52 guns. Continual skirmishing now took place on the 17 th, 18th, and 19th, between the Turkish Bashi-Bazouks and the Russian outposts without result and with trifling loss to either side. On the 19th, however, a Russian heavy battery (8 guns) unlimbered to the west of Khalifalu and opened fire on an advanced Turkish half battery (3 guns) to the right of the track leading to the village, and a general cannonade soon ensued along the whole line. The range being between 4,000 and 5,000 yards, but little damage was naturally done. The Russian fire, however, is described by an eye-witness as accurate, and the sany froid of the Turkish gunners in the advanced half battery, where the Russian shells fell thickly, very remarkable. According to a Russian official despatch, dated Kara-Yal, 21 st September, the 153rd (Baku), 150th (Taman), and 74th (Stavropol) regiments were engaged in this affair. Their losses were insignificant. Colonel Ivanow, commanding the 153rd (Baku) regiment, was wounded. On the afternoon of the 20th a party of some 300 Bashi-Bazouks were per mitted to make a demonstration against the village of Khalifalu. They90 descended a ravine on the right of the Turkish position but were speedily observed by the Russians, who brought forward a couple of heavy field guns from their main camp-half way between Khalifalu and Igdyr-and from a point about 1.000 yards on their side of the former place, unlimbered and opened tire, nushinn- forward at the same time a battalion in extended order to the east of the village. This at once checked the advance of the Turkish irregulars and both sides then continued firing at each other at long ranges and with little effect till evening. The Turks at the same time opened an arti lery fire from their advanced batteries on the Russian guns and skirmishers. The firing went on till dark, with little damage to either side. On the Turkish side the losses were 1 Bashi-Bazouk and 2 horses killed and 1 man wounded Towards even- ino* a Russian ammunition wagon was blown up by a lurkisn she . In the meanwhile another and more serious tight was going on on the other flank 1 ate in the afternoon 4 Russian battalions, supported by 4 guns a - vanced from the village of Yokari-Cherik-Jileh, and made a more serious but unsuccessful attack on the Turkish extreme left. They were met by 3 1 urkish battalions, occupying a position about 1,000 yards m front of their camp a ter- wards supported by a portion of another battalion and 3 guns advanced for the purpose These guns were, it is said, used with considerable effect on the Russian skirmishers, but were retired on the latter coming within rifle range. The Russians made three distinct advances on the Turkish position, which was temporarily strengthened by stone breastworks, but were repulsed each time with considerable loss. A regiment of Cossacks advanced during the engagement, and dismounting, supported their infantry as skirmishers, whilst on the J urkish side, seme GOO Koords under Erak Bey came to the support of their infantry on their extreme left, and, dismounting, materially checked the Russian advance The Turkish loss in this action is given as 5 killed and 12 wounded (among the latter was Kaimakam Hafiz Bey commanding on the left of the Turkish position, mortally wounded). m , . , , . -p, . Simultaneously with the real attack on the Turkish left, the Russians made a demonstration with one battalion from Khalifalu on the centre, but beyond a good deal of firing between skirmishers, nothing took place. The Turkish loss was nil. The total Russian loss in the engagement is not known, but it was un doubtedly more severe than the Turkish, as they were much more exposed throughout the affair. . . , In consequence of this attack, the Turkish left was on the following day reinforced by 2 battalions, raising the force on the left of the Zor ravine to 9 battalions, 12 guns (4 pounders), 4 mountain guns, 1 regiment of cavalry, and some hundreds of Bashi-Bazouks. . There was no fighting or firing on either side on this or the following day, ( 21 st. 22 nd), but on the latter day Mohammed Mumri Pasha, lately in command of the reserve, was appointed commander of the 3rd brigade, comprising all the Turkish troops on the left of the Zor ravine, as given above. At sunset on the 23rd, the Turks fired a salute and lit bonfires all over their positions to celebrate Osman’s victory at Plevna, news of which arrived on the night of the 22 nd. Shortly after midnight on the 23rd, heavy firing took place in front ot the Turkish position and on both sides of the Zor ravine. The Russians advanced 2 or more battalions, with what object it is difficult to say, and fired several volleys by sections into the camp of a Turkish battalion (Malacthia) located lust above and on the left bank of the ravine, and soon succeeded in drawing a heavy indiscriminate file fire on themselves from all sides. No casualties were apparently caused on either side, and the Russians retired after a couple of hours’ waste of ammunition by moonlight, having only succeeded in alarming the whole of the Turkish camp. On the following night the Turks, anticipating a renewal of the previous night’s diversion, reinforced their outposts with a large force of infantry and Bashi-Bazouks, but the Russians did not repeat the experiment. From the tactics employed by the Turkish General, he would seem to have had an idea of pushing forward his batteries by degrees, working at night and 2 battalions were now encamped lower down on the slopes in the immediate91 tlTLft Tur t kish P 0sUi0n ’ t 1 W0 more bein S employed day and night on ne lelt tront as opportunity occurred at road making-. tint anV]™n™ eri | in 'm f k thC 27 &gt; th jt Wa f docided at the Turkish head-quarters overlonWifr.^ Ar 10U d b ? ’? ade at , Illldnl ght on the extreme left to a position nrev ondv S 16 ^ USS .?~ Igd y r road ’ about one mile *0 the west of the position fen, nr y 0 CCU H d ’ bls movement thus enabling the Turks to connect their ,®'h e. ra 0' roads for their artillery with the main road above mentioned. A ttaiion ot Chasseurs, 4 companies of an infantry battalion, and 4 — 4 -pounder guns accordingly took up a position on the front of a spur, on the left of which was the broad, deep, winding ravine along which the main road runs, and on the right another ravine, deep, but narrow. The Turks immediately threw up stone parape walls along the face of the spur, but made their usual mistake in neglecting to look after their flanks while making their front nearly im pregnable. J • u ^ uss ^ ans apparently received intelligence of this movement durino- the night, for they attacked the Turks early in the morning with 4 battalions and 4 heavy field guns. I he Turkish guns which were posted somewhat in rear of their infantry were compelled after firing a few rounds to retire to a safer posi tion, and strong bodies of Russian skirmishers pushing unperceived up the ravines on either side of the spur, took the Turks holding it in flank and reveise. the latter now beat a hasty and somewhat disorderly retreat, after which the Russian infantry occupied the stone entrenchments which they had constructed in the night. Their further advance, however, was checked by the arrival of 2 Turkish battalions, who at once occupied some entrenchments pre viously thrown up (the same which the Turks had successfully defended on the 20 th), about 1,000 yards from the position held by the Russians. heiik Mustapha Pasha arrived on the scene at 11 a.m., and was met in succession by the retreating guns, a good many wounded stragglers, and finally by several companies of infantry, retiring in the greatest confusion, accompanied by a disorderly mob of Bashi-Bazouks. The Ferik at once assumed command, rallied the fugitives, and led them in person against the Russians. He first despatched several hundred Bashi-Bazouks to the other side of the main ravine on the I urkish left—thus not only getting rid of this element of confusion, but threatening the Russian flank—and next succeeded in getting 2 guns into action, which on opening fire soon drew that of the Russian guns, now icinforced to six. The remaining 2 Turkish guns soon afterwards came into action, and a sharp musketry and artillery combat ensued. The Russian skirmishers now tried to push up a ravine on the Turkish right, but were checked by a heavy fire and did not get nearer than 600 yards. Skirmishing was now kept up between both sides for at least two hours, and 2 Turkish battalions (weak) arriving in support at 2 p.m., the Russians retired to the position they had taken in the morning, being threatened in flank by the Bashi-Bazouks, who, however, only approached to within about 1,500 yards and kept up an unceasing but use less fire for several hours. The Turks made no attempt to drive them from this position, but the skirmishers on both sides continued to keep up an un ceasing rifle fire till dark at a range of about 1,000 yards, doing little or no damage on either side. Just before sunset a Russian ammunition wagon ex ploded. After nightfall the Russians abandoned the position they had taken and held during the day, but the Turks made no attempt to reoccupy it. The Turkish loss in this affair is given as 30 men killed and some 100 men wounded.* In the meanwhile, on the Turkish right, the Russians brought 4 guns into action near Khoshkhabar, and 8 near Khalifalu, which village they occupied with 2 battalions, with 1 battalion and 4 squadrons or sotnias in rear of it, and covered their front with skirmishers. 3 battalions and 4 squadrons or sotnias were also brought out from Yokari Cherik-Jileh, as if to support an attack on the Turkish right. At 10 a.m. the Turks opened fire from 6 guns in their advanced batteries, and the Russians at once replied vigourously. The fire was now taken up by another Turkish battery, giving 12 guns on either side, and after * Among- the killed was Ibrahim Agha, commanding- the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment, and among thewoun lei Mehemet Agha, commanding the 2nd Battalion, 6th Regiment (previously wounded at Ihiyazid). 2 A92 an hour’s firing, the Russians withdrew their guns at Khalifalu but advanced those near Koshkhabar with the object ot taking the I urkish guns en echarpe; their fire, however, is said to have been ineffective, as a very strong gale was blowing at the time. At about 12 noon the Russian skirmishers in front of Khalifalu moved slightly forward, but retired after exchanging a few shots with the Turkish outposts. The losses on the Turkish side on the right amounted to two men wounded. The total loss of the Russians on this day is given in an official despatch dated Kara-Yal, 29th September, as 16 men killed and 148 wounded. General Dewel commanding the 39th Division, Colonel Kabenine commanding the 155th (Kuban) regiment, and 10 other officers were wounded. The Russian troops engaged appear to have belonged to the 154th (Derbent) and the 155th (Kuban) regiments of the 39th Division, the 73rd (Crimean) and the &lt;4th * Stavropol) regiments of the 19th Division, and the 4th and 2 nd batteries of the 19th and 28th Field Ariillery Brigades respectively/' A great many horses on the Turkish side were killed or disabled by shell and shrapnel fire, but with the exception of Ibrahim Agha who was killed by a shrapnel bullet, nearly all the casualties were caused by rifle fire, in spite of the continual and heavy artillery fire kept up during the greater part of the day. Most of the losses on the Turkish side occurred early in the day. In consequence of the affair on the 27th, the Turkish left wing was strengthened on the following day by two battalions from the reserve, and the right by 1 battalion. There were consequently now 11 battalions on the left of the Zor ravine, 12 on the right, and 11 in reserve in the neighbourhood of the Mussin and Zor passes. The ’lurks also retired their guns from their some what exposed position in the advanced batteries, where they were certainly dangerously near the battalions covering them in front, and liable to be taken or disabled by a sudden attack of the Russians in force. Towards the end of September the Turkish force began to feel the effects of the weather, which was now stormy and cold, in this exposed situation ; in addition to this the difficulty of supply increased daily, especially as regards forage. The army looked forward, however, with some small satisfaction that Ismail Pasha would soon be obliged in consequence to move either forwards or backwards in spite of himself. Desertions among the Koords and Arabs now took place in large numbers, and scarcely a night passed without a batch of from 50 to 200 of these irregulars faking their departure. Their loss was not however so important as the dissatisfaction felt among the regular forces at Ismail Pasha’s want of energy ; this, added to bad rations and exposure, seriously affected the morale of the Turkish regular troops, and the sick list now began to assume alarming proportions. The actual strength and position of General TergukasofF’s force at the end of this month are not precisely known, but are supposed to have been some what as follows:— At Igdyr and Khalifalu, 9 or 10 battalions, 12 squadrons or sotnias, and 32 guns; and at Tcharekliger, Khoshkhabar, and Oba, 6 battalions, 4 squadrons or sotnias, and 8 guns; giving a total force of 15 or 16 battalions, 16 squad rons or sotnias, and 40 guns. With the exception of a cavalry reconnaissance made by the Russians on the 6 th towards the Turkish extreme right and along the Karabalak road, held by a regiment of Turkish cavalry (4th), and a continual exchange of rifle shots between the outposts almost every morning before sunrise, little or nothing occurred between the opposing forces in this part of the theatre of war in October until the 14th. On the 8 th instant, 6 battalions, and again on the 14th, 4 battalions were despatched, via Mussin and Karakilisseh, to reinforce Mukhtar Pasha, in * * According to the Russian account of this engagement, Ismail Pasha attacked the whole line occupied by the forces of General Tergukasoff at 10 a.m., and flieir right flank at Scharoukhtcha with 12 battalions, and after a severe struggle was driven 7 versts by detach ments of the Kuban, Derbent, and Stavropol regiments with considerable loss. It is difficult to reconcile this version of the affair with that given by impartial and competent eye-witnesses, who, moreover, can have no possible object in describing a Turkish offensive movement as a defensive one, or vice versa.accordance with that General’s orders. These battalions were, it is said, among the best and most reliable under Ismail Pasha’s orders, and their withdrawal, together with the disappearance of the greater part of his irregulars, now quite precluded any idea that General might have had of assuming the offensive, if indeed such had ever been his intention at any time. On the other hand, on the 9th or 10 th, a Russian force consisting of 4 battalions, 2 sotnias, and a field battery, w r as detached under General Tsytovitch, via Hadji Bairam, to Digor, there to join General Lazareff (see page 78). This movement was, it appears, noticed by Ismail Pasha’s head- quarters, and the Turks were fully satisfied that the Russian centre was being- reinforced from the left wing. On the 14th a demonstration was made along the whole front by the Turks, with the avowed intention of attracting the Russian troops from their camps and showing their strength. The following was the general disposition of the Russian outposts:—3 advanced pickets of from 10 to 12 men each with about 60 men in support, were posted in the ravines between the Turkish right wing and Khalifalu, the latter village being occupied by a reserve of 1 battalion and 1 squadron or sotnia, reinforced at night by an additional battalion and a field battery (8 guns). The disposition of the outposts in front of Tcharekliger was much the same, with the exception that the reserve—usually consisting of 1 battalion, 2 squadrons or sotnias, and 4 guns —was pushed forward along the Mussin road to the ravines on the extreme left of the Turkish position. The Turks about noon on this day began by pushing forward a line of skirmishers towards Khalifalu from the 6 battalions occupying entrenched positions on the slopes in their front on the right of the Zor ravine, to oppose which the Russians sent forward a line of skirmishers from the village, with a squadron of cavalry on each flank. At the same time the Turks threw forward their left wing and occupied the ground which had been the scene of the conflict on the 27 th; this wing consisted of 12 battalions of infantry, 1 regi ment of regular cavalry, and 3 batteries of field and mountain guns, and had some desultory skirmishing with the Russians, but without inducing the latter to attack or make a corresponding advance on their right. In the course of the afternoon, the Russians moved 1 battalion, 2 squadrons and 4 guns from Tcharekliger towards the Turkish left. As soon as the supporting force of the Turkish right wing (10 battalions, with 2 field batteries, and 1 regiment of regular cavalry covering the flank) had pushed forward down the slopes some 1,000 yards or so, a Russian battalion with a field battery issued from Iguyr, and took up a position across the Igdyr—Khalifalu road, where they remained during the remainder of the day, being subsequently reinforced by another battalion and 4 squadrons. In the meanwhile, at about 2*30 p.m., 3 Russian battalions and a field battery advanced from the Russisn right at Igdyr ; the battery pushed forward over the plain towards Khalifalu, preceded by a battalion with 2 companies ex tended in two lines of skirmishers (one in support of the other) and the remaining two covering the front of the battery. The latter was halted at about 800 yards from Khalifalu, the remaining 2 battalions were formed up in support, and the leading battalions entered the village in extended order. The latter now came under the fire of the Turkish artillery, and soon swarmed from the village to avoid the shells, and, forming an extended line some hundreds of yards in front of it, out of rifle range of the ’lurks, crept cautiously forward, taking every advantage of the rifle pits, stone screens, and natural cover formed by the rocky nature of the ground; they were soon indeed almost entirely out of sight, for, ow ing to the continual skirmishing that had taken place between the Turkish advanced positions and Khalifalu, the ground had been thickly studded with every kind of artificial cover, from which the skirmishers, both Turkish and Russian, were in the habit of firing at each other with a minimum amount of damage to either side. IJoth sides now kept up an incessant fire till night fall, in which the links decidedly carried off the palm for wasting ammunition—their batteries in fact firing some 100 rounds at the Russian supports without, it is said, doing any damage. ^ 1 owards evenin 0 *, the Russians moved 3 squadrons and 4 guns from Igdyr to Ichaiek-94 liger, and 1 battalion from Khoshkhabar to Oba. The Russian cavalry, with the exception of the squadrons mentioned, remained in camp. The Turkish losses in the affair are given as 1 officer and 3 men wounded. Those of the Russians are not known, but were probably as insignificant. The Russian troops engaged, according to their own accounts, were the 150th (Taman) and 75th (Sevastopol) regiments, 2 squadrons of Caucasus dragoons and 3 sotnias of Caucasus Cossacks. As a demonstration to compel the Russians to show their strength, these proceedings on the part of Ismail Pasha w r ere futile. There was an absence of reality about them which must soon have been as evident to the Russians as to the Turks themselves, and no more was seen by the Turks than was every day visible in camp, while beyond the appearance of the single battalion at Oba, there was no indication on the part of the Russians to what extent they occupied the villages. On the 13th or 14th, a large force of Russian cavalry was detached and made a reconnaissance or demonstration in the direction of Kagisman and Nachdshevan, with a view to interrupting the Turkish reinforcements on their way to join Mukhtar Pasha. Retreat of the Turkish Right Wing to Kieupri-keui. On the morning of the 16th a general parade of all the Russian troops under General Tergukasoff took place, and a salute of 101 guns was fired in honour of the victory before Kars. On the same evening a telegram in cypher was received at the Turkish head-quarters from Mukhtar Pasha announcing his defeat, and ordering an immediate retreat to Kieupri-keui. The contents of the telegram were kept secret, but a council of war was at once held in Ismail Pasha’s tent, and at 8 p.m. orders were issued for a general retreat to the positions that were occupied before the 16th September. The baggage was now hastily packed, and at 9 p.m. the tents were already being struck. At 7 p.m. the Turkish head-quarter camp was struck and sent up the mountain. The greater part of the artillery on the right wing w r as moved across the ravine near Ghinudi towards Zor, as soon as possible after the issue of orders—or about midnight. A half battery remained on the ground in front of head-quarters till 3 p.m., when it also retired to take up a position near Ghinudi, but all the infantry, except 6 battalions, continued to occupy the advanced posts in front of each wing till early morning, when they followed the baggage trains to the rear, the advanced posts being finally withdrawn shortly before sunrise. The distance to be got over was short—two hours’ march by daylight—but the night was dark, and the road bad, especially wdiere the deep and precipitous Zor ravine had to be crossed, so that the day was well advanced before the troops were settled down in their old position near Zor, which they had occupied for six weeks immediately after crossing the frontier on the 6 th August (some 1,650 feet above the position they had just quitted). The night was fortunately fine, and the arrangements for the retreat ap pear to have been well considered. Everything was carried out in an orderly manner and without confusion, and the retreat was unmolested by the Russians. On the 18th the Turkish force amounting to 24 battalions of infantry, 2 regiments of cavalry, 36 field and 13 mountain guns, and a large body of irregulars remained in the Zor position. Of these, 10 battalions and 2 field batteries occupied the Mussin Pass, village, and surrounding heights, and the remainder the positions that w ere held some six weeks previously. Throughout this day all w 7 as quiet on both sides. In the afternoon the Russian outposts were pushed forward to the edge of the plateau on the right bank of the Zor ravine, and on to the ground occupied on the previous day by the Turkish head-quarters. After sunset the Turks fired a few shells at the Russian bivouac fires. During the night the Russians struck their camps near the village of Chiraka, and before daylight on the 19th the whole of their force was advancing in two columns towards the Turkish position. On the right a column, consisting95 of 7 or 8 battalions of infantry, 8 or 10 squadrons of sotnias and 2 batterios of artillery advanced from Chiraka by the road leading from that nlacHn ir n rSa/fmce he of left f 0f ^ P °tT ^ b ? tL less cavalrv a lvsnc J f ' ^ 7, 7'? 3 ° r 4 batterieS of artiller y’ but the Xole^f rZr^T u K °^ kh f bar Strai « ht towards th e Turkish centre, rons an 1 ™ u 8 '^ f ° rCe (SOme 15 or 16 battalions, 16 squad! ns and sotnias, and 40 field and mountain guns) advancing to the attank hoping no doubt to catch the Turks on the movf. ^ aavanCin ^ to the attack ’ The latter were, however, firmlj established in strong positions on the mountains, and were anxious to meet the Russian attack. sunnortedhv 1° wJ Y a ' m ” Y 6 * c USSian ^ column Pushed forward a battery hy 3 battalions of infantry and soon came into action with the k sh ^uns at a long range. The infantry on either side were out of range but the artillery fire lasted for upwards of an hour, doing little or no damage ! it was stopped by a storm of rain and was not re-opened till dark, when the Russians retired. 4 -u r&gt; At ^ he S , ame . tlme ^ hat the artillery fire commenced on the Turkish left the Russian skirmishers from the centre column were pushed forward from the position the 1 urks had occupied two days previously, to within some - 3,000 yards ot the lurkish centre, but, on coming under the fire of the Turkish artillery, were checked,^ and made no further advance during the day. On the Turkish right, the Russians made an advance towards the hill on the north-east of the Zor ravine, occupied by the Turks with 2 battalions and { bantam guns; they pushed their skirmishers to the very base of the hill hut then suddenly retired for some unknown reason, without even exchanging shots, and at noon had re-occupied the positions held by their outposts on the previous night. In the centre, however, where the firing had been stopped about noon by the rain, and both sides were hidden from view for upwards of two hours the Russians, succeeded during the storm in moving forward a field battery (8 guns) 0 a bill where its fire took the Turkish batteries en echarpe, the latter being eche oned along the crests of the hills. The Turkish gunners were, however e ? U Ti o • ° CCaS10n ’ ^ickly changing front, they gradually got the better ot the Russians, though the latter were soon afterwards reinforced by 4 more guns, and after a severe artillery combat, silenced the Russian battery, explod ing 4 ammunition wagons and driving the teams and gunners from the guns which were not removed by the Russians till nightfall, when they retired along the whole front from the advanced positions they had taken up back to Myr and the adjacent villages. ‘ Owing to the firing having been exclusively confined to artillery, and at a long mnge, the losses were not heavy, the Turkish being given as 3 gunners contused and a few men of the infantry killed and wounded. The Russians give their losses as 5 men killed, but do not mention the number wounded. 1 hey had at least one gun disabled. On the Turkish side, another council of war was held in the evenino-, at which it was decided to continue the retreat* This was well arranged and orderly, but being suddenly decided on for strategical reasons, unfortunately happened at a time when there were not sufficient animals in camp to carry away the whole of the spare ammunition and commissariat; stoies that had been accumulated. The latter, moreover, owing to the recent arrival of large quantities of rice purchased at Khoi in Persia, were in greater quantity than had ever been the case since Ismail Pasha’s force had advanced from Bayazid, and after loading all the animals available, there remained some 500 boxes of ammunition (500,000 rounds), some tents, enormous piles of horse shoes, nails, &amp;c., and large quantities of rice and biscuit. The latter were mashed up and destroyed by smouldering fire, the tents were torn to shreds, cases of rifles and bayonets were opened and their contents distributed among the soldiers to be carried away, and at about 2 p.m., when the last man was leaving the ground, the cartridges were fired. Fortunately for the Turks it was a clear, fine, moonlight night—a striking * Only on account of the disaster before Kars, and not on account of General TergnkasofFs demonstration. 2 B96 contrast to the bad weather experienced in their night march 48 hours pre viously and to the much worse weather encountered on many a subsequent nio-ht in their retreat—and when day dawned the whole of the baggage and heavy guns and nearly all the troops had defiled through the pass, and were in safety on the south side of it. The retreat was accomplished by two roads— the main Mussin-—Igdyr and the Zor—Mussin roads. The battalions and batteries of the left wing with their reserve ammunition and baggage retired by the former, and the main body by the latter—a track which the Turks during their stay on Russian territory had converted into a fair road for guns. The ground to the north of the pass is open and undulating, hut on the south side, the Zor—Mussin tracks all merge into a single road, and at one time durino' the night a block occurred, when camels laden with ammunition, baggage ponies, sheep, and soldiers of the escort got mingled together in dangerous confusion. The delay, however, was short, and by sunrise the baggage and a portion of the troops had arrived in Mussin, the rear guards (consisting each of 3 battalions with 3 mountain guns') holding the two passes on the hills overlooking the roads. It was an anxious moment for the Turks, for had their rear guard on the Zor road been hard pressed and forced to retire, it would in all probability have been annihilated, as the steep and winding tract on the south of the pass would have been exposed throughout to the fire of guns placed on the highest part of the road. Fortune, however, favoured the Turks, for the Russians who had been some 20 hours under arms by the time they retired to their camps on the night of the 19th, were hardly in a fit state to start on the morning of the 20 th in immediate pursuit, when they learned— as they did at daylight—that not a man of the Turkish force remained on Russian territory. i x v The Turkish force reached Mussin (9 miles) in safety, but only to be hurried forward again to Ippek Gedik (13 miles)—a strong position where it had been determined to make a first halt. The leading baggage animals reached Ippek Gedik early in the afternoon, from which time up to midnight baggage and troops continued to arrive at the camp wet, hungry, and miserable, for the weather was now cold and stormy, and the road bad, and many of the overworked and scantily fed baggage animals were left in a dying state by the way side ; the march was followed by a bitterly cold night in camp at Ippek Gedik, where there was neither water nor firewood. Mussin village lies in a level plain some 4 miles broad, enclosed on the north and south by ranges of mountains. Two miles south-east of the village there is a narrow defile, through which the line of retreat lay, and here on the hills covering the entrance to the defile w r cre posted the 6 battalions and 6 mountain guns forming the Turkish rear guard. On the morning of the 19th General Tergukasoff, finding that Ismail Pasha had retired over the mountains, at once moved forward in pursuit, and about noon the cavalry of the Russian advance guard crossed the frontier by the roads by which the Turks had retired, and descended at once into Mussin ; this village had been vacated, but in such haste that some tents belonging to the Koordish auxiliaries fell into their hands, together with a small quantity of small-arm ammunition and commissariat stores, which the Turks had not found time to destroy. The Russian cavalry (2 squadrons of dragoons and 3 sotnias of Cossacks) now pushed on to the entrance of the defile, following up the Koordish irregulars who had been left in the Mussin plain to cover the Turkish retreat, but on coming within range of the guns of the Turkish rear guard late in the afternoon, were at once checked by the fire of the latter, and retired to Mussin. The Turkish rear guard retired shortly after dark and joined the main body at Ippek Gedik about 2 a.m. on the morning of the 20th. At about 9 a m. on the same day orders were issued by Ismail Pasha to continue the retreat, and by 11 a.m. the camps were struck, and the baggage had started for Gerger. At noon on this day 4 battalions and 6 mountain guns started from Ipek for Bayazid, which it had been determined to occupy. This force, which was placed under Liva Achmet Mukhtar Pasha, marched via Djevna (a more southerly road than the direct one, which lay in full view of possible Cossacks on the range of hills south of Mussin), with orders to retire on Van should the Russians have advanced and seized Bayazid from Igdyr via97 the Karabulak pass. It reached Bayazid in safety, however, on the same night, but subsequently retired, as will be afterwards seen, to Barghiri, on the road to Van. The day’s march on the 2 . 0 th was to Gerger—a small village on the left bank of the Euphrates, distant some 23 miles. The march was a long and trying one for troops in such a harassed condition and impeded with long- trains ot baggage, and the camp which was on a good defensible position on the right bank of the stream, was not reached till night. To raise the spirits of the troops, who appeared to think that the hurried retreat was due to fear of hussian pursuit, Ismail Pasha caused copies ot a telegram to be circulated in the camp just before starting, to the effect that a Russian General had been taken prisoner in the Schipka Pass, together with bis army-corps of 50,000 men ! This rumour was generally believed in, and it did not ooze out until two or three days afterwards that the telegram bad no foundation. In the course of the day’s march a detachment of Cossacks that had crossed the Russian frontier near the Balikly Gol, came down by a mountain track to the neighbourhood of Utch-Kilisseh, near which place they came into contact with some Turkish regular cavalry and a skirmish ensued in which the Kol-Aghani* (wing officer) and 2 troopers on the Turkish side were either killed or taken prisoners. The Cossacks, however, retired, and did not molest the Turkish retreat. Some 150 stragglers were left behind on the line of march during this day’s retreat, and great exhaustion was now everywhere apparent in the force. Gerger was reached in the night. On this day, Ismail Pasha was joined at Utch-Kilisseh by the 4 battalions that had been sent from the camp at Zor on the 14th to join Mukhtar Pasha. Having heard of the disaster at Kars, they remained halted at Utch-Kilisseh awaiting the retreat of the right wing. On this day the cavalry of General Tergukasoff’s advance guard reached TJtch-b ilisseh, and a body of Turkish cavalry numbering some 1,000 sabres (regulars and irregulars), were sent along the road to reconnoitre. Thev came upon and surprised a Russian cavalry picket at Tachlidgeh; following them up, they then came on the Russian cavalry in the strength of some 6 or 7 squadrons and sotnias at Utch-Kilisseh, with whom, however, they do not seem to have interfered. Orders were now sent to the Turkish cavalry to check any further advance of the Russian cavalry, but the latter appeared nevertheless at Karakilisseh on the afternoon of the following day (24th). The infantry of Tergukasoff’s advance guard reached Mussin on the 23rd, their advance being much impeded by the bad state of the weather and road. Having now considerably distanced the Russians, none of whom had been seen following in rear during the day, a halt was made till midnight on the 21st, when the force again retired some 15 miles to a strong position 3 miles west of Karakilisseh, where it halted for a clear day (23rd) to rest the troops and allow stragglers to come up. Some 350 or 400 sick and some stores were now despatched in advance on'ponies to Erzeroum. Early on the morning of the 24th Ismail Pasha again resumed his retreat, the baggage and ammunition train moving off at 1 a.m., followed at 3.30 by the infantry (24 battalions) and artillery (33 guns). 1 battalion and 3 field guns were now detached by a southerly and circuitous route to reinforce the detachment at Bayazid. The rear guard, consisting of 5 battalions and 2 squadrons, finally left the position at 4.30 a.m. 'Hie day was fine and there was a slight frost hardening the roads, and the head of the column reached Zeidikan (18 miles) at the foot of the Kosd Dagh about 10.30 a.m. (between Karakilisseh and Zeidikan there is a gradual rise of some 500 feet). Great consternation prevailed among the inhabitants of the villages through which the Turkish army was now retiring, and all who could manage to transport themselves and their families accompanied the Turkish troops, dreading the Koords who followed in rear. A council of w r ar was now held, and reconnoitring parties of cavalry sent forward along the road to Delibaba, and towards evening the column which had halted near Zeidikan during the greater part of the day, was directed by the Djeli—Gedik road on Kurdali—some 6 miles distant—where the troops arrived * It was generally supposed by the Turks that this man, who was a Caucasian, deserted, and went over to the Russians during the skirmish.98 and bivouacked at about 7 p.m. At the same time a flanking column of 5 battalions and some cavalry marched by the Chat or easternmost road across the mountains. The Djeli—Gedik road attains a height of 6,200 feet near Halias; it was by this road that General Tergukasotf retired in the previous June, and it had been greatly improved by the Russians, still, owing to the exceptionally steep gradients and muddy subsoil, it was a formidable obstacle to a retreating army encumbered with wheeled transport, especially in wet weather. On the 25th, the column marching again at about 1 a.m., found the road all but impassable. AVith each gun, there were 500 infantry and extra relays of horses, yet it took 8 hours to drag them a distance of little more than half a mile near Kiurdali, and so difficult was the greater portion of this day’s march that the artillery did not arrive at the camping ground near Halias, distant about 11 miles, till the following night. Snow fell continually, and marching for the strongest w r as no easy matter under the circumstances; for the sick and exhausted it was in many cases impossibe, and many a poor fellow was left to perish by the roadside, utterly unable to stagger on a yard further. In the afternoon the troops prepared to bivouack near the memorable heights of Halias, where Tergukasoff’s advance had been checked in the early summer; the baggage was some three miles ahead at the village of Henkilias, but on a report being received that Cossacks had been seen in the neighbour hood, it was ordered back to Halias and Henkilias occupied by a detachment of cavalry. On this day the cavalry of General Heimann occupied Milliduz, its further advance having been checked on the previous day near Zewin by Mukhtar Pacha’s timely attack, the news of which reached Ismail Pasha this afternoon ; consequently it was reasonably concluded at the head quarters of the latter that the retreat of the right wing, or its junction with Mukhtar Pasha’s force, was now secure, unless the Russians were in force at Milliduz, which fortunately for the Turks was not the case. Still up to the actual hour of marching on the 26th, it was understood that the column w ould avoid the Delibaba defile and reach Kieupri-keui by a circuitous road over the mountains. By 5 a.m. on the 26th, the baggage train was moving towards the defile (6 miles from Henkilias, and 9 or 10 miles from Halias) followed at 7 a.m. by the infantry and artillery; this portion of the road was good, and by 1 p.m. the baggage and ammunition train had cleared the defile, and by 2 p.m. was parked in the plain beneath awaiting orders. It was shortly afterwards followed by the artillery and infantry. Thus the retreat had not been practically interfered with by General Tergukasoft’s cavalry since the affair near Mussin on the 19th. The cavalry of General Heimann’s advanced guard on this day pushed forward from Milliduz to Zewin, and occupied the ford over the Araxes, near Maoudjikh, with a detachment, but the retreat of Ismail Pasha was in no way interfered with. This was continued in the afternoon and by midnight the greater part of the baggage train had arrived at Kieupri-keui; it was followed next morning by the artillery and infantry, the whole force reaching Kieupri-keui by 3 p.m. on the 27th where it now joined the force under Mukhtar Pasha. Had the Russian cavalry been more enterprising, they might have seriously interfered with the retreat of the baggage train near Delibaba on the 26th, or if not there, certainly during the subsequent march to Kieupri- keui. The flanking column on the Chat road might, it may be said, have prevented the approach of the Russian cavalry near Delibaba, but the column, some 10 miles in length, in subsequently moving over the plain, undoubtedly invited attack, and though the infantry soldiers who led a number of horses throughout the line, might have made a show of resistance, they were much too few and too exhausted to repel the assaults of cavalry at different points, and a few squadrons would have thrown the whole column into irretrievable con fusion and disorder. Whatever the shortcommings of Ismail Pasha may have hitherto been as a general, it must now only fairly be allowed that he had proved himself of99 signal advantage to his army in this retreat, both by his natural determina tion and shrewdness, as well as by his thorough knowledge of the country. The loss of the stores at Zor, Mussin, and elsewhere, were unavoidable contingencies, and considering the unexpected circumstances of the case, this rapid retreat, made over a long distance, in the face of many difficulties, and under bad conditions of weather and roads, reflects credit on the Turkish force. To Mukhtar Pasha’s courage and high military instinct must however be attributed the safe arrival of the right wing at Kieupri-keui, for it was by his timely offensive from his position at Ketchek Sood, that the Russian cavalry was checked in its advance on Khorassan on the 24th, and time given to the right wing to effect its retreat in safety. The state of the latter on its arrival at Kieupri Keui was, as may be supposed, anything but satisfactory. The battalions were deplorably weak, for though the pursuit of Tergukasoff’s force had tended to prevent straggling, many had nevertheless been left on the road utterly unable to keep up from sheer exhaustion. There was moreover now a distinctly visible apathy tending to demoralisation among the men—the natural result of their continued inactivity and disappointment, arising from the senseless operations which had characterised the action of the right wing since its formation. The force on arrival at Kieupri-keui consisted of 24 battalions (averaging 400 rank an file), 33 field and mountain guns, and some 2,000 cavalry (regular and irregular), and amounted to some 14,000 men of all arms, of which it is said at least one- third were unfit for service. The 4 battalions and 6 mountain guns that were detached from IppekGedik to Bayazid reached the latter place on the night of the 20 th, where they were joined by a battalion that had been stationed there for some time past, and afterwards by the 1 battalion and 3 field guns from Karakilisseh, but Liva Achmet Mukhtar Pasha deeming the place untenable,'' retired shortly afterwards to Barghiri, in the direction of Van, where he was joined by 2 battalions of the Baghdad Army- Corps, the total force under his orders now numbering 8 battalions of infantry (averaging some 450 rank and file), 3.squadrons of cavalry and 9 guns. „ * 2 c * According to some accounts it was occupied by the Russians.the EETREAT FROM KIEUPRI-KEUI to erzeroum. The situation of Kieupri-Keui, as the point where the roads from Kars and Bayazid meet, make it at once a place of importance, both as a o-enerai depot and a strategical point for the defence of Armenia. It is, moreover, a place which is described as technically possessing certain advantages for defence, with previous preparation. Little or nothing, how ever, had been done in the latter sense in anticipation of a crisis which had all along been regarded by the Turks as impossible, hut which now was inevitable, as soon as the heads of the advancing Russian columns were stiong enough to attack. . , The Deve Boyun*—a naturally strong position covering Erzeroum on the eas t— W as also incomplete as regards defence and was now practically denuded of troops, and the city, 7 miles in rear, was still open to attack by an enemy strong enough to advance simultaneously on either flank, vid Olti, or by the roads leading over the highlands on the right bank of the Araxes. ( onsiderable exertion had been made, it is true, since the news of the defeat before Kars had been received ; on the morning of the 18th, every available man m the town was sent to the Deve Boyun, under Faizi Pasha (Kohlmann), to work at the defences, and the latter had succeeded, mainly by his own ability and energy, in throwing up and arming, by the 23rd, two batteries for field guns on command ing points in the position, and was now’engaged in making such other defensive preparations as he was able with the few weak, disheartened men at his disposal, consisting, for the greater part, of arrested deserters, convalescents from hospital, and the dregs of the Mustaphiz. In addition to the other defences to the city, the plain north of it was flooded as far as possible. Nor was the state of affairs at Kars more reassuring to the Turkish cause. The 31 broken battalions had been formed into 14 battalions, hut amounted to no more than 10,000 men, including the few stragglers from the recent defeat that had since come in; the garrison however was so demoralized and dispirited by hardships, fatigue, and defeat, that the governor, in his last telegram to the Grand Vizier, stated that he could not hope to hold the fortress for any length r of time, if even he could resist a first assault. Telegraphic communication between Kars and Erzeroum was cut on the evening of the 17th. On the Russian side, little or nothing appears to have been done except detaching the two forces previously mentioned to Begli-Ahmed and Kagisman and collecting the prisoners and trophies of the victory, until the 18th or l&amp;th, w r hen all ttm Russian troops quitted Vezin Keui and the Aladja Dagh in two columns, under Generals Heimann and Melikoff, to follow up Mukhtar Pasha and besidge Kars, respectively. The former force consisted of the Caucasus Grenadier Division, a combined Division (4 regiments of the 21st, 38th, and 39th Divisions), 3 bat talions of chasseurs, 16 or 17 batteries of artillery, and a large force ot cavalry, amounting to some 35 battalions, 40 squadrons and sotnias, and 130 guns. The latter consisted of the 1st (Moscow) Grenadier Division, the 40th Division, two battalions of Caucasus Sappers, and the siege artillery from Alexandropol, and amounted to some 30 battalions, 40 squadrons and sotnias, and 120 guns. The siege park was at once brought forward, and preparations made for attacking the fortress on the south and south-east sides. On the 24th, the cavalry of General Heimann’s advanced guard had crossed the Soghanli Dagh, and was worsted in a fight near Zewin, and, by the 27th, the Russian columns were crossing the mountains vid Milliduz and march ing on Khorassan in force. No alternative consequently remained to the Turks, on the first appearance of General Heimann s troops in this direction, hut to destroy all surplus stores and abandon Kieupri-Keui. This was carried out unmolested by the Russians, and, on the 28th, the Turks, who were now under Ismail Pasha pro tern (Mukhtar Pasha having pro ceeded, on the evening of the 27th, to inspect the defences of the Deve Boyun), retired to Hassan Kaleh (9 miles), where they bivouacked for the night. So * * Meaning in Turkish “ The Camel’s Back.”101 aggravated was now the disorganization of the Turkish troops—so confirmed is their habitual neglect of the commonest precautions against surprise—that, about 2 a.m. on the morning of the 29th, their rear guard was overtaken and surprised by a Kussian force (2 regiments of dragoons,* 2 sotnias of Cossacks, a rocket troop, and halt a battery of horse artillery) without the slightest alarm being given of its approach. The village of Hassan Kaleh was traversed and occupied by the Russians, and many Turkish officers and men, who had sought shelter in the place, were killed or taken prisoners. The Turkish rear guard—consisting of the four Kieupri-Keui battalions, under Mohammed Ali Bey, which had bivouacked separately—was cut off, and had to fight its way through the Russians, and it was not until daylight that the main body of the Turkish force could recover from the alarm into which it had been thrown, and resume its march, without, however, attempting to rescue its rear guard. The night was dark and wet, and so complete was the surprise that the Turks in Hassan Kaleh were first alarmed by being fired on by the Russian guns. According to Russian accounts, some 100 Turks were shot or cut down, and 1 Pasha and 120 officers and men taken prisoners. The Russian infantry occupied Hassan Kaleh at about 5 p.m., and the cavalry pushed on somewhat further; but so great was the fatigue of the Russian troops that no pursuit was attempted, and the Turks continued their retreat after 4 ft jdight unmolested. They reached the Deve Boyun about 11 a.m., with their diminished battalions, marching in tolerable order; these were now posted at the several points- pre-determined by Mukhtar Pasha. Their rear guard had, however, to maintain a running fight with the Russians before it was able to extricate itself. One battalion broke up, and the men dispersed, it was believed, to their homes; the remaining three battalions eventually reached the Deve Boyun, but a large proportion of the men were missing. The firing between the Turkish rear guard and the Russians did not cease till near 11 a.m. The Russian advance guard pushed forward in the course of the day to Kuruyuk, distant some 3 miles from the Turkish outposts, where it was joined on the following morning (30th) by the main body from Kieupri-Keui, with head-quarters at Hassan Kaleh. r l he cavalry of Generals Heimann and Tergukasoff had effected a junction at Kieupri-Keui on the 28th (the same day that Ismail Pasha’s force had quitted it), and the Russian columns now pushed forward to the Deve Boyun, but so severe was the fatigue of the troops, entailed by their recent forced marches, and so great the depth of their columns, that a halt was necessary before their forces could be sufficiently closed up to undertake active operations against the Turks now holding the head of their column in check. Mukhtar Pasha was now again in command of the Tuikish forces and lost no time in turning the respite allowed him by General Heimann to account in strengthening his position, which is described as strong and the line of defence well planned and armed, especially in the centre and on the right flank. On the 31st, the Russians reconnoitred towards Mukhtar Pasha's position, feeling apparently for a road towards the left flank of the Turks, and the latter at once took the hint and strengthened the points menaced. Both sides now continued to watch each other till the 4th; the Russians, on the one side, busily reconnoitring the Turkish positions, and the Turks, on the other, using every additional hour allowed them in strengthening their defences. The chances of the latter, indeed, looked better and better every moment. Their demoralization, it is true, was great, and their fighting qualities much shaken, but the Mushir was doing his best to revive their confidence, and, on the 31st, addressed each brigade separately, with apparently good effect. By the 3rd November, some 3,000 Turkish fugitives and stragglers had rejoined the colours, and two battalions were expected on the following day (4th) from Trebizond. The position occupied by the Turks on the Deve Boyun had the common fault of being too extended for the force holding it, being nearly 8 miles in its entire length. Communication between the different parts of the position, as well as between the position of the reserves in rear and the front line was moreover difficult, both by reason of the rocky and precipitous nature * The IGth (Novgorod) and 17th (Sieversk) Dragoons.102 of the slopes and the isolated character of the various hills on which the Turkish troops were posted. It may be briefly described as consisting in the centre of a large elevated plateau with precipitous sides, and difficult ot access (held by 12 battalions, with 6 siege and 12 field guns); on the right of a range of hills of considerable elevation, of which the 4 isolated peaks or mamelons were entrenched or fortified; and on the left of a still more elevated mountainous block, situated between the two roads which, coming from the Passin valley, circle round its base on either side into the plain north of Erzeroum, by Wank and the village of Mudurgha respectively, i'he defences of the right and centre covered the only two other roads which lead from the Passin valley to Erzeroum, the one being the main caravan road from Hassan Kaleh passing the base of the plateau to the right, and the other a bye road from Kertren, skirting the hill which formed the extreme right of the position. From that point a wide gulley runs down the position on each side, embracing beyond the plateau a low range of hills in front of, and only separated by a deep valley from the line of defences on the Turkish left. The whole of these defences were held, on the evening of the 3rd, by Mukhtar Pasha, with a force of some 40 battalions with 8 siege, 63 field, and 17 mountain guns, amounting in all to some 20,000 men. The fieldworks and trenches were, however, far from completed by this date, and had the serious defect of being constructed of stone with a mere outward facing of earth. The want of some good cavalry was now severely felt by the Mushir, both for scouting and harassing the enemy’s communications, but the little that was left of this arm in the Turkish force appears to have been hardly of any use. General Heimann had advanced from the Soghanli-Dagh with some 35 battalions and 100 guns, and General Tergukasoff from Igdyr with some 10 or 12 battalions and 40 guns (the latter had left a detachment at Bayazid, and had, moreover, to watch his communications, again threatened by the Koords). The combined Russian forces which had moved up to attack Mukhtar Pasha on the Deve-Boyun by the 3rd, consisted of some 40 battalions, with from 120 to 13u guns, and a general attack was fixed for the following day. Battle of the Deve-Boyun. During the night of the 3rd, large bodies of Russian infantry were pushed forward and concealed in the hollows at the foot of the Turkish positions, and by daylight the whole of General Heimann’s and TergukasofTs artillery had advanced in the plain and was ready to open fire. At about 7 a.m. a body of Russian cavalry moved towards the Turkish centre, and Mukhtar Pasha ordered some Turkish cavalry down the slopes to check its advance. The Russian cavalry at once retired, followed by the Turks, but the latter were now soon exposed to a withering fire from some concealed Russian infantry, and immediately broke and tied. By 8.30 there was a general artillery fire along the whole line. At about 11 a.m. the Russian infantry began to advance against the right of the Turkish position, where an artillery and infantry combat raged during the remainder of the day. By 3 p.m., however, the Turks, though offering a stubborn resistance, had been gradually pressed back for upwards of a mile, the infantry on both sides keeping at about 500 yards from each other and firing from under cover. During the early part of the day the Mushir was himself here in command and was slightly wounded, and in the course ot the engagement the Turkish centre was considerably weakened to reinforce the right, where the Russians were visibly gaining ground. On the Turkish left, the Russians apparently remained satisfied with keeping the Turks in check, and though a constant musketry as well as artillery fire was kept up all day, the Russian infantry did not push forward to nearer than 1,000 yards from the defences occupied by the Turks. The battle, however, was decided in the centre. To the left of the road, at a short distance in front of Mukhtar Pasha’s head-quarter camp, lay the large, flat-topped, elevated plateau, forming the centre of the position, and held in the morning by 12 battalions with 6 siege and 12 field guns ; by 3 p.m. however this detachment had been considerably reduced to reinforce the right,103 e ^bfth nr tirh' u t he sate,y ° f ws p° sition ’ ai ’ j * The plateau, neve theless hid been u ! ■ T™ ' ,an 6 ' eak battalions, infantry no less than Lt.w* ansucces f ull y attacked by the Russian concentrated fire from a hre-e numb Im ®. s ’ ant *. was now subjected to a severe was also a mamelon on U,e £ht “f Ihe rnnd 98 '' % UnS l? the P lain bcI ™ as plateau referred to - the 1.,h,.,’ i,,.

The two unbroken Turkish battalions remained howevei, steady and even made a forward movement towards the advancing Russians. Any attempt, however, to seriously attack such overwhelming odds was of course out of the question, and they slowly retreated after the other fugitives A striking contrast to the general debacle was the conduct of 2 companies of Turkish infantry held in reserve at head-quarters, with 2 heavy field guns, he former, led by a stafi officer, moved down a slope of the ravine in rear of the plateau to check any forward movement of the Russians; it was a timelv and judicious movement, steadily executed, and formed a pleasing contrast to the scene around; the guns also were well and coolly handled by a mounted artillery officer retiring to fresh positions as the Russian skirmishers advanced and doing all they could to check their progress. They were eventually saved. 1 he rout of the Turkish centre was complete. Some of the artillerymen detached the traces to abandon their guns, but on being quietly remonstrated with, hooked on again and made no further attempt to leave them. It was also a remarkable fact that in the general debandade no Turkish soldier was without ins arms nor was there any running or riotous conduct. About sunset the troops on the right of the Turkish left which was under the Capitan ” Mehemet Pasha, began to quit their posts and retire to 2 D104 Erzeroum,* and at about 6 p.m. the whole of the I urkish force had abandoned the Deve-Boyun and was making for the town. The attack on the Turkish rioht was not followed up, nor, fortunately for the Turks, was any attempt at pursuit made by the Russians, probably owing to the great fatigue of their troops and darkness setting in, but 36 siege and field guns, all the Turkish camps, with large quantities of stores and ammunition fell into their bands. According to General Heimann’s report, the Russians took 8 officers and 300 men prisoners. Their own losses are given as 30 officers and 800 men killed and wounded.f The firing ceased at 6.30 p.m., and the Russians bivouacked m the posi tions abandoned by the Turks. Mukhtar Pasha had been borne away by the general rout of the 1 urkish centre, and was heard of no more until he reach Erzeroum duiing the night. Three out of four of his attendants were killed. When the defeat became known at the latter place the southern gates and ramparts of the town were occupied by guards with fixed bayonets, and all ingress refused. The scene which then ensued is described by an eye-witness as terrible, thousands of men, horses, camels, oxen, &amp;c., in one jammed and struggling crowd seeking to obtain admission, and pressing against the guards, who used their bayonets freely, killing several men. Chis continued till 10 p.m., when the guards were withdrawn and the fugitives allowed to enter. The greatest terror now prevailed in the town, both on account of the expected bombardment and attack of the Russians and the anticipated \iolencc of the fugitives in seeking food and shelter.^ No excesses were, however, com mitted, and tranquility was soon restored with daylight. Operations before Euzeroum. With a Russian army numbering some 30,000 men with over 150 guns on the Deve-Boyun, and flushed with victory, Mukhtar Pasha’s chance of saving Erzeroum seemed indeed anything but hopeful. Disheartened, however, as he must have been at bis succession of disasters, he did not give w ay to despair, but again showed himself to be a leader of energy, resolution, and courage, and at once set about doing his best to continue the resistance. On the night of the 5th a Russian Major with a flag of truce was sent to Erzeroum to demand the surrender of the town within 8 hours, and a Yuzbashi was sent back with him to ask for terms. The Russian reply was that if the town were not surrendered by noon on the following day it would be bombarded, and when captured, handed over to pillage for 3 days. The panic in the town was soon at its highest pitch, and at a general council it w r as determined on the part of the townspeople to surrender, but Mukhtar Pasha who had in the.mean- while communicated with the Sultan, refused, and stated his determination to resist to the last. The Turkish forces in Erzeroum now numbered 30,000 men in all, but of these there were only some 10,000 men who could be depended on to face the Russians. The remaining 20,000 were made up of worn-out Redifs, convales cents, newly raised Mustaphiz, and Mussulman citizens. This force Mukhtar Pasha divided into 5 brigades—4 to man the forts and enceinte, with one in reserve. To each brigade was attached some 180 horsemen under a Yuzbashi. Fortunately for the Turks, the Russians again showed themselves slow in following up their success, and time, which was everything to the defeated Turks, was again allowed them to recover from their disasters. On the 7th the Russians threw up a work on the summit of a hill some * The “ Capitan ” saved all his guns, 17 in number. f The brunt of the fighting appears to have been borne by the Elizabethpol, Erivan, and Tiflis regiments. j As an instance of the famished condition of the Turkish soldiers, they are described as having in one case entered a garden of cabbages and devoured the latter raw. That no violence under these circumstances should have been offered to the Armenian citizens, speaks volumes for the Turkish soldier.105 «r s s , ‘ Wrteritf r ,™ th * “—* * 1 . to stop desertion caused U men^lf’ n V ! n f e ?' ded ° n strin S ent measures and at the same tfme del.Xl t°l f ° r th,S offence when 011 guard, cowardice in the battle of the 4 th. eral officer3 &gt; including a Bimbasbi, for Boyim 'in^o 'jfn* 0t tlle Russians advanced in force from the Deve- affeTa su pr ^The'o he™ 1 ,! , defendi ^.

He was a pure Russian and gave a pitiful account of the state of the Russian camps. Gmnng as he did at such a moment, and giving an account of the state of affairs on the Russian side, which was contradicted by the villagers, it was generally suimosed in Erzeroum that he was sent there by authority. 11 The supply of provisions, See., in Erzeroum was now extremely scanty, partly on account of the inundations which cut off access from th ® T '“ a | es “ the north of the town, and partly on account ot the roving bands of l.ashi- Bazouks that infested the neighbourhood and effectually stopped all traffic. On the 18th it was determined to bring back the Government archives, &amp;c and military chest, which had been sent to Baiburt after the defeat of the Deve Boyun, and confidence in being able to resist the Russians now grew stronger every day. Operations of the Turkish Left and Russian Right Wings (Ardahan). Early in September the Turkish left wing at Pennek, which had recently been reinforced to 6 battalions of infantry with some irregular cavalry and 6 mountain guns, advanced to Tchermak, where it was joined by 2 battalions and some new levies from Ardanutsch, and threatened Ardahan, which was weakly garrisoned by the Russians ; the latter, however, instead °f evacuating the place as was expected by the Turks, reinforced the garrison with 3 | batta lions from Akhalzick and General Oklobjio’s force before Batoum* the Turks now made a feint or reconnaissance towards Ardahan, but finding it strongly occupied, again withdrew to Tchermak, and the detachment belonging to the Batoum command being withdrawn to Ardanutsch, the b battalions and 6 mountain guns again took up a strong position at Pennek; this force Mukhtar Pasha intended in the last days ot September to reinforce fiom vars with a field battery. Events, however, made him alter his decision and he was obliged, in consequence of the severe fighting early in October before Kars, to order 5 battalions of the Pennek force to that fortress. On the 13th the Russian force occupying Ardahan had been reinlorced to 16 battalions of infantry with 4 batteries of field and 2 of mountain guns, under General Komaroff, and about the 25th, a force consisting of 6 battalions, 12 sotnias. and 8 guns were moved via Zarshat to Parget, to reinforce the Russian force before Kars. m i • i i xv • x-n Nothin' now occurred on the Russian right or Turkish left wings till the Ctb October 1 when 5 of the battalions with 2 mountain guns, stationed at Pennek were ordered to Kars by Mukhtar Pasha; the remaining battalion with 4 mountain guns, joined the Mushir in bis retreat from Kars at Hun- The Olti line was now quite denuded of Turkish troops, and on the 16th * According to some accounts 16 battalions of the Rion Corps were also moved to Ardahan the 15th September.107 * 7t I’ P‘ :tober . » Russian column, under General Komaroff, affain advanced tteni lt;no°K PUShcd ° D un °Pl )0Sed - farafolti but was account of Ibe .nnT'i: 01 ' ' c 8 T SOn ;t is “0‘exactly known, but probably on force liefnre V '' S iollnd 'mpassable—and reached General Melikoff’s sTatti ons lO or ip' ° r , ab0Ut the 3rd ° f It numbered some '5 battalions, 10 or 12 squadrons or sotmas, and 36 guns.

On the 2nd and 3rd September, engagements took place between the Russian troops near fort St. Nicolas and Kutais, and on the latter day, and the 9th, artillery combats before Batoum. On the 15th September, 16 battalions were moved from the coast to Ardahan; and, on the 22 nd, the Russian force at Soukoum Kaleh was removed to Tiflis. . the 2ist&gt; an artillei 7 engagement took place before Batoum, and Fort St. Nicolas was bombarded by the Turkish fleet. Nothing now^ appears to have taken place till the 31st October, when some engagements again took place between detachments of the Kabuleti column and insurgents, near Kakout. About the 16th October, Dervisch Pasha detached 10 battalions from Batoum to Erzeroum, via Trebizond, by Mukhtar Pasha’s order. On the 7 th and 8 th November, the Russian artillery, which had been remforced by several siege guns from Ardahan, kept up a heavy fire on the lurkjsh positions at Katsoubani, and, according to Russian accounts, it was tlien discovered that the Turks were still strong in artillery and infantry. The Russian losses in this engagement are given as 8 men killed, and 1 officer and 38 men wounded. On the 11 th November, cannonading again took place all day, without apparently doing much damage on either side. Towards the end of August, a serious insurrection broke out in Daghestan, and severe engagements appear to have taken place between the Russian troops (the 20 th Division and Militia) and the insurgents on the 23rd September at Lavatsch, on the 24th at Koubisch, on the 30th at Kaipent, and, on the 3rd October at Dschemi-kent; in all of which, according to Russian accounts, the insurgents were defeated and dispersed, with slight loss to the Russian troops. By the 14th October, the insurrection appears to have been crushed in Southern Daghestan, but engagements took place in the central part—near Lawaschi—on the 15th and 16th, in which the Russians lost heavily, but the insurgent bands were dispersed. By the middle of October, the Samur District was in open rebellion, and it was said that, at one time, Tiflis itself was threatened by the insurgents, who now numbered some 18,000 men ; they w r ere however severely defeated by the Russian troops at Kulische, On the 28th, a Russian column was defeated by the insurgents at Zermalje. Tranquility was restored, according to Russian accounts, about the middle of November. SECOND SIEGE OF KARS. The details of the second siege of Kars in this campaign are as yet meagre in the extreme, and but little has hitherto been allowed to transpire by the Russian authorities. 2 E108 As has been previously mentioned, on the breaking up of the ordre de bataille ot the Russian force on the Aladja Dagh after Mukhtar Pasha s defeat on the 15th October, General Loris Melikoff with the 1st (Moscow) Grenadier Division, the 40th Division, two battalions of Sappers, some 40 squadrons and sotnias, and 15 or 16 batteries, together with the siege park and artillery from Alexandropol, was left to prosecute the siege of Kars, whilst General Heimann, with the remainder of the force, marched on Erzeroum. The head-quarters of the Russian army were moved to Yezin Keui immediately after the battle, and, by the end of the month, some 70 siege guns had been brought from Alexandropol, and were heavily bombarding the town and forts on the south and south-east. On the 25th October, the fortress was summoned to surrender, but refused. ,. On the 5th November, the Turk* mudeiTSortie on a small scale, according to Russian accounts, but were repulsed, and two battalions of the Kuban Regiment, following them up in pursuit, entered the Hafiz-Pasha labia, where 10 officers and 40 men were taken prisoners, and 8 guns spiked. ' On the 13th November, the Russian head-quarters were moved to Veran Kaleh—on the Akbaba Dagh, about 7 miles south of Kars. Early in the month, the besieging force was joined by a force m the strength of about a brigade, under General Komarotf, from Ardahan. force had advanced from the latter place on Erzeroum,t but had been recalled, for some reason as yet unknown, to reinforce General Melikoff, and the force under the latter now amounted to 39 battalions, some 40 squadrons and sotnias, with 150 field, and 70 siege guns. . v No preparation, it appears, was made for attempting a siege en regie. The Russian batteries were erected at their favourite long range, and did little more than annoy the besieged. The latter, it was well known at Russian head-quarters, were numerically, physically, and morally weak. The ganison necessary to hold the extensive works which surround the city has been computated, by good authority, at 30,000 men, whereas it scarcely amounted to 10,000, and these men who had been disheartened by hardship and defeat. Anyhow, it seems clear that, on the besieging force being reinforced from Ardahan, and the summons to surrender definitely rejected, it was decided by the Russian Staff to attempt to storm the fortress. The assault, which was at first fixed for the 13th, but, according to Russian accounts, was postponed on account of the weather, finally took place on the night of the 18th. . No details have as yet been published by the Russians, but the following is, briefly, what occurred. The attack commenced at 8.30 p.m. On the south, Forts Suwarri, Khanli, and Hafiz Pasha were carried by storm in the night by columns of the 40th Division (General Lazareff, right wins:), and the 1st Moscow Grenadiers and a regiment ot the 39th Division (General Count Grabbe, left wing) ; and, at the same time, the eastern foits Kara Dagh and Arab (Karapatlak)—were attacked and taken by forlorn hopes, the former being carried by the gorge, and the latter by a frontal attack. The capture of the southern works was followed, in course of time, by an attack on the suburb Ortakapi, which fell after some sharp street fighting. The western forts—Teckmas, Tih Tepeh, Laz, Ingliz, and Muckliz weie threatened apparently during the night by the Ardahan Brigade and the 2nd Moscow Grenadiers, under Generals Komaroff and Roop, respectively, but were only taken towards morning. It does not appear very clear whether these works were really defended by the Turks. At any rate, the fall ot the western works was subsequent to that of the defences on the south and east, and was probably due to it. ' The result was, however, a concentric attack from the south and west * According to Turkish accounts, a party of 18 men succeeded in entering the work and captured a horse only. Being unsupported, they were of course, unable to follow up their success, and had to retire. f There is still some doubt about this.109 morning t0Wn ° f ^ Citade1 ’ and their ultimate ca P tur e in the early £3 * A portion of the garrison tried to cut its way through to the mountains u was intercepted and captured, and few escaped except mounted men — among others, however, the Governor, Ferik Hussein Pasha 1 . the i ' r 63 ° f f t , i , e ? usslans '' ere heavy, but cannot be said to outweigh 500 iX^inch 0 th f p SUCCeS , S - n The y are i' an official bulletin as 500 killed, including 1 General (Count Grabbe) and 50 officers, and 1 833 not U known m h t n? 143 fX' The Turkish loSSe8 in kilIeJ a ' d funded are not known, but were probably as severe, and those that were not killed were taken prisoners.

W. A. H. HARE, Lieutenant, Royal Engineers. I * According- to Turkish accounts a heavy bombardment had been kept up from the Russian batteries established on the south side of the town for 22 days prior to the assault, the greater portion of their projectiles being directed on the town. On the night of the assault, a very heavy fire commenced about 2 hours before sunset, and was kept up for 3 hours. Fort Faizi (?) Pasha was the first attacked, and fell almost without resistance. Forts Khanli and Hafiz Pasha were next taken after a very slight resistance, several of the principal Officers of the garrison having quitted their posts. The Russians then advanced between Forts Hafiz Pash&amp; and Khanli, and, taking- possession of the south-eastern suburb of the town, pushed forward from it and attacked Fort Kara Dagh in rear. The garrison fled. Fort ■Karapatlak afterwards fell without a shot being fired to a forlorn hope of 18 men who were followed at some distance by a regiment. Altogether the'resistance offered was practically nil, with the honourable exception of Fort Chim, which, held by a battalion cf Redif and a battalion of Nizam under a Bimbashi, made a most‘gallant and determined resistance, holding out till daylight, and inflicting heavy loss on the Russians. A false attack was made on fort Techmas. The garrison is described as having been in a complete state of demoralization, and the officers to have been worse than the men. The Com mandin'; Officer was sick and unfif for duty. Owing to the want of firewood the garrison of Kars had been supplied with flour only for some time past, and dysentery of a violent type was raging, causing a mortality of 40 or 50 men per diem when the place was taken. The city was given up to plunder for 3 days, the Armenian quarter excepted. All except Armenians were plundered, including the sick and wounded. 2,000,000 piastres were found in the Government Treasury of which, however, one half was in caime. f This appears to be still a disputed point.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100044880739.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/20/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100044880739.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/20/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Russo-Turkish War, 1877.
