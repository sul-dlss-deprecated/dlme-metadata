The course lasts for two years, two terms of 11 months, the fee is Rs 30/- per month, Rs 330/- per annum, not including board and lodging. Both carpentry and mechanics are taught in the school, for the latter a knowledge of English and mathematics is essential* Should the two students wish to come to Bahrain I should be obliged if they would state beforehand which subject they wish to learn; the school building is being enlarged and we shall shortly have room for four more mechanics students and several carpenters, but there is considerable competition for entering the school. Students should be healthy, with good eyesight and between the ages of 15 - 20. 2« I enclose a letter from the State Engineer describing the work of the school. Boys who complete the courses are in the case of carpenters, sure of obtaining well paid employment, as an example of this-2- this three ex students have been taken on by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company at Rs. 3/- a day and in the case of mechanics I think it can be said that they are sure of obtaining employment with an oil company.

Memorandum:- xwvernment Technical School With reference to your memorandum No.I743/2-E of 1358 enclosing a copy of a letter from the Political Agent in connection with the Government Technical School. Bahrain Annual Report for 1357, which explains the general position, and the ground the school covers. The object of the school at present is to train Bahrain boys as mechanics, and artisan carpenters. Provided a student is normally intelli gent, he, at the completion of his training, will be qualified for employment as a carpenter or mechanic with an Oil Company or any other industrial concern. for iix months training, during which time he will receive Rs 2/- per day. At the end of six months, if satisfactory, he will be given permanent employment with the Company. Other students will go to the Bahrain Petroleum Company's workshops for similar training after the expiration of their term of eighteen months in the Government workshops. Several carpentry students, who have completed their two years course, have been given employment in various Govern ment Departments and are doing well. The school is under my direct supervision, and I I enclose an extract from the Government of At the end of the present month one boy is proceeding to the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company»t 2 tt AG3/25/58 28-10-1939 14- 9-1358 School Staff:- The staff consists of:- One working instructor mechanic Two working instructor carpenters These instructors were obtained from Syria. English is also taught by a local Arab teacher The school equipment consists of:- One shearing machine One sawing machine One drilling machine One wood lathe Two grind stones Two eme ry whe e1s A complete blacksmiths outfit Bench tools, etc.for six students One electric welding plant One pipe screwing machine One 6 M (Power) Lathe and the usual other small equipment of a mechanical workshop The school premises are at present being enlarged, after which four more engineering students can be taken. This scheme of technical education is still in its very early stages, and, as time goes on, it is hoped that a larger and more comprehensive syllabus of training will be adopted. Students who show good progress could, possibly, be sent to such institutions as the City &amp; Guilds College in London, where they could qualify for more highly paid executive posts, in this state or abroad. for one hour each day. School Equipment :- P.T.O.AGB/25/58 28-10-1939 14- 9-1358 This may sound somewhat ambitious, but I see no reason why, (although the process would be necessarily slow) such an aim should not be obtained. One important point, however, is that the standard preliminary education in the ordinary State schools should be improved, particularly in the later stages of the boy school life. They should leave school with a good working knowledge of English, and practical mathematics, and perhaps, even be given some elementary science etc# This would prepare them for their training as constructive members of the community. I should like to emphasize the necessity of learning English, as most of the students who qualify will find employment in the local Oil Company, or in one or another of the other Companies in the Persian G-ulf, where English would be a necessity. State Engineer, Qovernment of Bahrain Snlc— Extract from Government of Bahrain Annual Report of I 5 5 7. VII. Government Engineering and Carpentry School, The training of local boys in engineering and carpentry continued during 1357, and during the year, four boys completed their carpentry course, and were given work in Government Departments. The Huharaq section (one instructor and six students) has been amalgamated with the llanamah section, and an extension will be built in the school to accommodate them. A temporary matting annexe has been added to house the extra boys, until the new extension is built. The engineering section is now doing useful work in carrying out new and repair work for other Government Departments. During their two years course, the boys serve three months in the Government motor-repair shop, and same period in the Government Power House, whereby they gain useful general engineering knowledge. The If st six months of their course will be spent (if the boys develope satisfactorily) in the Engineering Workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company.

Two of the Kuwait students are boarding with one of the masters of the Manamah school. The others live in the Kullieh. I have visited them, without notice, more than once and have seen their rooms and also the food which is provided. They appear to be very comfortable. They have a common dormitory and a separate sitting room and have meals together in the dining room, not with the other younger boys. The food is excellent, I would not mind eating it myself. None of the boys has ever made any complaints to me when they have had opportunities to do so. They live in European style and are provided with furniture, indoor sanitation and shower baths. 2. Regarding the allegation that Vallance ill treats them; I will make investigations immediately. Is the complaint from all the boys or only those living in the school and is it a general complaint or regard ing some particular incident? 3. In this connection I received, about ten days ago, an anonymous letter stating that Saad bin Shamlan, a local agitator who was in jail, then deported and finally allowed to return, had been getting hold of some of these boys and persuading them to make trouble.

The former is in the Engineering Section and the latter in the Car pentry Section. The conduct of 'both boys has been excellent throughout their stay in Bahrain. They have been continuously under the care of one of the older masters at Manamah School, in v/hose house they board, at the Kuwait Oil Company^ expense. Both boys are intelligent and able students, and both are hard workers, who have fully satisfied their instructors. 1 Iqab Al-Khatib, the carpenter, is capable of starting work at once, if required, though one more year at the School would of course add to his experience and value as a carpenter. Khalid G-haraballi ought definitely to stay at the school for one more year, and indeed this is the wish of the Kuwait Oil Company. The Engineering course is in future to be one of three years, instead of two, as formerly. More time is required to make a boy efficient at Elementary Engineering than to make him into an efficient carpenter. We also now have very much better Engineering instructors than we had when Gharaballi began his course, and he would therefore benefit greatly by one more yea^s work at School.'

The position is that we are of course quite willing for the two boys to do another year at the Technical School, if the Company wishes it, but that the Carpentry student, T Iqab Al-Katib, is as a matter of fact quite ready to begin work at Kuwait. He has turned out a very good carpenter, and we have taught him French Polishing, as the Kuwait Oil Company asked. Another year would of course add to his general experience and useful ness. The boy himself is anxious to begin work at Kuwait at once. I have seen all the carpenters who were employed last October by the Kuwait Oil Company, and 'Iqab is streets ahead of them, and also uses modern tools.

Owing to the difficulty of obtaining tools and equipment we have dropped for the present, our scheme for starting an Artizan training scheme in Kuwait and if vacancies can be obtained we propose to grant 5 scholarships as early as S ossible in the New Year for the Bahrein Technical School echanical Engineering (fitting, machining &amp; metal work) Class and a further 5 scholarships conmencing at the beginning of the next school year, September, 1942. As on the previous occasion applicants will be medically examined and the pupils will be selected on the results of a competitive examination and interview, the scholarships will extend for the full course of two years . We shall be grateful if you would assist us to obtain the required vacancies and make enquiries for us on the following points:- (1) l/Thether the necessary vacancies can be allotted to us and the amount of tuition fee per head per year. Previously we have paid a fee of Es.330/- per annum. (2) Whether the Bahrain Educational authorities can arrange suitable board and lodging and supervision of our students out of school Hours, including games if these are arranged for other students.

We should for our students inc holiday. pay fares both ways between Kuwait and Bahrain luding their return to Kuwait for the yearly 9 id that a wage of Es.15/- per month is paid to by the Technical Sch9ol for pocket money. V/e understand the Bahraini students We have not hitherto paid this but we consider that we should do so in future so as to put our pupils on the same footing as the others. In the event of any of our students being unsatisfactory or in the opinion of the school authorities unlikely to become efficient artizans, we should welcome their recommendations.

Memorandum;- In continuation of my memorandum No. 13/2E dated January 20, 1942, we shall be glad to accept five Kuwait boys for the Technical School now and another five at the beginning of the next term. I suggest that the first five boys should come here as soon as possible as the term is already in full swing. At present the school fees for the Technical School are Rs. 30/- per month for each boy. The term lasts 9 months from about the end of September until the end of June. We now have a school hostel where boarders from Bahra-in and from outside Bahrain are accom modated. The hostel is in the charge of one of the masters and is closely supervised by the Director of Education. The boys live in the hostel and have their meals there. They take part in games with the other school boys on the school play grounds. They are not allowed out after a certain hour and are not allowed to visit people in the town without-2- without obtaining permission from the Director of Education. In every way they are looked after as carefully as possible. Free medical atten tion is given to them by the State Medical autho rities. The fee for living in the hostel is Rs. 40/- per month per head. In the past Bahrain boys working in the Tech nical School were allowed Rs. 15/- per month by the government; of this amount they received Rs. 10/- monthly and the remaining Rs. 5/- was given to them on leaving school in order that they should be able to buy some tools to enable them to carry on their work. This arrangement has now- ceased and the only allowance which is paid to the boys by the government is Rs. 5/- monthly which they spend as they like. I think Rs. 10/- a month would be adequate pocket money for the Kuwait boys who are probably rather older than the majority of the students in the Technical School. I should like to know all details about the boys including their ages and their parents* pro fession. The Technical School is now under the direction of Mr. Gr. E. Hutchings, formerly Principal of the Baghdad Technical School, who is now in India buy ing a quantity of material and machinery for use in the school. The education and facilities which are now provided in the new Technical School building which has recently been opened are greatly superior-3- superior to what we had in the past. As travelling 'by -steamer is uncertain in these days possibly the Kuwait authorities could send the boys down by launch letting us know by telerrram when to expect them. The first batch of boys who came to Bahrain from Kuwait have proved very satisfactory from our point of view and we shall be glad to wel come more boys of the same type.By Air Mail D. 0.

Dear Sir, The Kuwait Oil Company are supporting 5 students, of the Bahrain Government Technical School, who are living in the Hostel. In addition to their fees they are given Rs 10/- each per month as pocket money. I have received a request from them that I approach the Company asking eithertehat their pocket money be incresed or that they be given a clothing allowance. Last year the four students supported by the Kuwait Government were provided with a suit of clothes ( native style ) twice per year. These cost Rs 30/- per suit last year. The cost would be nearer Rs 45/- now. f This request is not unreasonable, I fel. They are finding the food ration on the lean side and spend some of their pocket money supplementing this. They are all of them in desperate need of new clothes. Will you therefore please approach the Oil Company asking them to consider this clothing allowance. I suggest that if they agree we be permitted to spend up to a certain sum, say Rs 45/-, on each boy twice a year, which will debited to the Oil Company in the usual way. Yours faithfully.

September Report dated the 24th Engineer, Kuwait Oil Company- Kuwait • Subject 1944, of the Resident on Mohammed Saleh Taqi oflo! KW ia IT oil company, limiied. Workshop report on capabilities of ex Bahrain student Mohammed Saleh Taqi, with suggestions of future method of edue at i on • No doubt this boy has benefitted from his schooling by learning to read and write English, but his standard of practical work is very low. He seems to prefer lathe work and has shown a little progress but does not show sufficient keenness in 'his work to suggest he will ever be very efficient. His powers of improvisation are also low and can only be developed by competition with other workmates in a commercial firm and not at school. Unfortunately his schooling appears to have given him a superiority complex which he cannot back up with superior craftsman ship. Writer would suggest in future when contemplating the employment of apprentices to any trade, they be first of all given ©fte-yea? work as helpers in our workshops, for a period of at least one year and then should any- latent talent make itself obvious a period of schooling should be given, alternatively night schooling, I consider to be a better means of education as it allows the student to keep in touch with his practical work. The student in question Mohammed Saleh Taqi has not been tested fully in regard to his technical capabilities but they appear to be as yet too elementary for our use. We will continue to employ this boy as a learner and hope that after more experience he will show up in a better light. Sd.D.Robinson, Resident Engineer, Kuwait Oil Company, Limited, Kuwait.
