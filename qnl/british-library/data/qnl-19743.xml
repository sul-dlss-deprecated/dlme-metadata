BU3HIRE. 3rd June 1002. 8 IK, Viith reference to your letter No, 57 of 8th May and previous correspondence on the subject, I ha TT e the honour to report that after leading Bushire and calling at Bunder Abbas I arrived at Fujaireh in H,M,3, * Redbreast ' on 21st April. (2) The village and Fort of Fujaireh are about a mile and a half from the coast. The name of the village at the coast is Gharfah, and at the time of our arrival the Jowasmee flag was flying at Gharfah \nd the Arab flag over Fujaireh Fort, The Shaikh of the Sharkiyeen - Hamad bin Abdulla - had returned from Muscat a few days before and on see ing the Redbreast approach had come down to Gharfah to meet me• I had a long conversation with him, informing him of what had passed between yourself and me on the subject 5 of his attitude, and of the agreement of 1881 signed by /) 6'i-b himself, which was on record in the Residency office. Shaikh Hamad replied that he remembered the document but /but would-' not ndmit that it applied to Fujaireh itself, which he said was excepted from the agreemen • I i. s -.s ed rhat the writing must be held '0 ap^ely 0 himself ... &lt; jj . illages controlled by him, (3) Questioned about the statemen whi h he hao. made to me in Muscat as to the part taker- by oeyyict Fej-Sj;! in mciintain- ing the garrison of Fujaireh Fort^ ohaifeh Hamad at first alleged that this had been the custom from the time that Seyyi; Mahomed bin Turki, brother of the oultan^ was Wali at Sohar, in his father's time, but I was unable to obtain any definite figures from him, and eventually elicited the fact that Seyyid Feisal T s pecuniary assistance consisted of nothing more than a present of cash and sundries on the occasion of Hamad's visits Muscat, The 20 men who garrison Fujaireh Fort are from his own tribe, the oharkiyeen, (4) Asked what specific causes of complaint he had against the chief of Shargah or his subjects, he stated that ; (a) Last year some Lingah visitors to Fujaireh were looted between Pujaireh and ohargah by Awamir and Beni Kattab ' tribesmen, subject to Shargah, He, Hamad, went himself to Shaikh cuggar to obtain redress, but was told he col obtain redress from them himself if he was so advised anu would get no assistance from Shargah, He then app- ; to Debai and Muscat, The former promised to remons- trate with ohe offenders himself. Shaikh cuggar heart incited this and thereuponASome of the Muzariyeh to molest A jL. Fujaireh people and they shortly afterwards killed a ^harki tribesman and stole his camel and rifle. He ^ wrote to Debai and Muscat, and both rejoined on him- 0 retaliate. Since then the Muzariyeh have killed oharki and looted 3 camels, but he, Hamad, has done nothing in the way of retaliation, (b) Shaikh iuggar has forcibly absorbed the Elayileh sectf' ofbT of the Sharkiyeen who used to pay zakat at Fujaireh, and he has made them di ert their goods to Ralbeh where he has a Wall, (5) The foregoing was ohailch Hamad^s story# In conclusion T assured him that you were giving attention to his case and would insist on ohaikh cuggar treating him with consideration and just c©, at he same time I impressed upon him that his :interes:.s lay in coming to a modus vivendi with ohargah and that he would only prejudice his own case, by raising his tribesmen and attempting any retaliation • He piomisea me that he would continue to be patient and woul'I take no hostile measures, but he seemed ~ery loth to recognize .he position that he was tributary to Shargah.

November 1902 S ir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.127 dated 20th October 1902 relative to the recent action of the Shahiyeen of Baiya, 2. While I was away in H.M,S,'Amphitrite' during the hot weather, some of the Shahiyeen or Shihooh came to Muscat and I believe were the bearers of a lei tor from the Shaikh of Debai to the Siiltan / their object being perhaps to got some recognition or support from him. His Highness assured me in this connection iha^ he had not given them the slightest encouragement and had so: t , _ vhem empty away. Again, a few weeks ago, as I gathered from a private letter from you from Shiraz thai the Fujeirah Shaikh was still giving you trouble, I mentioned the fact in co 1 versa.io with the Sultan and he remarked u ihe man must be a fool to persist in his attitude, after being distinctly give to understand that it would not hold water' or wordo ,o -hat effect.2^ On receiving your letter under rcpl/ a.gain com- municated with him on the subjec:. He .he begred that it would not be thought tha* he had had any leali gs with them and assured me that since the posi,. 10 had bee- explained ; to him last year he had held altogether aloof from the quarrel. ' ^ He has now forwarded to me two lexers, o^c addressed v o Shaikhs Suleiman bin Mahomed a'd S'n.lcirn.a bj.

COast. 2 It appears that for long the Sheikh of Eujeira has been endeavouring \ to free himself from the authority of the Jowasmi Chiefs, and that, on various ( occasions, he has invoked the assistance of the Sultan of Ma skat with, a view to effecting this object. In your letter, dated the 20th July 1902, you suggested that, in the event of the Chief of Shargah being unreasonable m the treatment of his feudatory, and being unable to give him adequate protection, it mig i become necessary to consider whether Jowasmi authority shou c no cease o exist on this coast, and whether the strip should not be handed over to the Sultan of Maskat. In vour later letter, written after fuller enquiry, you state as your opinion that no extension of Maskat influence over this trac siou he countenanced, and you express the hope that hereafter, when e ica man of Eujeira sees that he has no hope of obtaining assistance from is quai er, it may he possible to effect a satisfactory settlement of the ong s aiuin 0 disputes between this Sheikh and the Chief of Shargah, whose dineicnces }ou have hitherto been unable to reconcile. 3.
