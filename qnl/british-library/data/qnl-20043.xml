Indeed there is an important incident / which will always induce me to be of good service lo the members of that family. Nearly seventy years ago.when my mother^ mere child^was returning from school at A Bombay in a sailing ship touched at Muscat and while landing there | the boat which was carrying her to the shore capsized through rough weather and she was saved by Seyed Said himself alone swimming out to her rescue. In any case I hope you will not be displeased at my having written to the Sultan. The Farman Farma will arrive here tomorrow. The iVIalek-ut-Toiar and his two sons have gone to Mohamerah.

You have dealt No. 60, dated the 'fth November 1898. ' ji i j .* 'u* u i „ 61 }&gt; 7 th M „ with the several questions which have „ 72 „ 4th December „ lately arisen in the letters noted on the 82 ' 26th ' margin, and Major Eagan has reported ' qn 5 ' Ist Januar y 1899 - further in his letter No. 22, dated the 21st January, 1899, upon his interview with the Sultan in the matter of the lease of a coaling station at Bunder Jisseh.

The result of any further investigation into the matter of this lease should be reported, but the Government of India have learnt, from Major Eagan's report, that the concession has been given to the Erench Government and not to a Company or to one or more individuals. 3. The advice tendered in paragraph 10 of the Memorandum is the outcome of correspondence, which has passed between the Government of India and Her Majesty's Government regarding the use of Erench flags by Suri dhows. M ajor Eagan's proceedings in the case of Salim-bin-Saad are approved. The future course of action in such cases will depend on the Sultan's acceptance of the advice now given to prescribe to his subjects the exclusive use of a distinctive Maskat • Secret aespatch from Her Majesty's Secretary fla g- Tlle advantages Of SUeh a measure of State for India, No. 48, dated the 30th December, are Set Out in the enclosed COrrespOnd- 1898, with enclosure. ence,* copies of which I am to forward for the personal information of yourself and the Political Agent. In addressing the Sultan it will be sufficient to explain to His Highness that the usefulness of the proposal does not depend on his being able to enforce it. If after the issue of the order any Maskat subject accepts, or continues to fly, the Erench flag, the Erench authorities will, by granting the flag or supporting its use as the case may be, abet such subject in disobeying the positive orders of his own sovereign, and will thereby infringe the Declaration of 1862 which secures the t Enclosure to the Political Agent's letter to your independence of Maskat. His Highness address, No. 167, dated the 2nd June, 1897. might suitably be reminded of his letLerf[ 2 ] of the 28tli May, 1897, asking for advice, and of his resentment, disclosed in • Copies received with your letter No. 4 a., dated his correspondence* with the French the 22nd June, 1898. Vice-Consul, at the contention on which the French authorities consistently act, that the owner or master of a dhow under the French flag becomes a French-protected person even in Maskat territory. It should he represented to His Highness that the right way to prevent his subjects from passing in ever increased numbers under French protection is to order them not to take the French flag. 4. Your letter No. 72, dated the 4th December, 1898, forwarded, for information, a letter from the Political Agent at Maskat to Her Majesty's Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding certain Rules and Regulations which he had made under the Maskat Order in Council, dated the 4th November, 1867, in order to impose restrictions under which Her Majesty's subjects may enter into contracts for the farming of the customs within the Sultan's dominions. The?' rules are of doubtful expediency, and the Governor-General in Council is oi opinion that Major Fagan should not in his consular capacity deal, as these rules do, with matters of policy without previous reference either to the Home or Indian Government. The Government of India do not agree with the assump tion on which they are based, viz., that the customs farmer is in no sense a servant of the Sultan. The Government of India would prefer to deal directly with the Sultan in case of any contravention of their treaty rights arising out of the administration of His Highness's customs, and would admit no other responsibility. In their opinion Eule IV might conflict with the independence of the Sultan which is secured by the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, and is ultra vires, and Rule II, as drafted, would, instead of being directed against taxes which are contrary to the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of 1891, restrict the collection of any tax which is not expressly permitted by those Articles. This cannot be said to be 'for the observance of the stipulation of such Treaty ' in accordance with the terms of the first Article of the Maskat Order in Council. Moreover, even if it were found possible, notwithstanding the risk of henami transactions, to render the rules operative in practice, there would always be the risk of the contract falling into the hands of foreigners, and the end for which the rules had been framed would thus be frustrated. The Regulations being open to these objections, you should report, as already directed, whether they have been in any case enforced, and, if not, you should advise Major Fagan to refrain from taking action under them pending further orders. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Foreign Office Press—No. 101—-311-99—15.1 n a i ( } /i \ ) ■ . S.. Memorandum to he translated into Arabic, read to and a copy left with the Sultan of Maskat. 1. I am directed first to remind Your Highness of the long continued friendship and support which have heen accorded by the British Government to the rulers of Oman. 2. I have next to remind you that these favours have also been extended to you personally, both upon your accession to the throne, and on many subse quent occasions. Upon the death of Sayed Turki in 1888, the British Govern ment, notwithstanding the rival claims of Sayed Abdul Aziz, continued to you, Sayed Eaisal, the subsidy of 40,000 crowns a year which had been paid to your predecessors, in order to enable you to carry on the government and to maintain order; and by these means Your Highness was enabled to consolidate your position on the throne. This subsidy had been guaranteed in 1873 to Sultan Sayed Turki during his rule ' so long as he continues faithful to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Govern ment.' No similar guarantee of the continuance of the subsidy has ever been given to you, Sayed Faisal; but, nevertheless, the payment has been annually continued to you by the British Government from 18S8 to the present day. In 1890 the British Government formally recognized you, Sayed Eaisal, as Sultan of Maskat. Upon that occasion the Sultan ' intimated his intention to maintain to the full the same relations as existed with the British Government in the time of his father ; and to act up to all the engagements undertaken by his father and predecessors in the Government of Maskat.' He also said—' It is my earnest desire to be guided in all important matters of policy by the advice of the British Government, and to so conduct the Government as to secure the continued friendship and approbation of the Viceroy and the British Govern ment.' This was a formal assurance, which pledged the conduct of the Sultan, and which the British Government has never ceased to bear in mind. Sayed Abdul Aziz, the rival candidate, subsequently retired to India, and has been deterred by the British Government from leaving India since. 3. These were the great services that were rendered to Your Highness by the British Government upon and after your accession to the throne of Oman. They were continued in subsequent years. In 1894-95 there was rebellion against Your Highness's authority in Maskat. In 1895 the British Government warned Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Saleh to cease from attacking the Sultan. They also authorised Your Highness in November 1895 to issue a notification warning the leading Sheikhs of Oman that, whatever differences they might have in the future with the Sultan, Government would not allow them to attack the towns of Maskat and Muttra. Eurthermore, the British Government gave Your Highness their countenance and support when the people of Dhofar rebelled against you, and they enabled you to put an end to that uprising; and they have upon many other occasions used their good offices to uphold your authority. 4. They have on two occasions granted Your Highness loans of money to assist you in carrying on the Government, and in discharging debts which had been incurred by you personally. The first loan was one of Rs. 60,000 in December 1895 ; and the second loan was of the same amount, and was given as recently as August 1897. 5 They have offered Your Highness the further assistance of the loan of the services of a British officer to administer with more efficiency the customs of Oman. This offer Your Highness declined.6. They have consented to the adoption of most lenient terms for the recovery of compensation for losses incurred by British subjects in Maskat and Muttra during the insurrection of 1895. Your Highness has been allowed to continue payments at a rate which will not extinguish the moderate claims made on this account against you within six years from their being incurred, although the original demand was for their payment in three years. And although Your Highness was willing to pay interest upon the deferred com pensation, the British Government have not hitherto demanded interest. 7. These are the evidences of the friendly and benevolent spirit which has been consistently displayed towards Your Highness by the British Govern ment. Your Highness owes in the main to them your present position, the means that you enjoy, and your continued occupation of the throne. 8. Notwithstanding these facts and notwithstanding the assurances which have been given by Your Highness, you have ceased to maintain your friendship towards the British Government, and have conducted yourself in a manner which cannot be permitted to continue. Your Highness admits that you have given a lease of Bunder Jisseh to the French, in direct violation of the undertaking which you gave in 1891, to the effect that you would not alienate your dominions or give them for occupation save to the British Government. Your Highness employs as a confidential adviser Abdul Aziz, who is the Munshi of the Vice-Consul of Erance, and whose advice is inimical to the existence of peaceful relations with the British Government, and to the welfare of the State. Your Highness permits the French to violate your independence by taking under their protection your own subjects in your own dominions. Beyond a remonstrance against this action. Your Highness has taken no steps to assert your own independ ence in the matter. Eurthermore, Your Highness has, in violation of your commercial treaty with the British Government, levied, from British subjects, taxes on commodities from which taxes are not levied from Maskat subjects, and has levied export duties and import duties at rates which are higher than those stipulated in the commercial treaty of 1891 with the British Government. 9. I am therefore instructed to make the following demands upon Your Highness:— (1) I am to demand the dismissal of Abdul Aziz from all or any employ ment either now or at any future period by Your Highness or by any one under your authority; (2) I am to demand the payment of interest at 6 per cent from the present date on the sums still remaining to be paid for distribu tion to British subjects as indemnity for losses incurred in the insurrection of 1895; (3) I am to demand the cessation of the levy from British subjects in any part of Your Highness's dominions of any tax on merchan dise which is not levied from Your Highness's subjects; (4) I am to demand the reduction of all import duties to the rate of 6 per cent ad valorem, and the reduction to 5 per cent of the tax pn dates brought from the interior for exportation. &gt; 10- I am instructed also to tell Your Highness that, to prevent the infringement of your rights, you should order all your subjects to use a distinc tive flag, and should explain that, after the issue of such an order, the grant by the officer of a foreign Power of a foreign flag and the assertion by such officer of the right to^ protect in the dominions of Your Highness any of Your High- ness's own subjects is an instigation of such subject to disobey the lawful order of his own sovereign, and, if such instigation is made by a Erench official, it is an infringement of the declaration which was entered into in the year 1862 by the Governments of England and Erance to respect the Sultan's independence. 211. Finally, I am to tell Your Highness that, until these demands have been complied with, no portion of your subsidy, which has been withheld since the month of December, shall be paid to Your Highness; and that, in the event of a continuance or repetition of an unfriendly attitude on your part, the support in money and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you and your predecessors have enjoyed, will be withdrawn from you, and may possibly take another direction. It is impossible for the British Govern ment to continue their support to a ruler who habitually violates the solemn obligations into which he has entered with them.Telegram, No. 152 E.-A., dated the 31st January 1899.

Eoreign Office, 20th December 189S. Sir, I laid before the Marquess of Salisbury your letter of the 23rd May last on the subject of the grant of the Prench flag to dhows owned by the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India in Council that Lord Salisbury thereupon directed that the Law Officers of the Crown should be consulted on the legal aspect of the question. A copy of the reference to the Law Officers, and of their Heport, is enclosed for the confidential information of Lord George Hamilton. The Law Officers advise that the right to use the flag of a country is one that has been left to be regulated by the laws of that country, but that this principle has rested on the assumption that the right will not be abused, and that the permission to use the national flag will be granted only to vessels which can fairly be considered as national. They further advise that the case of the grant of the Erench flag to Suri-owned dhows is an abuse, and that such vessels might, even on the high seas, be treated as not entitled to the protection of that flag. Your letter of the 23rd May expressed agreement with the opinion of the Government of India, founded on that of the Eesident at Muscat, to the effect that nothing would be gained by urging the Sultan to prescribe to his subjects the exclusive use of a distinctive Muscat flag ; that His Highness would be unable to enforce the use of such a flag on his Suri subjects ; that he would not dare to interfere with those who had already accepted the flag ; and, finally, that the influence of the jFrench Yice-Consul at Muscat had grown considerably of late years. Lord George Hamilton suggested, therefore, that it would be better, in the first place, to ask the French Government to desist from granting the French flag to Muscat-owned vessels. But, subject to any observations which Lord George Hamilton may have to make, it appears to Lord Salisbury that there may be difficulties in following this line of procedure. Her Majesty's Government have no positive authority or unimpeachable locus standi entitling them to represent the matter to the French Government, seeing that Muscat is not a British Protectorate, and that they have received'no request from the Sultan to do so. It would lie possible to found the representation on the ground that the Sultan had by treaty given to this country power to search and detain Muscat vessels in connection with the suppression of the slave trade, and that Her Majesty's Government could not allow the assumption of the French flag by such vessels to interfere with the exercise of a right thus formally delegated to them. The correspondence between the French Vice-Consul and the Sultan, copies of w^hich are enclosed in your letter now under reply, shows that the answer to such a representation would be that the Sultan and his predecessors had allowed the assumption of the flag for years; that this constant practice had created a right which was no longer open to question; that the flag- was, in fact, granted and accepted with the permission of the Sultan— an independent sovereign; and that Her Majesty's Government must address their representation to His Highness. This position would point the way for the French Vice-Consul to represent to the Sultan that the abandonment of the French flag would put the vessels of the Suris at the mercy of every British cruiser; that their trade would be practically ruined; and that his Suri subjects would no doubt rebel S. 56. Bsooner than submit. It appears not unlikely that the Sultan would fall in with this view, and openly announce that the French flag was granted with his permission. The proposal that the Sultan should prescribe to his subjects the exclusive use of a distinctive Muscat flag was made with the object of avoiding this position. The usefulness of the proposal does not depend on the Sultan being able to enforce it. On the contrary, if, after the issue of such orders, any Muscat subject accepted the Erench flag, the French authorities would by its grant have abetted such subject in disobeying the positive orders of his Sovereign, and Her Majesty s Government would be in a strong position for announcing that they would be unable to recognise the validity of the grant. But in order to produce this position, it is necessary that the Sultan should issue the proposed order before any communication is addressed to the Erench Government, on account of the possibility of the French Vice-Consul being able in any other case, to induce His Highness to declare that the flag is granted with his permission. At the present time, Her Majesty's Resident at Muscat appears to have a powerful means to persuade the Sultan to issue the suggested order. His Highness' correspondence with the French Vice-Oonsul shows that he very strongly resents the French contention, on which the French authorities consistently act, that the owner or master of a dhow under the French flag becomes a French-protected person, even in Muscat territory. It could be represented to the Sultan that the right way to prevent his subjects from passing in ever increased numbers under French protection is to order them not to take the French flag.^ There is yet another matter which must be considered before makiug to the French Government any announcement to the effect that Her Majesty's Government may be forced not to recognise the validity of the grant of the French flag to Muscat vessels. The French Govern ment may appeal to Articles XXX. to XXXV. of the Brussels Act, which lay down the conditions under which the flag of one of the Signatory Powers maybe granted to a 4 «native vessel' as defined by the Act. As long as the Sultan has not prescribed the use of a distinctive Muscat flag such an appeal would have great force, as showing that the Act does indeed foresee the grant of the flag of a Signatory Power to non-national vessels. But these provisions of the Act are clearly limitative, not facultative, and cannot be interpreted as authorising a Signatory Power to grant its flag in derogation of the laws of the State of which the shipowner is a subject.

The point to which the papers in question are chiefly directed is the immunity from search conferred by the system upon vessels engaged incom the transport of slaves for sale, but they also refer to the more general question of the claim of any one State to extend its protection to the subjects of another, without the assent of such other State, and the * t r rwK oq i T\yr i ono letter from the India Office of the # India Office, 23rd May 1898. &lt;no i ti/ t i -i /-r&gt;&gt; a i J 23rd May, marked (B;,* shows the effect of the pretention in the case of vessels of the Muscat State in the Persian Gulf and waters of the Indian Ocean, adjacent to India. The status of Muscat towards Great Britain is somewhat peculiar, for on the one hand its geographical and historical position bring it com pletely within the sphere of British interests, and on the other hand its independence has been guaranteed by Great Britain and Prance by the . „ . + , , Declaration of the 10th Marchi862, t Printed eop.es enclosed. enclosed herein and marked (C).t Prance, moreover, by her Treaty with Muscat, signed at Zanzibar on the 17th November 1844 (Paper D),t enjoys certain rights in Muscat, amongst which are those of extra territorial jurisdiction within that Sultanate {see Article VI.) and the immunity of Prench domiciles from entry or visit, except with the consent of the occupier, unless with the intervention of the Prench Consul {see Article III.). The Prench Government contend that this exemption applies to all vessels flying the Prench flag in the territorial waters of Muscat. They have also persistently refused to allow such vessels to be searched for slaves or other purposes when in the territorial waters of Muscat, not only by foreign men-of-war, but even by the authorities of the territorial Sovereign. Correspondence on this subject is sent herewith (Paper E.)I as t sent in MS. elucidating the general position + claimed by Prance m such matters, although it does not directly bear upon the point on which Lord Salis bury is desirous of obtaining your opinion. That point is whether there is any justification under the general law of nations or through the special Agreements of Prance with this country and Muscat for the claim of Prance to confer the right of flying her flag, with its attendant immunities, upon subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who have qualified under Prench law for Prench protection, and to protect such persons in the territorial waters of Muscat or on the high seas against interference by the Sultan of Muscat or by British men-of-war. , _ 0 /• •i j o it iqoo The Memorandum marked (P.) § S Mr. Streatfeild. 2nd June 1898. . . c ^ contains references which may assist you in forming an opinion on the subject dealt with in this letter.

We were honoured with your Lordship's commands signified in Mr. Bertie's letter of the 12th ultimo, stating that he was directed by your Lordship to transmit to us the accompanying papers relative to the question of the protection afforded by Prance to dhow owners who are natives of Muscat, and who apply, under certain conditions, for the right to fly the Prench flag at sea. We have taken the papers into our consideration, and, in obedience to your Lordship's commands, have the honour to report— That the right to use the flag of a country is one that has been left to be regulated by the laws of that country. But this has rested on theassumption that this right will not be abused, and that permission to use the national flag will be granted only to vessels which can fairly be considered as national. Prom the papers before us it would appear that a practice has prevailed of granting the use of the Prench flag to vessels which cannot be considered as, in any sense, Erench vessels. The Arab slave-traders, to whom these permits are granted, do not become Prench subjects, and the allegation that they become French protected persons is, it would appear, merely colourable. It is possible that they acquire this character by French law, but in order to validate the claim to fly the French flag from the point of view of international law, they should be so in reality. Th subject is one on which there is an almost entire absence of authority, but the claim of the French Government seems to us to be unsustainable on principle. We cannot suppose that the French Government will fail to put a stop to so flagrant an abuse. If it fails to do so, and if it, considered expedient to resort to so extreme a step, the vessels may be treated, even on the high seas, as not entitled to the protection of the French flag. The XXXIInd Article of the Treaty of Brussels may be referred to in any remonstrance that may be addressed to the French Government. In territorial waters, the vessels may clearly be searched and proceeded against for slave trading, even if they are entitled to fly the French flag. Every Government has the right to police its own territorial waters. We cannot read the French Treaty with Muscat as in any way interfering with this right. We have, &amp;c., (Signed) E ichabd E.
