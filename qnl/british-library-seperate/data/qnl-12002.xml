The correspondence concerns a disagreement that arose between the Agency and the Sultan as to whether or not he was obligated to fire a formal salute when British Political Officers left Muscat by boat. The issue was taken to the Government of India and it decreed that the Sultan was bound to do so. The letters sent to the Political Agency by Faysal are in Arabic (accompanied by English translations).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military ceremonies, honours, and salutes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000a9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000a9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
