The correspondence relates to the set-up of reciprocal air routes between British and Syrian authorities; specifically, permission requested by Syrian Airways representatives to fly from Damascus via Baghdad and Kuwait to Bahrain, and a reciprocation of routes through Syria for the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and Cyprus Airways. Telegrams, sent between the Political Resident and the Bahrain Political Agent refer to a need to obtain the Ruler of Bahrain’s (Sheikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah) permission. A telegram from the Foreign Office dated 13 June 1948 (ff 5-6), provides details of the routes into and through Syria desired by BOAC.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Syrian Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Damascus</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cyprus Airways</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Syria</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000346#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
