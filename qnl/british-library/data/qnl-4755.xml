Dated, Dil Q,aad 13. 1354 February 6, 19o6. K. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - With reference to your memorandum No. C/610-8/8 dated 16th December 1936 in con nection with information for compiling the Annual Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency, 1 am giving below the required particulars. 1. Police. Strength on 1-1-35. 31-13-35 Indian police 4 Arab police Followers 146 8 158 3 168 11 182 Naturs, Manaman Maharaq 67 42 109 66 42 108 The police have carried out their usual duties during the year. Although the force now numbers 182 it is rarely possible to muster more than thirty men, on parade, the remainder being occupied on guards, posi-s and various duties.- 2 - The police and a detachment from the Navy carried out a ceremonial parade on Jubilee day and the police competed several times with teams from the Navy in shooting competitions and at football and hockey, OX times with considerable success. One N. C. 0., the son of the late llaji Sulman was sent to Karachi to study police routine under the Karachi Police. Instruc tion was given for some months to N.C.Os in reading and writing to enable tnem to check car numbers etc. Unfortunately only a few men in the force are literate. A number of prosecutions were made by the Police in cases of offences against liquor and drug regulations. Opium valued at several thousands of rupees was captured by the Police during several raids. Few serious crimes occurred during the year and only one case of murder was dealt with. The dacoits who carried out the raid on Zinj were traced, arrested ana tried. T^e investigations which led to their arrest u were made by Havilaar Idahmood whose work is now mainly criminal investigation. naviIdar Ali Mirza, the senior N.C.O. is responsible for routine etc. There has been no change in the organi sation of the naturs except that they now wear a simple uniform on official occasions which consists of a long white tLobe, white gutra and black agals. A new police post waswas built At Budeya and a section of naturs are stationed there for a month at a time. Thou^i there have been few serious crimes during the year there has been an increase of petty thieving and in many cases the culprits are men and youths who appear in the courts time after time on similar charges. Neither prison or corporal punish ment acts as a deterrent to these individuals. The State has had to incur a comparatively large expense in ^repatriating undesirable foreigners who after serving terns of impri sonment have been sent to their countries of origin and have then returned to Bahrain. A number of prosecutions have been made against persons who entered Banrain without passports. Owing to the excessive poverty on the mainland especially in Qattar, indigents and other undesirable foreigners frequently attempt and succeed in evading the passport authorities by landing in Bahrain. 2. Diving Indust ly . I am unable to give a report on the Diving Industry as 1 have not yet had an opportunity of examining the diving clerks T accounts. The season is said to have been sliyuily better than the previous season but this opinion is that of the nakhudas who owing to the cheaper cost of living were able to equip their boats at less cost than last year. All pearls found during the season were sold byby the nakhudas and most Bahrain mercliants disposed of their goods although no European buyers came to Bahrain. There was a great, decrease in the numcer of boats which went to the banks. 1934 season 436 boats. 1935 n — 340 ”. 3. Public Viorks. Tor over six months the Bahrain government was occupied in con structing the buildings of the naval base at Jufair. The work consisted of a pier 1800 ft. long, three large two storied buildings and several smaller one storied buildings. The work has been done at cost price and the buildings have been constructed at remarkably low cost, as an example of cost^the price of the pier at Jufair and the pier built by contract three years ago for the Royal Air Force may be compared. The R.A.F. pier is 1500 ft. long and 6ft wide and the Jufair pier 1800 ft. long and 10 ft. wide. The depth and height of the piers are approximately the same. The R.A.F. pier cost 19,000/- and the Jufair pier cost Rs 12,500/-. Lr. Mohomed Khalil, the Superintendent of the Land Dept., is responsible for carrying out the building woirk at Jufair. Some work was carried out on the Manamah- Maharaq road during the year. Progress was made on the northern wall and also in filling and surfacing.3. Agriculture. Nothing to report. 4. Justice. Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad was appointed as Magistrate on the Bahrain Court, his place on the ShelII Joint Court was filled by Shaikh Khaliloh bin Mohomed. These appoint ments were generally popular. The initial pre paration for the compilation of a code was com pleted during the year and a committee is to be appointed to examine the drafts and to submit a draft code to the Ruler. 5. Education. There is little to report on this subject. The routine of the schools continued during the school year as during the previous year. Two young Syrian teachers were enlisted in place of two whose agreements were not renewed. Ona of the new masters is specially qualified as a games master. All the boys who passed out of school and obtained leaving certificates during the year found employrasnt in government service or with the oil company. The supply of boys was insuf ficient for the posts which required filling. The students at the girls 1 schools have become very proficient at sewing and embroidery and at the end of the term they had an exhibition of their work which would find a ready sale, but the girls refuse to sell it. No. of schools in existence on 1-1-35 Schools opened during the year Schools closed during the year Students on the rolls on 1-1-35 Students on the rolls on 31-12-35 Teachers on 1-1-35 Teachers on 31-12-35 963 1184 30 35.- 6 - (®) n 6. Electricity. The electric department has continued to progress. I am enclosing herewith a report from the State Engineer about the working of the department. 7. Municipalities. No outstand ing work of any importance was done during UjT' year except the usual work of cleaning the towns. A new road was constructed at Hedd at government expense. Both the municipalities discussed the question of malaria and efforts were made to obtain supplies of crude oil to pour on stagnant water in both the towns. Adviser to the Governmait.

His Excellency ShaUih Hamad bin f Isa Al Klialif&amp;h, Ruler of Bahrain, was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire in the New Year's Honours List* T e news caused deep satisfaction in Bahrain. His Excellency has been on the best of terms with the Agency throughout the year. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah celebrat-d the second anniversary of his accession to tne Rulership of Banrain by declaring the Idth, 20th and 21st January public holidays. Shaikh Muhammad bin f Isa Al Khalifah paid a visit to Syria, Palestine and Egypt during the summer and Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa Al Khaiifah went to the mainland in November and December on two lengthy hawking expeditions* Shaikh Muhamuud has been President of the Manamah Municipality throughout the year. Shaikh 'Abdullah has been President of the Muh&amp;rraq Municipality and has also held charge of the Department of Education of the Ba rain Government. During the absence of Shaikh Muhammad bin 'Isa in Syria, Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa also acted as president of the Ifenameh Municipality in addition to his otner work. Both Shaikhs have done good vork in their respective si eres and Shaikh 'Abdullah has proved himself useful on a number of occasions. Shaikh/5 . /*■* Shfeikh S&amp;lman bin Hamad Ai Khalifah, the Ruler's eldest son, has also been on good terms with the Agency. He has been on leave throughout the year and his work on the Bahrain Court has been done by Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Hamad Al Khalifah. Shaikh Rashid bin Muhemmad Aa Khalifah has retained the post of President of the Majlis al Urfi through out the year* When Shtikh 'Abdualah bin Hamad was appointed to the Bahrain Court, his place on the Junior Joint Court was filled by Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad* Both appointments were popular* 3. ^OCA, G:\li.*Zz .t official Mr. C.C.Ii. de Greni r, Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, proceeded on leave to England on the 16th May* During nis absence his work was carried on by the Financial Acviser to the Baarain Government* Mr* de Grenier returned from leave on the 22nd November* Mi*. C. Dairympie Beigrave, Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government, proceeded on short leave to 'Iraq on the 22nd September. He returned to headquarters on the 30th September. Mr. W*B. Steele has been State Engineer to the Bahrain Government throughout the year. 4. BAHRAIN ARMED PO-^lC i* there has been no change in the distribution of toe Arm. d Police and posts u&amp;ve been maintained throughout the year at Ifcoharraq and Hidd. In addition the Police have supplied various guards in Manamah and at the Civil Landing Ground at Muharr&amp;q. Ine Armcci Police numbered 182 men and followers on tne 31st December. There are three Indian Instructors on the strength of the Armed Police. A Police Post was built at Budaiya* during the year/4 year, but as no regular police were available It was placed in charge of a section of n&amp;turs, who are stationed there for a month at a time. The Armed Police tooic part in a number of ceremonial occasions during the year, the most notable being the parade, which was held on the 6th May in honour of His late Most Gracious Majesty^ Silver Jubilee. Detachments from H.M.S. Bideford and H.M.S. Fowey also took part in the parade, at hich tne salute was taken by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ^sa A1 Khalif&amp;h. In addition to and independent of the Armed Police there is a body of n&amp;turs or armed night watchmen. There has been no change in their organiza tion except that tney now wear a sia^le white uniform on official occasions. The naturs numbered 108 at the end of the year. The astonishing improvement which h&amp;s taken place of late years in law and order in Bahrain may be judged by the fact that the Political Agent was able recently to fix tne time of night of a misdeed by a number of persons having noticed the noise of a rifle being discharged! 5. i-iQCiu, AFFAIRS* (i) In April 1»35 the British Naval Stations at Henjam and Basidu were transferred to Bahrain. (ii) In March 1355 reprt sentatives of the S&amp;’udi Arabian Government, headed by the Deputy Minister of Finance, arrived at Bahrain to discuss arrangements for tne transhipment at B&amp;nrain of goods destined for Sa^di Arabia and the rate of transit dues to be levied by the Bahrain Government. They were put into touch with representatives of the B&amp;nrain Government by the Political/Political Agent and conversations continued till the 7th April. An agreement satisfactory to both Govern ments v;as reached and utas formally ratified by an exchange of letters between His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Bahrain Government and tne Sdudi Arabian Government on tne 16th November 1335. (iil) A lamentable incident occurred in Bahrain on the 14th April resulting in the death of 83 persons mostly Y&lt;omen anc children. A crowd of some 2000 persons gathered outside tne house of an Iranian merchant having heard that he was to distribute alms to the poor. They thronged into the narrow passage way leading into the inner courtyard of his house and to control the numbers entering, the outer door which opens inwards was closed end locked. A panic ensued and in trying to force their way out a number of people were crushed and trampled upon before the door could be opened. Hi* Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa A1 j Khalifah opened a Relief Fund for the relatives of the victims. (IV) Few serious crimes occurred during the year and only one case of murder was tried. A number of prosecutions v»ere made by the Police for offences against the liquor and drug regulations. Opium valued at several thousands of rupees was captured S 'v * during several raids. 6 . ThE nAhU-lh PElKOoEUM COMP nhl (i) Mr. J.M. Russell, Chief Eoc&amp;l Representa tive, proceeded on leave on the 1st April and was relieved by Mr* G.W.R. Smith. (ii) Mr. F#A. Davies acted as Fields Manager till the 12th October when he handed over cnarge to Mr. E.A. Skinner, with the designation of Resident Manager. (in)6 . (iii) Towards the end of the year the Company decided to erect a refinery in Bahrain and large con signments of material were received and extra staff engaged for the construction work- The Company hopes to have the refinery completed by the middle of 1936* (iv) 176^88,374 tons of crude oil were shipped from Bahrain during the year in fifteen tank- ships of various nationalities (5 American, 6 Norwegian, 1 Banish and 3 British) and the total royalty due to the State amounted to Rs. 6,18,192-10-5. The net anDunt received by the State after deducting the last instalment of a loan given by the Company in 1934 was Rs. 5,68,192-10-5. (v) On the 31st December the Company* s employees by nationalities numbered J- Amcr leans 49. European British subjects 26. Indian British subjects 61. Bahrainis 1,283. Others (Iranians, •Iraqis, Kuwaitis, etc.) 244. In addition to the above 29 watchmen were provided by the Bahrain Government. 7# ARTIpXAN ,• . Efforts are being made to prevent artesian water being allowed to escape uncontrolled, but the overflow from the wells still adds to the difficulties of dealing with mao-aria. 8 . AGRICULTURE. (i) An experiment was made by the Bahrain firm of Messrs A. and M. Yatim, with the assistance of an/X an Indian agriculturist, to cultivate tobacco. Towards the end of the year Shaikh Abdullah bin ^sa A1 Khalifah also decided with the help of the saae agri culturist to cultivate tobacco and fuel woods on a large scale on his estate south of Bucaiya 1 , and imported a tractor for ploughing and levelling and drilled several artesian wells. Unfortunately in both cases the agri culturist proven unsatisfactory and it is too early to say how the experiments will turn out. (ii) The Banrain Petroleum Company Limited engaged a landscape gardener* to lay down parks, avenues and gardens at the site of their new camp. The type of soil ana nature of the water present great difficulties. 9. CUSTOMS . (jj The customs revenues amounted to Rs. 6,51,779 as compared with Rs. 6,11,8*30 collected during the previous year. Of this amount transit duty on shipments to the mainiv.nd amounted to Rs. 34,455-0-0 as compared with Rs. 48,740 collected during the previous year. (ii) The Bahrain Government issued ! Alans implementing the agreement arrived at during discussions held in March and April between Bahrain and Sa*udi Arabian delegations. The 'Alans informed the public (a) that the transit duty on cargo for the mainland which was transhipped at sea would be n* ad valorem instead of 2% ad valorem hitherto charged, (b) that the duty on dates would be 5$ ad valorem on the current market price in Bahrain, (c)8 (c) that General Export Manifests would be issued to all craft proceeding with cargo to the mainland and (d) that the minimum number of packages which v/ould be allowed for transhipment at sea would be reduced to 100* The agreement a^so provided, reciprocally, for the issue of manifests for cargo shipped from Bahrain or the various Sa’uai Arabian ports, 10, MGNICIPAoITlEb , Owing to the lack of funds no works of any magnitude could be undertaken by the Manamah or Muh&amp;rrac Municipalities during the year. Much useful business has, however, been done by tne two bodies. Visitors are invariably impressed by the cleanliness of Manaaah and Muharraq towns. 11. PUBLIC ;0RKo, (i) Through the courtesy of the Bahrain Government the State Engineer and Superintendent of the Land Department were engaged for over six months in supervising the construction of a pier and various buildings at tne Naval Base at Jufair. (il) Considerable work has been done on the projected causew/ay between Manamah and Munarraq. 12.

(i) An event -Rich overshadowed all happenings/✓N happenings in the Hasa province vas the death in October of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jiluwi, Amir of Hasa, anc a cousin of Bin Sa^ad* He had been ailing for some time and his death removes Bin Sa^d^ ablest lieutenant, who ^\as with Bin ^ud from the beginning of his amazing career and had for two decades maintained his authority in his eastern dominions* •Abdullah, bin Jildwi has been succeeded by his son, Sa^d, a taciturn young man of some 25 years of age, who is said to take an even stronger line with the bedouin than did his redoubtable father* (it) The Indian rupee has been adopted as the local currency of Hasa and Hajd and considerable ship ments were received in Jedda apparently for this purpose. The rupee is unpopular among the bedouin and smaller traders who have lost by tne change, but the importers from abrC^Dd have gained by it. (iii) Large numbers of camels were said to have i been purchased by Bin Sa'ud during the summer for sums varying from 120-130 riyals. (iv) Towards the end of the year Bin Sa f ud •established a land registration department in the Hasa Province and was making arrangements to (a) open regular courts, and (b) to establish a regular police force withi 150 trained men. He also proposed to disarm the tribes^. It is understood that Bin ^a’ud wishes to see the reactions to these reforms in Hasa before intro ducing them in other parts of his dominions. (v) The California Standard Oil Company have been prospecting for oil in various parts of the Hasa Province. A test well was sumc at Damam on the sea coast near Qatif and oil is reported to have been struck on/19 &amp; on the i^th August• Their operations appear to be much hampered by the pressure of gas.

Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Iiimited, for the grant of an oil concession. The Shaikh*s attitude in the course of the negotiations with tne Company made it apparent in the early stages that Bin Sa , ud was trying to bring pressure upon him. It was, therefore, considered necessary to remind the Shaikh of his obligations under Article V of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 under which he was not free to grant concessions or monopolies without the approval of His Majesty*s Government. This warning nad effect, but the Shaikh asked (&amp;) for protection and (b) that his son, Hamad, should be recognised as his successor. After considerable discussions with the Honourable tne Political Resident, tne Shaikh was informed :- (a) that His Majesty*s Government were pre pared to protect him from serious and unprovoked attacks from beyond his frontiers and to support him and his successors in internal difficulties arising from the presence of the Oil Company, and (b) that His Majesty* s Government were pre pared to recognise his son, Hamad, as his successor proviaed he agreed to accept all/go. all obligations under the Qatar Treaty of 1^16 and provided that the Shaikh agreed to convert the Treaty of 1916 into an ^heirs and successors' Treaty. Subsidiary matters connected vith 'protection' included tne construction of a lancing ground and petrol store near Doha. The above conditions were agreed to by the Shaikh in an exchange of letters v.ith the Honourable the Political Resident and the Shaikn finally signed tne Comisercial Agreement ^ith the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited on the 17th May. The question of defining the southern frontier between Qatar and Sa f udi Arabia is under dis cussion with tne Sa*udi Arabian Government. 29. SLAVERY .

Later, hen a Works pi^P'fcy landed at Abu Dhabi to mark the lancing ground and construct the petrol store, the Shaikh (largely as the result of ill advice) refused to allow the construction of the petrol store on the ground that it was not specially mentioned in the c-gi -. &lt;-mt nt concluded earlier in the year. He also complained that the Works Party landed at Sir Ban! Yas Island at the same time n had spoilt his island* by marking a landing ground. It was pointed out to the Shaikh that the petrol store was a natural adjunct to a landing ground but he refused to modify his views* The Officiating Political Agent (Captain G.A. Cole), therefore, proceeded to Abu Dhabi in Jui and as a result of a tnre&amp;t of pressure and the intervention/intervention of Shaikh Sa^d bin Maktum of Dubai, onc.ikh Shakhbut bin Sultan withdrew his opposition and the petrol store was constructed without further obstruction.

A^man, Sharjah and Dubai. A vaccinator was sent to the Trucial Coast from Bahrain with supplies of vaccine obtained by air from Karachi and Basrah, and vaccinated a number of people in all the infected towns.

Matters came to a head when, in the lattei half of December 1^54, the Shaikh removed his flagstaff and flag from Tunb island, ana was reported to be intriguing with the Iranians. In January the Residency Agent (Khan Bahadur ^Isa bin Abdul Batif) was ordered to proceed to Ras &amp;lj Khaimah to enquire from the Shaikh the reason for his eixtraordin&amp;ry action in removing his flagstaff and flag from Tunb Island, and at the same time reminded him of his obligations under Article 5 of tne Treaty of 1832. The Residency Agent reported that tne Shaikh had no intention of abandoning the island but wanted to Imke money out of it, and, there fore, removed his flag to attract attention* In March the Shaikh was informed that His Mcjestyts Governmert were not prepared to pay him rent for the Light House on Yunb Island and that if he did not replace his flak forthwith/10 &amp; forthwith the of ^hurjsah ( ho is the heedof the Q&amp;vr&amp;simi c+^n) would be permitted to hoist his fi«ug on f tlie island* Xrus warning the desired effect &amp;nd tue flagstaff wd fU.g were ropisced on Uxe island on the the lhaiich sent &amp; polite i? ttwr to tne Honourable the Political leaideat in witch he expressed the hope that a Political Officer would visit him at Bes si Khalsah and aiso asXi:u? that u geologist should be sent to Has si Khaiaali to a survey of his territory for miner nls* In coiUiection fith tne ^attur request it is interesting th©t # when the French Sloop 'Bougainville* visited Has si Khulmah on the iltli February f overtures for a geolo gist were b li ved to have been made to Contra Amiral Hivet (Commnder-ln-Chief 9 hev^nt station).

(§ iis wa look back over tha p&amp;at yoar we find that we nave a great deal to thank our heavenly Father for. Our staff has been Increased by several members and our equipment considerably augmented. In 1935 •tfe concluded our report by stating our great need for a lady doctor to be in charge of women's medical work, for a nurse to take Miss ^odemool’s (Mrs. Rodstrom ) place, and for an X-Rey machine. With the arrival of Dr. Eatner Bamy in April and Miss Jennie Bast in March as wellas the installation of a small and efficient G.E. X- ray in a three-room building annexed to the Rosentnal row we have had our req uests answered in a very full measure, we have been greatly heartened by the return of Dr. Barn/ to the mission field. Her quiet, efficient and sympathetic manner of treating her patients has already won for her and the mission many new friends. Miss Bast { since January first she has become Mrs. Alonzo Bell) served cheerfully and conscientiously for eight months as nursing matron of the European Nursing Home. Besides supervising the care of over two hundred in-patients and two thousand out-patients in the nursing home she often went to the homes of bed-ridden patients nursing them personally and lending nurse's assistance to tne doctors in both men's and women's hospitals whenever requested. On tte last day of larch Dr. Bto&amp;rn was given a right royal welcome as he returned to Bahrain after having been away, touring entirely around the penninaula of Arabia, for ten months. He was the first Christian missionary to visit the districts of aair, Hadramaut, and Dhufar. In these districts he successfully treated some of the chiefs as well as multitudes of the populace and ^as^pr^aseo^T^e^end the time of his stay. Becaude of his tour, these areas, which have until recently been entirely closed to missionary endeavor, should be more easily entered by medical missionaries. It is our hope and prayer that, through the Interest raised In America and England by his tour, some missionaries will be sent out to occupy those areas. In the Interests ot medical science. Dr. Storm discovered several , hitaerto unknown centers of indigenous leprosy. The International neprosy association hopes to discover where are the indigenous centers of leprosy dissemination so that they can plan an effective pipeventative attack against t ie dread disease by treating and quarenting? cases in the centers and taereby preventing their further spread to^areas where the disease is either unknown or uncommon. Bes idoa i.our taerj |m lwo ..^do uo and 0110 to Qator. Dr. Thoms also went to Rjrad right after Chrletoae. Banrain stands at the gateway to the Pirate Coast, Nejd and her dependencies. One Doctor alone in Bahrain cannot tour, ie hope the Mission and the church at home will not fail to realize the importance of touring and the necessity of an adequate staff to permit the same. with deep regret we said good-bye to Dr. and Mrs. Dame on May 2nd, when they took the boat on tneir homeward journey, after nine busy years of service on the field since their last furlough, they more than deserved a rest, and we were glad for their sake that taey could be beyond the beck and call of the sick and needy of Arabia for a time. However every member of the staff from the missionaries to the sweepers felt the departure of our 'Chief very keenly. For the moment it seemed to us that without Dr. Dame in charge, the fine medical plant and wide refutation which he had so large a part In creating for our mission nere would inevitibly suffer irreparable loss.i^ e anowii uB thAt Ha will oantiaua to bxadd th* ne re felofi naa bo nobly bean carried on for the paat thirty nina ■I 3ha f°?

He is a lad who has the unenviable job of dressing leg ulcers. He was a Christian enquirer in iusoat but because of his interest in Christianity tnere he was having a nard time making a living. He attends all Christian services that we holdand sings his favorite hymns lustily. We tuank ^usoa^ for him. Salih, one other enquirer, has won his way into all our hearts by his sweet personality and forwent piety. He comes from a prominent Sunni family from Hudd, and has been tempted persistently and in many diverse ways to reject Christ and return to the faith of nis fathers. He recently went through a very severe trial of soul but seems to have wome out of it victorious for he shows more joy arid less anxiety in his face than ever before.jrx gicUice at our statistical sheet will show that our clinic j thi past year nave had almost as heavy an attendance as in I 935 which will prooably regain for all time as the nigh mark.

They had been dressed by the company's first aid man and transported by their high speed launen to Banrain. At another time four coolies who had been injured in a dynamite explosion were brought in and treated. Among our patients numbered members fopm ail tne mam races of the world| Africans, Jews, Arabs, Persians, Afgans, Indians, Chinese cooksaand Japanese sailors from the oil tankers, Americans, Britisners, dollanders, and Germans. Although most of tne iiiuropeans whom we treated in the hursing home were employees of the Bahrain Pet. Co. yet we always nad room for other's outside the comoany. Among our most grateful patients were officers of the Royal havy, the 3.1. Steamship c ompa ny and the Imperial Airways. Last but not least we had two infanta bom in the Nursing Hone this year; Miohial Xoung and Charles martin Rodstrom. bur new X-Ray machine ia indeed a Joy. *^t is a small but efficient machine, simple and inexpensive to operate, snook proof, and flexible. Dr. Dame raised tne money for the machine locally before he left on furlougn. The oil company contributed a third of the total sum which was necessary for the purchase of the maonlne , tae erection of a three -room building for housing it, arid cowering the coat of installing and operating it. Shaikh Hamed headed the list of local contributers with a generous gift, the Bahrain government also contributed as did several other l^oal shaikhs, meronants, clerks, drillers, and artisaas. Moslems, Jews, Hindus, and /Christians recogniaed the uaefulueas and desirability of hatPing the machine here where it would be available for the needs of all and showed their interest by contributing towards the X-Ray fund.Tiie “Omans Hospital Has continued to be of service vo the wojpen of Bahrain and of the contiguous Arab tov^ns* Our patients nave varried from a poor beggar woman to members of the ruling shaikh's family and some of the richest families in town.

V.e are however less anxious to increase the number than to have smaller elinecs allowing more time and careful work on individual patients. The problem of language is a real one in Bahrain when a good half of the clinic patients are Persian. The spirit of the hospital is a very definite entity. Patients feel at home and a friendliness and lack of discordance a a selfish ness has been conspicuous. There is a confidence that whether rich or poor or whatever race or creed the utmost will be done for their welfare. Our Bible woman has been faithful in her duties and ner rjuding and talking with the women acceptable. The ambulatory patients and their friends have been eager to attend church services. Though Hrs. Van feursem is no longer in formal institutional work she is of constant service in introducii g old friends and making new ones. Each year opens with unlimited opportunities for improvement and progress. We ask your continued prayer that we may steadily forward. Esther Barby h.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. ); ( b Memorandum:- With reference to your memorandum No. C/22-8/8 dated 12th January 1937 in connection with information for compiling the Annual Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency, I am giving below the required particulars. l.\^ Police. Strength 1-1-1936 on 31-12-36 Indian Police 3 4 Arab Police 168 200 Followers n 14 182 218 Naturs Manama h 66 63 Budeya 5 Rafa 5 Maharaq 42 51 108 124 Police . Naturs, Law and Order . Police duties have increased during the year. Owing to the amount of traffic and the large numbers of foreigners employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company more men have to be placed on duty in the bazaars and elsewhere. Cases of motor accidents have to be dealt with almost daily.- 2 - A section of police is stationed at the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ Gamp by arrangement vdth the Company and this has been found to be very useful in dealing with cases at the Camp. Although the Force is slightly larger than it was last year it is rarely possible to collect more than forty men on parade. A regular course of musketry has been arranged and it is intended that every man in the force shall fire a course once during the year. The standard of firing is steadily improving also the health of the police who are not getting malaria as frequently as they used to. Six N.C.Os and men are in India doing a course with the 10th Baluch Regiment. This is the second batch which has been sent to India, the first experiment was very successful. The police head-dress was changed during the year from agal and kofia to turbans similar to those worn by troops in Egypt, the Sudan and the Somaliland. The turbans are more economical and more practical than the other headdress. There has been an exceptionally small amount of crime during the year partly because there is less unemployment and partly because most of the notorious rogues are employed by the Bahrain Petro leum Company. Illicit arak brewing has decreased and the use of methylated spirit mixed with eau de cologne has become popular. It is used as a drink by women of the town. Partly owing to the amount of traffic on the roads at night there has been no cases of dacoity during the year. There has been no change in the organisation-3-* of the nature who have carried out their duties satisfactorily under the various Amirs. A natur post has been opened at Budeya. 2. Administration . During the Ruler’s absence in England a council consisting of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad was appointed to take charge of the State. Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa spent eight months of the year abroad in Europe and in Syria. A committee was set up to codify the pro clamations and regulations issued by the Bahrain Government. Its work is not yet completed. No new regulations of particular importance were issued. 3. Pearling industry . There was a further decrease in the number of pearling boats. The market was very dull and except Mr. I&amp;ck no foreign buyers of importance visited Bahrain. A number of divers found employment with the Bahrain Petro leum Company and both they and their nakhudas profited, the latter receiving Rs 5/- per month from the diver’s pay. The Selaf and Tesqaam were the same as during the previous year. No large pearls were found during the season and the catch was considerably less than last year. There was an increase of Khammas divers and a corresponding decrease in the Selafieh divers. 4. Public works . Work on the following buildings etc. was carried out during the year:- 1. Manamah-Maharaq road completed except the parapet, up to the cnannel. 2. New Customs House. 3. Repairs to Fort including a barrack room and armoury.-4- JU * 33 - 12 4. Dispensaries at Naim and Bilad al-Qadim. 5. Two shops in Barrett Street. 6. Wall in front of the palace and interior repairs. 7. Usual repairs and upkeep of buildings. 8. Repairs on Budeya road. 5. Municipalities . Manamah . A large area of the swamp behind the mission building, municipal property, was filled in with stone. Owing to the abnormal heavy rains the reclaimed area has become covered with water again. Crude oil is being used on stagnant water near the town and it is generally said that there are many less mosquitoes than there used to be. A number of roads have been widened and some new roads have been built such as one through Has Rumman which joins the Manamah-Muharraq road and a road from the town to the Lunatic Asylum which became necessary when the Government leased an area south west of Manamah to Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa acted as President of the Council for eight months during Shaikh Mohomed’s absence from Bahrain. The original subsidy of Rs 2000/- per month was paid to each of the Municipalities from 1st. Maharam 1355. This payment had been reduced to Rs 1000/- per month at the time when cuts were made in all departments. The council decided to discontinue the method of employing a contractor to do the town cleaning and undertook the work itself.-5- Muharrag . In Muharraq little has been done during the year except the normal town clean ing and some widening of roads and filling in of the creek at Maharaq landing place. ' The muni cipality undertook a special programme of work in Hedd which they have now completed. The main street was widened to allow cars to reach almost to the end of the town, the longer sewer in the middle of the town has been filled in with stone and mud, and is now used as a road, and a dis pensary was opened in some buildings which were taken over by the Government for a debt. \ 6. Agriculture . Nothing to report, no work has been done by the Government in this direction during the year. t 7. -Electric Department . The accounts of this department and all other govemment depart ments, are Kept according to the Arabic calendar so it is impossible to give figures for 1936. J/st Arabic year the electric department made a slight profit after paying depreciation and all expenses and in 1355 there will be a larger profit. The staff of the department are continually occupied in wiring more premises and the number of people who use electricity for lighting is steadily increasing but unfortunately the revenue does not increase in proportion because there is a tendency to replace high powered lamps by cheap Japanese low power lamps. During the year a new ice plant was purchased by the Manamah Municipality and installed in the power house. During the year the Jufair Naval Base was connected with a load of 10 Kw and a printing press with a load of 3 Kw.A new telephone exchange was installed during the year and a day and night service was introduced at the same time. The Manamah exchange is now linked up with 114 lines including those of the Bahrain Petro leum Company. 8. Administration of Justice . Some changes have been made in the personnel of the magistrates. Shaikh Sulman left the Bahrain Court on the return of his brother Shaikh Abdullah from England. Shaikh Rashid bin Mohomed was appointed as magistrate on the Bahrain Court to sit with Shaikh Abdullah son of H.E. Shaikh Hamad. Shaikh Mohomed bin Abdullah was appointed as President of Majlis Tajara in place of Shaikh Rashid. Shaikh Baqr al-Asfur was appointed as third Shia Qadi on the Shara Court. Unfortunately the three Qadis rarely hold the same point of view and the working of the Shia Court is complicated by personal and local dissections. The committee who are preparing a draft code of regu lations for the Bahrain Courts are continuing their work but much ground has still to be covered. The general public appear to have lost all interest in the question of a code. There have been no unusual cases during the year but a very large number of nakhudas r claims against divers working at the Jebel has been dealt with. 9. Education . All schools show an increased attendance. The public are still asking for more advanced education and especially instruction in English. The opening of small country schools at Budeya and at Kurzakhan is under consideration and-7- and a building at Budeya has been acquired cheaply which will be psed as a school. All the older boys from the Manama, Muharraq and Hedd schools have left and obtained work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. During the last two years over 150 boys from the schools have ob tained employment mostly of a clerical nature at wages from Bs 20/- -Bsl20/- per month. This is in some ways satisfactory but it has depleted the schools of all boys who have learnt a few words of Knglish and a slight Knowledge of arithmetic. These boys have left scnool and obtained worK before completing their education and probably they will be no longer employed when the construc tion work ceases. In the girls* schools good progress has been made in sewing, embroidery and knitting.

Manamah 66 63 Budaiyah - 5 R&amp;fa* — 5 Muharraq 42 51 108 124 Police, Naturs. Lav/ and Order. Police duties have increased during the year. Owing to the amount of traffic and the large numbers of foreigners employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company more men have to be placed on duty in the bazaars and elsewhere. Cases of motor accidents have to be dealt with almost daily. A section of police is stationed at the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Camp by arrangement with the Conroany4 Company and this has been found to be very useful in dealing with cases at the Camp. Although the Force is slightly larger than it was in 1&amp;55 it is rarely possible to collect more than forty men on parade. A regular course of musketry has been arranged and it is intended that every man in the force shall fire a course once during the year* The standard of firing is steadily inproving. The health of the police is better and they are not getting malaria as frequently as in the past. Six non commissioned officers and men are in Inaia doing a course of training with the 10th Baluch Regiment. Tills is the second contingent which has been sent to India, as the first experiment was very successful. The police head-dress was changed during the year from the Arab aqal and kuffiah to turbans similar to those worn by troops in Egypt, zhe Sudan and the Somaliland. The turbans are more econonrLcai and more practical than the other head-dress. There has been an exceptionally small amount of crime during the year partly because there is less unenpioyment and partly because most of the notorious rogues are employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Illicit arak brewing has decreased and the use of methylated spirit mixed with eau de cologne has become popular especially with the women of the town, though methylated spirit is denaturalised and every effort made to suppress this form of evil. Partly ov/ing to the amount of traffic on the roads at night tiiere has been no cases of dacoity during the year. There has been no change in the organisation of the naturs who have carried out their duties satisfactorily under the various Amirs. A natur post has been opened at Budaiyah. 5. JjOCaIi AFFAIKb . (i) On the night of the 15/16th December a serious fire broke out and destroyed the vegetable and wood markets. Almost V the entire stock of firewood in Manamah was burnt. His Excellency Shaikh Bir Hamad bin !

(ii) A party of sma.ll boys, viio were playing in a water channel at Shakhura village, chanced upon a concealed hoard of gold coins, which tumbled out of an hole in the bank on the site of an old house. A number of the coins were found to be Turkish coins of the time of bultan *Abdul Hamid bin Ahmad (A.H. 1187) • One coin was, however, a Venetian gold ducat of A.D. 1280-8d. 6. Oha- J^h-'uIN P lh0.^:;UM COMPLY ^IMIThD : (i) ?£r. G#W.R. Smith acted as Chief Local Representative throughout the year. (ii) Mr. E.A. Skinner acted as Resident Manager throughout the ye r. (iii) Work on the Refinery proceeded apace during the year. The construction work was not, however, completed, as it had been hoped, b, the end of the year. (iv) On the night of 18/19th April a small section of the temporary British personnel employed in connection with the construction of the Refinery, who had for some time been giving trouble, started a real n Rough House” in the course of which the Resident Manager, who had attempted to quiet the disturbance, was assaulted and several persons mere or less h dly hurt. The 4* Political A. 2 ent T s help was invoked by the Company. Special Constables were appointed and on one night when serious trouble appeared possible, a strong party of Bahrain Police, under the Command:nt of Police (Mr. C. DtIrymple Belgrave), was stationed on the outskirts of the Camp until early the next morning. Four of the ringleaders were on the 25th April repatriated under Section 21(1) of the Bahrein Order in Council. (v) 500,400 tons of crude oil and 9,200 tons of fuel oil were shipped from Bahrain during the year in forty-one t^nkshipsi® -e- of various nc tionalities (8 Aaerictin, 16 Norwegian, 6 Bri tish, 2 Danish, 5 Japanese, 2 Italian end 1 French) the total royalty due to the State amounted to &amp; 17,83,600/-. (vi) On the 31st December the Company*s employees by nationalities numbered: Americans 153 Burope&amp;n British subjects 157 Indian British subjects 3£3 Bahrainis 3747 Others 658 7.

CUSTOMS : The Customs revenue amounted to 2s 8,12,417/- as compared v.ith .ts 6,31,779/- collected during the previous year. Of t&amp;is amount transit duty on shipments to the mainland amounted to d 1,19,350/- compared with £s 84,455/- during the previous year. a. Municip^Lima : MaHamah : A large area of the swamp behind the Mission building, municipal property, was filled in with stone. Owing to the abnormal heavy rains the reclaimed area has become covered with wrter again. Crude oil is being used on stagnant water near the town and it is generally said that there are many less mos quitoes than there used to be. A number of roads have been widened and some new roads have been built such as one through Has Kumman which joins the Manamah-Mohar,aq road, and a diversion of the Manamah-New Camp/--7- M&amp;n&amp;maii-Nev; Can^) at the place where the new Direction Finding Wireless Station is being erected. Shaildi ’Abdullah bin ’isa acted as President of the Council for eight months during Shaikh Mnhammad’s absence from Bahrain# The original subsidy of as 2,000/- per month was paid to each of the Skinicipalities from 1 st Muharrem 1355. This payment had been reduced to &amp; 1,000/- per nonth at the time when cuts were made in all departments. The Council decided to discontinue the method of employing a contractor to do the town cleaning and under took the work itself# Muii&gt;-xu .tX 8 In Muharraq little has been done during the year except the normal town cleaning and some widening of roads and filling in of the creek at the Muharraq land- ing place# The municipality undertook a special programme of work in Hedd which they have now completed. The main street was widened to allow cars to reach almost to the end of the town, the large sewer in the middle of the town has been filled in with stone and mud, and is now used as a road, and a dispensary was opened in some buildings which were taken over by the Government for a debt. 10. PUBLIC WORKS &gt; Work on the following buildings etcetera was carried out during the yeart- 1 . Manamah-Muharraq road completed except the parapet, up to the channel. 2 . New Customs House o. Repairs to Fort including a barrack room and armoury. 4. Dispensaries at Naim and Bilad al-Cadim. 5. Two shops in Barrett Street.- 8 - 6 . Well in front of the palace and interior repairs. 7. Usual repairs and upkeep of buildings. 8 . Repairs on Rudaiyeh road. 11 . : The Electric Department mrde a sli^t profit after paying depreciation and all expenses end it is expected that there will be a larger profit in future years. The stuff of the department are continually ocuipiea in wiring more premises and the number of people who use electricity for lighting is steadily increasing but unfortu nately the revenue does not increase in proportion because there is a tendency to replace high powered lamps by cheap Japanese low pov/er lamps. During the year a new ice plant was purchased by the Manamah Sfeinicipality and installed in the power house. During the year the Jufair Naval Base was connected with a load of 10 kilowatts and a printing press with a load of 3 kilowatts. A new telephone exchange was installed during the year and a day and night service was introduced at the same time. The Manamafo exchange is now linked up with 114 lines including those of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 12 . • hLUCkTION ; All schools shovr an increased attendance. The public are still asking for more advanced education and especially instruction in English. The opening of small country schools at 3udai f yah and at Kursakhan is under consideration and a building at Budal f yah has been acquired cheaply which will be used as a school. All the older boys from the Manamah* Muharraq end Hedd schools have left and obt*ined work with the Bahrein Petro leum Company. During the last two years over 150 boys from the/-- 3 - il the schools have obtained employment mostly of a clerical nature at wages from it 20/- - Bs 120/- per month. This is in some ways satisfactory but it has depleted the schools of all boys who have learnt a fev; words of English and have a slight knowledge of arithmetic. These boys have left school and obtained work before completing their education and probably they will be no longer ec^loyed when the cons truction work ceases. In the girls 1 schools good progress has been made in sewing, embroidery and knitting. itfumber of schools in existence on 1st January 1356 •••• •••• Schools opened during the year .

ULI At the conclusion of a v*.sit to Rasa early in the year Ibn Sa*ud announced that a new tax f Jihad Tex’ was to be im posed on all people not eligible for military service. In- y ere' sed taxes were also Imposed on sugar, tea and tobacco and anything connected with smoking. Representstions/-26/- 0 -17- Representations by the iLmir of Hasa that the people were too poor to pay jihad tax met with no success and some 70,000 dollars were collected in spi^e of wide spread dis content. hater in the year Hasa w s exempted from further taxation under this head. Further efforts were mcde during the year to reorganize the various departments of the Hasa provincial Government with a resultant frequent reshuffling of the heads of departments. In particular difficulties 7 /ere experienced in appointing financial officials and Cus toms directors who are in the unfortunate position of having to provide Ibn Sa’ud with funds. Towards the end of the year it was reported that a new exaction amounting to 150,000 dollars was being extracted from the merchants of Hasa. About the same time it was also rumoured that His Majesty King Ibn Sa f ud had requested certain merchants, who had adv.mced the S^uai Government money against Cuswoms duty on their importation of general merchandise, to forego 1/5 of their advances. The merchants are believed to have refused to agree to Ibn Sana’s request. 25. OATiiRt At the beginning of the year rumours were cur ent in Bahrain that there had been trouble in Doha between Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Casim /•! Thani end certain members of his family.

There have been no important criminal cases and there has been a definite reduc tion in petty criminal cases, theft, etc. This is mainly owing to the improvement in conditions and reduction in unemployment. a number of well known bad characters are working with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. During the year there has been a serious increase in cases of accidents by motorvehicles many of them due to careless dri ving. For some months about three cases a week were investigated by the Police.

One of the most important events of the year 1937 was the Zuharah trouble, when the old dispute regarding the rightful ownership of Zubarah was revived. In June 1937 a disagreement arose between the Shaikh of Qatar and the 'Ruler of Bahrain about the overlordship of the Naim Tribe and the ownership of Zubarah. Bepresentatives of both parties met but were unable to come to an agreement. On the 26th June, the Baler of Qatar at the invitation of the hr Shaikh of Bahrain met Shaikh Abdullah bin ^sa, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad and Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment, at Ghariyah in Qatar in an attempt to settle this pro blem. This party returned to Bahrain on the 30th of June with { - the news that the negotiations had ended unsuccessfully and that the Shaikh of Qatar was proposing to take offensive action against the Naim Tribe without further delay. On the 1st July a letter was received from the Buler of Qatar that he intended to take action to restrain those of his subjects who were violating the laws of his country. The same day the Qatar troops attacked a party of the Naim Tribe and without much difficulty took possession of the Naim strong hold. It appears that one or two men were killed on either side The effect of this engagement was that the Naim immedia tely sent their representatives to the Shaikh of Qatar to sue IM 1 # for peace. The Shaikh of Qatar then obtained an agreement from Shaikh Hashid bin Mohammad, the leader of the Naim, to the effect that they would observe the laws of Qatar while they re mained in.the State. There was considerable excitement in Bahrain during the first few days of July while exaggerated rumours were coming tfrom the Qatar Peninsula. His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain asked the Political Agent Bahrain for written permission to allow/-allow the Naim Tribe to come to Bahrain. This was granted and a party of Naim came across to Bahrain in August 1937• His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain later d ecided that in view of the action of the Huler of Qatar against the Naim Tribe, whom he considered as his subjects, he was not dis posed to cdntinue the transit due privilege which he had pre viously extended to the Shaikh of Qatar. As a result tfe* car go in transit for Qatar is now required to pay the usual duty of as against the previous concessional rate of 2%.

Pearl Industry. A very bad season, decline in prices and a poor catch. Tisqam reduced to Rs 20/- for a diver and Rs 15/- for a puller. Only one important pearl was found. Most of the buying was done by the Hindu merchant Gainmal. In spite of the reduction of the Tisqam the divers made no protest.

Large areas of land near Zellaq are being put under cultivation by His Highness bu^the only crops grown are dates and lucerne. The abnormally warm winter has caused date trees to blossom some motths before usual time, it is thought that this may cause a bad crop.

All elevations were referred to a mean sea level which was established beside the Zekrit pier. An area of about 860 square kilometres was mapped on this scale. The whole ol the remainder of the peninsula was surveyed on a scale of 1 to 100,000. Owing to the lack of prominent natural features triangulation methods could not always be used, and a large part of the area was covered by a series of traverses. By the end of the season some 10,400 square kilometres had been mapped. At the same time as the stratigraphical and structural examination w-cs being carried out, a study was made of the water resources with a view to locating a supply for the Jebel Dukhan drilling camp. A large number of existing wells were visited and the water level and salinity measured. Sites were chosen for three wells which were drilled by the Company. The results showed that there is very little prospect of obtaining an adequate supply of good water.Trucial Coast was No work/done here during the 1937/38 field season. On 1st November, 1938 Messrs. Williamson and Rogers arrived at Sharjah to begin work on the area west of the Oman Mountain Range. Their intention was to approach Baraimi by way of Dhaid and the Beni Chittib country. However, Mohammed bin Ali, chief of that tribe, refused to discuss the matter until after the Id al Fitr (24th November). The party, therefore, obtained permission from Sheikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi to drive to Baraimi through his territory. The party, accompanied by Capt. Howes, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Baraimi and met Saqr bin Sultan on 22nd November. On 26th November the party of Messrs. Thompson &amp; Hotchkiss who had come up from Muscat was met at Hafit about 28 kms. south of Baraimi. The two parties returned to Baraimi. On 30th November the Muscat party left for Sohar via Wadi Jizi; and Mr. Williamson began negotiations to be allowed to examine the country east and nortn-east of Baraimi. Between 3rd and 13th December the territory controlled by Saqr bin Sultan was examined and an area of some 150 square kilometres was mapped on a scale of 1 to 50,000. Mr. Williamson then found it was impossible to do any further work in the area. The Na f im and Albu Shamis to the south, the Bani Kaab to the east and north and the Bani Kitab to the north, all refused to allow the party to enter their territories. As no useful purpose could be served by remaining at Baraimi, and as the atmosphere was becoming distinctly unfriendly, the party returned to Sharjah on 16th December. 6.2.39.QATAR EXPLORATION BORING, DUKHAN NO. 1 &amp; i (x y Location The west side of the Qp.tar peninsular (25°.20* latitude, 50°.47' longtitude) about 2 miles from the sea and situated on the north end of the Dukhan fold* Work carried out during 1958 At the close of 1937» location to test for oil having 'been chosen and a suitable place found for unloading the drilling plant *r\A general material, the initial work of building a jetty, a road to the Camp and boring for water near the Camp were taken in hand* ■•dp Jetty . At Dohat-ez-Zekrit (inlet of the sea about 5 miles north-east of the oil well location) work on building a jetty was commenced and completed by the end of March. This jetty is 300 feet long, 17 feet wide and allows craft of 6 feet draught to come along side at high tide and is furnished with a 7 tons hand-crane and a 30' mast* Road Although the distance from the jetty to the location is only 5 miles, to overcome natural physical difficulties, it was necessary to build 9 miles of road, 3 of which had to be metalled. The road was ready for use in February. IXiring March and April 600 tons were transported over it and by the end of the year over 1,100 tons had been unloaded at Dohat-ez-Zekrit and transported to the location. Water Although previous searches for usable water on the east side of the peninsular had been unsuccessful, it was thou^it worth while making another attempt near the location and camp at Khatiyah. Two wells were sunk; the first , started in January, struck brackish water at 208*, which rose to within 100 feet of the surface and, when punped, gave 700 gallons an hour. This boring was carried down to 310‘. The second well, started in March, struck the same water source at 200* but in larger quantities. This well was carried down to 1,100 feet in the hope, which was not realized, of finding a deep source of sweet water wimilar to that of Bahrein. Ehe combined output of these two wells was about 2,000 gallons an hour, which contained 2,900 parts of solids in100,000 of water. These wells were used for supplying water for huilding purposes only. Having failed to find usable water locally, the Comp a ny was faced with Hobson*s choice of importing fresh water from Bahrein and/or Bombay for domestic use and using sea-water for drilling purposes. In July a 2** pipe line was laid direct from the jetty to the Camp and the following moirth a 3 H line from the sea to the boring rig. Bombay water is transported from the jetty to the Camp in tank trucks. Camp and Camp Buildings . These started in March were ready for use in August. The buildings comprised sleeping and living quarters for 15 covenanted staff and some 120 uncovenanted employees, they are a company design and are made of native stone and gatch, constructed by local contractors. The Camp is equipped withdectric light and power, ice plant, Marconi wireless. A small first aid hospital has been built and a hard tennis court made. Rotary Drilling Rig . This is a modern rotary outfit, Diesel powered and capable of going to a depth of 7,500*. By March the plant was being transported to the location. Excavations for foundations were started in May, the substructure built by the end of July and the derrick built and rig installed by the end of September. Drilling started on October 7 th and by December 31st had reached the depth of 2,000 feet. /A 7th February, 1939 SHC/RRo' 1.0.

LOCAL AFFAIRS f ikf (i) In September and October malcontents, making use of an incipient Nationalist Movement manifesting itself (curiously enough) among the semi-educated youth of the Holi community (the Holis are of Persian extraction), succeeded in stirring up some agitation in the State. The agitators were able to make use of a general dissatisfaction in regard to the Bahrain Courts, and the Shia Shera Courts in particular, and an attempt was made to foster public dissatisfaction with the State edu cational system and with labour conditions in the Bahrain Petro leum Company*s premises. On the ring-leaders being arrested a premature strike took place among the local employees of the Oil Company, and a demonstration was organised in the Manama bazaar. The demonstrators were quickly dispersed and the strike failed. Meanwhile the Shia Shera Courts had been reformed and Shaikh Abdul Husain A1 Halli was appointed as C adhi of a Shera . Appeal Court. Other steps are under contemplation for the improvement of the Bahrain Courts in general, and also of the educational system of the State. The agitation came to an abrupt end with striking demonstrations of loyalty by the leading Arabs of Bahrain and by the Bahama of the villages.llilti 1 -4- (ii) Three nakhudas of dhows were arrested and sentenced in early April for attempting to bring indigent foreigners with out passports into Bahrain# At the same time an extensive round up v^as made in the bazaars of Persians and pat if is who were found without passports and without any ostensible means of livelihood. 547 persons were arrested by the Police of whom 114 were put before the Agency Court under King’s Regulation 2 of 1937.

This he undertook to do but certain interested persons in Dubai instigated the nota bles to prevent their deportation. At the same time consider- able excitement was caused by false stories of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government in regard to emancipation of _ ^ I _4 slaves, and a difficult situation arose. On the 25th March the Political Agent and the Residency Agent met the Shaikh of Dubai and the notables in Majlis; the policy of His Majes- ty’s Government in regard to slaves was explained in detail and on the folly of their attitude being pointed out the notables at once withdrew their opposition to the expulsion of the two arms smugglers who left Dubai shortly afterwards. (b) During the summer, there was considerable agitation in Dubai for reforms of a democratic nature, led by prominent members of the Al'Bu Falasah, the Shaikhly family. The first outbreak, during which armed bedouin were called in by the Shaikh to help him against the hostile section of the Al Bu Falasah, ended in a promise by the Shaikh to grant certain concessions. In the next few months, however, during which both he and his brother, Shaikh Juma, visited the Political Agent and strove to obtain armed British inter vention, it became clear that the Shaikh did not intend to implement his promises. Finally, open hostilities became imminent, and the Political Agent went to Dubai in H.M.S. Deptford. By this time the Shaikh had lost all public support, and eventually an agreement was reached, providing for a State Majlis, over which the Shaikh himself would pre side, a Municipality and other reforms. The relations of la the state with His Majesty’s Government remain in the hands of the Shaikh. (c'/(c) The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah has written an apology to the Senior Naval Officer for his refusal to call on His.Majesty 1 sloops visiting Has al Khaimah* (d) During winter 1937-38 information was received that considerable slave trading was going on in Abu Dhabi. On the 1st March 1938 the Political Resident visited Abu Dhabi in one of His Majesty’s sloops and called on the Shaikh to put a stop to this traffic. It was found necessary to withdraw the good offices of His Majesty’s Government, including facilities for travel, from Abu Dhabi, and the question of more active steps was explored* Information received later in the year, however, indicated that the action taken had had adequate results and at the close of the year the question of restoring travel facil ities to Abu Dhabi was under examination. (viii) Oil . (a) On the 15th November a geological party of Petroleum Concessions Limited accompanied by Captain J.B.Howes, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, left Sharjah for Baraimi. After getting as far as Baraimi through the territory of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, they found the hinterland Shaikhs impossible to negotiate with (thanks in large measure to the intrigues of various Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast )5 and after surveying a small area, were obliged to return to the Coast on the 16th Dec ember• (b) On the 9th December Mr. S.H. Longrigg, representing Petroleum Concessions Limited, obtained an exploratory ygTamfrfe option from the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah covering a maximum period of 3£ years. (c) On the 22nd December, he obtained a 75 year concession from Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba. (d) Negotiations with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for an oil concession were still in progress at the end of the year.

With reference to your letter No.C/31-8/8 dated 8th January 1940, I enclose herewith my notes for compiling your Annual Administration Report for year 1939. Adviser to the Government. Memorandum: S.Z1. Police Strength on 1-1-39 31-12-39 Indians 6 6 Arab 296 341 Followers 19 25 321 372 Nature Manamah 81 70 Muharraq 54 54 135 124 It was decided last year that the Police force should be raised to 350 men. This strength has been almost attained. A machine gun section and a motor bicycle section were trained during the year. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed took over his duties as Superintendent of Police after completing his training in India. Havildar Abdul Karim son of the late Superintendent of Police, Haj Sulman bin lasim, entered the Police Training School at Nasik. Since the beginning of the war the Police have been occupied with defence duties in addition to their ordinary work. The Government is endeavouring to improve the quality of the naturs. In the past these men have been enlisted without any medical examination and they have not been given any train ing. Men are now subjected to eye tests and are being taught to shoot. Most of the old men were found to be unfit. Traffic accidents have again decreased. One murder took place during the year, there were no other important criminal cases. Towards the end of the year there were an unusual number of thefts in Manama. 2. Administration . Captain A.C. Byard was appointed Assistant to the Adviser, Mr C.R.L. Adrian-Vallance was appointed Director of Education. There were no outstanding changes in the administration. During the absence of His Highness Shaikh Hamad in India a Regency Council was appointed consisting of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad and Adviser to the Government.Pearl Industry , Figures for the last season have not yet been examined. According to reports the catch was very good in quality but not very large. No foreign buyers of importance visited Bahrain except Mr S. Pack who only remained a short time owing to out break of war. The firm of A.A. Kozaibi &amp; Brothers made pur chases, said to amount to about £60,000. They bought at low prices, owing to the unsettled world conditions. Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa visited America and assisted in advertising real pearls.

The following important public works were completed during the year. Manama Customs Pier Extension, State Hospital, Dispensary, Passport Office. New Rifle Range. Extension of both ends of Manama-Moharraq causeway. Transport Department, new garages and Departments. b. The following works were in course of construction. Womens Hospital. Mens Hospital. Fort Tower and wall. Extension Technical School. 5. Municipalities . Manama. The following was the most important work done by the Municipality during the year. Metalling the customs square and partoof sea Road. Partial filling of swamp near Wireless Station. New Road from Barrett Street to Suk al Arba. Anti-malaria measures, oiling stagnat water etc. Constructing drains from artesian wells to sea. Planting trees on main roads. Filling in portion of swamp on south of town. Laying out new road from cin&amp;ma to east shore. Building a drain from Palace garden to sea.Muharraq . With the aid of a grant from Government the Municipality extended the sea road to a point on the north of the town close to the school. This enables traffic to reach Hedd and the numerous villages in Muharraq island without entering Muharraq town. The municipality built a double line of shops on ground reclaimed near the pier. This used to be a creek and is now valuable property. 6 . Agriculture . Captain A.C. Byard took over charge of the Budeya experi mental garden. Crops of English vegetables, potatoes, wheat and barley, sugar can and lucerne are being grown successfully. The Government obtained a supply of English vegetable seeds and endeavoured to sell to the public, but with small success. Date disease was prevalent in a number of the gardens espe cially in the south east coast. 7. Education . The Inspector of Education, Faik Adham, left the service of the Bahrain Government in March, 1939. He had held the post for ten years. His wife, the headmistress of the Manama Girls School, left at the same time. In June 1939 Mr C.R.L. Adrian-Vallance who was employed in the Iraq Education Department, visited Bahrain and made a thorough examination of Education in Bahrain. He wrote an exhaustive report on the subject. In November 1939 Mr Vallance was appointed Director of Education in Bahrain. The following schools were in existence at the end of 1939:- Masters Boys Manama 11 390 Muharraq 9 342 Hedd 7) Suk al Khamis 2) Budeya 2 ) 582 Sitrah 2) Technical School 3 17 38 1339r\ -- —4— Girls School.

The Technical School was enlarged in order to admit more pupils and further expansion is under consideration. 8 . Administration of Justice . There has been no change in the composition of the Courts except the resignation of Shaikh Ali bin Hasan, one of the three shia Kadies. It is not proposed to appont another Shia Kadi in his place as the two kadis and the Appeal kadi are sufficient to deal with the work. There is still criticism of the Bahrain Court and this is likely to continue until a regular code has been adopted. The Sunni Shera court is also the subject of much complaint owing to its delay in dealing with cases submitted to it. There have been no cases of particular importance during the year 9. Electric Department . I forward herewith report from the State Engineer.GOVERNMENT OF 3i\HRAIlT STATE ENGINEERS DEPARTMENT Notes on Electricity Department for the year ending 3lst December,1939:- The undertaking operated continuously during 1939 with steadily increasing load and revenue curves. Connected load on 31st December,1938 was 415 K.W. ' ' Tt w M . 1939 tf 545 ” Maximum recorded load 1938 - 174 K.W. ' ,T ' 1939 - 203 ” w Power House generating plant capacity 400 K.V.A. The actual financial result of the year T s working will be shown on the Annual Statement at the end of the Arabic year (30th Dilhaj,I358 - 8th February, 1940), and it is anticipated that the result will be favourable. The approximate increase in revenue from the sale of electricity is Rs.I6,000/-. 1938 Rs.103,000/-/- f 1939 Rs.119,000/-/- The capacity of the generating station was not increased during 1939, as owing to the outbreak of war in Europe, arrangements made to instal a fourth generating set to supply the R.A.F.were not proceeded with. It is anticipated, however, that a new 200 K.V.A.set will be required to deal with the normal increase in connected load, the set to be in operation by March,1941. It is proposed to budget for this expenditure in 1940 as the set should be installed before the end of that year. Extension to Mains etc. A new H.T.transformer station was erected and equipped at Nuaim, Manamah, during 1939 to deal with the load in that area (new Government Hospital) and to relieve the bazaar substation by taking part of its present load.The wiring of houses by local certified wiring contractors continued, approximately 950 points were added during 1939 as compared with 820 in 1938. Twenty-two air conditoning units were in service during the summer season of 1939 - and more have been ordered by consumers for use in 1940. Telephone Department (Included in the Electricity Department). A new 50-line board was added to the Manamah Central Exchange during 1939: Subscribers at 31st December, 1938 - 67 ' ' ' ” 1939 - 80 Further applications have been received. If the present international situation does not adversely effect the output and revenue of this Department, it may be assumed that the annual increase in revenue will continue. r GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.On 2nd 'nril the Political 1 ;ent, Banrain, arrived at dubni and had an interview v/ith Sheikh '5a r id on hoar ?rd H.I . ^Dentforc. tT- «id end the Political ATent diacuddud Uiu ■■■uiuil k g , sjJiiiatioJi^Th^e diaikh of Dubai promised—ily, ti&gt;e that he would restore tiie property and ^rant allowances ..ere in ^ ^ &lt;1^ w-w&gt; w whose who/need cmJ&amp;ieTF . to live in some iShaikhdon 'C T C ^ \ other 1 'isr 1 All^Sh&lt; ildis reiused to accept^i.ani party lesw it mi._h^ lead to compliCt tions ./itli Duoaio On lot July Shaikh Meni T went to Hemasah and became Hafiq. of Uie Albu Shanist&gt; Shaikh Bashid bin Hamad of the Albu Shamis sent his brother iliaikh Lluhannad with a letter to Shaikh Sa'id to this effect* On loth July the Shaikh of Dubai accepted the undertaking riven by Sha ikh Luhairmab bin Hamad on behlaf pf the dlbu Shamis taring respor. sibility about l.Iani 1 and hi^ party* On 13th u^ust, tlie Shaikh of Dubai handed over to Sha ikh Iluhammad bin Hamad of the Albu Shamis the pro erties of Am/lad Bati bin Suliail and the launch of Shaikh Iiani 1 which were then in his possession* Hani T party then moved to Hamasah* On 14th October the Shaikh of Dubai put out the eyes of five persons suspected oi complicity in a plot to secure the return of Shaikh Liani T .

Trachoma, Keratitis, Ophthalmia, Cataract are the commonest eye complaints.

Kar disease s This constitutes 20£ of cases attending the women's clinics - Otorrhea or discharging Ears is very common among young children, it is gratiflng to see that the parents are beginning to realise that it can be cured* espiratory disease : Bronchial asthma is the commonest respiratory complaint in the Island. The diet of the people combined with climatec conditions, is lesponsible for this - It is particularly common among the Persian community* Pulmonary Tuberculosis s Fifteen cases were diagnosed at Naim.

He also state that Medical inspection of the School children should be carried out bi- annually. m view of the high incidence of Malaria Eye disease and Mal nutrition among the school boys, this recommendation would appear to be necessary. School boys who are ill attend Naim Government dispensary for treatment on the advice of the Head- master of the School. /he number of children suffering from diseases and defects xn the Girls’ chool is high for this reason a weekly School treatment clinic is held in Manama School and a Nurse attends bi-weekly at Muharraft School to give treatment. It is hoped that in this way minor ailment will be treated and much chronic disease prevented - attention to general hygiene is part of the teaching given by Nurse. No less than 37.3?? of children in anama School were suffering from Unclean Heads. All childrenchildrtn found to bo unvaccinatod were, subject to consent of parents, vaccinated in the Schools. Respiratory disease and Enlarged Tonsils and Monoids, are the main diseases fro* which the children suffer. Children with the latter complaint are prone to attacks of Tonsillitis and Bronchitis. These in turn interfere with nutrition and growth. General Malnutrition is common, 25 per cent of children in y&amp;nama School suffer from this complaint.- MALARIA - REPORT In ord«r to interest the citizens of Bahrain on the question of Malaria control, it was decided by the Govemme to invite prominent citizens to serve on an Anti- Malaria Committee# The Progress of Anti Malaria work done can best be estimated by following the work of these Committees throughout the latter half of the year# The first meeting of the Anti Malaria was held at the Government hospital Manama on 11th July# In view of the prevalence of Malaria infection in Bahrain (60$ School children Infected) particularly in Manama, it was decided to commence Anti Malaria operations, in Manama in the first place# a# It was recongnlsed that shallow wells in compounds must b e removed and an alternative water supply provided* Mean time breeding was to be controlled in wells by putting fish in the wells - A hatchery for fish was established in Manama Municipal garden# b# Graining of stagnant water* The Committee were informed that attempts were being made to deal with swamps by means of vertical drainage# c# Irrigation ditches and drains in gardens - These are a prolific source of mosquito breeding - It was pointed out that all owners should keep their ditches clear, in good condition and properly graded# d# The necessity for affective Anti Malaria propaganda among the population was discussed and agreed up on# e# Funds for expenditure on malaria control were provided by a special grant under Public Health in the Budget of the Bahrain Government*- 2 - The second meeting of the Anti Malaria Committee was held on September 16th. The minutes of the last meeting were X V N read and approved* • The State Engineer then gave hia report* He said that experiments in vertical drainage of swamps had received some measures of success* He reported progress regarding the grouping of Artesian wells in Manama city t ^ as a trial measure four wells were linked up - The amount of water available from the four wells when t hey were linked up was approximately 23,000 gallons an hour i*e* 552,000 gallons per day* It was decided by the Committee that no dwelling should be more than 600 feet from a source of water supply, and that each terminal should be provided with wash houses with 6 taps each for men and women* b* The Dtate Medical Officer reported experiments made w regard to introducing fish into shallow domestic wells and recommended the filling- in of large swamps where vertical drainage had failed. He also proposed that an Anti-larval Squad be organised to clean drains, and distribute Oil and Paris Green. c* Three Sub-Committees, were formed e*g* Executive, Finance and Propaganda Committees to carry on special work* A third meeting of the Anti- Malaria Committee was held^cia December 14th.

We have nothing of importance to add except that very cordial relations have been maintained with the Ruler of Qatar. He has interfered exceptionally little with matters affecting the conduct of our operations and he undoubtedly takes the view that he is co-operating and facilitating operations to the best of his ability. His initial distrust of foreign Companies has been largely dispelled and it would appear that as regards relations with the locals conditions in Qatar a re so far very favourable to the expansion of the Co f s operations already planned and in hand and later the successive stages towards the hoped for commercial production.

Dear Sir, 1/ ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORTS We enclose a copy of a report which Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED Ehclos.2 MANAGER ACMDrilling . Drilling operations were continued at No. 1 well Dukhan; the well being drilled from 2,000 feet to 5,685 feet during the year. At the end of the year the well ras standing with casing cemented preparatory to the testing of promising oil showings in the lower portion of the hole. Staff . The number of British, American and locally engaged employees raried little during the year and consisted of 11 British and Americans and about 175 locally engaged. Transport . The Company^ M.L. Shahin was regularly employed on the carriage of mails, fresh vegetables and passengers between Bahrain and Zekhrit until December when the new M.L. Ghazal of 42 tons D.W. specially built in the United Kingdom for this service and use on the Trucial Coast, was put on the service. Other Launches and barges required for the transport of heavy materials and water from Bahrain have been hired locally. Water Supply . No further attempt was made during the year to obtain a supply of fresh water by drilling wells on the Qatar Peninsula since geological opinion rules out the possibility of any substantial supplies being available. All domestic water was, therefore, imported; approximately 325,000 gallons from Bombay and 150,000 gallons from Bahrain. Buildings . No additional buildings were erected during the year but general improvements were carried out including the installation of air conditioning equipment in the sleeping quarters and mess room of the Foreign staff. Health . The health of the staff was excellent considering the climatic conditions and the general lack of ready made amusements.Summary of Geological Work in Persian Gulf Areas in 1939. Oman and Dhofar and tha Trucial Coast . From Ist January 'bo 14th February Messrs* Thompson and Hotchkiss were engaged in completing the aerial surrey which had been begun in December 1938. The boundaries between the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms and the Sultan of Muscat’s territories not haring been defined, the whole of the work done on behalf of Petroleum Derelopment (Trucial Coast) Ltd., and Petroleum Derelopment (Oman and Dhofar) Ltd., is reported together. From 30th January to 6th February the party was in Marbat and did sufficient ground work to establish the stratigraphic succession in Dhofar. The remainder of the period was spent in aerial reconnaissance and systematic aerial photography. The following areas were covered by systematic flights during which oblique photographs were taken (a) From the main Oman Range westward to the Rub ’al Khali, as far south as Latitude 23° North-South flights at 5 -mile intervals with photographs every 10 miles. (b) From the meridian of Baraimi westward to the meridiem of Abu Dhabi. North-South flights at 30-mile intervals with photographs every 10 miles. (c) The Trucial Coast from Abu Dhabi to the southeast comer of the Qatar peninsula. East-West flights at 30-mile intervals with photographs every 10 miles on the northern flight only. (d) Dhofar. North-South flights at 30-mile intervals and an East-West flight along the face of the mountains. (e) A flight was made over the Persian Gulf islands north of the Trucial Coast. The following smaller areas were each covered by a mosaic of vertical photographs:- Jebel Fayah ” Aqdar ' Hafit ” Ebri M Hatmar A synclinal trough. On completion of the aerial photography, it was decided that a further programme of ground work could not be laid down until an examination of the phtographs had been made; and also until further negotiations had been carried out with the inland sheikhs. The party therefore left for Basrah on 14th February. For the winter season 1939-40 it was proposed that*- (a) A geological party should do a ground survey in any areas selected from the reconnaissance work which political negotiation had made accessible. (b) A geophysical party should carry out a gravimeter survey in Abu Dhabi and other areas west of the Oman Range. Owing to the war, these progranmes have been suspended. Qatar No further field geological work was done in 1939.«1? Z16 PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LTD. BAHRAIN PERSIAN GULF. DO/GAG.2/1853 OONFIDSNTIAL 25th February, 1940. Dear j. lo \ With reference to my No.PCr/0A^2/1850 dated 24th February 1940. It may interest you to know that the excellent relations with the Ruler described therein have been preserved in spite of the embarrassing and persistent attempts by the heir-apparent (Shaikh Hamed) to extract some personal benefit from all branches of the Go’s activities, which attempts so far have been parried with fair success and without apparently affecting personal relations adversely.

RULER OF BAHRAIN AND AL KHALIFAH FAMILY (i) On the 16th July 1939 His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin * Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.3.I., Ruler of Bahrain, left for India to spend the hot weather in Simla. During his absence a Council of Regency consisting of Shaikh Abdullah, His Highness* brother, Shaikh Salman, his son, and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government carried on the affairs of the State. His Highness had an interview with His Excellency the Viceroy in Simla and greatly enjoyed his visit. He returned to Bahrain on the 10th September 1939, very much improved in health. (ii) Shaikh Muharnmad bin ’Isa, brother of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, visited the United States of America where he was shown much courtesy, visiting the New York Exhibition as an honoured guest. This is the first time that a member of the Shaikhly family has visited the United States# (iii) Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad, nephew of His Highness completed his training at Nasik this year and was put in charge of the Police as Superintendent. BAHRAIN POLICE Police Strength on 1 st January 1939 31st December 1939 Indian Police Arab Police Followers 6 296 19 6 341 253 (Uo) Natura Strength on 1st January 1939 31st December 1939 81 70 54 54 135 124 It was decided last year that the Police force should be raised to 350 men; this strength has now almost been attained. A machine gun section and a motor bicycle section were under training in the latter part of the year, and since the beginning of the war the Police have been occupied with certain additional duties. These have unfortunately disclosed certain deficiencies in organisation and discipline which remain to be eliminated. Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammadc ompleted his training in India during the year and took over his duties as Superintendent of Police. Steps are being taken to improve the quality of the naturs. The men are subjected to a strict medical examination before enlistment and are put through a course on the rifle range. 5. LOCAL AFFAIRS Bahrain was prepared for the war, and the outbreak of war saw various schemes, which cannot be detailed here, put into operation at once. There was widespread satisfaction at the generous gift of £ 30,000 made by His Highness the Shaikh to His Majesty’s Government as a contribution towards war expenses. 6 . THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED (i) Mr. J.S. Black was the Company's Chief Local Representative for most of the year. He was called up in /- Manama Muharraq/ / - 4 - 4T / / in September last as a Naval Reserve Officer for duty at Basra, but was later released. During his absence Mr. M.H. Lipp acted for him. (ii) Mr. M.H. Lipp became Resident Manager during the year. » (iii) The total number of producing wells at the end of the year was 66, three of these being in the 'fourth pay' horizon. Total production for the year 1939 was 7,588,544 barrels of crude oil. Royalty paid to the Bahrain Government for the first half of 1939 was Rs. 15,49,278-12-8 and for the second half was Rs. 16,25,554-1-4. (iv) At the end of the year the Company’s employees numbered as follows :- British ... 192 Americans • •. 67 British Indians ... 374 Bahrainis ... 1878 Others •.. 399 (v) Refinery operating facilities were improved during the year by the addition of the following major units s- Polymerization plant New Oxygen plant Gas Oil Stripper Reformed Gasoline Lead Sulphide Plant Inhibitor Plant Altogether 12 tanks were added at the Refinery. The following refined products are exported *- Ethylized Gasoline Straight Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Oil Fuel Oil. (vi) Living and recreational facilities were consider ably improved during the year. (vii) During the early part of the year negotiations for the Unallotted Area continued between the Bahrain Government /-- 5 - Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and Petroleum Concessions Limited. After a careful consideration of the offers made by both Companies, His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, announced his intention of granting a Concession for the whole area, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 7. AGRICULTURE The long overdue report from the agricultural expert lent to the Bahrain Government by the Government of India was received in August, and proved to be almost entirely valueless. Captain A.C. Byard, the Assistant to the Adviser, was put in charge of the experimental garden at Budeya where green vegetable crops, potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar cane and lucerne are being grown with some success. Date disease was prevalent in gardens on the south-east coast. 8. CUSTOMS The customs revenue amounted to Rs. 10,56,532/- during the year as compared with Rs. 11,58,547 during 1938. The fall in total receipts was due solely to the drop in transit duty on shipments to the mainland, which amounted to Rs. 1,03,650/- as compared with Rs. 2,19,942 in the previous year. This results from the opening of a port at Ras Tanura and the consequent direct shipment of machinery to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 9. MUNICIPALIT IBS Manama Useful public works were carried out by the Munici pality including the construction of drains, the partial filling /-filling in of swamp on the South of Manama, the building of a new road and some metalling. The Municipality contri buted also to anti-malarial measures by oiling and draining stagnant water and irrigation ditches and drains in gardens. Muharraq The sea road from Muharraq pier to Busaitin was com pleted and a double line of shops was built on ground reclaimed near the pier. 10. PUBLIC WORKS The extension of the Manama Customs pier to reach deep water and a new Passport Office were completed, while both ends of the Manama-Muharraq causeway were extended preparatory to the installation of a swing bridge. The State Dispensary was completed, a new Rifle Range cons tructed and new garages for the Transport Department were erected. Aipong important works in progress at the close of the year were hospitals for both men and women (the latter approaching completion), the extension of the Technical School and the erection of a Tower and a wall in the Fort. The contractors for the swing-bridge to complete the Manama-Muharraq causeway were also making good progress in spite of difficulties in obtaining materials as t he result of the outbreak of war. 11. ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT A new H.T. transformer station was erected and equipped at Hu*aim, Manama, during 1939 to deal with the increased load in that area. 22 air conditioning units were in service during the summer eeason of 1939 - and more have been ordered to meet the demand in 1940. The /-The revenue of this Department amounted (in round figures) to Rs. 1,19,000/- as compared with Re. 1,03,000/- during 1938. Public demand having exceeded the potential supply of the Municipal ice plant permission was given to a local merchant, Hussain Ycteem, to install an ice plant for the manufacture and sale of ice. In spite of improvements made the electric supply is still far from satisfactory and rates for lighting are much too high. EDUCATION The following schools were in existence at the end of 1939 :- Bovs 1 Schools Teachers Students Manama 11 398 Muharraq 9 342 Hedd $ Suk al Khamis { Budeya Sitra 5 13 582 Technical School 3 17 Girls* Schools Manama 175 Muharraq 145 Hedd 65 During the year a new Girls* School was opened at Hedd, the third largest town in Bahrain. The Technical School was enlarged in order to admit more pupils and further expansion is under consideration. To the great satisfaction of the public, the Syrian Inspector of Schools was dismissed in March after 10 years service in Bahrain.JPNP (2)/- - 8 • Mr. C.H.L. Adrian-Vallance, then of the Iraq Education Department, visited Bahrain from the 12th to the 22nd June 1939, for the purpose of reporting on the Bahrain Educational organisation and of advising on its future growth. Later, in November 1939, Mr. Vallance was appointed Director of Education in Bahrain. 13. PEARLING INDUSTRY The catch was very good in quality but not large. Tisqam (advances paid to divers and pullers) was the same as last year, namely, Rs. 20/- for a diver and Rs. 15/- for a puller. The number of pearling boats during the year was 219 compared with 252 in 1938. A slight improvement in the Indian market followed the outbreak of war. One local (Arab) firm bought up pearls said to be worth Ks. 7^ lakhs and is now trying to sell them in Hyderabad. 14.

(v) In last year* s report mention was made of the visit of Major M.K. Afridi, I.M.S., and of his report on anti- malarial measures. After several months of inactivity on the part of the State Medical Department the initiative was supplied from the Agency and by the summer a beginning had been made on the real drive for the elimination of malaria from these Islands. A general committee was formed on which, apart from officials, prominent citizens were invited /-12 - &gt; ^ invited to serve; and executive, financial and propaganda sub-committees were formed. A supervisor and two insect- collectors were recruited with the aid of the Government of India and the volume of work accomplished at the end of the year was impressive. The extent of the work to be done may be judged by the fact that it involves the pro vision of a pipedfv/ater supply for the whole of Manama and the closing of several thousand shallow wells in private compounds, apart from extensive operations in gardens within the Manama Municipality and on its peri phery. There is a vast deal of prejudice and inertia to overcome and it must be recollected that the task affects tt* whole population in their homes and gardens; but there are at least signs that the people are beginning to realise that malaria is a preventable disease if all sections of the community co-operate. The work resolves itself into five main parts, the cleaning of all drains, pools and pits, the distribution of oil and paris green, the distribution of larvicidal fish, the inspection by insect-collectors of gardens, compounds and houses and the collection of adult mosqui toes, and the provision of a piped water supply in Manama. So far the work has been c onfined mainly to Manama town and its environs, but will be extended later to other parts of the Islands. (vi) A special feature of this year was the attention paid to the health of the school children. 21 . jusicbil The total number of civil suits in the Agency Courts was 861 as compared with 1101 in 1938.

Taking advantage of the situation, the Shaikh of Dubai made a surprise attack on Daira on the 29th March. During this attack Shaikh Hashar bin Rashid and his son Bati were killed, but Shaikh Mani bin Rashid and his brother Maktum fled to Sharjah after holding out for two days. Shaikhs Sa*id and Suhail Auwlad Bati also fled to Sharjah, where the party were joined by a number of their adherents who had been out in the desert. The question then arose what was to happen to the refugees whose presence in Sharjah, so close to Dubai, gave promise of continued disturbance. On the 2nd April the Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Dubai and had an interview with Shaikh Sa*id of Dubai on board H.M.S. 'Deptford'.

On the 14th October the brother and son of the Shaikh ox lubai put out the eyes of five persons who were accused of cdmplicity in a plot to secure the return of shaikh .ana to Dubai. This action caused a strong revulsion of feeling in Dubai against the Shaikh, and in order to take full advantage of the situation Shaikh Mana and his adherents returned from Hamasa to Sharjah territory where they began to collect a force in order to make an attack on Dubai. Up to the end of the year no attack had been made but there was considerable un easiness and unrest in Dubai town.
