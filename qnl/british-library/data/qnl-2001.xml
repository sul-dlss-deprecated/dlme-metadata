I enclose a bill for the pay of Simon, the Rest House cook at the rate of Rs. 60/- per month. This is the rate at which we paid him monthly but in addition when working for us at the Rest House he made a profit on the catering, which he was allowed to do. He came to see me today and pointed out that he was getting a good deal less than he used to make when at the Rest House. I think there is some justification for this statement. Actually when I wrote telling you that his pay was Rs. 60/- I did not take into consideration the amount which he made on the catering or the fact that he was at times allowed to do outside work. I have come to the conclusion that for the present our Rest House is unlikely to be required as no body seems to come here these days so if you would care to keep on Simon as a permanent cook you are welcome to do so. I understand however from him that he will ask for more than Rs. 60/- per month. E. B. Wakefield, Ssquire, I.C.S., H. B.

He has been in the Persian Gulf for over two years and is now being urgently posted to an important appointment in India. I heard confidentially from the Honourable the Political Resident a short while ago that Mr.Wakefield was going to be moved some time in the next few months, but the arrangements were then very indefinite and I wanted to wait for some more definite information before writing to Your Highness. I have now heard that Llr. Wakefield is to return to Bahrain on October 3rd. He will remain here for only a week or ten days and will then leave for his new appointment. I know that Your Highness will be as sorry as I shall to see him go but, thanks to God, his place is being taken by an old friend of Bahrain, ?.!aJor Hickinbotham.

I understand that they were not regarded as suitable for the Residency itself and were not required for any other house at Bushire. I put it to the Political Resident verbally that they should be acquired for the Consulate at Bandar Abbas as that building is woefully short of furniture. He a greed, but I shall be glad if you would kindly obtain his formal approval. The occasion on which I broached the matter with the Political Resident was my visit to Bushire in December last year. 3. I shall be glad if you would clear up the posititoi regarding this furniture. The cost of the furniture itself i have mentioned in a previous telegram from Bandar Abbas of which i have not the reference. I presume the Residency will also meet the cost of freight from Calcutta to Bushire «s. 243-14-0 paid by me. The account is enclosed in original. 4.
