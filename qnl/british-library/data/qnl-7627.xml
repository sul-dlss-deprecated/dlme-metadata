IN THE WINTER OP 1881-82, BY M. G. GERAKD, C.B., CAPTAIN AND BEEVET LIEUTENANT-COIONEL, 1 st CENTEAt INDIA HOESE. CALCUTTA: PRINTED BY THE SUPEE1NTENDENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA. 1883.« NOTES OF A JOURNEY THROUGH KURDISTAN IN THE WINTER OF 1881-82. To Busreh by British India Steam Navigation Company; fare, Rs. 323 for self from Bombay to Baghdad, and two followers from Kurrachi to Baghdad. Length of voyage, 12 days ;* touching at Kurrachi, * 15th to 27th November 1881. Bunder Abbas,^ Lingah, Bahrein, and Bushire. Weekly mail service; boats small, but comfortable. At the bar at Fao, mouth of Euphrates, there is 9 feet at low and 18 feet at high water. Soft mud bottom ; easily dredged. According to wind this limit may vary 1 foot to 1J feet. From Fao upwards both banks covered with date palms, planted in regular rows, with frequent irrigation cuts. This cultivated strip, 1 to 2 miles wide, then desert, is extremely valuable. All undulations cut away and banked, forming high raised roads, so that the whole can be irrigated at high tide, which fit Busreh, 80 miles above Fao, is 6 feet to 8 feet, with a four-mile current. In the intervals of the palms, wheat, vines, pomegranates, oranges, lemons, figs, cotton, &amp;c., are planted, but the dates are the staple of the country. August to September is their season, and each bale of dates (weight 50 okes = 1J maunds) is worth Rs. 3 J there. Some wheat is exported to India; green grass abundant. The date palms—no other timber here—supply firewood, beams, bridges, fish-weirs, and the matting of the country. All wells become brackish speedHy, and, in spite of the strong tide, river-water is only slightly brackish at flood and quite sweet at ebb tide, and is invariably drunk. Pever prevalent hereabouts. This narrow strip is practically impassable on account of canals, but can be easily turned by the desert. The entire system, both of irrigation and of the numerous fish-weirs, is based on the tidal rise, which seems rather to push back the fresh water to a higher level than to affect the nature of the river. The channel is broad, and navigation to Busreh, and indeed to 40 or 50 miles further, is easy for all vessels which can cross the bar. As far as Mohamreh, at junction of the Karun, the left bank of river is Persian territory; from above this point (24 miles below Busreh) both banks are Busreh, 30° 34' N., 47 51 East. territory. At Sabani, 10 miles down stream, a quarantine station was established under the orders of International Sani tary Congress. Proceedings, &amp;c., in French and Turkish. Ten days' detention ; Rs. 9 per head, whether remaining on board ship or in the Lazaret, and Rs. 32 il provided with separate room; Rs. for fumigation of each parcel. Neither doctor, medicines, nor sanitary arrangements provided; and so long as you pay, no questions are asked. This is imposed on arrivals from India under pretext that their arrivals from the Red Sea are not subjected to surveillance. ^ Arab villages and forts resemble those of Peshawar valley. Roads near river impassable lor horses; often bridged by single date trunks. A few black partridge, snipe, and duck hereabouts; but every Arab has a gun. The river is unsafe at night, and small boats with mails are not allowed to proceed after dark. Besides the weekly British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer, those of the opposition Persian line run every fourteen days, and a French Company, Sassoon'sCompany, and the British India, run monthly steamers via the Canal to Europe. Syud Rajab Nakabzada of Busreh, a young man who speaks English and is the son of one of the notables of district, called on me and took me out shooting, and by influence of Sheik Esau-ben-Curtas, I was released on 3rd from quarantine, and proceeded to Zoheir^ 10 miles south-west of Busreh, in the desert; the site of old Busreh and scene of great battle of 7th century, and death of the Mohamedan general of that name. Zobeir, 4th December 1881. The ancient city, or rather the mounds marking the spot, is a little to north-east of Zobeir, and extensively excavated for the sake of the bricks, somewhat resembling English fire-bricks. Zobeir is a walled town, about 2 miles in circumference, and settled 80 years ago by refugees from Nejd, fugi tives from Wahabi persecution. With some slight Turkish aid they repelled two attacks upon them, the latter 50 years since. Not a green thin» is visible. The ground hereabouts, 1 mile east of town, rises some 30 feet above alluvial plain bordering the ' Shat-el-Arab,' and is slightly gravelly. Water somewhat scanty from wells, and, though beautifully clear, slightly brackish. Population purely Arab ; no Turks visible, one or two indeed who were sent here having been ' found dead.' Some good houses, especially that of Abdalla- ben-Misheri. The richer men keep hawks, Persian, prices lis. 50 to Bs. 100, and hawk ubara and hares in the desert west of town. Zoiier, 5t/i December 1881. Starting at SJ A. m ., and returning in evening, a round of 20 miles; got ten ubara. Undulating, hard, dry, gravelly soil ; occasional patches of camel-thorn of 18 inches to 24 inches high. Only saw one small oasis, twenty wells, and a fort; clear but somewhat brackish water, 12 feet from surface. Worked by donkeys, in theusuallndian fashion ; 10 acres pumpkins and onions. Bemains of a large canal, 7 miles west of Zobeir, running towards a bold solitary hill to south-west, 6 hours ( = 18 or 20 miles) distant, called Jebel Zenam (camel-hump), where formerly a town, the capital of Songhera district, existed. The caravan road to Mecca via Nejd starts from Zobeir, whence it is called ten days to Nejd or Biad on camels, 10 to 12 hours per diem ; only two watering-places on road; to Mecca 20 days. Cold shammal wind; 34° Fahrenheit at sunrise. Arabs perfectly unpre judiced as to eating with Christians, and extremely civil. English popular, partly on account of suppression of piracy in Persian Gulf, and also as supposed cham pions of Islam, a reputation gained by the Crimea. Distances all in hours = 3^ miles. Occasional raids of Bedouins on cattle, and watchmen are kept in the minars to give alarm. When out hawking, besides weapons of sorts with the twenty horsemen with us, about a dozen breech-loading rifles were carried on riding-camels as an arsenal to fall back on, chiefly Bemingtons, one Soper, two Sniders, two *450 breech-loading revolvers. The Bemingtons are sent out by French Government, remains of 1871 contracts, and though import of arms is strictly prohibited by Turks and Busreh and vicinity. ^ as a Government monopoly by Persians, they are landed at the nominally Persian, but really semi-independent, town of Mohamera, where they are being sold with 250 cartridges at 35 krans = Bs. 17 each. Great numbers are said to be now in Arab hands, and, in spite of the attempted interference of the Persian governor of province with their sale, superior orders from Teheran for bade his interference. This unusual proceeding, together with the alleged fact of the present French Company here being maintained at a loss, seems noteworthy. Export of horses, also prohibited by Turks, is carried on through Mohamera, the intervening Zaptiehs being bribed, and the Persian Gov ernor, Sheikh Jubbar, levying a private tax of 60 to 70 krans per horse. There are four or five stables at Zobeir, where these horses are collected preparatory to embarkation. Prices here seem almost as dear as in Bombay. The old Sheikh Jubbar, who has just died, was very fond of English, and wished an English Company to establish steamers on the iTanm, 'which is navigable for about 20D miles. A war of succession is expected betwixt his son Mohamed, now in power, and his younger brother Tura, the popular favourite.T (H? 3 A general hatred of the Turks and desire of our friendship is, I think truth fully expressed. In Zobeir surdabs are found,—which are impossible in Busreh,from proximity of water to surface. In both towns the numerous coffee-houses are somewhat orientally conducted. Chance customers pay J piastre independently of what they drink, and better-known men merely give a present from time to time. In Arab towns like Zobeir, eases are investigated and adjudicated on, indiffer ently at any private house where the litigants and village Sheikh happen to meet, or in the public coffee-shop. All who wish have their say without the smallest interruption, all seem patiently listened to, and a slip of paper and seals being produced, the decision is there and then written out and done with, and all seem satisfied with this style of justice. All horses in Arabia and Persia are shod with the round flat plate, six nails very close together in centre of quarters. Bad and clumsy work, but better than it looks. Scarcely ever saw a horse lamed; and toes are so much more pared than done by us that Arabs here seldom stumble. Great carelessness as to feeding and watering horses is evinced. When out for twelve hours no attempt to feed or even water was made. The present town of Busreh is much contracted in size, and a large belt of Busi , eh&lt; gardens now stands betwixt the old fortifications and the present city, untenanted since the great plague of 1832. Town wall ruinous, gates gone, and the few guns on bastions almost dismounted. In spring the plain to the west is covered with water, 2 feet to 3 feet deep for some miles, and crossed by boats. The Turkish lira, = 18s. 4^., is supposed to contain 100 piastres, but here = 115. Hate of exchange I rupee = lOJ piastres, but at Custom House and Quarantine 9J piastres. 1 piastre = 14 kamari = IJ annas. In fact, both here, where there are a few gold coins, very rare, and in Persia, where there are nominally gold tomauns, but which are really non-obtainable at any price, the Indian rupee is depreciated quite as much as it is in exchange on England, and a corresponding loss incurred by India; 1 oke = 2J lbs. (about). Best mutton, 7 kamari per oke; beef, 6; fowl, 4 piastres; duck, 6 piastres. The Governor, Muyur Pasha, is now absent at Baghdad, and Effendi Ismail is acting. Commodore Mehmet Bey is chief naval officer, with two gun-boats and some launches. Her Majesty's steamer Woodlark now here; one of the Persian squadron in turn being generally up ; and is anchored just off our Con sulate, which is on right bank, just below the Custom House. Most of the Re gulars now absent against the Montafik Arabs, who, it is rumoured, are on the point of submitting, and who very nearly had the best of it. They inhabit the Jazira district, betwixt the Tigris and Euphrates, to the south of latitude 33° N., and after being defeated crossed to the desert to west of the Euphrates, where they are beyond pursuit. Izzet Pasha, Commander of the Vlth Army Corps, was unable to take the field with more than 2,500 men; one night attack was attempted, some thousand camels being driven in advance by the Arabs, but, as these broke back when the guns opened, the Eegulars had an easy victory. Some correspondence with leading merchants of the province was captured, the 'shishan ' seed alluded to therein being supposed to mean breech-loading cartridges. The Regulars here have extremely neat but ragged dark-blue, yellow-braided Zouave uniform, and the Martini-Peabody, with solid metal cartridge, 40 of which are carried a la cherkesse in waist-belt. When going into action two more of these are worn en bandouliere across the shoulders, or 120 rounds in all. Rifles dirty but serviceable, and the men, many of whom are Kurds, are of a splendid stamp. They get 6 beshliks per mensem and all rations found, but are sixteen months in arrears. The Zaptiehs here, often Persians or Beluchis, have light-blue, white-braided Zouave dress; still more dilapidated muzzle-loading Enfields and sword-bayonets. They get 1 lb. flour per diem and 16 to 20 beshliks per mensem, but are 32 months in arrears. A beshlik is now worth about 7^ annas; so nominal pay is Rs. 7 to Rs. 9. There are now two river steamers. Lynch and Go's., and six Turkish, the former plying weekly and the latter at most irregular intervals, betwixt Busreh and Baghdad. The Khalifa of former Company, the largest on river, is of 350 registered tonnage, and carries 460 tons cargo, counting 14 passengers per ton,4 125 horse-power, paddle, independent engines; with full load draws 5 feet 6 inches, but ordinarily 4 feet, water. Low freeboard and raised hurricane deck. The smallest of Turkish steamers is about 160 tons and steams 3 knots. Coal is used as fuel by the English, and wood chiefly by Turkish, company steamers. Vessels of 15 feet draft can go about 15 miles above Kurnah (junction of Tigris and Euphrates), said to be the Garden of Eden. Above this shifting sand-banks, and in the dry season, August-September, vessels continually stick and must be unloaded to float again. Guard of 12 soldiers sent with each since July 18S0, when Arabs opened fire on Khalifa, driving men from wheel, and, but for gallantry of the captain (Clements), who was severely wounded, the steamer must have gone ashore and been plundered. From 8th December to 12th December 1831. From Bdseeh to Baghdad. Twenty miles above Busreh dates cease. At Kurnah, thirty miles above this point, is Kyvan's tomb, a wonderful place of Jewish pilgrimage. Here the river is very narrow, barely 100 yards wide, and deep, enormous marshes, extending for 30 miles to the east, and the banks almost flush with water. Erom here for the next 200 miles nearly the country is a bleak plain, diversi fied by occasional reed marshes and dotted with reed-walled Arab huts. Lots of buffaloes, sheep, and goats. A fair lot of native craft, chiefly towed by lines from the mast-head, and taking about 25 days to 40 on the up-journey to Baghdad, dependent on a single or double set of trackers. The youth of both sexes pervade the bank all but naked, clamorous for hucksheesh. The crew of steamers are Chaldean Christians, called ' Mossulees,'—magnificent physique, though clumsy build, and said to be sadly deficient in pluck. Native craft are reckoned to make but four voyages annually to and fro , _ 10 „ from Busreh to Baghdad, the distance by water Amara, 4/ 5^,31 5o N. about 520 m - les# a UCW -founded station, 1861, now has 1,000 Kegulars and a Governor, who was establishing posts betwixt here and Kurnah to check the somewhat troublesome Arabs. It was characteristic of the country that he did not possess any map of his district and sent to borrow one of mine. 10th December 1881. From Busreh to Baghdad. At about 46° 20' E., 32° 35' N., river approaches to about 35 miles from the chain of mountains forming Persian frontier, called c&lt; 6 hours ' distant. Banks rise to about 15 feet and command steamer. Arabs and some Kurds hereabouts friendly; large herds of horses. Soil good, but cultivation scanty. All Sheikhs said to be much in arrears of revenue through bad harvest. Bevenue levied according to extent of land occupied, irrespective of crops. Eresh snow on mountains. Biver about 250 yards in width but full of sand-banks, and perpetual soundings required till Baghdad. Horses used for ploughing here. 10th December 1881. Kut, 45° 50' E., 32° 33' N. 11th December 1881. 45° 0'E., 32° 50' N. 12th December 1881. Baghdad, 44° 25' E., 33° 28' N. Kuli Khan, chief of the Luri Kurds, nominally a Persian subject, is the most powerful man of these parts. Mr. Wartmann, a Swiss merchant of Baghdad, is said to be a great ally^of his and could give introductions. Arrived at ' Kut' about 7 p.m . It was close to this where the recent fight with the Montafik tribe had taken place. Kamianah, about noon, curious loop in river; regular ' Kadir country ' less the large trees. Width 400 yards, but sand-banks plenty. Lots of wild pi^ visible on banks. Touched ground several times; landed at Consulate, which is a little below the Custom House, along with the mail-bags with my rifles; was intercepted by a Custom House official in a mash oof, whom a dozen rupees5 squared.

Was hospitably received by the Consul, who, in these countries, has invariably to exercise hospitality to all travellers of his country. The present Wali, Takht-ud-din, 70 years of age, is a Turk of the old school and somewhat fanatical. Baghdad, on the two banks of the Tigris, here 300 yards broad, is said to have about 160,000 inhabitants. Save a narrow belt of culti vation and palms on the edge of water, the desert comes up to the walls. On the right bank the suburb is defenceless ; on the left, which contains the prin cipal buildings and two-thirds of the town, and which is connected with the f ur- ^ m „ „ . ther side by a bridgef of 24 boats, was formerly a line all these briV^s of'boats!^ eV1 a defence. This consisted of rampart with brick scarp of 25 feet to 30 feet; dry ditch about 75 feet by 15 feet, unrivetted counterscarp and a glacis, too steep to be properly covered from rampart. As Midhat Pasha removed all the bricks for the construction of barracks, the fortifications now consist of little more than a couple of ridges of earth, separated by the ditch, crossed everywhere by footpaths, with the glacis affording as good cover to an assailant as the remains of the rampart to the defenders. The desert, extending up to the walls, of almost the entire perimeter, gives no cover to an assailant and is liable to floods in February and April. Long covered bazdrs, numberless coffee-houses, a few semi-European shops, a tramway on the right bank to Kayumane, and the mixture of Kurds, Arabs, Turkish officials, Circassians and Persians, makes the town, though dirty, picturesque. About 20 Europeans of sorts, besides English, French, Russian, and Persian Consuls, form the society of the place. There is a large French church, convent and school, but the chief part of their congregation are Armenians or other Native Christians. Izzet Pasha, an able-looking man of about 40, commands the Vlth Army Corps and troops here, which, after deducting 2,000 men at Nishangat and Shaha in the Montafik country, do not seem to number more than 2,000 of all arms on the spot. Nawab-ud-Dowlah, of Oudh, who resides here, is a man of great influence and most hospitable to English visitors. 19th December 1881. B aghdad to H illah. Unable to find horses yet at reasonable prices, and desirous of keeping up my role of a traveller visiting ruins, &amp;c., hired two mules and ponies at Re. 1 each per diem, and started for Babylon, due south, on right bank. At about 3 miles bridge of seven boats over creek from Hur swamp, soon after which leave bank of river and strike through desert. Line of telegraph follows track. About 7 miles pass ruined Khan-i-Chakur on left. Mound ' Abbu Habba,' where numbers of ancient tablets are now being disinterred, visible to right, 4 miles, and Babylonian Tower ' Akr Kuf,' 10 miles to north-west. Plain hence to Khan-Mal-i-Mushraki, 14 miles from Baghdad, covered with stunted shrubs, resembling withered heath. At 12J miles ruined well on right. Khan-Mal-i- Mushraki deserted, but northern enclosure, 80 by 80 yards, in good repair, with iron plated gate. One description applies to all khans on this road; brick, 80 by 80 yards, outer walls 25 feet high, loop-holed parapet. An inner wall, 35 feet distant, is, as well as the outer, formed in a series of arches, as a counter-arched revetment in a fortification, leaving about 14 alcoves of 10 by 10 feet along each face ; the floor of these is raised 5 feet from the ground, and a couple of stables to tie up horses is the whole furniture of the place. A covered-in passage of about 15 feet wide for animals in cold weather is thus left, the alcoves always facing i Only private room is occasionally Centre of SC l Uar «- . Fo , U , r ^ised Open platforms, an one over gateway, generally filthily upper room, J and raised look-out place over gate com- dirt y- plete the building. No charge made for travellers. Dates, bread, pomegranates, oranges, and coffee procurable. bTo west-south-west, 4 miles, square tower-like ruin. Onwards to Klian-i- Handodra ; no vegetation; loose sand, strewn with small fragments of brick and pottery. Almost the entire distance this continues; not a mound but is the re mains of some irrigation channel or the debris of a village. AtMandodra a little cultivation; thirty huts and a post of Zaptiehs; two small irrigation channels with water and small bridge. One or two Arab camps near. At 24 miles Khan-i-bir, deserted, but in fair order, and disused well. Hence to Sekundria, 30 miles, little or no vegetation, and from 20 to 28 miles there is one mass of debris of former habitations. All mounds are simply heaps of brick and potsherd, both glazed and common. All canals long since disused, and apparently made originally with beds raised 6 feet or more over level of country. This was easy, as, at the latitude of Baghdad, the level of Euphrates over Tigris is about 30 feet. Though the ground is so flat, still the low canal mounds bound the view to a mile or two in any direction, and mirage still further limits even this. Though sandy, the soil is tolerably firm, and not bad marching ground. lOth December 18S1. Sekundria, small village, large khan, with three courts. A canal, 30 by 15 feet, in good repair and impassable for cavalry, is immediately on south of village and spanned by brick bridge. Road via Museyh to Kerbela here diverges to south-west. Cross sandy plain; some small irrigation channels at 33 miles. * Bridge of boats, is miles from Khan-i-hasma miles to the left, at 38 miles culti- Kerbeia ; s.ooo inhabitants. At this yation, and coarse grass, boggy after rain; 40 miles, oniyVorferiy, tried three ruined water-courses, ground hard, plenty to stop and levelled at us, but, on our of camel-thorn, and two Arab camps. Up to cntZ ZSw'kSwria o2 44 miles skirting water-course and cultivation, palm 20th, after we passed. groves of Museyh* and other villages, 4 to 6 miles to right, marking course of Euphrates, almost parallel to which the track runs. On to Khan-i-Mohamil, 46 miles, sandy and bare; J mile before reaching this, join branch road to Baghdad via Khan-i-hatwa, and line of telegraph, which was left a mile to north of Sekundria, and cross an 8-feet water-cut by bridge. A few huts and Zaptiehs, and supplies limited. Just beyond large, deep canal in good order, brick bridge. tJpto47 miles several embankments, one wooden bridge over irrigation cut winding between them. Large palm grove of Mohamil, 4 miles east. Hence to Hillah, 62 miles, is one mass of debris of Babylon. At 49 miles mound recently exca- 1 3 on ' vated for British Museum. Line of telegraph slightly to left (east) and coincident with road. About 51 miles canal, brick bridge—water. Palms and village 1 mile west. About 54 miles cross old em bankments and mounds, apparently old ramparts to east, and 56 miles two brick bridges, latter over a very large canal, 40 by 20 feet. To north-west of this point is the Mujeliht, ancient citadel of Babylon, about 200 by 200 yards and 100 feet high. It is J mile from Euphrates to its south-west. Hence to 59 miles are masses of ruins, merely resembling gigantic ash-heaps and village of Babyle. These are mere masses of brick, chiefly unburned, and fragments of pottery; and neither the gardens of Semiramis nor the Kasr, Alexander's Palace, are traceable, save by conjecture. The celebrated Babylonian bricks, of excel lent finish and each bearing Nebuchednazzar's name and titles in cuneiform character, have for centuries been carried off for the construction of neighbour ing cities. At 60 miles enter lanes betwixt walled date gardens, and, after passing some obsolete and one used canal, with brick bridge, about 60 miles, reach banks of Euphrates, and after traversing more cultivated date gardens reach Hillah, 62 miles, and passing a short covered bazar cross river by bridge of 15 boats to main town on right bank. Eiver here 90 yards wide. 21st December 1881. H illah, 44° 28' E., 32° 28' N. Hillah, Governor Suleiman Pasha, in the Baghdad Vilayat, contains 13,000 inhabitants and has as garrison one battalion and one cavalry regiment, about 700 men all told; good, covered bazars. At 1 mile north telegraph wire diverges to Kerbela, 25 miles north-west. Heavy rain at night. LeaveT v~ town by south-west; just outside road divides, that to Tamaria due west- south-west, 4 miles; that to Birs Nimroud (Tower of Babel), which is visible 8 miles as crow flies, diverging to the south, the Shat-el-IIindia marshes intervening. Large heaps of debris and two bridges (brick) crossed on leaving town, whose walls are ruinous. To north-west, open bare plain. Palm gardens skirting the river run almost due south, whilst plain, across which runs the Birs Nimroud road, is open and to a great extent cultivated. At 6 miles ridge* east to west, which keep about half mile » Composed o e ns. on . se y era j irrigation cuts now dug, and road turns due west, between the hill of debris on south and shores of Lakef Hindia on north. At about 9 miles reach Bi?'s Nimroudt y Covered witn pciiccins Oiiicl wild' Tv/r *1 i -i-i^ p i-i^* 'l. f ow j Mound 4' milG round at base, llo teGt nigh by X Tower of Babel. . aneroid. On summit well-built brick ruin, 35 by 20 by 12 feet, riven from top to bottom by lightning. Numerous holes 6 by 6 inches, similar to scaffolding ones, pierce it both lengthwise and cross wise. Some large masses of brick, resembling, till closely inspected, boulders of rock, lie about. These have been cemented with bitumen in lieu of mortar, and have evidently experienced the action of a tremendous fire, the layers being frizzled round by its force. A great portion of east face of mound has been excavated by the British Museum; everywhere brick buildings and passages, but few objects of interest being unearthed. To east, another large mound of brick and pottery, about 80 feet high and a mile in circumference, upon which a sort of mosque, called Abraham's tomb, rises, is the most marked feature, but a somewhat lower ridge of debris extends for miles east, apparently to the river, which is marked by its border of palms. According to Herodotus and others, JBirs Nimroud must have been the south-west corner of Babylon. Some consider it as the Temple of Belus; others as a mere look-out tower. It commands a most extensive view across the Hindia Lake to Kerbela on the north; on the west numerous Arab camps; the Hindia canal, 3 miles, covered with white sails, and red sand desert to the horizon. To south, Tshifil, 175°, 12 miles, is clearly visible, and Meshed Ali, 150°, indistinctly; plain, liable to inundation, to south. As before stated, ruins of Babylon are mere ash-heaps. Gardens of Semiramis are but 60 feet above river. One well-preserved frag ment of the Kasr is visible; here Alexander the Great was seized with his last illness, and opposite this, on right bank, he died. Bab}lon ' Close to this is the Babylonian Lion, on its side, at bottom of a hollow, being too heavy to move. For centuries the whole place has been burrowed for the sake of the bricks, and are now further being exca vated on behalf of the British Museum, which allows £5,000 per annum for researches in these parts. Little save brick w T alls and mortuary urns have so far come to light. To the north, the Mujelibe (overturned), also largely exca vated, shows that it is artificial, though from its size resembling a natural hill. Numerous wells, in spite of its proximity to the river, prove it to have been a fortress. The lines of ramparts, as described by Herodotus and Xenophon, are quite untraceable. On the whole the road is good for troops, though most of smaller bridges are unfit for artillery, as also the bridges of boats. Near Hillah, where canals are in working order and more frequent, the larger ones can only be crossed by cavalry where bridges or paths exist. Otherwise it is easy-going. ^ A fair amount of supplies procurable along the river-banks. The most noticeable feature throughout is, that for half the entire 70 miles from Baghdad to Birs Nimroud, you are traversing apparently the sites of habitations, and that every single feature in the topography is purely artificial, either ruins of canals or debris of buildings. About one and a half miles north of Khan-i-Bir you cross position of Per- sian right wing at battle of Cunaxa. Bought three horses from soldiers (probably looted) for Rs. 445, and hired four mules at He. 1 each daily, and servant for Rs. 25 per mensem. Left Baghdad by south gate, 9 a.m ., for one mile through walled date gardens; tw r elve shallow, raised water channels, ctesiphon. wooden bridges. General direction south-east, at little distance from cultivation, and small villages on bank of Tigris direct to left. About 9 miles cross by ferry the Dyala river, 60 yards wide and navigable,8 at 400 yards from its junction with Tigris. Fare half kran per horse. Tak-i- Khusm clearly visible 160°; thence to Ctesiphon barren scrub jungle. Lari^e fort-like mounds Smiles east. Just before reaching Ctesiphon hit bank of river which forms a wide loop enclosing it, and the neck of which shows lines of old fortifications. _ Quarter mile from arch is the Sulieman Pak Musjid, Mahomed's barber, by which name the place is best known by the Arabs. Arch about 85 by 130 feet high, and hall 170 feet long. Ruined mounds all about, but save one tomb half mile to south-west, and a powder factory on river, no other buildings standing. Large herds of camels and sheep about, and, judging from armaments and vigilance of their watchers, require a good deal of looking after. Many marks of pig and perfect pig-sticking ground here. Ruins of Seluccia, mere mound; to west and north-west across river, on right bank, left bein'- about 1,000 yards from arch. Passengers can be landed, walk across neck and visit arch in time steamer takes to go round the loop. Rather a scene here on 28th December—Shah's birthday-—when all officials attend in full uniform at Persian Consulate to .offer congratulations, the Vali only sending his dragoman, whom the Persian Consul most politely said he was happy to see as a friend, but whose visit in lieu of the Vali's he considered as a slight on his master, consequence being that all civil officials absented themselves from the big dinner given in evening. 1st January 1882, Baghdad to Jedidah. 9-30 a.m. to 3-45 p.m. General Direction—north, 18 miles.

Most of ground in to-day's march cultivated, and supplies should be abundant, and various other lines of road available. But for irrigation, no difficulty. 3rd January 1882. From 4 a.m . to 5 p.m. From Zedaidah to Deli Abbas. General Direction—north-east, 33 miles. Hoar frost at night. Devious road on account of irrigation for 3 miles. Cross two large canals close together, brick bridges, and fortified post of Zaptiehs. Villages Issandria and Jengem Shayan to north-east, 3 miles ; large village Dalhama to south-east. At 4 miles direct road to Kerkuk diverges; no supplies ; a few miles desert, and about 10 miles cultivation, again undulat ing ground with camel-thorn; about 16 miles ruined fort of Tamila and better cultivation. One or two boggy places on road; 19 miles bank of deep stream, 20 yards wide, Gobunga, really a branch of Dyala. Hence road skirts stream closely to Deli Ahhas, passing at 23 miles cemetery and village of Mahomed Seraya on right bank, 25 miles; Sarayo on left bank, gardens for half mile, and Sigari on left bank. Hence barren ground, camel-thorn, numerous deep water- cuts with very narrow bridges. Several Arab camps. Lots of sheep. Twenty- eight miles. Imam Syed Mahomed ; river bends and road turns due east; 29 miles. Imam Argabi. Small white dome. Two camps of Abu Mamal and Abuoorah Arabs; 33 miles. Deli Abbas, 70 houses, post of Zaptiehs, two-arched brick bridge, damaged, but passable for field guns; khan dirty. Low range of hills to east, and no signs of habitations there or to north ; o - r . o , xt several palm-groves to south. Kiver here 30 yards Deh Abbas, 44 o3 , 34 4 . w ^ e ^ second road vid Bakuba to Baghdad exists, and other tracks could doubtless be found through intermediate country, which seems fertile and full of supplies, though the water-cuts offer certain difficulties to troops marching. Lots of wildfowl and sand-grouse along road. The main post road to Anatolia via Mosul and Diarbekir passes by this line, as does the telegraph. Mails travel at a walk with escort of Zaptiehs. Post horses can be hired, and travellers accompany the mails, about 50 or 60 miles a day. No traveller is supposed to move without a bayaruldy, or passport, and one or more Zaptiehs attached to him, for whom he is supposed to provide food and give 1 kran each a day. 4th Jmmary 1882. 6-15 a.m . to 3 p.m. Deli Abaas to Kara Tepe. General Direction—north. Slight frost, daylight at 6-30. After few fields desert, with marshes to west, and range of hills 4 miles east; 6 miles, enter hills, and find sandstone rock; 8 miles, hills close in on road. At 9 miles turn corner on to Suenna ; post of Zaptiehs fortified. From Deli Abbas on to the Zab on north and Persian frontier on east, the roads are unsafe, and country almost deserted on account of Hamawand and Jaf marauders. Here the Mosul Vilayat begins. Two Zaptiehs accompanied me from this, who scouted very well. From here to 14 miles road winds through low undulating spurs of the Narin range, parallel to its crest till the last J m il e » when it turns to the right (east), and ascends to summit, 600 feet above sea. Near this the telegraph, which had been left about 4 hours before Deli Abbas, again joins into line of road. Range not rocky, though some little sandstone shows itself, and chiefly water-worn gravel. On a very small scale this resembles the Subabund Pass on its east face. Descent easy; guns might cross with very little labour. Sixteen miles regain plain, whence Kara Tepe, 10 miles north, is visible. A similar parallel range closes the view about 10 miles east, a few snow-peaks showing faintly beyond ; the whole valley apparently deserted. This tract of country has an evil repute, and is greatly feared by travellers. Twenty-one miles cross Narrin river by brick bridge, five arches, near which is walled enclosure and 20 houses. Bed offl 10 river, which flows south, is 25 feet deep, but had little water. Thence across a flat, open, partially cultivated and very muddy plain to Kara Tape, 28 miles. About 100 houses, dilapidated khan, and Yuzbashi with 40 Zaptiehs. K ara T epe , 44° 55' E., 34° 25' N. Abdur Rahman Aziz, Aga, the Yuzbashi, insisting on spending the evening with me, described state of affairs as lamentable. Had udw 80 Zaptiehs to keep open road, collect taxes, &amp;c., from Deli Abbas to Kifri, where before the 1877 war they had 1,000. His men without pay for four years; no induce ments to men to risk themselves on duty; no inducement for villagers to make one penny more than needful for existence; the Hamawands masters of whole country, and road from Kifri to Sulimania closed even for Zaptiehs. The Hamawand Kurds inhabiting district about Tschemschemel, in the Hamawands. triangle between Kerkuk, Kifri, and Sulimania, though only numbering about 1,000 horsemen, are noted and daring marauders, and now armed with Martinis, well mounted and recruited by all the deserters, &amp;c., of country, hold the whole district in terror. About 13 years since they were put down a la Turc by Takht-ud-din, the prisoners being shod with red-hot horse-shoes. They are subdivided into following sections, dwelling at Bazian, Kara Hassan, Dirhand, and Tschemschemel: (1) Hamawands; Sheiks —Taki-bin-kadr, Joamir, and Hamad-bin-Mama Suliman; (2) Setawasar; Sheikhs —Bairam-bin-obin and brother ; (3) Eashmad ; Kaka Saka and Salim; (4) Suframad; Sheikh —Amid-bin-kala Paya. Up to 1879 they were quiet then, partly (it is said) from intrigues of the Pasha to raise an excuse for uniting the Boghdadand Mosul Vilayats, partly to supposed orders of Sheikh Obeidallah. They began to move. Camped for long at Shithan, Persian territory, plunder ing from Kasrto Karmanshah. Shahraban was blockaded for six days, and Serpit, 8 hours from it, plundered last year. In July 1880 they entered Zohab, also plundered near Kerkuk and Shergkhan (Persian territory) ; twice robbed Bagh dad and Kermanshah caravans, and others at Salahia, Altyn Kopru, and Kafar. In June 1881 camped on Diala in Persian territory, were intercepted by troops from Baghdad and Sulimania (after being defeated by Persians at Beni'Kudra) at Gulamber. Hard pressed by the Suiimania detachment. Turkish ammu nition ran short, and, as their reserve boxes were found filled with stones (sold by their colonel), result was, defeat of the Regulars. Shortly after they made terms; Sheikh Takih Kadir, Joamir, &amp;c. Terms—{!), Surrender breech-load ing arms; (2) restoration of property of Postal Department plundered; (3) peaceful settlement on lands assigned. £2,000 in gold had been carried off from the post, a Yuzbashi and 10 Zaptiehs, out of an escort of 50, having on one occasion fallen. The tribe is but of 300 families; not a man was punished. lor two j'ears this one tribe kept two Turkish and one Persian province in alarm, undoubtedly from collusion with Pasha of district. Mahomed Pasha of Sulimania, now Governor of Kerbela, offered with his local influence to stamp out the tribe in two months if allowed, but, thanks to Turkish jealousy, was not permitted to try. Owing to complaints of breach of faith on part of Turks, a caravan was looted by the Hamawands in October last near Kerkuk, and roads again declared unsafe. In 1877 all these tribes got hold of Martinis, either as auxihaiies of, oi deserters fiom, the lurkish army, and what between recappin 17 * old cases, cartridges smuggled in by merchants, and chiefly from sale from Arms.

General Direction—north, 22 miles. Skirt vineyards in starting, the first seen ; clear, bright, running water rills. Undulating, gravelly downs; lovely grazing ground; lots of sheep at one camp. The Yuzbashi with a miscellaneous pack of 25 Zaptiehs escorted me. These were armed with Martinis and Winchesters. About 5 miles after descending and crossing hollow, whence a road diverges half left to Kerkuk, cross lidge about 150 teet high, and descend to ChiTYidYi ' lv.opri,' which cross by brick bridge, two arches; stream 18 yards wide, muddy, reedy and sluggish ; flows west. IJ miles further on cross the Tschitchand. Brick bridge, three arches, almost dry ; bank 15 feet and steep ; three miles further, three Arab villages right and left of road. Zerdan, and dry shingly bed of Kifri stream, 200 yards wide, and village of Timshan, with white imam, at foot of hills to right; 15 miles gradual ascent for 2 miles of down-like hill, flattish top. At 20 miles crest, whence Kifri is visible two miles further, in a valley, with a few vineyards and gardens around, backed on the north by a picturesque range of white quartz, 350 feet high. Cross level and partially cultivated plain to town.

Called on the Kaimakam (Civil Governor) in evening, name Abdul Aziz, a most favourable specimen of a Turk ; speaks a little Persian. Put up at Mr. Stanno's agent, from whom I had letters ior Sulimania, Howanduz and Choi Sandjak, and had regular levee in evening. This department, Mamuli Sithay, or ' six contributions,' , tobacco, salt, &amp;c., pledged by the Porte to Galatea bankers, is watched by Mr. Stanno on behalf of the mortgagees.^ My host, by name Mahomed Effendi, extremely civil, but, after the fashion of the country, I had to put up in his best room, where I had to hold a levee of all his friends till late in the even ing, and had my first experience of dinner a la Turc, squatted on your heels, and eating with fingers. Turkish hospitality hereabout is always the same. You are installed in the best apartment, a sort of durbar-room with low divan and cushions at one end, and Kurdish rugs down centre. Coffee excellent, but without sugar or milk, is handed round, almost as soon as you alight; and, by way of doing you honour, your host, his relations and friends, swarm in and squat, smoking cigarettes, around the apartment, till you give a hint you want to sleep. The dinners also closely resemble each other. Mutton broth, kabobs, fried fish, pillao, pease pudding, some kinds of sprouts (wild), sweets, and two huge bowls of sherbet and sour milk, which you wash down the repast with, from two large wooden ladles. Country-bread somewhat resem bling coarse chupatties, though in Kurdistan generally much finer and thinner, much resembling Scotch £t scones/' A Chaosh of Regulars, amongst others, attended the levee. A most smart soldiery man, speaks Persian, says he and his comrade are 55 months in arrear of pay; rations generally deficient, and * Though his term of service had uniform, till quite recently, in rags.

Walked up Char Sowar Hill, 200 feet above town, in evening, had a talk with two friendly Syeds I met there, one of whom, having been to Muscat, was regarded as a great traveller. They belong to Sulimania, but say the road thither, which leads over a succession of sharp, rugged hills, backed by the Kara Dagh range, is both bad and unused, as well from physical obstacles as from the predatory nature of the inhabitants, Jafs and Hamawands. Good view of town, road back the Doazdeh Imam to south-east and Jebel Kurra range, 12 or 15 miles south-west. Beautiful clear streams of water run through the bazars. Turkish soldiers chiefly spend their time in playing a sort of rounders and backgammon; several good caravan-serais in town.12 7ih January 1882. 6-15 a.m . to 2-15 p.m. From Kifri to Tuzchuumatu. General Direction—west by north, 24 miles. Started 6-20, with Salar Iffendi and his two followers, armed with Winches ters, five Zaptiehs, similarly armed, and joined on to a caravan of donkeys, even the drivers of which had Snider Springfields.

Up to 17 miles neither flocks nor cultivation, and road as before. Thence cultivation to left, where telegraph wire again joins line road, and bear more to north about 23 miles, reaching banks of Tuzchurmatu chai, mile wide; gravelly bed, but little water, most being diverted for agriculture. Thence, after crossing three water-cuts, enter Tuzchur matu at 24 miles. Quartz range still continues on north-east; Multazat Ali, about 900 feet, over road just above village, being the most noticeable peak therein. Plain to left well cultivated, and a long line of water-mills visible. Salt mine said to exist near peak above mentioned. Taodia, small conical hill, with 200 houses, and reputed mineral springs, 6 miles to south-west. One branch of telegraph runs thither. The whole march easy for all arms, but water scarce. Tuzchurmatu, 44° 40' E., 34° 63' Splendid grass land up to Jebel Hamrim range, about 15 miles westwards, indistinct from mirage. A second wire runs up gorge of river. One small covered bazar; 300 houses, 100 regulars, and 30 Zaptiehs. Put up in house of villager. Olives here. Get ting out of the region of palms, only a few scraggy ones now seen. 8f/t January 1883. 6-15 a.m . to 1-15 P .m. From Tuzchurmatu to Taok. General Direction—north by west, 21 miles. Marched 6-20. Same party as yesterday. Skirt a few gardens to left and for first 2J miles a little cultivation. About 3 miles two villages, Ab- bushabha 1J miles on left. About 5 miles quartz range on right gradu ally subsides into low undulations, flocks of sheep, and approaches road t Behind these Paima Godrun, a at nulla called Kimtizza. The Salahi and Ghillehf snow peak over Suiimania, visible. ranges parallel, about 10 miles to right; undulating grass downs intervening. On left open plain. Abu Abed Arabs up to the Jebel Hamrim and further north. Maksulranges, through which flows the Tigris. Several fort-like mounds, and village Ablakalas on plain, but all indistinct from mirage. About 8 miles Karez and Dughed Koorutschai. Eor next 8 or 9 miles ground more undulating, cross numerous nullas running west; villages Zau, Kerkuk, Istagar, and fort-like mound 4 miles west, and an Arab cam}) to right. To this side villages of Shoran, Kurkanum, and Ach Mirshed and Kir Gudroon lie in low hills, the chief peaks of which are Jebel Kurra and Nahsool. At 19 miles cross water-cut, mill, and reach dry bed almost of Taokschai, about f mile wide, gravel. Two ranges of quartz of about 500 feet called Shoramat, running north-west, are about 3 miles to west of road here, T k 44° 27' E 35° 6' N ^ rass ( l owns intervening. At 21 miles Taok, 200 ao ' . houses, 40 Zaptiehs. Site of old Mussulman town. Only remains, a well-built brick minar, 45 feet, on south of village. Imam Yein Abdur on a picturesque rock, 1 mile west, where river cuts through quartz rocks, and villages of Sassil and Jungipa, 3 miles west. Houses loopholed. A fort night previously 400 Hamawand horse had made a swoop on village, but after a little firing and having two of their number hit, they departed. Put up with a shepherd, good fellow, but dogs a nuisance. Declared the Wali of Kerkuk a regular tyrant, and he, as well as most men hereabout, positively asserted that the Hamawands pay one-third of their loot to him. A fair lot of culti vation to north-west of village; country here perfectly bare and treeless.13 9th January 1882. 6-15 a. m . to 2-30 p.m. From T aok to K erkuk. General Direction- { ^ by west | W) |, 25 ffiiles . Marched 6-20; Imam Hama 1 mile. Open cultivated plain west, hills right, miles. Village Teli Mustafa left, 5 miles, small dry stream, Setaldurra. About 7 miles, Mutara deserted village, destroyed by Hamawands, 1 mile on right foot of low Tuppa range. Ruined fort Talmagha, Shumetza, Arab village, and Bolden, 3 or 4 miles Left. At 8 miles Dagatchai, dry; thence to 12 miles succession of dry stream-beds, Durrundurra, Sakaltchai, Satubruchai; road to Karali, undulating downs and sheep on right; open, and villages Buschir and Shamsha, 4 or 5 miles on left, horizon bounded by high range, 25 miles off. About 17 miles, Tasya Kurmatuchai, shallow ford, village of same name, 100 houses on right bank, flows south-west, and artificial mound strewn with debris. Battrkauf immediately west of ford and overhanging it. Road here bears towards east, and after half mile through vineyards, crossing three water-cuts, leads over undulating downs, soon after entering which Kerkuk is visible. Seven miles north-west is village of Chadukuli, 1| miles left. About 20 miles the almost p ost dry bed of Kerkukchai. Passed down mail with a Yuzbashi and ten Zaptiehs as escort. Post-horses are established along this road, at from 15 to 25 miles intervals, and can, with a fir man, be hired from the contractor, and a traveller ride through with mails. Pace slow, animals wretched. Time from Baghdad to Mosul 14 ordinary marches, four days. Seldom travel by night or out of a walk. Met detachment of Turkish infantry on mules marching against Hamawands, followed later by a squadron of cavalry. It is noticeable that the authorities have had to discard the Win chester, and give latter Martinis to put them on an equality with the Kurdish tribes. About 22 miles a little cultivation, then skirt dry river-bed; J miles of shingle; no banks to speak of. Village of Tissin and vineyards left, and wide valley, Kirzil, to right, with numerous Turk and Kurdish villages and plenty of water from springs therein. This is season for the rains, and considerable appre hension was expressed at the small amount that had yet fallen. Picturesque town.

Of one officer 's quarter. Mehmet Ali is Wali and Commander-in-Chief, and Humdi Bey the Mutaserrif. One battalion infantry, one regiment cavalry, and one battery of artillery are quartered here. Was put up by Kadr Effendi, father of my fellow-traveller, Salar Effendi, one of notables of the place. I have the comfort of a room to myself in one of his retainer's houses, a paved, arched, vault-like apartment, but with the inestimable advantage of privacy. One of the Zaptiehs had brought on a murderer here with his hands hand cuffed between a couple of blocks of wood nailed together. They had travelled in most friendly style, smoking together, and the prisoner often carrying his guardian's rifle. In evening dined with Kadr Effendi &amp; la Turc, sitting on heels and using fingers. 10th January 1882. Cloudy; put on uniform, and called at the serai-on the Wali. Humdi Bey, one of the Midhat Pasha school, who speaks French beautifully, acted as inter preter. Was received courteously, but with extreme suspicion, cross-questioned, and asked for my papers. Luckily an old passport with the Turkish visa on it seemed to reassure them, and I was asked to dine by the Wali, which I did at sunset, the quartette being completed by Edhem Pasha, Commandant of Sulimania, and the Mutaserrif. Very good dinner, semi-Turc; table, chairs, plates and forks, but fed out of a common dish; all en grande teaue. Was sent back under a grand procession of Zaptiehs and lanterns. Subsequent14 night, dining with Dr. Humpfell, noticed that the two orderlies who eseorted me back, loaded their Martinis, and halted and challenged every man en countered, which spoke volumes for the state of place. The Wali, who is both Civil and Military Governor, gets equivalent to Rs. 2,000 per mensem, and has Mosul, Kerkuk, and Sulimania districts under him. He starts in a few days for his annual tour through district, for expenses of which he gets 300 lira = Rs. 3,000. The Mutaserrif gets Us. 1,000. There are three others in the vilayat—Sulimania, Mosul, Howanduz. 11th January 1882. Kerkuk. An Austrian, Dr. Ilumpfell, under a five years' contract, is here and called. Speaks Prench well; invited me to his quarters in fort, where he lived with the Surgeon-General, a Greek, Yoakim Bey, who also speaks French. The civil doctor of town. Dr. Ban, is also Greek-German, M. A. Taksim Bey. Dr. Ilumpfell tells me he gets 40 lira a month, paid punctually in gold. Eahim Khan taken ill with fever. My muleteers struck work, funked leaving beaten track. The Mutaserrif and Mahomet Beg, Commander of Zaptiehs, who spoke much Political state of country. of General Campbell, called on me. The former spoke very bitterly of the so-called reforms England tries to force on Turkey, as utterly unsuited to her state of progress and customs. As he says, England only sees the outside of house, and is ignorant of what passes within; that she is utterly at sea as to the real necessities of the country; forgets that one must walk before he can run, and says that there are plenty of educated men in Turkey who know perfectly what is needed, but lack the power to carry out their views; and that if England really wishes to reform Turkey it is by according complete parliamentary and con stitutional protection, and making it independent of the Sultan. Up to a few years since the English were universally popular, but thanks to the Russian war we are no longer so. That a very strong party were even in favour of siding completely with Russia, since they could no longer resist her success fully. 12th January 1882. Both my host and Dr. Ilumpfell draw a lamentable picture of the lawless ness, misery, and discontent of the country. The Turks regarded as aliens, bitterly detested, and only living on their prestige. Officials scrambling to enrich themselves before an inevitable smash takes place; troops unpaid, half-fed, badly clothed, and discontented ; many who had been prisoners of war openly contrasting their good treatment, food, and even pay, received as a matter of policy in Russia, with their present condition, and it is doubtful if they would care to resist a Russian advance. They are now well turned out in their neat Zouave dress, but three months Political, &amp;c., situation. sincere said to be a shoeless mob. Humpfell, with whom I breakfasted, had a very good collec tion of coins, &amp;c.,—Demetrius, Alexander, 1 Polish, 1 Hamburg, &amp;c. Had sent to Vienna 2,500 recently. He mentions Sulimania as a good district for curios, and an early Christian church of 5th century, near Choi Sandjak, as worth seeing. He tells me I am first European he has seen for two years, and that my appearance has caused considerable excitement in the place, many asking my host ' what hopes of an English annexation ?' The universal cry of rich and poor is when are the English, Russians,—any one, no matter who,—coming to deliver us from the Turks. As he says, things must be in a pretty state when even une peuple sale et fanatique ask for Christian intervention. Superior officers take bribes, sell arms, accoutrements, openly. One staff officer sent to report on the river from Baghdad to Mosul recently had appeared here, sold 40 sets of uniform, and four days after departed by road to Mosul, as he said he had once slapped a major, who took Rs. 2 to square the matter. Military discipline is most lax. Officers fear to enforce it, though by the Armj code a man may suffer death for loss of his arms. When, as often happens, a man sells and asserts15 lie has lost his rifle, he gets off with SO days' imprisonment or 20 blows of the stick. As they get lis. 25 or Us. 30, and are utterly without pay, this is no deterrent. Eive or six desert weekly to the llamawands, &amp;c. One colonel married to a Uamawand wife, who, instead of attacking, handed over 300 stand of arms to the llamawands last year, was declared not guilty by court-martial. Conscription is for three years, but often authorities refuse them ' teskire ' or certificate at end of the time, and keep them longer. Ihoy are supposed to get three medjidies, Rs. 6 a month, one winter and one summer suit a year. Rations excellent, if issued in full, and I may men tion that ration bread is far better than ours.

Cartridges, solid brass and better than ours, are carried in belts en handouMre, each containing 40. One belt is habitually worn round waist, and in action two more crosswise over the shoulders, thus giving 120 rounds. 13th January 1882. Eahim Khan, who had an attack of choleraic fever, was quite unable to move, and being further bothered by the strike of muleteers still detained. Baghdad ones fear the mountains, and local ones demand Rs. 1J each per diemj with Rs. 100 advance, and brought awful sore-backed brutes pardessus le marchL At last got four for Rs. 40 to Rowanduz. The Mutaserrif and all others spoken with having so pointedly recommended the superior facility and safety of the Rowanduz over the Sulimania route, that in default of an excuse I felt bound to adopt it.16 14ih January 1S82. 6-30 a.m . to 3-30 p.m. From Kerkuk to Altyn Kopru. General Direction—north-west, 27 miles. Marched 6-30 a.m . A Mullazim and 6 Zaptiehs told off to accompany, i e., spy on me. mounted on wiry but emaciated ponies, and armed with Winchesters. Passed through suburb of Koria, 2^ miles, low range close to road on right; 3^ miles, naphtha springs, slightly worked. About 4^ miles bear more north, and up to about 7J miles through very broken country, formed by numerous low parallel ridges running west by north, about 8 miles crossing Duramee range; Ruined caravan-serai, Kan Han- easy gravel slopes, aSCCnt of about 200 feet. Crest gia, about 7 miles. 1,580 feet by aneroid: thence descend into open, wide, cultivated and grassy plain, with numerous small Kurd villages, ' hullun' of 30 to 50 houses and flocks of sheep, and about 1^ miles from the foot bear more to the north-west. This plain, some 3 5 or 20 miles wide, bordered by the Suan Reg range to north-east, is bare and treeless, but the more numerous signs of cultivation, defenceless character of villages, and comparatively unarmed state of population, seem indicative of a more settled condition of things. For, 10 miles pass through a good deal of cultivation ; many shallow irrigation-cuts; keep along parallel to left bank of the Gerranga Chaismall stream, and pass numerous small villages, chiefly on right of road,—Goelflurra, Ketwall, Patupa, Kultun, &amp;c. Eoad gradually recedes from the Durranee range, which bears to west. About 21 miles get on low, stony downs; range to north-east, 15 to 18 miles distant ; rainy day; and at 27 miles, Altyn Kopru, an island of lesser Zab, with two ridiculously high pointed bridges over it.

Marched 6-30 a.m ., crossing right-hand channel by bridge, which is smaller (though not so steep) than other, over which it is difficult to ride. About 2 miles cross low spur and twice ford brook, and in next mile ascend low, undu lating and much-cultivated ground. The road continues thus the entire dis tance to Erbil, the mountains on either hand 20 to 25 miles apart. Pass several villages,—Shjeikh Hassan, Tahush, Girdlanik, Saraila, Bash Tuppa, Kara Tuppa, Kul Tuppa] Haniza, Kush Tuppa, Kurdes, Ibrahim Leker, Murka Isinga, Giderash, Sheikh Girgi, Girdima, Shakhlama, with some high peaks, Kara Chuk, &amp;c., showing in distance to west.

One weak battalion troops, 3,000f houses (?). Ilahi Effendi, a smart-looking Captain of Kedifs, put me up; and Reschid Effendi, the Kaimakam, called on me. The battle-field of Arbela is some miles distant, near Guagemala, on the greater Zab. Very bare around here, few gardens and no trees. Soil slightly sandy and excellent. 16th January 1882, 6-30 a.m . to 7 p.m. From Erbil to Mosul, 43° 10' E., 36° 20' N. General Direction—west by north-west, 55 miles. Started with saddle-bags and one orderly, leaving Fahim and baggage at Erbil. All Zaptiehs insisted on accompanying me. For 12 miles slightly undu lating ploughed country; general direction north-west, descending. Thence17 more undulating, stony, and little cultivated to the Zab. General direc tion more west; reached Kellek, 22 miles. Cross by two boats; each takes four horses with difficulty. No landing-places; have to jump them, or haul them in bodily. Gravel bed. Stream 150 yards, with a six-mile cur- Keiiek 43° 47' e 36° is 'N rent. From bank to bank here about 2 miles. N - Villages of Kellek on either bank, 1J miles lower. 1 ost-horse station on left bank at ferry. Forty soldiers were drowned here in 18 / 7. About 32 miles ford the Khazir, 80 yards, stirrup-deep, gravel bed. About 36 miles get on flatter and highly cultivated ground, numerous villages Zaptiehs and others, both here and and pass high mountain, l3assuni, visible, since Erbil, on right, and another peak, Maklub, to north of it. Near this is the old Ninivean city of Khorsabad. Amongst villages passed on way, at about 40 miles, are Guzna and Sheikh Amar, where are curious, raised, artificial, mounds some 70 feet high ; and Bur- tala, a Christian village, with fine church. Cultiva tion continues right up to River Tigris. About 53 miles pass through old ramparts of Niniveh, which form an oblong of about 2 miles by f mile wide, and after passing close under the mosque of Nebbi Yunus, Jona's tomb, and leaving the mound wherein Sennacherib's palace was found, half a mile on the right, reach the bed of Tigris, the greater part of which is now dry, with brick bridge of 33 arches across the dry portion and a bridge of 18 boats across the stream, which Russell, the Consul, was Chermside, R.E., towards 16 hours, ordinary march, cantered 20 miles. in Persia generally, carry rifles slung over one shoulder, not across chest. Butt to the front and barrel very slightly inclined upwards; the hand is usually employed when at speed in holding either sling or small of stock to steady it. Even at a gallop it seemo not to incommode them. Some few carried their Winchesters in excellent way, butt to front of thigh, heel-plate almost touching wither; barrel passed under leg and flap of saddle, and muzzle in rear of calf. Tried mode similar to French for one of my orderly's carbines, i.e., bucket, something similar to regulation one, but at tached far more horizontally, muzzle touching outside of fore-arm, and barrel passing under flap, where it is attached to one of girth straps. This for steadiness and convenience of mounting is far superior to regula tion fashion, especially for small horses. is under right bank, absent with Captain Howanduz. Journey, 17ik January 1S82. M osul . . 43° 10' E., 66° 20' N. Altitude . . 725 feet. Mosul, right bank of Tigris, has 10,000 houses, of which 1,200 are Christian and- 800 Jew. French Dominicans have large schools and church here, but the Christians are in ever so many sects, the two principal divisions being, the ' Wet' and ' Dry,' and French Consul has a lively time settling- disputes. The English Consul is son of Mr. Eussell the correspondent, and the dragoman a cousin of Mr. Eassam. French is much spoken. A Russian officer had been here recently, and preceded me towards Rowanduz. Rode over ruins of Niniveh, Kouzungik, which I had traversed in the dark. The cities of Nimroud and Khorsabad are 19 miles south-east on left bank of Tigris, and 14 miles north north-west. Few sculptures are now visible, save two winged lions at north-west gate, and some small damaged tablets at the palace. The hill on which Mosul is built is believed to be artificial and full of remains, also the mound on which is Jonas' tomb, which is as large as that already excavated, and equally within the ramparts, but Mussulman fanaticism renders this out of the question. Strange to say, no other remains exist outside this rampart, and, though some suppose that Khorsabad and Nimroud all formed part of the same city, others think them the site of the palaces at different epochs. Hie probable explanation is, that the mud huts of the common people were so fragile as to have left no traces, but no line of rampart save that above mentioned is found. It is noticeable that all the geographical descriptions of Xenophon as to the Zab, &amp;c., seem strictly accurate. To the west the country seems sandy and barren, a low range of hills, 8 or 9 miles distant, bounding the horizon. General aspect of Mosul is flourishing. Streets are paved, houses generally of stone, with frequent door and window frames of marble. Some good two- storeyed coffee-houses near the river, and numerous traders about. The serai stands to south of town near river, outside the walls which sur round the city in a semicircle. Had not time to call on the Mutaserrif, Nasim Beg, who is reputed a good French scholar. e18 With exception of narrow bridges over the smaller water-cuts and irrigated , . , tj i i . fields, the whole road is passable for field sruns from Remarks on route from Baghdad t * iiixn/r i ^ t r • j i. to Mosul. Baghdad to Mosul, save the two chains betwixt Deli Abas, Kara Tepe, Kerkuk, and Altyn Kopru^ where a little manual help would be required, as it would also for the bridges at latter place, where guns must pass by hand. The Zab would require more boats. That portion of road from Deli Abas to Taok is most deficient in supplies. Excellent grass for grazing, and flocks of sheep throughout the winter, though in summer the latter migrate west to the Persian plateaux. Barley and chopped straw are the only forage procurable. From Mosul to Baghdad by Kellek (raft) is but four to six days' journey down stream, and, when river is full, the first half of year, steamers can come up more than half the distance, and are then stopped by rocks, remains of old Assy rian dams. Samarah, a great place for Shiah pilgrims, is on this route, and ruins of El Haddar a march to west of river. The village of Tekrit is the half-way house on this road. Though travellers seldom, if ever, march by the banks; this is chiefly, I believe, owing to want of villages along the route, and difficulty of supplies, and not to any physical obstacles or want of water. Great numbers of ancient coins are procurable here, though imitations are not altogether unknown. 18tk January 1882. 6 a.m . to 6 p.m. M osul to E rbil , 55 miles. Marched G a.m . My Zaptiehs, whom I had left strewn about the road, all turning up. Returned by almost same road, going for 10 or 12 miles bv a parallel path, a mile or two distant from the one I had come by. Lots of snipe and teal visible. Took over an hour to cross eight horses at the Zab. 19ih January 1882, 6-15 a.m . to 8 p.m. JVom E rbil to H erash. General Direction—north by north-east, 30 miles, Eirst 12 miles low, undulating, and chiefly cultivated ground, bare and tree less, gradually approaching the high chain of mountains on the right. About 3 miles Christian village, Anchawa, 2 miles on left, and 10 miles through Bahirka, 11 miles dry bed of Bussora, and at 12 small village of Dumwach, and enter gorge of low gravel hills. After a mile, ascent to 1,950 feet, see utter change in scenery, perfect sea of rough, broken earth scarps, with brawling trout streams, oak copse beginning to show, and castle of Dera, 3 miles ahead. Steep descent of Dera 2 025 feet feet,fair going thence; wind up small glens, with clear running water and some nice patches of copse on banks, oleanders and long grass, to Dera, where I was met by the chief and a mounted Peshwai' of about 30 horsemen. Yakzar Beg, Modeni, and a fine old white-bearded Kurd, Hazi Sheikh Humud, of the Gugdi clan, a Ghazi of the 1877 war, were most affable, and, whilst baggage marched ahead, I had to enter his fort and dine a la Turc with them. Never saw men I took to more than they, and regietted much I had not halted to improve their acquaintance. 1 hey were curious as to the movement of the Russian officer who had preceded me 10 days to Rowanduz, and evidently thought I was in pursuit of him. The old Sheikh swore eternal friendship to me as an Englishman and enemv of Russia, and the chief sent me on with six of his followers, armed with Sniders, to Row^anduz. The best horse I saw r in my travels was an Arab mare of Se^lowie breed of the Sheikh's. Hence perpetual ascents and descents; splendid^ wild, stony country, with babbling brooks, wild roses, oak scrub, and deep ravines! About 22 miles into bed of large stream, which, together with a couple of small villages, one ruined, an old castle on a craggy peak, and a razor-backed marble range, through a gorge of which the track turns off, are all called Duni. The ravines along foot of this range are particularly bad, and the marble boulders in gorge, where the only track is in bed of stream, so slippery as to be most danger ous riding for 100 yards. Thence bear more north-east, skirting stream, a good many oaks about and slopes becoming easy and gentle, and about 27 miles cross© 19 saddle BaMajijik, of over 2,000 feet (crossed in dark), thence descend through oak copse and scrub to Her ash &gt; a Souchi village belongiug to the Dera chief. Rain and snow in night. %0lh January 1S82. 9-30 a.m . to 2 p.m. Krom H erash (1 ,4()0 feet) to K urruck. General Direction—east, 12 miles. Started late on account of snow. After about a mile, easy ascent up ravine, got on plateau downs, and to 4 nliles cross there east to Esh Handil, small river. The valley, betwixt range crossed last night, and mountains to north runs east and west. This range continues east for about 9 miles, where it joins another, running more north and south, and which the Uowanduz road crosses. Two small villages on Esh Handil and commence gradual ascent towards range above mentioned. Pair lot of cultivation; ground very heavy and stonv. About 9 miles, 1,900 feet, commence real ascent, marble rock, with no end of mud. About 10 miles after a zigzag ascent to 2,650 feet, gain comparative level, a little cultivation and a few oaks about. Up to 12 miles wind alon^ gradually ascending valley, and last ^ mile up hill-side to Kurruck, 3,200 feet, where, on account of snow, we halted, it being 5 hours to Rowanduz. 2Jst January 1882. Heavy snow rendering a start impossible, had to remain in hut, which was a square, flat-roofed edifice cut into the hill-side, about 30 feet each way and 9 feet high, one door, no window, roof supported by numerous props, fire in centre, horses in one corner, my bed (?) in another, and the remaining available space occupied by family, my followers, clay receptacles for grain, firewood, cocks and hens, dogs, &amp;c., &amp;c. Splendid hills, tolerably wooded, and a long valley running north and south ; one of routes to Choi Sandjak, almost in front, three days' march. 22nd Jamiary 1882. 8 a.m . to 2-15 p.m. From K urruck (3,200 feet) to R owanduz (2,000 feet). General Direction—east, 14 miles. Marched 8 a.m ., descent of 1,000 feet to bed of stream and f mile from foot enter Sir Dergan pass, after passing villages of Khalifa and Koniatman, further south. This is prettiest march of whole. For first 1J miles, after crossing by a brick bridge, path winds alongside brawling stream, through splendid gorge, cliffs 1,500 feet overhead, and tine oaks along banks. It then ( just opposite to where the Rowanduz Chai joins former stream, and the two united disappear northwards through a tremendous chasm) turns straight up the cliffs to the right (south), and, after a narrow zigzag ascent by a solidly con structed but difficult path, or almost staircase of slippery marble boulders, for 1,000 feet, lands you on crest of range, in an oak forest, 3,475 feet. This pass, most difficult for pack animals, can be, it is said, turned from the south, in the direction followed by line of telegraph. The Turks talk of constructing a road directly up valley of Rowanduz Chai. From crest descend a couple miles, and, crossing mountain stream, which cuts through the rocks to the north, again ascend a barren glen for a mile, where vineyards and cultivation meet you, and, gradually descending for another miles, find the roofs of Rowanduz under your feet. The tow r n is situated betwixt two extremely deep ravines, or rather chasms, formed by junction of a mountain torrent with the Rowanduz Chai, and, though completely commanded from above, was strong enough in old days, when guns could not be brought against it, as the neck betwixt the tw r o precipices is but 100 yards in breadth. Town itself is 2,000 feet above sea and surrounded with vineyards, and contains 800 houses. Was most hospitably put up by Sirtip Ali Bux, descendant of the old chiefs, who retained theiV independence, and plundered up to the gates of Mosul till within last 50 years. Called on the Kaimakam, Birkir Beg, who returned visit next day, and found Rowanduz, 36° 37' N., 44° 29' E. Altitude 2,000 feet. Altitude varied from 1,800 to 2,200 feet.20 that Russoll, the Consul, and Chermside had just arrived from Mosul, so at chief's request invited them to dine with us. One battalion of regulars is stationed here. Hence to Persia two roads exist, one to north-west by Kelashin pass (said to be 10,000 feet), to Ushnai in three marches, is now, and annually for five or six months, closed by snow; the other to Soug Boulak, four stages. Kurds of this district are of the Balak clan, the chief others recognised by them being the Shamizinia of Sulimania, the Mikir of Soug Boulak, the Koshnan of Choi Sandjak, besides the Bilhas, Mungur, Akhor, Sakuz, Mamush Kurds, &amp;c. The Kaimakam, most jealous of chief, and, finding Botbk,^49. mile8 hence t0 SoUg * obtained two Kurds from him to accompany me to Rowanduz,* insisted on my leaving them behind, as he would give me Zaptiehs, &amp;c. Luckily I made them join me out side, as after first day the Zaptiehs demanded a rupee each, and on its refusal deserted, and by time I reached frontier I would have been without even a guide if I had not retained these two. 24lh January 1SS2. 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. From R owanduz to R ayan. General Direction—east, 24 miles. Chief accompanied me a short way; gave him a pistol, For 5 miles skirt left bank of Rowanduz Chai, ascent over spur, and after another mile strike south-east up side of small tributary for 4 J miles, near head-waters of which steep, zigzag ascent through snow; ground apparently soft shale to 4,500 feet. About 17 miles pass Dergala, 3,400 feet, picturesque village, with old castle, fair lot of trees about and most picturesque snow-peaks around. This is on right bank of tributary, down ravine of which road descends for upper saddle, and about here turns almost east again. About 19 miles, after passing through fine oak woods, cross large tributary, if anything larger than the upper part of Rowanduz Chai. Small village of Chokiskin here. Thence ascend to 20J miles, 3,175 feet, and descend to, and ford, the Rowanduz Chai at few huts called Amara, and skirt along right bank by a path in many places built up on almost precipitous side of hill, to Rayan, which is situated just beyond a splendid gorge. Mountains here most precipitous and picturesque, but through out the day a surprising quantity of cultivation, considering the ground, with small villages of a few huts and vineyards, perched high up the mountain sides, told of an industry I had not expected. The defenceless state of the dwellings, and less armed (daggers only carried) state of the Kurds encountered, told also of a state of peace which the inhabitants of the plains do not credit them with. In fact the more I saw of the wilder parts of Kurdistan, the more I felt secure whilst in them—a feeling I never experienced in the lower districts near Suli mania, Kifri, and Baghdad. Rayan is a small village, of about 25 huts, on banks of a regular Scotch trout stream, which brawls along in fine style. Though one or two of the paths are precipitous and fit only for pack horses, in almost all eases by fording the stream a more level route could be adopted and a road for guns made; but the narrow paths seem used as much to avoid wetting your feet as to preserve the level bits for cultivation. 25Ik January 1882. 6-30 a.m . to 45 p.m. From Rayan (2,700 feet) to Rayat (4,850 feet). General Direction—north-east, 18 miles. Bitter wind and hard frost. Zemla's horse, which got bad soreback on way to Mosul, got lock-jaw (from cold?) and died at night. For about 8 miles skirt right bank of Rowanduz Chai, sometimes some height above it. Lovely highland scenery, foliage, and birds, robin red-breasts, &amp;c., wild briars,' roses, hazels, &amp;c. At 5 miles many traces of ironstone, almost oppo site two picturesque rocky crags (isolated peaks) on opposite bank. About 8 miles ford stream; here, as at most fords, there being a ricketty wooden bridge for foot passengers. For about 5 miles ground more open, a good deal of cultivation, and several villages. Dcrga Horgot, &amp;c., perched 1,200 feet overhead on the slopes of the Warda mountain, which rises to about 11,000 feet. Numer ous vineyards on lower slopes, and the Nawanda and Dorahan streams join inon right bank, near where, entering a narrower gorge, the road from Choi Sandjak * To Choi Sandjak; from Uayat to joins in,* about 13 miles. Large flocks of sheep and 6 hou't' FinTan io s^san'e &amp; I ?o™ e , most savage dogs in charge, which came for us. Sujsan to Choi Sandjak, 4 hours. Vviiid up liill-side above river, which is now reduced to a mere brook, passing village of Durban, and about 17 miles ford the main branch, and, after a mile's easy ascent up a span, chiefly cultivated, turn to left Rayat, 36° 40' N., 44° 57' E. Ai- (N.) into village of Rayat, the Turkish frontier titude 4,850 feet. station on this road. A few miserable mud huts, with a dilapidated quarantine house. No soldiers, and only some very irregu lar Zaptiehs. Hard frost here for some months, and trees almost cease. The road has become much easier since Rowanduz, and country more cultivated. 26th January 1882. 7 a.m . to 4-45 p.m. From R ayat to K helisissar. General Direction—east by north-east, 27 miles. Threatening morning, and glass falling. Over a thousand (?) people are said to have perished in a snow-storm last year, fugitives during Sheikh Abdallah's revolt, and pass generally closed by snow for several months. For about 4 miles skirt along slopes over right bank of stream. Snow knee-deep and track unbeaten. At 4 miles pass ziarat and graveyard. Sheikh Mahomed Balak, with a few gnarled oaks around it. Cross watershed 6,000 feet, about 5J miles. Slope has got easier and more rounded ever since Ray an, and at watershed are almost like undulating downs.

Mabawa, destroyed last year, but now repaired and garrisoned by 200 Sirbaz, is 2 miles south of road. Passing the small villages, destroyed, of Karia, Shinawa, Guhlasur and Genadar, and fording the rivulets of Little Zab and Shinoyan (flowing south), enter spurs of low jhills at about 21 miles, and, after crossing low saddle, just as I was getting thoroughly cold, and wondering where I should find a lodging for the night, found that what seemed a few low mounds became suddenly alive with people, and a very hand some young Kurd, coming forward, welcomed me to the village of Khelisissar. Khelisissar 4 700 feet was son of Humza Aga, by name Suleiman Aga, relations of the Peswa Chief, and had on the spot a critag^thrSrold Uone 'nY?' sheep killed 1| and other hospitable preparations made, greatest forms of welcome in Persia. As instance of his desire to please, one or my horses refusing to enter the low door of a hut, the wall was instantly breached to make way. Shot several couple of ducks and snipe in rivulet just in front of village to great delight of population, who were much impressed. Most picturesque crags in rear (south) of village. Had to feed with Chief's son and hold a regular levee all the evening. Terribly hot room and eaten alive by fleas; was told dreadful stories of Persian reprisals last year, after retreat of the Sheikh,—rape, fire, and sword. The present Persian Governor- Kui . d - General of Soug Bouiak had just summoned all chiefs thither to warn them that in event of further disturbances they must cross the frontier, as all their land would be Some of the natives believed he had confiscated. These, as most Kinds, being Sunis, aie heard a report of the Shah's death, and bitterly hated by the Persian Shiahs. Doubtless, though they denied it, the Kurds of these parts had him when besieging Urmia, was all taken part with the Sheikh, w ho lias religious pre- exceiientiy received and told he tensions over them, and who undoubtedly dreamed of tenance, and ^as escorted through forming an independent Kurdistan.^' He is a well- all districts in possession of Kurds, wisher of the English, protecting the Prench and22 American missionaries in the Clialdsean country, and has a hazy idea that our Indian frontier is contiguous to Southern Kurdistan. * Yusefovich, an officer of the The Kurds here also assumed that I was chevying the Tiflis Chanceiiede. Russian,* who, they said, had been making lists of the villages destroyed, &amp;c., and regretfully remarked they feared I scarcely would catch him now, as he had a week's start. I should add, his muleteers who were here, told me he had made a sketch of the town of Rowanduz topographically. Was warmly invited to come and shoot here. The spring said to be best time. Several horns of ibex, ' Nerya' shown me, somewhat different from the Cashmere species ; also Gosfand, a sort of oorial. About thirty of the Chief's followers have Martinis, nearly all with Turkish Government stamps on them, and they tell me that about 10,000 stand of them and 2,000 Winchesters are in the hands of the Kurds of these mountains. 27th January 1882. 7-45 a.m . to 4-45 p.m. From K helisissae (4,700 feet) to S ouj B oulak (4,770 feet). General Direction—east by north-east, 24 miles. Hard frost. Escorted by Chief some way, with a lot of well-mounted followers. Shot several teal en route. Soon crossed small rivulet, Segman Chai, and, skirting village of Kuranga, followed along its right bank. Ground tolerably open. About 5 miles passing village of Segman, and 8 miles slightly steep ascent and up bed of small mountain stream; wild country but no trees, and at 13 miles reach open crest of Segman, 7,200 feet, deepish snow, but road on whole easy. A lower but longer route via Peswa exists. From this point descend ravine of a tributary of the Souj Eoulak, reaching several patches of cultivation about 15 miles, and about 17 miles the valley of the Souj Boulak river, with several vineyards and orchards. Thence, after crossing a little lower to right bank, you follow river close to the town, near which you have one nasty crossing over a mill-stream; rest of road easy; traces of iron here abouts ; cross a spur and descend to town, which is prettily situated in basin of hills. Large stone bridge on Ushnai road to north-west of it, and lots of vineyards around. Having letters for the Governor-General, Hassan Ali Khan, called on him, received civilly, and sent on by his orders, consigned to hospitality of the Turkish Consul, an Armenian Christian, Khoja Abdul Wahad.

January 1882. 7-45 a.m . to 4 p.m. From Souj Boulak (4,770 feet) to Miandab (4,200 feet). General Direction—north-east, 27 miles. Attended by about a dozen Armenians for first few miles, who brought out a breakfast and lot of wine for a farewell drink. Eor 5 miles skirt river and newly-established line of telegraph, when cross low spur and bear more east. Interkash, 800 houses, and Kumcacha, large village to left, and mountains on right. About 8 miles ascend low undulating spurs, and about 13 descend to marshes of Lake Urmia, which reach about 16 miles. Thence cross marshes, coarse grass, numerous villages destroyed to north, and about 25 miles, crossing the Satao by brick bridge, three arches, enter the ruined and almost deserted town X Some ruins and inscriptions of Miandab, | containing 2,000 houses, and suburb of exist 7 miles east of this.

So great is exasperation against Kurds that no Kurdish mule teer would engage for Tabriz, but got a Persian returning thither for Rs. 03. Was also warned to discard the turbans of my orderlies and substitute Persian fur caps to prevent mistakes, and to wear a fez myself. SOth January 18S2. 6-45 a.m . to 2-45 p.m. From M iandab to B inab. General Direction—north, 24 miles. Cold hard frost; just outside town (deserted), had to ford the Jugathu, 80 yards broad, 3| feet, and difficult from floating ice. Continued north over open plain, deserted villages, some of considerable size, and orchards on all sides, but a few nomads, with herds, alone visible. About 6 miles north Memandar vil- # , n D lage, cross marshy brook,* nitre on banks; and at 8 miles villages of Tapa, Yuzbashikund, and Senahad close to road; latter fortified. At 12 miles enter lane, through walled gardens, and village Malakandi, cross Mirzicha by brick bridge. About 14 miles cross low gravel undulating hill; large villages of Laklar, Midanget, &amp;c., near foot of the Tahend mountains on right, and Chaldean mountains, showing a mass of snow, across Lake Urmia on left. About 17 miles re-enter plain, large villages with orchards Tisible ; left Haji Bazar, Kamzan, Gunai, Sujeabad, &amp;c., towards lake. About 22 miles rocky spur comes down to road, Goranaur, Kultbul, and ruined cara van-serai, and to right endless succession of orchards. Cross Bimabchai by brick bridge ; enter gardens and town Binab, scene of check of Kurds last year. Two thousand houses, 7 or 8 serais, excellent private rooms, covered bazars. Saw one or two carts hereabouts. Pruit, meat, &amp;c., cheap and abundant. Paper windows and fire-places in rooms. Great lot of hairy Tartar camels; caravan for Hamadan. Bid January 1882. 6-45 a.m . to 11-30 a.m. From B inab (4,330 feet 37° 21' N.) to A jakshehr (4,400 feet). General Direction—north-west, 14 miles. Hard frost.

Large villages of Baghdad, Korasvan, and than 2 or 2g feet. Karakabda, about 8 miles on left; Shorgol, Elhwa, and Isgu on right, near Binab. About 9 miles ascend spurs of Tahend, descend ing to plain about 10 miles, soon entering lanes of orchards about Kaiman; ford three water-cuts and rivulet, and turn sharp left down lane to pretty village of Ajakshehr, where I got, through the Persian servant of Governor of Souj Boulak, who attended me, excellent quarters in a private house, covered with vines and looking over orchard. 1st February 1882. 6-45 a.m . to 2 p.m. From A jakshehr (4,400 feet) to J ooan (4,450 feet; 37° 47' N., 45° 51' E.). General Direction—north, 23 miles. Near Kaiman on west is large mound, artificial, a mass of potsherds; Koh Kanabara to north-west part of Sahind Chain. Hard frost. After half mile, gardens, across open, gently sloping, cultivated ground at foot of mountains; lovely view across lake. About 4 miles entering low hills, offshoots of spurs, ascend gradually to about 7 miles 5,050 feet, then descend to 9 miles, tolerably open and close to lake, from 1 to 2 miles distant, 4,375 feet. About 15 miles, ascent, stony, rocky hills and marble quarries on left, to 18 miles, broken and frequent nullas. About 19 miles descend bed of stream, celebrated for robbers, and soon after 20 miles open cultivated ground ; more quarries to left; cross two brooks and enter garden of town.

Kukra- sha, 2 miles, on right of slope of mountains; large open plain on left, and rocks of Shahi Peninsula prominent to west. At 19 miles lanes again, large caravan-serai of Armani and villages of Kochanli and Ispahan. Spurs of hill here run down to road, and commence to be, wherever they can get water, a mass of fruit orchards. Erom this point pass through continual orchards and large village of Sirdan, with some well-built summer-houses of the inhabitants of Tabriz. About 22 miles cross low spurs, whence Tabriz is visible, 7 miles ahead, but from the brown hue of the houses, and want of any prominent buildings, it is scarcely distinguishable from the mass of brown trees surrounding it. On approaching it, after a mile of orchards and narrow lane, reach graveyard immediately beyond, where a lot of flags hoisted show the Foreign Consulates, and about 28 miles enter miserable gateway and the European quarter, where I was hospi- Tabriz 38°5'N., 46° 18'E.

French^ English, Austrian, Russian, and Turkish Consuls are stationed here,—the Russians keeping up their representative in the greatest state, allowing country house, &amp;c. English Consulate is as usual the finest building. European society, to which Armenians are not admitted, is most limited, and necessaries of civilisation difficult to procure. Russian custom house officials make every difficulty to transmission of any European, save Russian, goods. The French Consul had a piano, still detained, lying at Julfa for more than a year. Two carriages exist somewhere in the town, but as curios rather than as luxuries. Turkish, not Persian, is the language of the district here, and the head-dress the Tartar fur cap, just as'often as the ordinary Persian ' kula.' Got a check on my chronometers, wired through Indo-European Telegraph, and further corroboration by working out observations on the known longitude of this place. Tremendous snow-storms set in day after my arrival. Tirermo-meter down to* 13° below zero, Falir. Many shops in bazar closed, and firewood almost unattainable. Fruit trees, generally almond, supply only fuel hereabouts ; said to be particularly severe winter. Great fears of the Kurdish advance enter tained last year. A Jarge Russian force was concentrated at Jalfa, ready to occupy the province in event of further Kurdish successes. A party of 7 commissioned and 5 non-commissioned officers, retired, of Austrian army, was daily expected. The late Austrian military commissioner had been dismissed, the Shah wishing to have officers more completely under his own orders. In these latitudes coffee has quite disappeared, and tea is the only national beverage. Some feeble attempts at gaiety, including a dance, and one or two dinners, the most amusing of which was at the Turkish Consul's, took place during my stay here. The latter told me the Russian Consul had been to him to enquire if he knew the object of my appearance, and the Russian Consul kindly sent to warn me of plague having broken out at Souj Boulak, &amp;c. The celebrated Tabriz marble, of which quarries exist near Jogan, is pecu liar, being almost transparent, and is frequently used here for shelves, &amp;c., in houses. Distances here are given in farsakhs (farsang), which seem variously estimated at from 3 to 6 English miles, most probably same as ' hours ' in Arabia, just as the 'kharwar,*' donkey-load, is common measure of weight. Some breech-loading revolvers and guns for sale in bazar here, at about 100 per cent, over European prices. 18ih February 1S82. 7-15 a.m . to 6 P .m.

Had feared I should be followed by escort, but no one turned up. 19th February 1882. 6-45 a.m . to 3-30 p.m. From Dizzi Khalil to Tasuj. General Direction—north-west, 25 miles. Cold ; even running streams easily bore weight of our caravan. About a mile of lanes through walled orchards, then open cultivated ground. Some large villages to left (south), Sufr Mir Alhangi, &amp;c., and numerous ones nestled between spurs of chain on north, which approach to within a couple of miles of road. Chief peaks about 8 miles distant and 10,000 feet high. Passed a large caravan of yahoos from Trebizond, with European bales of goods. Larger orchards and roadside trees here and there, generally plum and other fruit trees, or willow.

Bitterly cold wind from north-east; foot of mountains about a mile on north, and bare, open, marshy-looking ground for a couple of miles up to edge of lake on south. Numerous nullas crossed and numerous villages and fruit trees amongst spurs, a good deal of shingle on road. About 15 miles cross stream, low rocky hills close on north, and shores of lake about 1 mile south. Police post, Gumez, here, and flocks of sheep; track branches here half right and half left. About 18 miles cross Sutaigo, and a mile beyond, Bunarjdurra, small streams, hills on north, low, and less cultivation.

French convent near Haftovan. 21st Fehruary 1882. 7-15 a.m . to 2-38 p.m. From Raoshan to Goochi. Genera] Direction—south by south-east, 20 miles. Cold, but sun proved hot later on. About a mile after starting had to cross large sheet of ice, and had some croppers amongst animals. Indeed, it was wonderful how our beasts, shod with the Arab plates, and not roughed, ever kept their legs at all; 2 miles through large village, Karafa; about 3 miles pass through some low hills. Imam Zada on knoll on left, and, after passing some sharp, isolated, rocky knolls, about 7 miles, join main track from north-west near ruined village and some very strong tepid springs, forming stream swarming with duck. Shot four or five without going 100 yards from road. A bay of the lake is distant 3 miles left; ground marshy up to it, and round serai, about a mile south east ; 8 miles ascend undulating spurs and enter valley in hills. About 9 miles Yakba Khan, a police post, and cross dry nulla. Barren hereabouts, and a good Goochi, 37° 59' N., 4,600 feet; deal of snow lying 12 miles near eastward, and easy small village ; loo houses. ascent to 5,550 feet; village Karabarren 2 miles west, thence steeper to cross about half or half mile further; 15 miles, elevation 6,150 feet by aneroid. Thence descend down valley of small stream for 3 or 3^ miles, thence along spur descending to village of Goochi, 4,600 feet. The end of range jutting into lake is bold and rocky. Some large blocks of granite strewn about. Rest of hills chiefly earth, with easy slopes. This pass, which, with another sum mer one more to west and higher elevation, are called indifferently the Goochi, Salmas, and Vergams Passes, is much raided on by Ali Aga, Chief of Sheikhak Kurds. Last year after Sheik Abdallah's retreat the Persians utilised some of their disciplined troops and Austrian officers to punish him under the Heir- Apparent. His fort was eventually taken, and is now held by Persian garrison. But he, though 80 years of age, charged with a handful of men through the Persian * The Persian Commander had been ^ made Way for him.* He is now in first disgraced, and subsequently lurkish territory, and the Persians have nominated given a sword of honor for this. one Hassan Khan as chief of tribe Many of these Kurds have Martinis.

Alti- hand, hidden by orchards, and enter town. Though tude 4,400 feet. there were three large well-built caravan-serais, found every corner occupied as shops, and after more than an hour's wandering about, at length, with great difficulty, got a damp vault-like hole to dismount in. Streets so cumbered by snow-heaps that laden mules could scarcely get along. The Governor sent me some dinner, hearing of my arrival. Great crowd of merchants, &amp;c., and terribly mobbed next day. So went to call on the French missionaries, and was most hospitably invited to stay by them, and at once found myself in the lap of luxury. Called on the Governor, a young man, Ali Khan, who speaks French well. Town, which is feebly fortified, has 8,000 to 9,000 houses, and is situated in close proximity to the foot of spurs which run down from Mount Sitawar chain on west and surrounded on all sides by orchards and gardens. To east these extend to the lake, here 6 miles distant. One isolated hill, Bizar Daghi, showing up there and some rocky islands in lake, said to hold large numbers of wild goats. Owing to proximity of Binar (in the Naochia district, is the capital of Sheik Abdallah, near which is a large Christian village,Halania, two days' journey from this), a strong garrison is now maintained, one regiment of 400 cavalry, 500 artillerymen, three t And though he is a civilian the regiments infantry, eachf of 1,000 men : 1,000 of above have Werudls, which are the adopted Persian breech-loaders. This town was besieged by the Kurds for ten days last year. The surrounding villages were plundered, but not destroyed, as the Sheikh counted on their permanent retention. A French Archbishop, styled Bishop of Heraclaide, Mons. Aug. Cluzel, some priests and six French Sisters of Charity, are settled here; former has been 40 years. There is also a colony of American-Presbyterian J Paasengrer? from Tabriz ofteo Missionaries _ Both of above work amongst the travel by water from the peninsula Ghaldoean Christians, who are chiefly to westward of of Shahl, or near Gogan, in very rude this.

Informed by the French Bishop that zinc, lead, and silver exist unworked in the Chaldoean mountains, and that petroleum oil springs are found that are actually kept on fire by villagers to prevent their overflow tainting the streams. General feeling of insecurity and probability of being squeezed by officials pre vents all enterprise; the Christians, moreover, saying these had better be left for the benefit of some Christian Power, and not for that of present rulers. Water of lake, in which no living thing exists, is five times as salt as the sea at the equator, i .e., about 20 per cent. One curious relic frequently found hereabouts. In28 mortuary urns 10 feet below surface, two bronze pins, about 4 inches long, driven through skull at ears; and small, coarse glass tea-bottle, nothing else. No notion * There are over 20 varieties of as to date or history.

They are, however, legally prohibited from selling food, acting as shoemakers, &amp;c., selling fruit, &amp;c.* Weather warmer and slight thaw. Both here and at Tabriz I utterly failed in getting any gold tomans, so had to carry the whole sum I had in silver. A Persian post exists between all the chief towns, carried on pack-horses, but so slow that a letter I wTote from here to Baghdad took about seven weeks to get there. The stamp, as XJrmia also the new kran, are very neat, and, belonging to postal union, you can send letters from Persia to Europe for One very break-neck path, from Urmia to Neri-Turkistan, exists. Another route to Ushnai, two marches, now closed by snow. From here there i. -p r q ii,' a rou te of three stages to E/Owanduz,t but cross- t By vailey of Syakcha.. ing ^ p ass at ^ 10)000 ^ ^ by snow for five months annually. On this road, about two hours from Ushnai, is an Assyrian inscription, on Sheikh Iwa, ' The Peak ' mountain. This must probably have been the old Niniveh-Ecbatana road. Gave out to Governor, who was inquisitive as to my movements, that I was on way to visit this inscription. All declared I would be obliged to follow the road by edge of lake to Sheikh Ahmed, and then up valley of Sulduz to Ushnai on account of snow. Was told a petition, signed amongst others by some of richest inhabitants, had been captured last year by the authorities, praying for a Russian annexation. Talking of military conscription here, the Governor told me he could not understand how men stood it, neither pay nor food, and that a regiment sent, for instance, to Eastern Persia, Meshed, &amp;c., would somehow continue to get along and reach their destination. The men of this province, especially Aderbaizan, seem perfect material for soldiers, and, both from fertility of district and mineral wealth, would doubtless prove a most paying province in the hands of Russia. Throughout the basin of this lake Turkish is the language of country, and but few men in each village understand any Persian, soldiers and wandering fakirs alone, as a rule, doing so. 27th February 1882, 7 a.m . to 2-30 p.m. From U iimia to J aiban, General Direction—south-east, 20 miles. Not so cold, and road very muddy. About a mile outside cross dry gravel bed of Chaishai; bridge exists a little lower; 3 miles spurs approach road on right. Thence through well-cultivated country, numerous gardens. On way a mounted Persian, with wdiom I got in conversation, suddenly asked if I spoke French, as he did very well, and told me he had resided three years at Lyons, where he had learned photography. Continue thus crossing numerous water- cuts and keeping spurs of hill a couple of miles on the right, passing numerous villages, and the Kasidage, a larger stream than others, about 10 miles; and about 14 miles, Fort Morad Ali, on spur 1 mile west; 17 miles, reach bank of Baraulu, a largish stream, just fordable, number of storks' nests about in trees, and after skirting down left bank for half mile cross by brick bridge, four arches, at village Sardaro. Turn left (east) to village Jairan, two or three hamlets. Great diffi culty in getting a house, the three horsemen promised by the Governor never having put in an appearance. At last a soldier consented to admit me, and no sooner was I installed than a couple of Moollahs, with an excited crowd, forced their way in to ask whether I was a friend of Sheikh Abdallah, and whether a Suni or Shiah ! Had some difficulty in squaring them. At this time I wore a Fez and Kabul poshteen, breeches, puttis, and shooting-boots, and my two order lies Persian kulas, poshteen, and puttis, so our nationality was not so apparent. After reaching Souj Boulak resumed our puggris. My host complained bitterly of his own Government, said if he were only in the Russian, Turkish, or any other army he would be fed and clothed, but that here he was having to serve alternate years, or find his brother as substitute; had already been serving thus29 during 20 years, and would be kept at it all his life. He got no remission of taxes, and had to pay 3 tomans per half-year for his hut. Showed me his musket and accoutrements, which they keep at home with them,—old muzzle-loading smooth-bore musket, dirty antiquated belts and pouch. %Sth February 1882. G-30 a.m . to 6-15 p.m. From Jairan (4,275 feet) to Sheik Ahmed (4,200 feet). General Direction—south by south-east, 35 miles. This is about southern limits of the Urmia gardens. Lake is 2 miles west, and hills about as far on east of village. After a few gardens and open ground, ford small tepid stream and cross low spurs at 2 miles. Thence descend and skirt along shores of lake, to which slopes tlescend. An upper track exists, avoiding Jairan, but going round at 4 miles. Ground now uncultivated, save patches at villages llashakan, Shashagal, &amp;c. Eleven miles, shore of lake tends eastward, and a fortified village, Tergan, stands on rocky scarp over water; ascend easy slope for mile, then through gardens of Dizza to 14 miles, then again skirt low slopes and shore of lake; crossing larger spurs at 18, and deep ravine 21 miles, rather likely spots for robbers; 25 miles shore of lake again recedes east. Very strong smell from the kind of seaweed on shore, rather disagreeable; 27 miles, crest of spur, 4,470 feet, aneroid reading, easy ascent, and see valley Sulduz at feet. Large part of it now flooded. The Kalashin Pass visible to west at head. Skirt along spurs and cross flat ploughed plain to another low spur and hollow road, (3 feet); and descend to village of Sheikh Ahmed, 50 or 60 flat mud huts; valley about 5 miles wide, and as much pastoral as agricultural. Large flocks, sheep, yahoos, &amp;c. Terribly savage dogs, who live on roofs, even throughout snow, and troop down in a pack on any stranger. Kobbery quite impossible, and it is dangerous for any stranger on foot to approach at night, unless with villager. Dogs all have names, and are said to recognise instantly any one of inhabitants' voices. Had to draw my sword to keep one off, although mounted. Some of neighbouring villages belong to Mr. Gelately, whose brother was there, of which unfortu nately I was ignorant. Put up by shepherd. Here, as common in these parts, there is a fire-place sunken 3 feet or so in floor, and kept always full of embers. The ladies of house could not for long bear themselves away from the attraction of sticking their legs down this, notwithstanding our presence. Bitterly cold evening. Inhabitants here Turks, and seem to have suffered little from the Kurds, probably joined them. 1st March 1882. 6-15 a.m . to 5-30 p.m. From Sheikh Ahmed (4,200 feet) to Souj Botjlak (4,300 feet). General Direction—south-east, 33 miles., Over marshy but tolerably cultivated ground, 4 miles, through partly ruined village Mahomed Shiah on left bank of Gadr Chai or Sulduz Chai, marsh on right bank, foot of hills south boundary of valley 3 miles off, several villages Found on enquiry that the Kak. alon g slopes. Bear ^ more to east, passing two or shin Pass was still so blocked that I three villages, Dungia, Duna, &amp;c., at end of low would not probably be able to make rocky spur which iuts out into plain. Lar^e herds the Assyrian inscription. i i . i j -n .. and good many ponies about. Irom enquiries a fair yaboo was procurable for lis. 40. Cross some water-cuts and through reeds to about 11 miles to stone bridge, three arches, to which road makes a curious loop. River seemed deep and unfordable, 30 yards wide. Reason of its being off direct line was, I believe, to avail themselves of a block of rock at one side for foundation. Villages of Saradash and Mania on right bank near, and steepish rocky hill overhanging, along base of which road skirts. One very black and oily piece of soil showed here through snow. Circle round foot of hill and cross spur, 4,270 feet, open and undulating, grassy marshes to left (east) close to road, and two or three villages a mile or two off track. Hills become more detached and smaller; 17 miles easy ascent round spur to your right (west), and down gentle grass descent and over some low undulations, snow melting and ground heavy. About 22 got large villages of Interkash, &amp;c., to left; passed on other side on way from Souj Boulak to Miandab in January, and 25 miles30 over spur, descend about 100 feet, and at 2G miles strike banks of Souj Boulak river, opposite Usukund; close to this is end of spur, across which the Souj Boulak-Miandah road crosses about half mile off. Being misdirected we forded river here and made for this road and line of telegraph, being bothered on right bank by a deep water-cut which mules crossed with difficulty. Proper road runs for some way up left bank and crosses nearer town. Sent on, and was met by Mr. Gelately's cousin and put up by him. Eound that telegrams concerning me had been sent down from Tabriz. Several storks turned up to-day, a sign, according to the inhabitants, of Souj Boulak, 45° 45' E., 36° 45' beginning of spring. Called on the Governor- N. Altitude 4 ,300 feet. General, Hussan Ali Khan, whose full titles are Amir-u-turam, Mlnistre des Travaux Publics, Gouverneur-General cle Souj Boulak, Sainkaleh et de Gerus, Commandant-General de Varmie JPersane a Souj Boulak. He is native of Gerus, and came here with army on retreat of the Sheikh last year. Being ordered by the Shah to make Wrote to Suleiman Aga excusing ^mp^e of particularly Suleiman Khan, one of my not visiting his village for shikar Sheikh Abdullah s adherents, he enticed him to Souj on account of snow rendering the Boulak under an oath on the Koran that he had latter impossible. Heard that the jv • j . i» p , • , n i i i i i Ganashin Pass was so thoroughly nothing to tear trom him up to the day he descended closed by fall of snow just after I into his grave. In tent prepared for his reception foTtod'WWa grave had been dug, covered by carpet, and on that drifts lay over top branches of the Khan s sinking into this he was shot. An hammad Baiai Ziarat siieikh Ma * instance of Persian justice occurred day after my arrival. Four robbers caught had a nose, hand, and ear respectively cut off, whilst the leader was flogged to death. This justice is tolerably efficacious, and the security of the roads on the Persian side of frontier contrasts strangely with the anarchy of the Turkish provinces. Chances of detection and capture are so few that an extra stringent penalty must be exacted to make justice feared. Called daily and had long chats with the Gover nor, some medicines I gave him being much appreciated. He also returned my visit, an unusual circumstance. Heard our intimacy caused much conversa tion in bazar, and it was said that some recent changes of sentries, and issue of cartridges and breach-loading rifles to some of his followers were dictated by my advice. Received visits from Jewish Rabbi, w T ho gave me petition for Sir Moses Montefiore and from several merchants, including Russian Tapirhashi Agent, which I returned; also made sketch of town for the Governor which ho said he was going to send to the Shah. Spring apparently set in, mild snow disappearing, and blue crocuses sprouting everywhere. 6th March IS82. 7-15 a.m . to 1-30 p.m. From Souj Boulak to Haji Ali Khan. General Direction—east, 13 miles. Some rock-carvings are said to exist on face of precipice of isolated hill to north-east of Juberkash. Accompanied by large cavalcade of Armenians, and had a pic-nic breakfast • Sultan Kai Kawas. 0 ' ^ Als ? ^ a Persian,* who ranked as captain ot cavalry, with two or three followers, sent by the Governor-General to see me to Sakuz. He had a very small blue cloth uniform that rather threw my kit into shade. Immediately outside town enter narrow valley, few traces cultivation, three miles ascent, wind upwards hill about six miles ; cross ridge 6,000 feet, descend to 5,450 feet next mile, and wind along high-lying, fairly open valleys, with slopes easy, and at 13 miles reach village Hafi Ali Khan, 100 houses. Deep snow was terribly fatiguing on this march; horses kept continually sinking till your stirrups touched snow, and as it was partially beaten down, and crust occasionally bore, there was terrible plun&lt;nm»-. Meeting convoy yaboos, who hustled us off beaten path, one of Governors men instantly felled one of muleteers with butt of rifle, cutting his head badly. The poor devil, who did not dare to murmur, refused to take a few krans I offered him, from pride apparently. The mules I got at Urmia for 12 krans each to Souj Boulak, refused to come further, so hired four there at 40 krans each to Sulimania. Eventually they engaged on and accompanied me to Baghdad.a: 31 About 5 miles out another road branches off more to south-east, but was said to be difficult from snow. From Ilaji Ali Khan two other roads to Sakuz exist via Borhan, used in summer, said to be three farsakhs shorter, and the Ba Sunga road. Two prominent peaks stand on south of village Almalas and Sultan Said A\ r akai. A wedding being on, was left to myself, all avail able population dancing. Women unveiled, as general amongst Kurds, arm and arm with men, the whole in a circle going round and round a few musicians with drums and reed flutes, who kept up a monotonous but tolerably correct tootling, certainly very many degrees above Hindoo melodies. 8tk March 1882. 6-45 a.m . to 5 p.m. From Haji An Khan (5,(500 feet) to Bokan (4,450 feet). General Direction—south-east, 34 miles. Bright, gay colors worn, picturesque scene. Lots of dogs. There had been some fighting here with some of the Sheikh's Kurds who tried to loot, and eight or nine villagers had been killed. An Armenian merchant held this village as his compatriot did of many in districts whose Agas, ruined by events of last year in particular, were glad to flbave. Por three miles follow bank of stream to village Sigar, 5,200 feet, ford it and over undulating cultivated ground; Kilai-el-llasul Salif, about 6 miles; 3 miles left, and decided fall into Miandab valley, Maragha hill, Sahend, &amp;c., clearly visible; undulating, few villages to 14 miles. Sheep, larks singing, at 15 miles into plain and cross two streams to Ashagu, skirt under rocky ridge at Imiles, striking left bank of Tatava. Hills on right bank across valley 4 miles; at 25 miles Unchar, big village, with Fort Mahommad Aga. At 30 miles large villages, where for only time during travels was refused lodgings, owing, I fancy, to my Persian companion; descend cultivated ground, grove and ford to west of village Ustapa, half mile down on right bank; 33 miles cross ford, 80 yards; girth deep, and after water-course and mill. Bokan at 34 miles, with old fort on knoll above town. Hospitably received by Munshi of Saf-uddin-Khan in a very small house, owner just gone to Souj Boulak. Small covered bazar here, and building going on, 400 houses (?); most marvellous spring, lukewarm, in court of mosque, from which large stream flows through town; full of fish. 9 th March 1882. 6-30 a.m . to 2-25 p.m. From B okan (4,450 feet) to S akuz (5,075 feet). General Direction—south, 24 miles. Pass few gardens, hills close left for 1^ miles, open to 5 miles, low ridge Lots of villages in sight up Valley Tatawa, and high snow-chain on west 7 miles. Imam Sultan Altimas up hill west, ascend 5,000 feet, some ups and downs, crossing a couple of streams tributary of Tatawa, and at latter village of Sarsloe, boundary of Sakuz and Mikri Kurd, and ascend a gently rising snow field; marching again heavy; at 15 miles, crossing saddle 5,500 feet, descend to stream which skirt and cross at 19 miles. Several villages in sight, and valley whence inner stream tolerably open. Lots of sheep about. Path now ascends and winds round spurs of hill on right (west) about 23 miles, descending to Sakuz, which is situated at end of Sakuz, 36° 14/ N., 46° 21' E. a i on g low spur overhanging left bank Sakuz river, Altitude. o,0/o tect. tributary of Jugathu. Was met by a regular Peshwai, Chief's brother, and about 20 mounted men. Ruinous little town of 1,000 houses with an equally dilapidated house of the Khan, and some feeble attempts at covering in the roofs of bazar. Jews very rich here.

He is nominally Persian Governor of district, but told me is terribly spied upon and watched. I formed a greater friendship for him than for any other native met with in my travels.32 Heavy snow, making roof of my room leak like fun, detained me here till 13th.

This apparently was when Mahomed i \kbar Khan was theic confined, of A^hose escape he gives romantic tale of a mine driven under hy some piolessional Afghan robbers to his prison.

Opinions were divided as to whether I was Russian or English, but all agreed I was a Govern ment emissary, lells me the Khan is terribly in debt; has about 300 cousins33 to keep. Mesjid Khan himself told me that, though his assessment is 3,000 tomans a year, he has to pay 10,000, the balance going to the Governor- General of Province, Ministers, &amp;c. That he recently had to raise 6,000 tomans from the Jews to meet some of these demands, and was now called upon for 3,800 more. When the Persian army from Ispahan was on march to oppose the Sheikh last year they burned many of his villages, doing 12,000 tomans damage, and though he proceeded to Teheran to complain he could get no redress. That he was so worried he almost thought of quitting the country and flying to Turkey. Here, as elsewhere, Kurds are Sunnis, and bitterly hostile Southern Kurds. t0 tlleir Shial1 rulerS - Mesjid Khan, of whose powers and dare-devilry many stories are current, was absent burning a neighbour's village one of the nights of my stay.

Persian). As to what their numbers may be, it seems pure guess-work. Some say one million, some two, some a half. Dissensions and clan feuds weaken them, as they did the Scotch Highlanders, and they do not attempt resistance to the Persians, whose present army is far from formidable, but in the event of any invasion the great fact would be that the invaders would find auxiliaries rather than enemies in them, which, considering the nature of the country, is of enormous importance. Persian-born Governors are now beginning to replace the Kurdish Chiefs, who up to now were always Governors of their own districts. None of the present Chiefs have any great autho rity. The Mukri Kurds, Souj Boulak district, are, perhaps, the most numerous, but there is now no one recognised head. Habbi Beg, Juanruni, whose head quarters are at Kellak, 8 farsakhs from Zohab, is said to be the biggest man, and to have from 26,000 to 100,000 clansmen. The Jafs, who are on both sides of the frontier, on the Diala, and chiefly nomads, and are considered Kurds, though apparently more resembling Arabs, are divided into the Kashkai, Sursur, Babagani, and Abrami clans, and are popularly said to muster 35,000 horsemen. Mahomed Pasha, who lives near the Sulimania-Kifri road, is the most powerful man of those parts. Sate.—High rocky range.

Snow almost daily, and roof leaked much. The Khan left me to myself most of time, only visiting me an hour or two daily, and only once had I to eat with him, when one tray was reserved for us two, and other trays for each three or four of his chief attendants, excellent food in its way; and he openly offered me ' mastic,*' which he drank himself occasionally. On taking leave he sent a cousin to accompany me to Baneh, with letter for the Khan and orders for all villagers to turn out and carry my kit over pass; gave him my Soper Express. He wished to give me a mule, instead of which I took his dagger, to which he added a prayer carpet and jacket. I parted from him with real regret.34 13ih March 1882. 9-30 a.m . to 2-30 p.m. From S akuz (5,150 feet) to M iradeh (5,450 feet). General Direction—south-west, 17 miles. Mules went ahead separately, road very muddy from melting snow ; follow iL . , f valley of river, which for 5 miles is within J mile. * Near this the usual caravan route, , , n ,. ci i m Souj Houlak to Suiimania, joins in; After that strike over low undulations, several Vll- Souj Boukkto Miradeh,3stitf marches, i a o.es in si^ht, mostly at some little distance, and all Soui Boulafc to Isakuud, 5 hours; ,P ■ -i ? ^ Kareza 6 hours, Miradeh 5 hours, ol miserable appearance. IIiqIi range on lett (south), Hilly road. Shakh Mulla principal peak, 5 miles off, 10,000 feet; about 9 miles, near village Tamoga,* two streams join, both regular Scotch trout streams; cross the north one and skirt along left bank of other. !Near village Bala jar, at 15 miles, slopes, along which path runs, are steeper. At 17 miles, village Miradeh. on banks, 40 houses. Decent accommodation in headman s house, to whom gave compass. 14th March 1882. 8-15 a.m.to 11-15 p.m. From M iradeh (5,450 feet) to K apura (6,125 feet). General Direction—south-west, 9 miles. Snow at night; doubtful about start, but tried. Cross biggish rivulet at 1 mile, and smaller brooks at 2^ and 5; hug left bank all the way. About 5 miles path narrow and rocky, but no great difficulties. TV hen about 7 miles, heavy snow-storm began, and all villagers, of whom we had some 60 with us, declared it impracticable to attempt the pass; so branched off to Kapura, a small village of 30 huts, 1 mile north-west of main track, on chief branch of stream, 6,125 feet; had some regular snow-bridges to cross, over which yahoos had to be fairly lifted, as they sank belly-deep every stride. Had best hut of village about 12 by 12 feet, 7 feet high ! A good many ' chuppatties ' of the poorer people are made from a small seed, ' aryan ' or ' gow,' which grows wild here, somewhat resembling canary seed. loth March 1882. 7-45 a.m . to 5-30 p.m. From K apura (6,050 feet) to B an ah (5,400 feet). General Direction—south-west, 15 miles. Retraced our steps for about a mile, and just at junction of the Kapura with the Kalakua brook, unloaded mules and prepared for ascent. Horses were sent over spurs to left, i.e., east of tract, whilst the baggage on porters kept up left bank of stream. Save a few score yards at first, road apparently easy and good, but such a depth of snow that it reached top twigs of bushes; slopes of hills easy, and about half way up a few bushes begin. Easy gradients from 5,900 to 6,800 feet, about an hour's walk. Thence, about J mile to crest 7,475 feet. Last 300 feet especially steep ; 18 minutes to do this bit; near foot is a ruined like building, formerly a caravan-serai. Thick mist hid everything. This point is 7 miles from Kapura; equally steep descent for J mile, but no rock—merely earth slopes; trees begin, and descend to village Simach, 5,970 feet; at 9miles foot ot pass, at head of Banoh valley. All surrounding hills fairly wooded, oak and thorn; saw one or two wild ash, and, I think, walnut. Paid off porters and waited in the mosque of place, where a fire was lit for me, for the horses, which did not turn up for 2f hours, about double the time we had taken ; they had kept round by the wind-swept ridges, but had been over croup in some of the drifts. Marched down right bank of stream, road very muddy, 7 or 8 villages inside valleys, and good deal of cultivation, hills well wooded. Thirteen miles, Kilai Tarash, on rocky peak, 500 or 600 feet over road ; 15 miles, very open, plough, met by Peshwai of Chief's son, &amp;c. Pord stream and enter town. Rather handsome house, received most warmly by Khan, man of 50, who seemed delighted to see an Englishman. The whole of our popularity in these parts is owing to our sup posed championship of Turkey against Russia.35 Banah, town of 600 houses, betwixt river-bank and a deepish ravine. Chief, 45° 54'E., 35°59 N. Altitude 5,400 is head of the Banah Kurds. A. peak, Arbabat, feet - 3 miles south of town, has its slopes covered with vineyards more than half way up. Town has a slightly more prosperous look than Sakuz, and the Khan's residence was certainly far finer and better famished. His great show carpets were some gaudy, striped, cheap, French railway rugs, which were evidently prized far above the beautiful Kurdish ones. Erom Banah it is 7 hours to Sardasht, which was burned last year, but is „ , f , now held by Persian garrison. Open easy road, one Kouies iroin Danan. . ,01 ' j - ci * river to ford. Summer traffic ouhmama to oouj Boulak passes by Sardasht, but passes which are described as very rocky (many hawks come from that side) are now closed by snow. It is 3 marches via Jiltomar from Sardasht to Souj Boulak generally, or four easy; Nihsan 16 miles, Jiltomar 17 miles, Bairan 20 miles, Souj Boulak 12 miles. Akursa 24 miles, Sulimania 27 miles, difficult ford over the Aksu. Erom Banah direct road to Sulimania (closed for another month by snow) is Shewakar 5 hours, Kalachwala 5 hours, Sulimania 4 hours. Another, now open, Kanyan, 4 hours, Pengwin 5 hours, Mamakilla 6 hours, Sulimania 4 hours. Merwan is 10 hours from here, Sirambal 4 hours, Bin (mountainous stage) 6 hours, Asrabad 4 hours, Janawara 6 hours, Doissa 7 hours, Sihna 3 hours. 17th March 1882. 8-45 a.m . to 2-15 p.m. From Banah (5,400 feet) to Serambal (6,050 feet). General Direction—south by south-east, 13 miles. Heavy snow had fallen since my arrival, effectually blocking Kalakua Pass they said. For 2 miles road very muddy and heavy, with half-melted snow, plough at 2 J miles low saddle ; descend banks of small stream fringed with wil lows. Hills still wooded, at 5 miles, valley; on left village Halabjek, and small river Ab-i-Fan. On right bank, about 6 miles, is artificial mound ; undulating road to 9 miles; traveller met here declared further on drifts too deep for mules. At 9 miles ford stream and commence ascent, wooded spur. Fearful snow and sleet, with gale of wind, here caught us, but not a village anywhere. About 11 miles road very difficult for a mile, two deep ravines and three spurs, part of path zigzag. About 12 miles, top highest spur 6,200 feet. Thence descend slightly to Serambal, 50 houses, at 13 miles. 18th March 1882. From Serambal (6,050 feet) to Pengwin (4,850 feet). General Direction—south, 21 miles. Aga, cousin of Yunus Khan, lives here; fine young fellow and fond of sport. Had heard en route that lots of game were to be found in the Banah forest, but herejis nothing save partridge and other small game. No trees of any size,— 6 feet circumference the largest I noticed. Descend short way, then up spur to about 2 miles, at which point is the frontier, 6,050 feet. Skirt along hill, descending deep-wooded ravine on right. From 3 to 5 miles undulating forest ground, then zigzag path, not rocky, from 5,050 feet to 4,650 feet; enter bed of small stream, and skirt down right bank to 7 miles, where strike right bank of Surab river, 70 yards broad, and just fordable. Opposite the ford, one line of road strikes off via Bistan—called 2 hours—to Sulimania, which is 8 hours thence, but it having been burned last year by one of the Banah Khan's cousins, on a question of black-mail, supplies were unprocur able. Also five or six of Yunus Khan 's followers attached to me declared they were responsible to see me safe to Pengwin; so proceeded thither. Over open, wet plain, covered with crocuses and flowers showing through snow, and up line of small stream to rocky saddle 12 miles, another point of frontier. Thence across wide plain, with some isolated hills on it, at 15 miles, skirting foot of hills on left (east); cultivated but terribly wet plain on right, pouring rain, and high wind.36 most dismal march. About 16 miles village Bamabal, small defile, again open to 19 miles, where ford the Bimansuchai or Mashkal stream, 70 yards, girth-deep. Another mile of open, bear to east up valley between low hills, and at 21 miles is the frontier town of Pengwin, terraced in amphitheatre, rising up from small stream ; 200 houses, 8 Zaptiehs and a Modeni ; put up hospitably by him. Tells me he has been here 12 months, not a farthing of pay, and the captain ot lledifs here 2^ years. That he has 50 villages, and 8 unpaid Zaptiehs to keep order. That he has now received orders to furnish some elaborate census returns, for which he has neither clerk nor paper; that the Hamawands might ride up and camp in Sulimania, and would find no one to oppose them, &amp;c. Wild night and heavy sleet-storms. 19th March 1882. 8-15 a.m . to 6 p.m. From P engwin (4 ,750 feet; 35° 36' N., 46° 6' E.,) to M ama K ulan (4,200 feet). General Direction—west by south-west, 27 miles. Started with escort of 6 Zaptiehs, who promptly deserted at first village. For 9 miles skirt low range on left. Bimansuchai parallel about 1 mile right; ground cultivated, number of small streams. At 7 miles road divides, the left (south) one now closed by snow; 9 miles village Hasilyn, 50 huts, where escort deserted me and went home. River here, and track enters gorge in mountain. One bold rocky isolated crag, called Kitai Hasilyn, ruined fort just opposite village. Got a guide at last for 3 krans and proceeded; path wound along picturesque wooded slopes from mountains on left bank of stream into which they descend, path indifferent. One descent of 700 feet, about 10 miles, at foot of which cross ravine, smaU huts of Zerkow, 4,550 feet, and up the stiffest ascent of this road to 5,200 feet. Here, being ahead of caravan, met a bold, handsome- looking Kurd, with scimitar and pistols, lying on grass. Said he was going on business to Sulimania, and that a band of robbers were hanging about road in front, so was waiting for protection, and enquired how many guns our caravan had. It ended by his accompanying us, and my telling off Zemila to cut him down if any attack was made. He disappeared that night, and from what villagers said, was, as I suspected, the leader of a gang. Prom this skirt along parallel to river. Several small villages Sighted, some high up on slopes of mountains on north, and about 16 miles get on openish and cultivated ground. * Sheomakai road. 11(31,0 roa(1 branches, the north via Mama Kulan, and south via Alawa,* both to Sulimania. Little to choose, by all accounts ; so, as our new companion recommended the southern, fYahara is, T believe, proper name. We took the other. Descend slightly to 18, where cross small tributary, and after another mile the river, here called Mashkhal,t flows due north between high, but not very steep, wooded mountains, with a few villages on slopes in distance, and path, leavins open, cultivated, undulating ground, enters small, gently-ascending ravine, with thick copse on both sides. Trees here thoroughly English,—oak, hawthorn, ash, wild roses, brambles, &amp;c. ; numbers of common wood pigeons. Emerge intc slightly opener ground at 20 miles and skirt along slopes; gentle ascent ^of hill on lelt; large valley with village of Dia, past which one path runs to Serambal on right (north). Reach crest at 23 miles, 4,700 feet. Near this found traces, 2 or 3 days old, of large body of horses picketed. Said by guide to have' been marauding Hamawands or Jafs. Along ridge for a mile, splendid view. Oak woods and deep valleys on either hand. That on south quite wild, and splendid mass of snow mountains. Kasha about 12,000 feet, and crest about 12 miles south beyond, with thickly-wooded spurs and ravines. On north large, partly cultivated valley; wooded mountains beyond. Cross ravine and wind up to saddle 25^ miles, 4,850 feet, whence roofs of Mama Kulan are visible, about a mile further on. Descend ravine thither ; small villao-e, 40 huts, and sort of serai ; got a little wattle-and-daub hut on roof to myself. ^ One man forced his way in, saying he was owner, whom I had already seen ;* took stock of my battery and departed rather hastily when I drew my revolver. So barricaded myself for night.20th March 1882. 6-30 a. m . to 2-45 p. m. From Mama Kulan (4,200 feet; 35° 43' N. 45° 48' E.,) to Sulimania (2,975 feet). General Direction—south-west, 21 miles. Snow again at night, but, as it was melting, made a start. Fully expected an attack from yesterday's companion's gang and agreed with my Patans that, if so, he was to be killed coiite que coute, Eor a mile follow course of brook, then over spur, cross some cultivation and descend to Tankabwa river, about 100 yards wide, and up which, for about ^ mile, we had to proceed for a ford, which is just ahove a small mill-dam. Several villages high on slopes, cross spur, and at 5 miles tributary with water-mills. Some cultivation and one or two villages here. (At river altitude is 3,150 feet.) Country wilder and ground roughish, with bold crag overhanging road to 8 miles, where there is straight ascent to 3,900 feet. Country now very open, with deep ravine, whose sides are all vineyards, and good # Harri l • . deal plough. This valley,* which runs south-east and north-west, is bounded on west by the Girjah range, and is about 8 miles wide; on steep slope of hills here are a wonderful lot of vineyards and fruit trees in places where they could never be irrigated. Descend, road wide and gravelly, skirting deep ravine, passing at 10 miles Naodeh (Aga Sheikh Mahomed, a big man for these parts) and Chinginia, and several other villages in sight further off; 12 miles, descent steep, into ravine, and down to Harrik Chai stream, 13 miles, 3,550 feet to 3,170 feet. Thence gradual ascent up small glen, ruins at 13| miles. Easy ascent to 15 miles, 4,150 feet; thence steep, winding path to crest, 16J miles, 5,250 feet. East slopes of Girjah have oak scrub (west bare), and number of donkeys bring ing it to Sulimania for fuel. Met a few Zaptiehs, with large batch of conscripts. Steep descent to 17 miles, thence down ravine to 18 miles, and over easy, cultivated ground to Sulimania, 20J miles. Sulimania is a squarish collection of mud houses, without one single p Au-f ^ prominent building to break the monotony; and, 2,975 feet.^ ' 0 1 u e indeed, exactly resembles the mud walls of nomad tents, with their black camel-hair roofs replaced by flat mud ones. Town said to contain 2,000 houses, but looks rather some thing like 1,200. Valley in which it stands is 10 to 12 miles wide, between Girjah on east and a lower range, marking the Kara Dagh, on west, and runs almost north and south. Got most excellent quarters in private house, whose owner, a Kurd, was absent, being a Modcni, near Sardasht; but to my surprise found my Austrian friend. Dr. Humpfell, was now here, and I had to move over to his quarters. The crops here were beginning to sprout and blossoms to show. Of all places visited, this stands pre-eminent for the utter state of anarchy which exists, and for the fanaticism of the population and dominant position of the Sheikhs (religious). A few Chaldsean Christians drag on a miserable exist ence. On one of their number dying lately, he had been disinterred by the popu lace, dragged through streets, and thrown to the dogs. The Mutaserrif, Achmet Yemar Beg, and the Commandant, Colonel Tewfik Bey, had recently made annual contract for rationing troops for ensuing season at something like three times bazar prices, of course sharing profits. This Colonel, an ignorant fanatic (who perpetually told his officers that any soldier asking for his pay should get the stick, and be told that prayer alone was to be thought of, that with money he would only commit follies and imperil his soul), was perpetually at logger heads with, but somewhat afraid of, Dr. ITumpfell, amost devil-me-care character, and who I wonder does not have his throat cut. The second month he was here, on repairing to the Colonel to ask for his pay for preceding, he was curtly told—'We have no money in chest; you can go.' Dr. Humpfell rejoined, ' It is nothing to me whether you have it in chest, or have to rob some one for it. Ilere is my contract, signed by the Sultan and Austrian Ambassador. I don't serve for love of you, and if my pay is not forthcoming, I am only too happy. I will start home to-morrow, and report through the Ambassador that you have broken the contract.' The pay was produced that afternoon. Shortly before, two soldiers had been sentenced to 100 blows of the stick, one for some small act of disobedience, the other for violating and killing two little38 children. Dr. Humpfell certified that No. 1 was too ill to endure punish ment, but that No. 2 was fit; was sent for and remonstrated with by the Com mandant to try and get latter off, ' as he says his nimaj four times a day.' Here, if you do this, you may do anything with impunity. Two battalions are quartered here, and one at Kara Dagh. Last year town was besieged for four days by the Hamawands, and would have fallen but for arrival of another battalion. Inhabitants had in first instance invited them, but subsequently feared admitting them. No walls to town, but the narrow lanes easily defended. Dr. Humpfell told me he had recently, when called in to attend * Tried as an experiment, and found one of the Sheikhs, seen a large case full of JVIartini- i could buy Winchesters at Rs. 25 Henri cartridges* (Government) destined for the Ha- propertVand* martinis for abm' 'k '! mawands, and reported this to Governor, who took no 30. A few imitations are said to be notice of it; and that within last week small caravans had twice been plundered close to town, and not a of the former, nor saw any of the soldier dispatched in pursuit. On the 23rd a caravan, 500 strong, which, relying on its numbers, had at tempted to come from Kifri, was totally looted, muleteers even stripped of clothes. The Mutaserrif, who had, the previous day, assured me that all roads in his dis trict were perfectly safe, now recommended either the Kerkuk or the Gulamber ■p . . ill one. From Sulimania the usual route to Baghdad Boutes to Baghdad. ig ^ Kevknk, the line of post and telegraph; Bagh 6 hours, Chemschemel 9 hours, Kerkuk 5 hours. This would, how ever, have forced me to return from Kerkuk along the already traversed line via Kifri, though it is also possible to travel down by the Tigris and Samarah shrine. Few villages on the route, and must trust to Arab camps. The direct, but little used, route to Baghdad via Kifri, is Simat 5 hours, Gor Tapah 5 hours, Bokan 10 hours, Kifri 12 hours; but road is described as very bad, and it traverses the Hamawand country. The third route, little used, is Moan Girujeh 6 hours, Ghulambar 5 hours, Dizyaish 6 hours, Pirhas 5 hours, Kani Chakal 7 hours (cross the Diala by raft), Khanikin 7 hours. Thence by the usual Kirmanshah road 100 miles to Baghdad. This is through Jaf country, and Mahomed Pasha's safe-conduct indispensable. The stages given here for Sardasht are different from those given above, Sulimania routes. KoniamaSi 7 hoUrS ' Birim P 7 hoUrs . Sardasht o hours. Also Kartshatan 7 hours, Dukan 5 hours, Choi Sandjak 12 hours. The same Tscherwader who gave these, calls it 15 hours to Pengwin, which is near enough, taking me 18, as it did, to do the 48 miles. The peak of Pema Gudrun, 10,000 feet, lies a few miles to north of town. Two or three raised mounds, similar to those called Kilai Iskande and Kilai Nadir Shah in Persia, are visible in valley. Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Ali Beg here, a most favourable specimen of Turk, and hated by Commandant as refusing to certify that one or tw r o rich recruits were unfit for his cavalry regiment (quartered near Mosul) for which he was recruiting. A great many fox-skins exported hence to Russia. One merchant sent me message not to attempt to move out without at least 40 men as escort, and to insist on Regulars, and not Zaptiehs. It seems believed here that there is a com pact with the Wali that the Hamawands are never to resist the Regulars, but may do as they please with the Zaptiehs. Also all the bazars are talking of some quarrel betwixt the Hamawands and some allies, as to the one-third share of loot due to the Wali, A detachment of 20 Jaf sowars, belonging to Mahomed Be^, son of Mahomed Pasha, being on point of returning to Gulamber, they, with two Zaptiehs, were ordered to accompany me. 24th March. 1882, Snowing in morning, so the Jafs said they were not going that day, but suddenly, about 10 a.m ., sent to say they were going. Loaded up and started, relying on a letter for Mahomed Beg, which I ostentatiously showed. My two Zaptiehs asked leave to go and get some food, and they would catch me up, so started with the Jafs. Found them the most insolent set of scoundrels I had yet met. Mounted on scraggy mares, with long lances and pistols; most had Martinis22 39 probably, left at home luckily. Several spoke Persian, which they availed them selves of to cross-question me and my followers, as to my object, valuables, &amp;c., &amp;c., one one-eyed ruffian openly thrusting his tongue into his cheek when I spoke of my being on a visit to their Chief.

On going to complain to Governor his greeting was, ' He was overjoyed at this, as it gave him the pleasure of seeing me once again,' the brute! My Zaptiehs were ordered up, and declared to my face I had given them a rupee each and dismissed them, saying the Jafs sufficed. Subsequently they confessed they were afraid to go. Governor sent that evening to tell me he had dismissed the Zaptiehs, and would send a lieutenant and 15 men to escort me. Humpfell and merchants advised me to go to Kerkuk, and that I would find Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Ali at Bayian, who was to be trusted, and would have me safely escorted to Kerkuk.

From Sulimania to Mama Kulan, 21 miles. As by daybreak, which was cloudy and hazy, there were no signs of pro mised escort, and the same Zaptieh whom the Governor swore he had discharged for deserting me, appeared and said that he and one other only had been w r arned to attend me, I started my baggage off with my orderlies to take the back i track to Pengwin, a course I had determined on in the event of any further tricks of the Governor, feeling far safer alone amongst the Kurds than in these nominally semi-civilised districts. Waited till 7 a.m . without any one else appearing or any news of the Zaptiehs, so cantered off, overtaking my baggage iiear crest of Girjah range, where a wood-cutter told us all the bazar were talking of our ' escape from the Jafs,' as he termed it. Reached Mama Kulan without molestation. 261A 'March 1882. 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. From Mama Kulan to Pengwin. Sent off letter by villager to Banah Chief, asking him to send notice of my coming to the Murivan one. Marched 5 a.m . to try and clear the thicker copses before travellers would be expected to traverse them,—the only differ ence in route being that at 18 miles from Pengwin at small ravine, turned off to left, fording the Yahara, which was now passable, and continued along the slopes' over rfght bank by an easier, but in one part artificial and somewhat dangerous, track, to opposite village of Hasilyn, where re-crossed to left bank and rejoined former road.40 Put up most hospitably by the Modeni, Achmet Beg, who informed me that an express had come to him from the Governor of Sulimania, the day after my arrival there, for an exact account of my doings, movements, &amp;c., &amp;c., to be reported upon at once. 27th March 18S2. 6-15 a.m. to 12-15 p.m. From Pengwin (4,750 feet) to Murivan (4,725 feet). General Direction—south-east, 18 miles. Five or six Tufangchis accompanied me. Up small stream which flows through village for a mile, 5,050 feet, then descend another small stream, emer^in 0, 3 miles near village Ardana at south side of 13imansuchai \tilley, which is here 2 miles wide and flat; at 4 miles cross small stream, frontier ; 5 miles, small spur. Deserted fort, Kula Tapa, 6 miles; 2 miles left (north), ruined fort of Mirawar ; 2 miles further north-east, large snow ranges, Paizad and Bardarash, to east j 8^- miles low spur, and at 10 miles roads divide, west one to Ahroman, 2 days, the east one to Murivan, valley marshy; and 11 miles head lake, into which both from north and south ends the streams flow. Said to be an outlet on west side, but could perceive no gap in the chain of mountains, along slopes of which 5 or 6 fair-sized villages are dotted, and which descend almost into lake. About 13 miles a track branches off to Zif, 3 hours, belonging to Shahzada Azam Beg. Large . A good deal «f ploughing going herd of cattle* and lots of duck on lake, which is on; ploughs followed by large num- rather marshy round the sides, and about miles bers of white gulls. j on g 21 a t widest portion. Through small defile and low spur, at 16 miles, skirt rocky slope of edge of lake, and reach Murivan, 18 miles.

From M urivan (4,725 feet •, 46° 19' E., 35° 31' N.) To S heikh A ttar (5 ,750 feet; 46° 35' E., 35° 35' N.) General Direction—east, 21 miles. Lovely grazing ground throughout these valleys. Accompanied by the naib, to whom gave watch, with about 30 Kurds as escort, of whom I with difficulty got rid of the chief lot. For 6 miles skirt foot of low range on left (north), 1^ hours to north is village called Gul Suzan Salassi, celebrated for its onions, which are sent to Teheran. Pass couple of small villages; tremendous croAvd of storks' nests ; at 6 miles descend, crossing brook at / miles ; thence over spur and down to right bank of Girdalan, which here turns through gorge due south ; mountains here descend to river-bank; 9 miles picturesque brick bridge, 3 arches, so dilapidated fit for footmen only; very high, bold, granite cliff over hangs it on north ; thence skirt up valley of tributary, the main stream going in at 9J miles up lovely glen, well wooded, with brush wood and creepers. Pour- teen miles relieved escort, and 15 miles reached foot of Garan Pass, o,500 feet, ziz- zag and rocky in parts, to crest 16^ miles, 6,900 feet, thence view of a perfect sea of snow-peaks to the front as far as eye could reach,—Sultan Achmet to north east, and Sirkamal to south, being about the nn&amp;t S most prominent. { Descent steepish to 17i miles, deal of shale cropping up on hills, 6,000 feet, thence along edge ot small stieam, with a which look as if they contained ^tle plough, to Shtikh Attar, 20 J miles, a wretched collection of about 20 poverty-stricken hovels.41 Camped on roof of one. Villagers here complained much of exactions of Gover nors and of damage by Jafs and other Ilyats. 29ih March 1S82, 6 a.m., to 3 p.m. From Sheikh Attar (5,750 feet) to Barodar (6,725 feet). General Direction—east, 27 miles. Up ravine, north-east of north, and ascend to miles to 6,125 feet, circling round hill on east village, thence descend by brook to 3 miles, near where strike right bank of Katawal stream, which here turns due south, and skirt *ap its right bank to 5^, where cross. A ford, barely passable just now, and oad strikes off south-east over hills from 4th mile, for Kalaju ; cross a couple cf tributaries; at 7 miles path bears off north-east for Doissa, 7 hours, and another due south to Kalaju about 11 miles, and a second at 12 miles north-east to Doissa. Open valley to north-east with much plough on slopes, which are easy. Artificial mound Kilai Nadir Shah in gorge here, 13 miles over low spur, de scending into valley of small brook, tributary of Kalaju river. Over another spur, 6,850 feet, descending at 17 miles into a new valley with small stream, 6,500 feet; where taken needlessly 1J miles up glen to Dera Khushkar for convenience of '-uides, who wished a relief, they explaining this was end of Murivan district. Allans; Peak due south. Followed back down one and up another stream, and over saddle, 21 miles, 7,350 feet; descend to 7,150 feet, and down side of stream, south-east, to 25 miles, whence you tack due north up another glen to. Barodar, 27 miles, 6,725 feet, 50 houses. Got fair quarters for self and follow ers in big room of mud hut. Lots of sheep hereabouts. 30th March 18S2. 6 a.m . to 2-45 p.m. From Barodar (6,725 feet) to Sihna (5 ,300 feet). General Direction—south-east, 30 miles. Heavy snow at night, which had not extended far to east, however ; road easy, retraced steps 2 miles to 25th mile of yesterday's march. About 3 miles stream flows south, and road circles to left and ascends course of another stream, ascending by spur from 6,550 feet to 7,300 feet in about } fiaile. Thence steepish descent into bed of stream flowing east, 6,925 feet, and work along banks, crossing and soon after re-crossing to left bank at 10 miles. Here road to Sihna branches off south-west up valley of biggish tributary, and a mill and some other signs of inhabitants appear. From Dera Khushkar it had been wild and barren; sheep only signs of life; 12 miles re-cross to right bank, and 15 miles stream flows east under Doissa, a village of 200 houses, whilst road bears more south-east. It is noticeable that this stream flows, if native accounts, which were rather mixed, are correct, into the Kizil TJzen, which falls into the Caspian, the only one I met with that did so in my journey,—all others, except the few flowing into Lake Urmia, being tributaries of the Tigris and Karun, and falling into the Persian Gulf. A high range, Kalwaya, to north, across which the Sakuz road leads. Another Kilai, Nadir Shah, J mile east of road, ascend open ground, pic turesque Kalakan peaks east, 2 miles to about 18 miles, 6,250 feet; descend and cross a new brook flowing east; at 20 miles couple of villages, and at 23-24 miles a couple more brooks which join just below, and on banks of which are some gardens, and Arena and Nouera, villages, higher up. Ascend to 26 miles, 5,900 feet; then open cultivated valley and gentle descent to Sihna, 30^ miles. High peaks of Owada and Owa Anga to west, whose spurs fall to the town. High range, about 10,000 feet, Dooshand, to south-east. Put up by ^ 18 ' e . some Native Christians; good house. Sihna, capital of the Province of Kurdistan, has about 4,000 houses, though I have heard it called 7,000. It is under the Zilla Sultan, at Ispahan, and lias another Shahzada as Governor (name lost), now absent, and Naib Mustafa Kuli Khan at present in authority. A very handsome building, on small rising ground, in middle of town, is half barrack, half palace. The former Governor, Ali Akbar Khan. Kurd, is at Teheran in a sort of surveillance. Visited his son Sulieman Khan, who has a fairly large house and was very civil. There are about42 40 Christian families here, and a Bishop, or Khalifa as he is called, hut he lives in rather native style. Garrison of two regiments and some guns here; usual armaments and want of uniform. Government sent large procession of servants to escort me about when visiting, and who naturally expected baksheesh. Sihna is especially famous for carpets. These are generally rugs. Size oi a large hearth-rug, 9 by 4J feet, but sometimes in long rolls, 18 by 4 feet. The rough, and in some respects nicest looking, are cheapest, Rs. 6 to 8 ; whilst a thick and heavy, but rather smooth kind, are about 100 to 150krans, i. e., Rs. 40 to Rs. 60 each. The durable nature of their colouring is entirely owing to using mineral dyes. They are made by the Ilyats, or wandering tribes. Routes from Sihna. r Sihna to Kirgowa Dehgulan Kusba Hanakussi Hamadan hours.

Am still doubtful whether it was really owing to natural difficulties or to fears of the inhabitants that I was told this was now impracticable, both by the Naib, Suleiman Khan, and the Christians. No objects of interest in town, two blue-inlaid minars alone worthy of attention. 1st April 1882. 6-30 a.m . to 3-30 p.m. From Sihna to Takt Sulimani. General Direction—south, 34 miles. Cross stream bounding town, and some vineyards. Small defile 2 miles, and descend towards river, Shirwan or Dyala,* * Called Eakama here. which ford at 5 miles, stirrup-deep; thence passing several small villages along river-bank, skirting low shaley spurs from Dooshand chain, and always within J mile of stream; at 7 miles, cultivated valley and three villages on opposite bank (west), and isolated hill, Kilai Amurula Khan (ruined), said to have spring close to summit. Fourteen miles, Kilai Nadir Shah, said to be hollow; could only find smallish cave. Twenty-one miles, river, here called Rohawa, disappears through gorge to west. Cross a couple of spurs, 5,125 feet. About 23 miles some bold peaks on right (west); descend slightly cultivated valley; skirt small stream to 27 miles, where it joins Gobaro river, and flows due west towards Sitargu, a prominent mountain 5 miles in that direction. Thence skirt up the right bank of Gobaro, to which spurs of mountains descend. Thirty- two miles, sharp ascent over spur, ruined fort, and wind chiefly downwards over another small spur to Takt Sulimani, 33^ miles. 2nd April 1882. 6 a.m . to 3-30 p. m. From T akt Sulimani (4,850 feet; 47° 5' E.) to Kamiram. 33 miles. One or two nice-looking villages in glens across river of the Sirkub and Yamunan Mountain on west. Close to village saw unmistakeable coal crop ping out. Continue along right bank, nasty path and precipice about f mile;43 at 2 miles descend and cross stream by wooden bridge and along spurs ; some height above left bank a good deal of oak scrub hereabouts, and numerous donkeys taking it to Silma for firewood. At 7 miles descend and skirt river 4 A few villages, and signs of cultivation. Twelve miles main stream comes in from past, and path of bank leads to Pir Mogan; 16J miles, up to which road has skirted river, road to Juanro branches olf to west. Cross stream soon after, knee-deep. About 19 miles, broad valley ; village Asawal, &amp;c., to west. Skirt up side valley to north-east at 21 miles, 5,900 feet, and at 23 miles Showery ay. crest ^ 6 } 500 feet, rather deep snow. Thence descend, skirt right bank of stream to 28 miles, where cross wide valley of Loabush to west. Re-cross to right bank at 31 miles by few huts called Bia, and at 33 miles Kamiram. Country here wide open valley, with sharp rocky ranges. Kalam Sheikh Garran 6 miles east, and others on all sides, 8 or 10 miles apart. Sort of caravan-serai here ; very wet afternoon. Had intended to strike west via Juanro, whence Tamirama 5 hours, Takana Shu 5 hours, Jagiran 5 hours, Zohab 5 hours, was one road open, and a second joined in to main road near Karind, but was dissuaded by villagers, who declared it was folly to attempt it without strong escort, and that both Ali Akhbar Khan at Howansar, and an Aga near Juanro, who had about 10 sowars, would undoubtedly waylay me. So decided for Kirmanshah. Srd April 1882. 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. From K amiram (5,275 feet) to K akasan (4,825 feet). 22 miles. Rained heavily all night, started late in consequence, and great doubts being expressed if rivers would prove fordable. Plat road whole way; ford stream 3 miles, girth-deep, and at 7 miles main stream, * just at entrance of tolerably wide gorge, * Karasu. through very precipitous rocky hills of 1,200 feet. Large valley extends eastward; numerous small villages, whence comes this main stream. In looking for ford got into quicksand in middle of river, under water, and escaped with difficulty when almost quite exhausted.

Eleven miles emerge in wide valleys, 4 miles wide, dead flat, and apparently cultivated, but almost under water; a few small villages and old fort on left; at 17 miles pass detached hill; 19 miles strike river- bank 5 again, Karasu. Skirt along this on left bank, one or two side streams almost unfordable, and into small village of Kakasan, with ruined mud fort at 22 miles, dead beat with cold. Put up in small hovel with several calves, lambs, and six or seven of the family, and change before an admiring audience. One curious minar 6 miles due west of this. 4tk April 1882. 6-80 a.m . to 3-30 p.m. From K akasan to K irmanshah (5,150 feet; 47° 13' E., 34° 19' N.). General Direction—south, 32 miles. City of Kirmanshah clearly visible, south by south-west about 15 miles, but road makes long detour. Due east to foot of hills for 5 miles, one deep nulla to ford on way. Taki valley and curious f Parao Mountain, 5 miles, south- g p r i n g below.f Lots of duck about marsh just east, said to contain a lot of game. ^ Then foot; of east ^ nassino' several villages to 14 miles. Cross spur, 5,500 feet, through giassy basin in hills, and emerge hy gorge, 18 miles. Here a road hrani'hes to richt direct to city, and river crossed hy boat. Continued on parallel to course of river; at 22 miles pass Ferras. Strong springs, gardens, and in gorge, near site of ancient Tak-i-Bostan, 23 miles, ruined rampart, quadrilateral, regularly laid out like Mniveh mounds; 25 miles Kila Amandia, /u where Shah dresses before entering city, and at 28 miles strike bridge and line of telegraph of the Teheran road. Brick bridge, 6 arches. Thence due west, flat cultivated ground to city gates, 32 miles. Was met by servant of English Agent, Vakil Aga Mahomed Khan. Kirmanshah has 4,600 houses and fairly built with large bazdrs; stands in broad valley, hills near on south, but on north about 10 miles distant, and this valley, chiefly cultivated, extends 12 or 15 miles east, in direction of Teheran, The Karasu, on whose banks are some large gardens and a palace, is a tributary of the Karun. Some handsome gardens and summer-houses in ravines to south of city, and large graveyards to west. The Governor, Shazada Abdulla Mirza, Hushnat-ul-Doulah, who is to be relieved shortly, was most civil to me.* Our Agent * Called on 6tb. here, Aga Mahomed Khan, is a man of greatest consequence, and large landowner, having 30 or 40 villages, some said near 100. Eine-looking fellow of 45, has been to Constantinople, and intends visiting India. Was lodged in a capital separate house of his, with courtyard and fountain. Dined that night in very civilised fashion at his house, where I met Surtip Bolair, aErench generaf in Persian service for 35 years, formerly an engineer officer; had served in Algeria, and was at siege of Herat; was now returning to Ispahan after reporting on frontier. Aga Mahomed Khan has a book, started by his father, in which he makes his guests (and apparently he entertains every single European who has ever passed), commencing with Sir. F. Williams and others, of the Boundary Com mission in pre-Crimean days, enter tbeir names. Would strongly recommend any future travellers to obtain introduction through him to the neighbouring chiefs, to nearly all of whom he is well known. The Souj Boulak muleteers, who had accompanied me to Sulimania, there volunteered to come on to this for 110 beshliks, i. e., Rs. 55; and now engaged to Baghdad for Bs. 50 for the four. At Tak-i-Bostan, 8 miles north-east of city, in mountains, are four rock- carvings, doubtless well kmrwn, though I do not remember having seen any mention of them. Two are figures of court ceremonies, and two hunting ones— deer and pig. The king, who is always depicted as four times the size of other mortals, in the former on horseback at full speed discharging arrows, and^ in latter in a boat doing the same. Line of elephants beating the game to him. Most spiritedly executed. Bather fine bazars here, and many European goods for sale. Main line K ikmanshahto especially of pilgrims, for traffic betwixt Mahidasht. Persia and Baghdad. Besides the main road chadasvar. Sir-i-Pul and Khanikin, another track, Hiawana. seldom used, via Mendali,t exists, but there are Amiaw-Oi 110 v ill a o es f or three marches, and just now Thence three district is unsafe. A Kulhour Kurd, Buga Ali Mendaii t0 Khan, of Goawar, near Kulago, having for (Luristan.) robbery been sent prisoner to Teheran, his brother, Mand Ali Khan, with 100 horse, infests that district, in which he has burned all villages, and retires across frontier if threatened. Had arranged to attempt that route, and Aga Mahomed Khan promised me some horsemen for it, but, at last moment, partly from the change of Governor being likely to cause a few rows, and partly from continued rain, which without tents would, as it was yet excess ively cold, have made it rather trying, he dissuaded me. t K iemanshah to Mahidasht (a) Kulago (a) Goawar (6) Zirna (b) Chamsurat (b) Mendaii (Turkish) (a) Warazaro (b) Takohia (a) Khan Agam (a) Baghdad (a) (а) Supplies.

B.—The road from Kirmanshah to Baghdad having been fully reported on, I give brief notes only.] Heavy rain and hail on evening (6th). Sent on kit, breakfasted with the Asfa, and trotted on. Low hills for 8 miles, where cross ridge, several small villages and cultivation in hollows. At 11, into large open plain, numerous villages, no trees, chiefly cultivated. Mahidasht, 174 miles, few huts, and toler able caravan-serai. Boad follows telegraph line whole way to Baghdad.% ^ •m 45 8th April 1682. 5-45 a.m . to 1 -45 p.m. From Mahidasht to H arunabad. General Direction—south-west. Muddy; 4 miles strike foot hills, southern limit of valley; oak scrub here; firewood for Kirmanshah, Here met tribe of Ilyats migrating towards east, Sheikh Ishmaili Kurds. Insolent-looking lot of blackguards, rather handsome but bold-looking women, large flocks of sheep, few horses, not many rifles visi ble,—about a hundred fighting men in all. Through defile gentle ascent, formed by south-west boundary line of valley which stretches north, far as eye can see, closing in to south chain to 10 miles, where emerge into a plain 5,750 feet. Steep scarp, facing south-west to both sides of road; old wall here. Likely spot for a Persian force to make a stand Here passed about thirty sowars, followed by small bands, sixty or eighty in all, of excited villagers, Kulhour Kurds, two of whose number had been murdered last night by the Sheikh Ishmaili, and whose * Yair Alii total extermination they vowed; save the sowars, they were badly armed. The servant* sent by the Aga to help me recommended our pushing on, or it would be risky for the baggage, so I was unable to see the fun. 9 th April 1882. 6 a.m . to 1-30 p.m. Prom Harunabad (4,800 feet) to Karind (5,350 feet). General Direction—north-west, 19 miles. Never heard result. Eourteen miles cross low hills, attempt at regular road- blasting, &amp;c.; 17 miles wind through hillocks and broken ground; at 19 miles low spur, turn to right, round spur at 20 miles, and Haranabad 22 miles. Large valley south-west, chain here 4 miles off. General direction of valley north-west. Dirty serai; put up in private hut. Touch of fever from my ducking of the other day. A Kilai Iskander, over village, Fort of Mahomed Hussein Khan here in ruins; deserted 1J years ago by Persians. Up fairly open valley 2 miles wide. Little cultivation, gangs of armed men watching sheep. Oak scrub on range (Kohyar) to south-west 10 miles. After crossing low downs, turn corner of Kutrahabad village; thence wider and better-cultivated valley, rising to Karind, 0 , o , ^ miles, terraced, over gorge, foot of bold pictur- stfgeT'fttm^Kari 'J 1 : 'owara, cst l ue scar P. northern side of valley about 12 miles Chyunush, Dehdar, Kirmansiiah distant; road, on which were a lot of Ilyats migrat- iiyats of thereabouts are Jafs and i n g ) leads through gorge to Gowara.f This is capi tal of Karind Kurds, who, like the Kulhours, are, exceptionally to the common rule, Shiahs; 1,000 houses, and an imposing but ruinous and dirty serai. Good quarters in private house. On these caravan roads nearly all inhabitants seem to be sort of lodging-house keepers, and though welcoming you as guests, expect payment of supplies, and small present for use of house. Chief man here is Kurrim Khan. The Chief of place is now hukamat of Siripul, to guard it against the Hamawands. 'When first ordered last year, on his representing that the Persians here had only muzzle-loaders to oppose to the Martinis of these tribes, was at first imprisoned, but, thanks to mediation of our Vakil, released and put in command of the frontier. 10th April 1882. 5-30 a.m . to 4-30 p.m. Prom Karind to Siripul (2,300 feet). General Direction—north-west, 29 miles. Continue up valley 8 miles, 5,300 feet, enter bed of Nuroula stream; wooded rocky cliffs on both sides, pass Iskander's Fort and Yurabya or Mian Lek, 15 miles. A lot of Sirbaz in it. Passed Hamawand and Lak Ilyats, some of whom had Martinis, eyed my battery very hard; heard the term ' Martili,*' which is a generic name for breech-loaders in these parts, fre quently repeated, and a knot were evidently undecided whether to follow us, but from their proceedings were apparently short of ammunition and did m /46 not come on. Seventeen miles stream cuts through deep chasm to south-west and well-constructed zigzag road, modern, takes you down from 4,100 to 3,150 feet, at Pat-i-Tak, a serai about 20 miles; a good many travellers putting up here. Regular change into spring at once. Above buds barely showing, here waving corn, green willows, wild flowers, and flies. Several caravans here. Mountains wild, bold, and rocky. This pass, midway up which is the Tak-i-Shirin, a Roman-looking arch, would undoubtedly be the first strong position for a Persian army on the defensive, and is geographically in some respects the natural frontier. Down right bank, crossing stream at 25 miles, and through razor-backed gorge, and round serai, 26J miles. Large corn-fields on every side, but inhabitants all dwellers in black tents. No regular villages. 'Wild , o tt i • rocky mountains to north; Siripul* bridged, 29 * liight bank of Hulwan river. m -n ^ i • i , miles. Few huts and filthy serai, crammed with Sirbaz, with whom I put up,—the Surtip, Ali Morad Khan Karindi, being in camp about a mile off; 2 battalions and 6 guns here, but antiquated armaments. 11th April 1882. 5-30 a.m . to 12 noon. From S ieipul (S ,300 feet) to K asr-i- S hirin (1 ,700 feet). General Direction—west, 18 miles. Corn-fields and black tents to 3| miles; escorted by captain to Sheikh Sherif, 3 miles ; thence 6 sowars, over rolling gravel, undulations more or less parallel to Hulwan all day. Some sticky clay in hollows, bare and deserted ; just the place for marauders. At 7,11,12|, and 14 miles are fortified towers, newly built, or camps of Sirbaz, holding ground, much as we did the Khyber, since mas sacres of last year. About 13 miles, curious, low, sharp, paralled ridges north-west, where road passes through second of these, are remains of aqueduct. This, I see, is described in Route Book as 'wall of Cyclopean masonry containing two rocky mountains.' The ridges so designated are not 20 feet high. From 15 t PassedMoradi Il y at.„„ m arch. ^ 7 ™jns of ancient city t At 18 miles tort and villages ot Kasr-i-Shinn. Large camp and guns here—about 1,200 men, I should guess. Small village, 80 houses, on right bank of Hulwan. Got good quarters in private house. Had long talk with a Sirbaz on road. His 32nd year of service. Declared he felt great friendship both for English and Russians. 12t/i April 1882. 6 a.m . to 12-30 p.m. From K asr-i- S hirin (1,700 feet; 45° 40' E., 34° 30' N.) To K hanikin (1,250 feet; 45° 30' E., 34° 20' N.). General Direction—south-west, 16 miles. A dozen Jaf horsemen, with lances and Martinis, sent by the Surtip's orders, accompanied me. Road after winding close to river for IJ miles leaves it, and leads over gravelly, undulating, broken ground, with most lovely grass and pasture. Enormous masses of sweet-scented clover, knee-deep, untouched by animals, as all hurry over this district. About 3 miles tower and camp of Sirbaz, and at 8 miles village of Sabyi, Persian frontier post, merely a loopholed mud wall, with a burned village round it, destroyed by the Hamawands last year. Lovely valley to south-east, apparently deserted. Escorted hence by frontier guard, Kurds of the Karind Chief's particular lot, J armed with X Hussein Ali his Naib here. Werndles reaching Turkish frontier; tower, with Zaptieh guard, an excellently built affair. At 11 miles small fort, Kila Kushla, also garden 1 mile north on same ridge. Undulating pasture to 15 miles, where see gardens, very large new build ing and enclosure, and town of Khanikin at sixteen miles. Stopped and had to pay 2 krans per head, receiving no end of stamped receipts in return, as quarantine dues. No medical examination required; merely had to pay, and there is an end. Also had to pay 2 krans per head as passport fees ! Formerly large bridge, now in ruins, several serais and coffee-houses. Forded stream, passing some lovely gardens, mass of blossom, and put up in brand-new serai on south-west of town, unused and clean. Lovely evening. Seven hundred47 houses. Governor and two companies Regulars and Zaptiehs. Country now merging into plain, hills low and easy, climate quite different, and a few palm trees beginning to show in gardens. IBth April 1882. 5-15 a.m . to 12 noon. From Khanikin (1,250 feet) to Kizil Robat (900 feet; 45° 14' E., 34°, 10' N.). General Direction—south-east, 18^ miles. Open corn-fields, tents, Jebel Hamrim, stony gentle slopes at 7 miles, 1,425 teet, then undulating, deserted; another ridge of Jebel Hamrin at 12| miles, 1,200 feet, gentle descent, lovely pasture, masses of brilliant scarlet poppies and buttercups. Seventeen miles small canal, hence water-cuts and cultivation to Kizil Hobat. Eight Zaptiehs, starting daybreak, patrol till they meet similar lot from next At four miles, road to Mendaii, stage, close to Dyala, which is much flooded; Jaf T^i'- « i country beyond. News in that Mahomed Pasha, J at Lliict, had been murdered by a young cousin, Aziz Beg, whose father he had killed years ago. Surprised and stabbed in 16 places at night, and camp looted. Mahomed Pasha, his son (of Gulamber), had attacked Aziz Beg^s lot, killing 25, but losing 15. Both preparing for further fighting, Aziz Beg s faction, though weaker, being richer. Two serais 600 houses in village; got fair quarters in room on roof. 14th April 1683. 5-15 a.m. to 11-30 a.m. From Kizil Robat (900 feet) to Siiahraban (700 feet; 45° 4' E., 34° 0' N.) (assumed). General Direction—south-west. Sun now too high to take double meridional attitude with sextant. Last D. meridional attitude of sun obtained on 13th being (corrected) 129° IG'. Open and cultivated to 7 miles, then ascent, gravel ridge, easy slopes ; as usual Jebel Ilamrin. Cross at 8 miles, whence Shahraban is visible, 1,000 feet, then broken earth and sandstone ravines to 11 miles, then open; water-cuts and cultivation at 12 miles; deep canal brick bridge at 12J miles; Shahraban 17 miles. From crest, which, as well as the ridges of yesterday (Jebel Hamrin), all run south-east and north-west. Deli Abas is visible 8 or 9 miles north. But little or no water this march. As yesterday, patrols of 6 Zaptiehs escort and change midway; 300 houses, tremendous number of storks' nests' good quarters in serai, upper room; 2 or 3 other serais. 15th April 1882. 4-45 a.m . to 1-80 p.m. From Shahraban to Bakuba (700 feet; 44° 47' E., 33° 43' N.). General Direction—south-west, 26 miles. A few gardens on west of town, then entire march open, flat, tolerablv cultivated ground; a good many, but seldom deep, water-cuts and palm groves, for which the 34th degree seems the northern limit, marking out villages exactly as in marches near Jedaidah. About 20 miles, larger groves on light ('west) mark River Dyala. Bakuba quite hidden in walled palm groves, which enter at about 25 miles; 800 houses, covered bazar, capital quarters in cleanish serai, of the usual pattern along the Hillah road, but surrounded with gardens, lots of fleas. Ihree serais here; 300 of the above houses are inhabited by Zaptiehs; Mutaserrif, Hassan Effendi. 16th April 1882. 4-45 a.m . to 12-15 p.m. From Bakuba (700 feet) to Baghdad. General Direction—south by south-west, 33 miles. A mile of streets and lanes, cross Dyala by bridge of 12 boats, skirt right bank to 4 miles, near where cross remains of large Nahrwan canal, and strike across desert, road scarce distinguishable but for telegraph; mirage all around.48 At 14 miles, Khanhein Sar. a few hovels, water brackish. Here left kit to follow, and cantered on ahead. Not one feature en route, but a few old canal mounds at 18 and 21 miles, near latter of which is ruined enclosure. At 30 miles north-west corner of Baghdad, old fortifications. Re-sold my horses at Baghdad, getting Rs. 150 for the grey I had ridden, and Rs. 100 for the other and the pony. Originally they had cost Rs. 485- though one had died, I only lost Rs. 235 on the transaction. They were never once groomed throughout, and looked at end almost as well as at be«innino'. Entirely shod with the Arab plate, which is not so bad as it looks, and, thanks to nalbunds in these parts paring toes more than we do, they seldom stumble. Ihe servant 1 had hired, Amoudi, got Rs. 25 a month and food. He rode one of the baggage mules, which, by the way, were almost invariably yahoos. Spent the day with Nawab-ud-Dowlah, commonly called the ex-Kino* of Oudh, and even addressed, in a letter he showed us from the Ambassador at Constantinople, as ' Your Majesty.' In reality, he was once one of the pre sumptive heirs only failing the succession going in elder branch. He is a charming old man; has about £10,000 a year. Although with him, was onl V allowed distant view of the Shiah shrine of Kazumane, 5 miles from Baghdad on river-bank; gold plat eson domes; lovely building; tramway cars run to it lyzet Pasha had been despatched to quell rebellion in Yemen durin^ mv absence, but up to latest date had had rather the worst of it. Was invited to a review of the garrison by his successor, Edhem Pasha, a bluff soldier -like man,—total of all arms on parade, including 2 companies of Zaptiehs, bein^ 9o0 men ! ^00 of whom marched on mules that afternoon for the frontier to the south, 8 days' march, where Kuli Khan, the Suri Chief, was giving trouble. Ine most noticeable fact about present frontier line is that all these passes are well within the Persian boundary, and that it is a purely arbitrary and not anatural or geographical, demarcation. The watershed is far to east of it and one effect of all the upper valleys of the tributaries of the Tigris beino* across the frontier is to cause the nomads to be neither Turkish nor Persian subjects,—spendmg half of each year, according to the wants of their flocks, in either territory, ihis undoubtedly contributes much to the lawlessness of this territory, as they can so easily evade punishment by crossing the frontier when they are just as much at home on the one side as the other. I found, as a rule that, wherever there are regular villages, the roads are secure, the inhabitants bemg unable to evade the authorities; but that whenever you get into the Ilyat districts, you are told the roads are unsafe. This, no doubt, is from the facility with which they can evade punishment. The Arabs, also, are a far more knavish cowardly, though less bloodthirsty lot, than the Kurds in general, and will not dream of attacking unless in overwhelming numbers, and fonder of petty pil fering than of large raids. Turkish troops, who are more cautious with the Kurds, unhesitatingly attack any number of Arabs. In travelling here, with your poorer hosts, the value of supplies and 5 or 6 krans for lodging is expected. Also, with all escorts, 1 kran per man a dav nnrl if regularly attached to you, their food also is expected. People in these parts are frugal and com scarce, and this is regarded as munificent.

One Crimean bucket-shaped zinc canteen more than sufficed for whole party. Took tea before starting, and chuppatties and handful of dates or raisins in holster, and no regular meal till after arrival—much the best plan. Best kit I found was, flannel shirt, serge blouse, cotton cord breeches, knickerbocker stockings, and either shooting-boots and puttis or ' Field ' boots. Useful to have pair of easily-fitting ones, and of slippers adapted for walking for paying visits, when shoes have to be removed. Wore a posteen in cold weather, an Arab Abba which hid all, and head-dress of country, fez, kula, or turban. It is necessary to have some undress uniform for visits of ceremony. Found hunting-saddle, pic-nic head-stall and wallets, with pad strapped on, on which the cloak is carried, the most serviceable. Tried military saddles tor my orderlies, but they had no one advantage over above, and in one case gave soreback, when mine did not.
