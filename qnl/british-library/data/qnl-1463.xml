The need for iudicial assistance in this Agency is really urgent and the sooner the proposed appointment is made the better. At the present time this Agency has no method of dealing with Court work other than by the Political Agent’s own exertions. He has no Assis tant and not even a Court Clerk. 2. As regards the number of cases, the volume of work cannot really be judged by numbers, but rather by the number of witnesses/the length of their statements, and the complications of the charge. In the last two months, I have had three major cases but have only finished one, and that involved over 50 pages of manuscript, evidence in three languages, and ? of course, many hours of prepara tion and study in addition apart from presiding in Court. I have had five other cases in the last three months, and the probability is that the cases will increase since we have not yet introduced traffic regulations v/hich are under consideration. 3 . I am appealed to in my capacity as Political Agent in which 1 have to endeavour to adopt an attitude other than that of Judge and to keep the points of view separate. In these circumstances I think the Judicial Assistant should take all Court work. 4. as regards the number of persons subiect to my jurisdiction, there are at present approximately 2000 Europeans and Americans, 4500 Indians, Pakistanis and other British protected persons, including persons not employed by the Kuwait Oil Company. \ Major A.L.A. Dredge, Esq.,M.B.E., /First Secretary, Persian Gulf Residency, gAHRAlN. NR(XSC3/34(9/48)) Foreign Office, S.W. 1 31st December, 1948 Dear Hay, We have been giving further thought to the proposal for the appointment of a Judicial Adviser to the Political Resident, which I believe you discussed with Beckett when you were last in England. I understand that powers already exist for such an Assistant to hold court in all or any of the political Agencies in the Persian Gulf, and from our point of view it would great^ly facilitate the problem of the future staffing of the Agencies if the appointnent were made. Moreover, it would leave the Political Agents, with more time to devote to commercial anu financial problems, of which the importance is now increasing. Arrangements could presumably be made w'hereby instead of the Political Agents hearing all tne cases at present, they should aeal only with cases of a petty nature and remand all serious cases to be heard by the Judicial Assistant to the Political Resident, who could tour the Agencies at appropriate intervals, sitting in each place for perhaps a week or a fortnight according to the nunber of cases which have accumulated. We have the impression that the volume of judicial work in the Gulf is increasing as a result of the increased size of the foreign population there, all of whom are justiciable in British Courts; and as many United States citizens are now involved, our judicial system will scab be unaer fire if it is not prompt and effective. It would help us to decide whether we could now make a case for the appointment of a full-time or part-time Judicial Assistant if we knew rather more about the proportions which Court work in the Persian Gulf has now assumed. I wonder, therefore, whether you could possibly let us have any statistics of the number of cases, if possible classified as cases of a petty or of a serious nature, heard recently in each of the Agencies? It would also be useful to have your estimate of the present population in the Persian Gulf States. Yours sincerely Sd. A.J.
