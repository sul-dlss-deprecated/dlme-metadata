We are therefore informing the Military Attache that we cannot vary our normal rule that payment must be made in advance of the despatch of the stores. Arrangements are being made for the India Office to be notified when we have received the cash. Until then, the actual issue of the stores should be held in suspense. Presumably, you will only wish to deal in your telegram to Mohamad Ali with the question of the channel of payment. W. Taylor, Esq., India Office, 4, Central Buildings, Matthew Parker Street, S.W. 1. W&gt; In that case, perhaps you will tell him that we will arrange to recover the cost of the grenades frcm the Persian Government’s sterling balance in London. As regards vouchers, would you please arrange for than to send them direct to the War Office (MGOF(R)), marked 'Repayment.

I : Dear Harrison, We spoke the other&gt;day about Pyman ! s letter to you of the 2th August^S^the supply from India of arms and ammunition for the Persian Army. You then told me that, so far as you were aware, the Persians were prepared to pay the full cost of these stores, ana I indicated that if this was the case I had no particular comments to make. There is, however, one point which I should have mentioned. I assume that India will collect the money from the Persians and give H.M.G. a corresponding credit through the Indian Defence Expenditure Plan accounts - the proceeds are presumably for H.M.G., since, by large all military stores in stock in India are to be regarded asH.M?G's property. If India is billing the Persians, she should be warned to ask for payment m sterling or rupees; certainly, il there is any suggestion that Persia should pay in rials, we would like to be consulted. I suppose we can take it that there is no question of the arms and ammunition being supplied on credit. I am copying this letter to Pyman (Foreign Office) and Morrison (War Office). Yours sincerely.
