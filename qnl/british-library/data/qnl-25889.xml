Later the same day the Political Agent discussed the situation with the Company*s representatives and s ugge sted that they should make an alteration which would much simplify the text of the letter which they proposed to address to each one of their disgruntled employees so as to make no mention of the cause of the present disagreement and further that they should grant the men half pay as an ex gratia payment for the period during which the discussions had been taking place* The representatives of the Company agreed to the Political Agent* s suggestions but stated that they rrsist obtain the formal approval of the General Manager* Unfortunately the management of the Company refused point blank to alter the letter or to grant any allowance to the men for the period they had been off duty* Thus when the Political Agent himself met the men on the 8 th he could but suggest that they should give the Company one lore trial' and not unnaturally they were not willing to do so.

Copy forwarded to ilis iv:ajesty 1 s minister, Jedda under Residency endorsement No.C/480 dated the 13th November, 1944. //£. ^ /3//'I 0 I s . About the 20th of October Mr. C.A. Hobstrom the local representative of the Arabian American Oil Company brought L5r. Barker and Mr. Hosman of that Company to see me in con nection with the difficulties they were experiencing with recently recruited Indian artisan labour. They stated that 206 Indians had arrived at A1 Khobar via Bahrain from India for work on their Refinery project at Has Tanurah and that the men were dissatisfied with the conditions and stated that they would not work unless they were provided with cooked rations and had expressed their desire to return to India. I enquired what the difficulty had been with regard to the provision of a cooked ration and was informed that owing to bhip No.8 having been torpedoed in the Gulf of Aden the Company were very short of utensils and stoves and rations fop^bheir Indian artisan labour. They had hoped to introduce cooked food from the 15th of October but owing to the aforesaid circum stances this had not been possible. They said that they were doin£ everything in their power to meet the men f s demands but it must be understood that they had been caught at a disadvantage and that things ware not moving as smoothly as they had hoped. My advice was asked with regard to the men's demands to return to India and I said that if the men would not work and had clearly stated their desire to return to India then I saw no alternative but for the Company to facilitate their journey. The representatives of the Company stated that that was their own view but that they had desired to obtain my advice before putting it into practice. 2. Gome days later I had a further visit from the afore mentioned gentlemen who informed me that the majority of the Indians had decided to work and that there were only some thirtysix who were insisting on being repatriated to India. I informed the gentlemen that as faf as possible adequate /transporttransDort from Bahrain to Tn^1a ahonlfi ha arranged before the non wore brought over here as our housing position was i most acute and there was also the ratiomnp difficulty. On the i X w&amp;a informed that some thirtysix Indian ex-employees of the -irabian American Oil Company desired to see me. I interviewed two df their spokesmen and listened to their com plaint about the failure of the Company to provide ihem with cooked food and the inadequacy of the rations issued to them In lieu. I was shown a letter which was addressed by the Company^ representative in Bombay to each of‘the employees before he signed his agreement and I pointed out to the two men that the Company had not giver, any undertaking to provide cooked food from the 16th of October. They had stated that they hoped to be able to do so but that it was always possible that soaie delay might occur and that therefore the man were advised to bring their own cooking utensils. The Indians were very concerned about what they considered to have bean unfair treatment and stated that they did not know why they had been sent over to Bahrain. I contacted the Company^ representative here and gave it as my opinion that the Indians should be given che Company^ reasons in writing for having been removed from Bhahran. This was done and each individual was informed in writing that he had been discharged unaer Clause 12 of the Foreign Service agreement w for cause”. I again took the natter up with the local representative and suggested that the non would have a genuine grievance unless the ”cause” was clearly stated. Hr. Rodstrom undertook to forward my views to his principals at bhahran and I understand that this was in fact done though no change was made in the composition of the letter of dismissal. 3. Time went by and owing to lack of transport the thirty- six Indians remained in Bahrain being accommodated and rationed by the Company. Mr. Fedstrom had several conversations with me witn regard to their transport to India because shipping /appearedI by air* I did my best to persuade them to accept air passages but they refused on the grounds that they would be separated from their luggage* Some of them appeared to have passed their time in composing articles for Indian newspapers and petitions to the Protector of Emigrants. 4* Some few days ago I was informed that a further sixty Indian artisans had left work and were awaiting at A1 Khobar for onward transport to Bahrain en-route to India. I was informed that their conduct while there was very reprehensible and that they had come into conflict with the Saudi Police. They were* I understood, being accommodated in a large house or houses at A1 Khobar and were being rationed by the Company* The Company^ representative here complained that the Indians ware selling their rations and the plates with which the Com pany had provided them. They were said to have been taken from Dhahran to A1 Khobar as the Company had no wish for them to mix with their other employees and possibly persuade more men to cease work. 5# On the 7th Mr.. Hosman accompanied by Mr. Rodstrom called on the assistant Political Agent and intimated that they were making an effort at reconciliation and that a letter had been drafted which they hoped the Indian artisans in Bahrain would, be prepared to sign. The letter stated the Company’s view point with regard to what had occurred and made two conditions to be fulfilled as a preliminary to resumption of work. The first was that the Company would provide cooked food from the 11th of November and the second that the arti sans would not receive pay for the period that they had been absent from work. The Company’s representatives explained that rather more than 50 per cent of the original party of 206 had remained at work throughout and had put up with rather difficult conditions and had co-operated fully with the Company. The Company felt that some difference must be nade between /thoselo) = 4 = those men and men who had refused to co-operate in any way whatsoever, therafore they were not willing to grant them pay for the period they had boen absent from work. ' 6. Mr. Hadow was present at a meeting between the Com pany's representatives and the men on the 7th November and his Note which forms an enclosure to this Note explains what exactly took place at the meeting except that he has not recorded the fact that the men's spokesmen stated their desire to thank the Political Agent for the interest he had taken in their case and for having done all that was'possible to aid the n. 7. On the same day the Company's representatives called on sb with a view to enlisting my assistance and I gave it as my opinion that they should alter the wording ox'* their letter and that it ehould read as follows*- f, The Company are now prepared to provide you with cooked rations from November 11th and will be willing to grant you a gratuity of 60 per cent of the wages which you would have earned had you been at work during the period of these negotiations provided you return i to work immediately. Do you desire to accept these terms or do you desire to return to India?' You will note that I have advised a partial payment. Mr. Hosman said that he was in agreement with my view that some sort of payment must be made to the men, that he understood that it was the Company's intention to have given then a gratuity on their arrival in Bombay, that he would proceed to Dhahran to consult Mr. Ohliger^immediately, and that he hoped to be back the following day with the Company's acceptance of the sugges- . tion. I agreed to call a meeting of the 36 Indians for the following day and to explain to them in person the Company's new proposals and to use what influence I might have to bring about a reconciliation. 8* On the 8th November Mr. Hosman returned from Dhahran /with— the information that tne Company were not prepared to alter in any way the terms of the letter nor were they prepared to make the men any payment for the time which they had been away from work. I said that I was sorry to hear the Company^ uWX pnm t-fron and I really did not think that it be worth my while talking to the men# Hovreverj after consideration and in view of the Protector of kmigran^s telegram No. nil dated the 2nd Novemberj 1944 I decided to put the case as it stood to the Indians and hear what they might have to say# I therefore interviewed the men at 11-30 a.m. and explained the Company 1 s point of view and endeavoured to smooth things out during the course of a some 3i3 minutes talk with them collectively and individually# I suggested that having come so far they might see their way to giving the Company another opportunity of carrying out what they considered to be the terms of their original agreement# ULy words apparently had little or no effect as I was told later that they had all decided not to return to work. During the course of the meeting it came to my notice that the Company were no longer providing the men at A1 Khobar with rations and that possibly they hau even prevented a depu tatlon from coming to Bahrain to lay their grievances before mo. Immediate steps are being taken to ensure that a depu tation is permitted to come here and enquiries are being instituted with regard to the housing and feeding of the Indian artisans now at A1 Khobar# ,3d. T. Hickinbotham. 9-11-44.4 . I X attended a conference between 36 Indian ex- employ ees of Aramco and Mr. Hosman of the Company at the Indian Rest Honse at 9 a.m. to-day. The Indlaub had been given a letter by the Company o.xenng them re-employment on certain terms. The Indians were to give their reply at the conference. The Indians were inclined to reiterate their ill- treatment in Arabia and their ringleaders were obviously in n intransigent mood. I pointed out that this Agency had no a-i.thorxty to arbitrate in Aramco labour disputes but that I considered the offer made them a fair one. It was up to them to decide their attitude towards it. Various reasons were put forward as to why the Company s new offer was unacceptable, which I have detailed overleaf. The Company's letter is also appended. The consensus of opinion among the Indians was that they could not accppt the offer and X left the meeting. Sd. R.M.

Aramco officials sought advice some days ago regarding 206 Indian artisans recently imported via Bahrain who complained that Company had committed a breach of their contract by not feeding them on arrival. They all asked to be repatriated to India. Company were unable to commence feeding arrangements on the date they had hoped to owing to the loss of essential equipment and stores due to enemy action. Company were doing the best they could. i 3. From a cursory examination of a contract and a letter regarding messing issued to each Indian employee there did not appear to be any breach of contract. However I advised the Company to accede to their request and- said I thought only a small percentage v/ould in fact carry out their intention of returning. I was informed on the 22nd October by an official of Aramco that 38 were returning to India and that the rest were at work and appeared contented.
