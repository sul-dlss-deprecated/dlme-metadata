                           Tigris, on 7 June, after it was discovered that the vessel was carrying two African slaves. Commodore George Robinson, Commander of the Persian Gulf Squadron, refers to Arnold Burrowes Kemball's letter of 6 September (no. 249), in which Kemball recommended that the bugglah be released. Robinson reports that the bugglah has been released. He forwards a copy of a declaration by the vessel's nacodah [nakhoda], Rashid ben Zaid, which states that he, Rashid ben Zaid, has no claims against the captors.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x000014#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
