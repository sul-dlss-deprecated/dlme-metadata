It includes a brief description of these regions, outlines local British activities during the First World War to counter threats to their interests, and presents the current situation in Mekran and Sarhad. It also outlines proposals put forward by the Government of India in 1917 for reorganising the administration of Persian Baluchistan, with a view to protecting Britain's Indian Frontier and telegraph lines through Persia. This includes an explanation of objections put forward by the Foreign Office to these proposals.The rest of the memorandum is dedicated to the Quetta-Nushki railway extension to Duzdap [Z훮hed훮n]; it is considering a proposal for the destruction of this extension. To this end, it includes a short history of its construction, examines the economic and political advantages of the line, and considers the possibility of a further extension of the line into Seistan [S카st훮n].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Sarhad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mekran Coast </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Duzdap</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Railway lines</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000195#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
