Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan reports from Bala Murghab that a Russian disguised as an Afghan, with a guide, is on his way to Herat. He is supposed to be a spy. He also reports that orders have been given at Sheikh Junaid that a grazing tax of 2b per cent, will be levied on all Afghan sheep on the boundary. To enforce this Turkoman sowars are being sent along the frontier. He has sent word warning the inhabitants to keep their flocks away from the frontier.

Russian Forgery Case. —It is evident that the Russian subjects who were im prisoned in the forgery case reported in the Summary of the Diary No. 42 are not going to let matters rest. They are on their way to St. Petersburg to make com plaints. The Russian Legation is making enquiries from the Russian Consulate- General. It seemed likely that the Attache was to be made the scape-goat but now he has come to an understanding with the Russian Consul-General (for the con sideration of Roubles 10 , 000 ) that they will all hang together. Reception of Colonel Haig at Kuchan. —The Governor under instructions from the Governor-General arranged a reception for Colonel Haig. “ Fete Onomastique ” of the Czar. —This being the Fete Onomastique of the Czar—a parade of the Russian garrison was held in the morning when 90 recruits were sworn in.

Undue interference by Revenue Department. —As reported in the Summary of last week complaints are being received about the undue interference by the Revenue Officials. This week the Turbat Agent reports that Mirza Khalil Khan is intriguing to get the Karguzar removed and is working directly with the Russian Consul. He agreed to intervene on behalf of a man in a local case on condition he got Ts. 400 if successful. The residents of Kushk-i-Mehdi have complained about ill-treatment at the hands of the Revenue Sowars. Conduct of Russian Soldiers. —More robberies are reported in Meshed to have been committed by Russian Soldiers. About a month ago at Kuchan a Cossack was found dead in 'a well and it is locally reported that he fell down when escaping from a house where he and two others have violated a woman. The Governor has remitted Tomans 800 as compensation for his death. State of Roads. —Insured articles are now being accepted by the post in Khorasan. r~77 Z 'Z India, Foreign Secretary s ■A ! j.--.

The Karguzar has been exerting a considerable amount of pressure on Saiyid Hashim and the Governor-General who is at present on the most friendly ternis and being at the same time a grateful patient promised to Te his influence to settle the case. After endless trouble on the part of the Attache the case has been finally settled and Saiyid Hashim’s friends have agreed to pay Tomans 6,450 at once. Tomans 1,450 have been received and the balance is to be paid on Monday. I I would like to place on record that in the settlement of this case, to which we have also agreed, the Governor-General and Karguzar have rendered this Consulate the greatest assistance. H.

Arrival of Consul-General. — I arrived at Meshed, having been well received on 2 ist December December 18th at Knchan, where I exchanged calls with the Governor and the 1913, Karguzar. After lunch in the Zarkash garden I drove with Captain Thorburn, Major Marsh, and the Attache Haji Muhammad Sharif, to the Kaim Makam's garden, where I was received by the representatives of the Governor-General, the various Heads of Departments and the Russian Consul-General, who had come out to meet me. The istikbal ceremony was on an elaborate scale and is said to have given umbrage to the Russians. From Kaim Makam’s garden I drove to the Consulate-Geneal, through the city, accompanied by the istikbal procession. Abdul Hamid, the Russian Attache, did not accompany me to the house, but left the procession and returned to the Russian Consulate-General.

It has now been sent to the Imperial Bank of Persia and this long-standing case, the settlement of which reflects great credit on Captain Thorburn, is finally closed. Revenue Department .—A complaint has been received regarding the oppressive behaviour of Mirza Aga Khan, Revenue Collector of Mian Vilayat. I called on the Governor-General. It is said that the Russian Consulate-General has received instructions to submit to Tehran daily telegraphic ^reports of what takes place in this Consulate General. The Russian Consulate-General has received from the Russian Legation in Tehran permission to retain the services of Abdul Hamid until the arrival of a new Attache from Tehran. The Russian Vice-Consul is said to have complained to the Karguzar of the scale on which my reception was organized and was informed that the usual official arrangements were made and that whatever was done more than this was due to the friendly feelings with which the British Consulate-General is regarded. i received and 24th 1913.

Arrival of Belgian Architect. —M. Cocriamont, the architect mentioned in diarv No. 50, travelled to Meshed with me. He informed that he had been com missioned to design a railway station for Meshed, but I learn that he is likely to be sent to Sistan.

Sykes, C.M.G., C.LE., left Meshed on 20 th November for England, via Badkan, Muhammadabad, Artik (Central Asian Railway), Merv, old Merv, Tashkent, Orenburg and Moscow. He handed over the duties of Acting Consul-General to Captain R. H. Thorburn, I.M.S., Vice-Consul, Meshed. Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Haig, C.M.G., the new Consul-General, is ex pected to arrive in Meshed on 21 st December. ( 6 ) Military Attache, Meshed. —Captain E. G. Marsh, 9th Gurkha Rifles, arrived in Meshed on 16th November from Askhabad. On the afternoon of 23rd November he took over the duties of Military Attache from Major E, A. F. Redl, 113th Infantry. Major Redl left Meshed on 24th November for India, via Askh abad, Batoum and Constantinople. 684. Belgian enterprise in Asia. (Reference paragraph 660).— The Belgian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has organized a special department for Asiatic affairs. This department is employed on the question of suitable open ings for the use of Belgian capital in Russian Turkestan, China and Mongolia. 685. Russian enterprise in Persia.

Coal. —The present price of coal in Russian Turkestan is from 50 to 60 kopeks per pud (from £ 3-6-8 to £4 per ton). 087 . Oil. —(Reference paragraph 676). Mr. Sutherland is buying an oil-field from the firm of Vladimir Alexeief. 688 . Agriculture.—The grants of land in Golodnaya Steppe, which are to be made in April 1914, will be given out in holdings of from 20 to 25 acres. The grantees are to be only Russian subjects of the Orthodox Church, with at least £110 private capital and a working knowledge of agriculture. The north-east portion of the Steppe is irrigated by the new Romanovski canal (reference paragraph 663). The central and southern parts will be watered by cuts, leading from the River Zeravshan, and in this connection reservoirs are to be constructed on the heights of Zeravshan and Sanzar. Building-sites will be allotted in the new settlement of Syr-Darinsk in April 1914. The development of the Steppe and the construction of the railway from Syr-Darinsk to Jizak will, it is expected, stimulate the growth of Jizak, but on the other hand the importance of Chernysevo will be lessened, as that station and town will be off the main line, Tashkent-Samarkand. Irrigation works are being taken in hand at Khojend, where a new canal, 6 ^ miles in length, will tap the waters of the River Khoji Bakgiran at its exit from the hills near Aucha, and will supply the new town of Khojend, which is to be built at about § mil e from the railway station. The canal will bring some 7,500 acres of land under irrigation. Military. 689.

Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 2 lor the week ending 10th (received on 26th) January 1914. 5th January. —Mr. R. H. New, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, reached Birjand with the Rev. Dr. Esselstyn. Mr. New received a fine Istikbal. Representatives of the Deputy-Governor, Karguzar and Revenue Director, with the Telegraph Sartip and the Postmaster in person, met him two miles outside the town and accompanied him in. The pro cession also included three Russian Cossacks and some 60 other horsemen. Finance Department in Sistan. —In looking through the books of the Hindu trader here, Seth Mahan Singh, of the firm of Chuhar Mai Jawala Singh, I have discovered that the Finance Director has remitted to Meshed through this firm a total of 7,000 tomans in about six drafts since last April. The Finance Depart ment are under an agreement with the Imperial Bank of Persia to remit all their money to Meshed and Tehran through tjie latter, who give them a special rate in consequence. The question arises “Why did the Director send these secret remittances ? ” It looks to us as if the money was the private property of Monsieur Paquet. All the local officials declare that they know of instances of his corruption. The younger Paquet said to me, only last Friday, that he and his brother knew well that every one of their subordinates took bribes, but there was little advantage in continually replacing one man by another who was equally venal. Finance Department in Birjand. —The Revenue Sowars have lately been act ing very oppressively in several villages. In Khur they collected the full revenue due—3,200 krans—and exacted a fine of 1,000 krans in addition, besides taking free food and forage for a number of days. They also seized all the weapons and invited the Deputy-Governor to take custody of the latter. This Mizbeh- ud-Diwan refused to do as he suspected that the sowars would give him substituted weapons and misappropriate those of the best quality. Similar complaints have been received from Khusf, Seh Deh and Khurwaz. As regards the last-named, the Naib-ul-Hukumeh of Kain has sent a graphic and no doubt exaggerated account by telegraph :—“ Twelve Sowars first fired volleys into the village : then tied up and flogged six Saiyids. Broke one man's teeth and blinded another with the butt of a rifle. Threw children off the roofs and caused women to abort. In such circumstances I resign my post.’ It is to be hoped that Mr. New’s presence in Birjand will have a beneficial effect on the Director’s policy. The Rais-i-Nazmiyeh, Sistan. —I have seen the letter written by M. Leleux to M. Paquet about this officer. In brief, it says : “ His pay and allowances have been fixed at 50 tomans. He has been ordered to consult you in every matter. He is directly under the Rais-i-N azmiyeh of Meshed, and his duties have nothing to do with the local Governor.” On my representation, His Majesty’s Minister has addressed a rebuke to M. Leleux through M. Mornard. The Suspected Russian Spy. —From an Afghan source I hear that the “ Aus trian ” has confessed himself to be a Russian subject, and that a number of papers have been found on him. The Chakansur Authorities have referred to Kandahar for orders about him. In the meanwhile they are treating him well and “ feeding him on rice.” The Russian Doctor at Sistan. —Colonel Yygornitzky recently informed me that this gentleman is not a member of the Consulate, and that he submits his reports to quite a different Department.

Salar Humayun (grandson of Nayar-ud-Daula) to be Governor of Turshez. News has come that Shuji-us-Saltaneh, the new Taimuri Chief, has received the title of his late father, Shaukat-ud-Daula. The Revenue Official, Mirza Khalil Khan, at Turbat has already tried to rough- ride over Shahzada Mustafa Mirza by interfering with his department. The Moharram. —The Moharram passed off quietly. Rumours were current 9th December that Caucasus Turks, who are Russian subjects, were likely to attack the proces- 1913 - sions as there is a good deal of feeling between them and the Persians. At the Russian request the processions were not allowed into the Arak Quarter of the town.

Our nth December special agent reports that on 18th October Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan, 1913 ‘ who had been deputed by Naib-ul-Hakuma of Herat, met a Russian Official at Shor-i-Sangi near Panjdeh. A friendly conference ensued. The Russian Official put forward the claim of the Turkomans that the Shela water and irrigation channel known as Job-i-Kuraish used to irrigate lands on the Russian side of the frontier. The Afghan Agent pointed out that the Boundary Pillars had been agreed upon by British, Russian and Afghan Commissions and all parties had been contented with the settlement. He objected to the places which had been recently marked by Russian Engineers as the boundary line. They visited the sites and eventually the Russian Official admitted that these marks were wrong and removed them. Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan said the Amir was most anxious to have the boundary pillars repaired. Kalat-i-Nadiri. —Reference entry No. 2 on October 27th. The Russians are 12 th December still showing considerable activity at Kalat-i-Nadiri. A Russian Colonel recently 1913. visited it and at dinner with the Iktidar-ul-Mulk (Governor of Kalat) said that the Russian Government was arranging to have the place made ready for a garrison. He stated that it would easily support six Russian Battalions. The Iktidar-ul-Mulk has been warned again by the Russian Consul-General that no news must be allowed to get to the British Consulate.

On the 21 st November, he presided at a committee at Bairam Ali on the Murghab water question. (Press, 26th November.) 667. Movements of Zroops.—Time-expired men are being released at Khiva and Termez, but are being detained at certain stations, e.g., Tashkent,Two hundred Turkestan Field Artillery men passed through Samarkand on 20 th November, from east to west. A company of recruits arrived at Samar kand from Tashkent on 20th November. One hundred and fifty recruits arrived at Charjui on 24th November, from Baku, and have been sent up the Amu Darya by steamer. A party of engineers of various branches of engineering have passed through Charjui some to the east and some towards Kerki. Fifty Cossacks left Sarakhs on 12 th November for Pul-i-Khatun. Two companies, 14th Turkestan Rifle Regiment, have returned to Sarakhs from Merv. Sixty men, 3 rd Turkestan Rifle Regiment, have arrived at Askhabad from Tashkent. 668 . Deserter. —A man of the 14th Turkestan Rifle Regiment recently deserted from Merv, was apprehended at Meshed by the Russian Consul-General and sent back for trial. He had embraced the Muhammadan religion, and had allowed himself to be circumcised. The fact is of interest in connection with similar instances of recent date, of desertion by Russian soldiers into Afghanistan. Administration. 669.

During 1913, a series of surveys, according to a programme laid down by the Ministry of Marine, were carried out in the bays of Astrabad and Krasnovodsk, and in the vicinity of the islands of Cheleken and Ogurchinski, Nephtiania Kamni (Petroleum Rocks), Asphern and near several dangerous banks. The new sound ings taken reveal an undoubted lowering of the level of the sea, especially near Krasnovodsk and Astrabad, due probably to the diminution of the volume of water brought down by rivers which flow into the Caspian and to the extra ordinary influence of the bay of Kara Bugaz, which swallows up an enormous amount of the Caspian water. [Press.) 671. Telegraphs.—The Postal and Telegraph Department propose to erect several wireless stations in Russian Turkestan in 1914. One will be at Krasnovodsk. [Press, 22nd November.) 672. Railways, Persia.—A. Belgian engineer, M. Debre, has been sent by the Persian Government, as their representative, to Mohammerah, for the Moham- merah-Budjird line, which is being surveyed by British engineers. [Press, 26th November.) The Russian Press comments, with satisfaction, on the progress being made with the Tubriz-Julfa railway, which, it is stated, will be completed in the autumn of 1915. ' ‘ ‘ ^ 673. Railways, Russian Turkestan. —A railway committee recentlv sat at Samara, on the question of new railway construction in Turkestqn. Colonel Jukoff the Deputy Governor of Trans-Caspia, travelled from Askhabad, in order to sit on the committee. The following questions were considered : - 1 ( 1 ) The construction of a new line from Turkestan to Europe, from Chariui via Kungrad, New Urgan, to Alexandroff Gai. (The engineers’ sent to examine fhe local conditions for this line, have returned with their report to Petersburg.) (Information from Khiva states that five new bridges are being made m the vicinity three of iron and wood across the Shahabad canal, and two across the Amu Darya.)( 2 ) The construction of branch lines for the Central Asian and Tashkent railways (see also paragraph 567 of General Summary, Number 39 , Military Attache, Meshed):— ,, !• Basmain—Firoza, 12 | miles. (This line is being constructed.) 2 . Tash Kepri—Takhta Bazar, 12 miles. 3. Gorchakovo—Tashlak, 3 miles. 4. Assake—Osh, 30 miles. 5. Vannovskuya—Alta—Arig, 4 miles. ' 6 .

' The Committee resolved that the following lines are deserving of the special attention of Government at an early date, and advised that full technical and econo mic surveys should be carried out at once, the necessary funds being provided from the funds at the disposal of the Director of the Central Asian Railway : (a) Normal gauge:— 1 . Tejend — Chaacha — Saralchs, with extension to Meshed .— Length 120 1 miles, direct through the hills north-east of Meshed, or along the valley of the River Tejend to its junction with the Keshef Rud and along the valley of the latter to Meshed, 180 miles. The Committee enlarged upon the strategic and economic importance of this line, s and maintained that it would be a paying concern, both as regards passenger traffic (owing to the large pilgrim traffic to and from the holy city of Meshed), and as a stimulus to trade between Tur- kestan, Afghanistan and India. A survey of the line, fur- | nished by Colonel Jukoff, Deputy Governor of Trans-Caspia, was j attached to the recommendation of the Committee, but was not published in the Press. 2 . Samarkand—Chaisk—Yeni Kurghan, 27i miles. Purely commercial. 3.

F. G. MARSH, Captain, Military Attache, Meshed.SECRET. r i Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 48 for the week ending the 13th December 1913. GENERAL SUMMARY. Resources. 674. Land development .—The Russian Ministry of Agriculture intends, in 1914, to irrigate 250,000 acres of land in Semirechia, in the basin of the River Hi. 675. Growth of town. —The town of Aris now has 500 shops, 20 restaurants, a school with an attendance of 200 , and a club with 50 members. Rents have recently risen 250 %. 676. Oil. —Mr. Sutherland, representing a syndicate for supplying naphta ! to the British Navy, is now in Tashkent. Mr. Nobel, one of the largest owners of ! oil-fields in Southern Russia, is also in Tashkent on business connected with naphta. \ 677. Cotton. —The Ferghana cotton crop is officially reported to total 11,000 tons. 678. Agricidture .— The following concessions of land are announced for 1914 :— 9th March, in Ferghana, 625,000 acres ; 14th Apiil, in Golodnaya Steppe, 750,000 acres. Half of the land, taken up and irrigated, will 'be the permanent freehold property of the settler, or the whole may be held on a tenant’s lease of 75 years. The shortage of water for irrigation in the Merv district, owing to the decrease f in the volume of water brought down by the River Murghab, continues to evoke in the press complaints that the Afghans are draining off the head waters of the river. It is stated that the volume of water which reaches Russian territory totals now only 24} cubic feet per second, whereas it used to measure 42 cubic feet per second. The latter estimate was only sufficient to irrigate 15,000 acres, and the present situation of the Russian farmer in the district is represented as desperate. Hopes are expressed that Russian interests, as regaids the water which flows into Trans-Caspia from the high lands of Persia, will receive greater consideration, when the question forms the subject of diplomatic negotiations, than they received when the British and Russian Governments decided the question of the waters of the Murghab. 679. Town site. —A site for a town, for the district watered by the Roman- ovski canal, will be fixed by a committee, which will assemble in Tashkent at the end of this week and which will include General Flug (Assistant Governor of Turkistan) and Mr. Okunef, Director of the Central Asian Railway. 680. Trade with Afghanistan.—Vaz Russian Political Agent at Bokhara has raised the question of removing certain hindrances to Russian trade with Afghan istan by :— ( 1 ) insisting on the transit of Russian goods through Bokharan territory free of customs duty, as provided for by the treaty of 1873 ; ( 2 ) constructing frontier posts along the whole of the Bckharan-Afghan frontier ; ( 3 ) removing the obstructions now placed in the way of Afghan traders by the Bokharan authorities.

Lieutenant-General Lesh and Major-General Vostrosablin (Commandant, Kushk) have gone to Tashkent for an annual conference. Mr. B. N. Okunef (reference paragraph 679) left Tashkent on 3rd December for Askhabad, returning on 11th December. Colonel N. K. Kalmakof (reference paragraph 664) arrived at Askhabad on -7th December. 683 Movements of troops. —One thousand three hundred and sixty-four recruits’from different parts of Russia landed at Krasnovodsk between 9th and 27th November, and proceeded to various stations in Turkistan. A party of 3 officers and 25 men, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, left Askhabad on 27th November for Kushk. Two hundred artillery recruits arrived at Merv from the east on 24th November \ 50 of these went on to Kaakha. A party of 2 officers and 14 men, 14th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, have left Tashkent for Fort Alexandrovsk. Sixty boxes, small arms ammunition, have been sent from Askhabad to Kizil Arvat for Kari Killa. 684. Forts. —The garrison of Termez small fort is reported to be in charge of a large number of guns and reserve ammunition, in the following quantities :—- Field guns (old pattern) 400, Mountain guns 200 , Heavy guns 17. Ammunition 700 boxes artillery and 3,000 boxes small arm. 685. Extension of service. —Certain artillery men at Termez state that their period of service has been extended to 4 years. It is probable that the extension, announced last spring for infantry has been made applicable to cavalry and artil lery ; this would have the effect of extending the period of service of these arms from 3| to 4j years. 686 . Health statistics. —The following figures for July 1913 are published :— Turkistan Military District:— Deaths per mille :— Officers .. .. .. .. • 92 Rank and file .. .. .. .. -5 (13th Turkistan Rifle Regiment had the highest death-rate, wz., 7*68).

Russian surveys. —Considerable activity is being displayed by small parties of Russian officers in the neighbourhood of Kalat i-Nadiri (in the hills south of Dushak) much to the annoyance of the Persians, who hold the place in great rever ence (reference Curzon’s “ Persia”, Volume I, Chapter 6 ). j The Russian Military Attache, Meshed, has been on tour for the last six weeks in the neighbourhood of Karez (east of Turbat-i-Shaikh-Jam) and is reported to have crossed the Afghan frontier, penetrating as far as Kafi: Killa.

Finance Department in Sistan. —No settlement has yet been made of the Cara van incident reported last week. It, however, seems probable that Monsieur Paquet will be reverted to Meshed. Baluch raids. — {a) From Koh Malik Siah it is reported that the large lashkar which went westwards (presumably Shah Sowar’s) has returned home with a quan- graph poles, as reported last week, were only three in number. The camels belonged to the Sarbisha contractor. They were recovered by people of Shusp, who put the robbers to flight. Subsequently some Kaini camel-men captured three suspicious- looking Afghans at Gurab, on the direct and unfrequented road between Shusp and Bandan. They have taken them to Birjand. (c) A band of 40 (?) Baluchis has been harassing Khusf and Seh Kala, having come from the direction of Khabis. The Deputy Governor of Birjand telegraphed to the Naib at Neh and wrote to the Naib of Sarchah Ambari to cut of! the retreat of the party. There were encounters both at Ambari and at Deh Salm. The Dauleh had a fall from his horse. After suffering a good deal for two days he allowed the Vice-Consulate Sub-Assistant Surgeon to examine him, with the result that one rib was found to have been fractured. He is progressing as satisfactorily as can be expected. Shaukat-ul-Mulk telegraphed to Birjand on the 22 nd instant for 3,000 Tomans. He talks of returning via Meshed in a few days’ time, and has warned his escort to be in readiness for him at Sabzawar. It is rumoured in Sistan that Hashmat-ul-Mulk will come here as Deputy of Shaukat-ul-Mulk.

F 1 Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 1 for the week ending 3rd (received 19th) Finance Department in Sistan. —The gendarmes and Mirzas concerned in the caravan outrage remain still unpunished. The removal of Monsieur Paquet from Sistan has, however, been decided upon by the Treasurer-General. Two fresh little incidents have come to my notice during the week which demonstrate the autocratic pretensions and the unfriendly sentiments of the Director : — • (a) In Meshed Consulate-General Diary No. 43 of 1913 the arrest of four Afghans (Lowanis), engaged in the Arms Traffic, was reported^ Three of these men were eventually convicted and sentenced to deportation to India. They were made over by the Consulate-General to the Governor-General of Khorasan for despatch to the Vice-Consulate at Birjand, and thence to the Sistan Consulate. The men duly arrived in Sistan.in the c ustody of three camel-sowars serving under the Naib-ul- Hukumat of Neh, and, on passing the Sistan Custom Office, they were prisoners 1 On my referring to Monsieur Paquet for an explanation, I was told that the jambazes had enquired the way to the Consulate, and Haidar Khan, the Captain of Gendarmerie, had furnished them with the two gendarmes as guides! As a matter of fact the Consulate stands at the end of the road, which passes the Custom House, about 400 yards further on, and could easily have been pointed out from there. (b) In my Diary No. 47 of 1913 I mentioned that Monsieur Paquet had refused an application from Naushirwan Khan, the British outlaw, for a grant of land in Sistan. He has recently reconsidered his decis ion on this point, and has sent Sardar Pasand Khan with two Mirzas to Sar-i-Shela. to choose a site suitable for cultivation on which to settle both Yakub Khan, Sanjarani, and Naushirwan Khan! As the banks of the Shela river are the present favourite resting and recruit- ing grounds for the Baluchis of Sistan who periodically go raiding, it is ludicrous that the Revenue Department should contemplate settl ing cultivators in that region without reference to the local Govern ment or this Consulate. The Outlaw Naushirwan Khan. —This man has received an invitation, with safe-conduct, to go into Quetta to discuss terms of settlement. I hope lo have an opportunity of warning him that he cannot expect to be allowed to set. le down in Sistan while the British Government continue to regard him as an outlaw. A Suspected Russian Spy.—In Diary No. 51 of 1913 the arrival of a darwish called by Colonel Vygornitzky an Austrian, was reported. I have since heard from the Karguzar and the Rais Kushun that the man informed a number of Persians that he was a Tartar Russian Muhammadan subject. The Meshed coachman of Dr. Esselstyn’s carriage—himself a Russian subject said that the man knew Russian well. I was able recently to inform Colonel Vygornitzky that I had heard of the man s arrest in Chakansur. The news evidently perturbed my coliesgue considerably, but he repeated that the man was an Austrian, saying that he had seen his passport, issued from Buda Pesth only about four months ago! ^ He added that the man used to visit his Cossacks occasionally but only came to himself once. joined by two Revenue Gendarmes, armed wdth rifles, wdio took charge of the party and themselves imperiously demanded a receipt for the India, Foreign Secretary's No 4 dated JAN 19H' 2 The Governing rumou^^tha^Hashmat-ul-Mulk will Je soon SSt Sn S He will be ^ “ Te^an until ou^s are pa.d u^ Sbaukat-ul-Mulk has been a—d r SlinTn 0 ffice to lotg as he gives stt.sfac his father nray order him to res.gn.

The Afghans are threatening not to return next year. They have, however, invested a considerable amount of their takings in arms and ammunition, including 150 rifles. It is rumoured that 100 more camel-loads of rice are on their way here. The Rais-i-Nazmiyeh.—Th.h Official arrived from Meshed on the 2 nd January. He has put up temporarily with Haidar Khan, the Captain of the Gendarmerie, and has laid himself under some adverse comment by calling promptly on Monsieur Paquet and delaying to call on the Deputy-Governor. He says that he is directly Bubordinate to the Chief of Police in Meshed. The introduction of this official is due to Monsieur Paquet’s initiative, and was carried out against my advice. If the Officer does his duty and works reasonably well with the Deputy-Governor, the experiment may turn out satisfactorily, but the odds are perhaps rather against it. The Kais is calling on me on the 6 th instant, when I shall speak to him very plainly. Sistan Hospital Figures for December 1913- New Cases 850 511 21 F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.Meshed Diary No. 49 for the week ending the 6th December 1913 (received on the 7th January 1914). Swedish Officers for the Gendarmery.—The Governor General has wired secretly 3 oth November to Tehran asking that Swedish Officers should be sent to take over charge of the 1913* roads. Colonel Scourratt’s visit to Afghanistan. — The Naib-ul-Hakuma at Herat has 1st December 1913 . again examined all the Officers and Sepoys who were concerned in not detaining Colonel Scourratt at Kafar Kalla, but nothing was proved. He warned them to be more careful in the future. The New Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari.

(2) The Russian Attacte.—The city has been full of rumours for the last two days that Abdul Hamid has been dismissed and had been ordered to refund large sums of money, which he had got by illegal means, before being deported from Meshed. Colour was lent to this rumour by the fact that he was confined to his house ; but to-day, on receipt of a telegram from Tehran, where it is said M. Lutkin has again intervened on his behalf, he has been let off. Certain Russian subjects who are not satisfied with this have again wired to St. Petersburg and threaten to take bast (refuge) in the Russian Consulate-General until their claims are satisfied. Road-Guards.—TI m Governor-General has received instructions from Tehran 4th December 1913 . that he is responsible for the order of the roads and has again taken on the Sowars whom he dismissed about a month ago as the result of the quarrel with M. Leleux (see Summary of Meshed Diary No. 45). The question of who is to pay the road- . guards has not been settled. Departure of Mr. Eldrid.—Mx. Eldrid, who has been Manager of the Imperial 5 th December 191 3. Bank of Persia in Meshed for the past four years, left Meshed to-day with his family on transfer to Tehran. During the time he has been in Meshed he has always in every way assisted this Consulate-General, and Mrs. Eldrid, who is a lady Doctor, has been invaluable : the British Colony at Meshed owes her a debt of gratitude and all greatly regret their departure. (2) Jews in Afghanistan. —The Jews in Afghanistan have petitioned the Amir to be allowed to cross into Russia for trading purposes. The Amir has refused their request, but has agreed to let them trade with India if they want. Kuchan-Sabzawar Post. — The question of a post from Kuchan to Sabzawar, 6th December 191 3. which the Russians were pressing (see Diary for November 20th), has temporarily been arranged. The Governor-General has arranged Sowars to carry the bags until proper orders come from the Minister of the Interior. ' India, Foreign Secretary’s , No 3 M, dated 5~ JAN 19D1 Summary. State of Province, Revenue Troubles. —From all sides complaints are being 1 'fna^^agalhsh the Revenue Officials and Sowars. No less than five complaints from respectable Bri tish Subjects have been received during the past three weeks. These complaints have been forwarded to the Revenue Department and it will be interesting to see what steps, if any, are taken to punish those at fault. The trouble seems to be that every body is in ignorance as to at what rate taxes are levied and the Revenue Officials and Sowars gather it in the most arbitrary manner. There is no proper control and discipline. : A: iv £&amp; \ 3UANii o 1 ii »■ I•n v 95 miles from Meshed was looted by the Kevenue This week a village about 25 m wil w to pay the taxes through their Sowars.

L'* : } L &gt; &gt; I i 1 .^-i f. /I Meshed Diary No. 48, tor the week ending the 29th November (received 30th December 1913) Elections. —The Governor-General has received words from Tehran that the elections are to be held there in the first week of January and that they should be held in Khorasan before the end of that month. Departure of Major ML—Major Redl left for India via Baku and Constan tinople. Colonel Kulikofi and all the officers of the Russian Garrison came to see him off and escorted his carriage out of the city where they had again arranged a “ Stirrup Cup.” Proofs of Popularity .— Prince Dabija is reported to be engaged at present in trying to get “ chits ” from the leading Persian subjects to say what a fine fellow he is and bow much they owe to him. A case in point is the following: The Rus sian Consulate-General, acting on instructions from Tehran, warned the Aga Zada that if he continued giving trouble he would be deported. The latter, having paved the way with a present of Tomans 500, called on Prince Dabija and pro mised to behave well in future and wrote a laudatory “ chit ” at Prince Dabija s dictation. The Karez Agent reports that a Russian subject arrived there disguised as a Persian Dervish and has proceeded to Sistan via Khaf. The Herat Agent reports that the Naib-ul-Hakuma has been making encpiines as to how it was that Colonel Scourratt, who had got as far as Kafir Killa in Afghan istan, had not been detained when caught (see Diary No. 45, November 5th). He is said to be not satisfied with the explanations. The Russian Attache. —It is reported that Abdul Hamid has been advised by Prince Dabija to proceed on leave and to clear out of Meshed. It is said that in the case reported in Diary No. 42, Prince Dabija promised the Russian Barrister, in order to save himself, that Abdul Hamid would be dismissed before 1st November. His case/lieing considered in Tehran and Monsieur Lutkin is again interesting himself on his behalf. Abdul Hamid is now escorted by an armed servant. His life would probably not be worth a week’s purchase if Russian protection were removed. Arrival of Mr. Evans. —Mr. Evans, of the Telegraph Department, has arrived at Meshed on the annual inspection tour. Smuggling of Caps.—With, reference to summary of Meshed Diary No. 43, Mr. Leleux has finally disposed of the case by confiscating the caps and imposing a fine of Tomans 10.

Revenue Tropes—Several headmen of Kuhsani Afghans have come to Meshed to protest against the collection of taxes by Revenue Sowars. They claim that (1) Many of them have been in Persia for over 10 years and have never been taxed before ; (2) that other Afghan subjects, viz., the Berberis, are exempted from taxa tion ; (3) that there are no fixed rates, and that the money is demanded in e mos arbitrary manner ; and (4) that these taxes are being suddenly sprung on them wi - out warning. They ask that if these taxes are to be levied, they may P ' mission to so back to Afghanistan and excused any export fees, this anects about 80 or 100 families. The Berberis are also pressing for assistance as aalla ” is being levied on them, and from all sides there are complaints that tne Revenue Gendarmery are oppressing the people in collecting the taxes. I discussed the matter with Monsieur Leleux and he agreed to treat the Kuh- sanis on the same lines as the Berberis. He has ]ust received orders to proceedTehran and is going in about ten days’ time. He asked if he might discuss the whole matter withke British Legation at Tehran if an mtervrew could be arranged. Strained relations between the Russian had a long talk with the Karguzar and he informed me that he has heard that Russian Cossacks were being sent to guard the Sabzawar ^ i of which no news has been heard, and to survey the district. He is of opmion that this is iust another Russian excuse for extending their influence. He told me that he has wired to Tehran pressing that the Swedish Officers should be sent to Khora- san to take charge of the roads and Revenue Sowars. It is certainly most desir- able that this should be done. The Karguzar said that the relations between him and the Russian Consulate are at present very strained, because in connection with the removal of Nayar-ud- Dola, which the Russian Consul-General is pressing; he had wired secretly to Tehran pointing out that “ (1) The candidates for this post were either past failures or new and unexperienced men ; (2) that a change would certainly disarrange things and that the Russians would gain in the confusion ; (3) that Nayar-ud-Dola had the advantage of being a strong and wealthy local man, and that at present there were, fewer cases of robberies in the province, which is partly due to his personal influence ; (4) that the British Consulate-General has never had any complaint against him ; (5) that the Russian Consul-General only objected to him because he does not do always exactly what they want; and (6) that he settles all cases^brought in by the Karguzar. Unfortunately the Foreign Minister showed this to the Russian Minister, who telegraphed it to the Russian Consul-General at Meshed. The latter at once sent word to the Karguzar that he had no right to interfere against their wishes. It is quite likely that an effort will now be made to get the Karguzar removed. A day after this, a dispute occurred between a Persian and Russian subject. The Persian was arrested at the request of the Russian Tajjir Bashi but released after he had been examined in the Nazmia. He lodged a complaint at the Kai- guzari. When the Karguzar asked for redress, the Russian Vice-Consul demanded the re-arrest of the Persian and was distinctly rude to the Karguzar telling him he must do what he was told, threatening to send Cossacks to arrest the Persian, and reminding him that they had troops at Meshed to make the Persians do as the Russians wanted. Since this Karguzar has been in Meshed, he has always shown himself most anxious to assist the Russian Consulate-General with its cases. A change of Governor or Karguzar would at present be most undesirable. State of the Roads .—About ten days ago, two Russian Cossacks when proceed ing to Kakah with two thousand roubles were murdered on the road. Eight Cossacks turned out to pursue and overtook the murderers, who turned out to be Turkomans. A fray took place in which two Cossacks and one Turkoman were killed. The remaining 5 Turkomans fled.

The caravanserais on this road are being rebuilt, and the road is being inspected by the Amir of Bokhara. 655. Railways. —On the 17th November, at crossing-place No. 102, near Samar kand, a goods train left the line ; two wagons were smashed and seven men were injured. The accident was due to an obstruction placed on the line. Monsieur Okoneff has been confirmed in the appointment of Director of the Central Asian Railway. Monsieur Oznogoff, Director of Telegraphs, Central Asian Railway, has returned from leave. Two engines for narrow gauge traffic have been sent to Osh. 656.

Political. —The Amir of Bokhara has returned from Petersburg. Press ure is being brought to bear upon him to take steps for the more efficient pro tection of his southern frontier. Information received points to a closer supervision of Bokharan affairs by the Russian Government, with regard to religious jurisdiction, security of life, land revenues and education. 658. Persia. —The Teheran-Meshed road continues to be raided by Turkomans from the hills to the north. Mr. Evans, Indo-European Telegraph Department, who arrived in Meshed on the 28th November, states that he himself saw two dead bodies and attended to the wounds of a third traveller on his way here. A caravan, immediately preceding him on the road, was attacked, and he only escaped by retracing his steps to the nearest caravanserai, and remaining there until reinforcements arrived. The Askhabad-Meshed road, which is patrolled by Russian troops, is at present safe. __ „ r - Military. One hundred and fifty recruits for Kerki have been sent up the Oxus by steamer. Political.

Finance Department in Sistan. —On. the 18th instant, a small caravan started out for Birjand from Sistan, consisting of 10 camels with Colonel Haig’s bagga«e and 14 camels carrying merchandize, the property of Seth Mahan Singh and Ghulam Muhammad, Peshawari, British subjects. A Customs gendarme demanded from the camel-men Nawaqil (Transport Tax) and in excess of the proper rate. A quarrel ensued, and 15 other! gendarme ran out, beat the camel-men, and drove the camels back to the Custom House. The camel-men were Persian subjects, but all were hired for the journey by Shaikh Painda Khan, the Consulate Transport Contractor, who had paid the camel- owners half-hire in advance. The Director of Excise fined the camel-men for re sisting lawful authority, besides collecting Nawaqil even on the camels carrying the Meshed Consul-General’s property. Monsieur Paquet was aware of the affair before I was, and approved of his subordinates’ action. -I proceeded to the Custom Office as soon as I heard of it, got the camel-men released from custody, and demanded the punishment of the offending gendarme. As Monsieur Paquet refused all redress, the case has been referred to r His Majesty’s Legation by telegraph. The Tsar’s Name-day. —On the 19th instant, Colonel Vygornitzky, Acting Kussian Vice-Consul, held a reception and gave an official dinner to which all the Englishmen in Sistan were invited. Baluch Raids. — (a) Some 20 men of the Idozai tribe, under Habib, son of Gul Muhammad, from the Shela and Bandar-i-Kamalan, have attacked a caravan near Anjira, but lost one of their party. They looted some 25 camels from Shusp, and got home safely by the Palang Koh route. (h) Idu and Juma Jalal, Alam Khan Brahuis, have been raiding flocks, the property of the Shebak, Jamalzai and Urdani Baluchis, near the Palang Koh. (c) The large lashkar under Shah Sowar Yar Ahmedzai, which went into Narmashir, is said to have sent home 1,000 head of animals, and is still raiding. {d) A party of Brahuis, possibly the same as mentioned in {a) or {h) have had an encounter with the Bahlolis and Nakhis in the southern Kainat. The raiders were worsted and lost their loot. (e) It is rumoured that raiders have captured 12 camels, loaded with telegraph poles, between Bandau and Aliabad. This, if true, will excite the Eussian Consulate. The Outlaw Naushirwan. —A party of this man’s Afghan friends of the Gurg tribe under Kabir Khan, who are in retreat with him, have been amusing them selves by pursuing a bio ad-feud against their own relatives, who have taken ref uge in the Kainat, opposite Lash Juwain. After killing a woman and a child, and themselves losing two mei£i&amp;#*Natiet - ;;y returned to the vicinity of Khwaja Ahmed. They did not enter Afghan territory.

He had joined the India, F reign Secreiary'S No 2 M, dated 8 JAN 1914 24JAN1314 ■wwn.411„ HIM'I CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 46 for the week ending the 15th November (received 17th December) 1913. Alleged Outrages by Russian Soldiers .—Since the departure of Colonel Kha- loth Norember. kondokoff I have received reports of several cases of murder, rape and robbery committed by the Russian troops. lam afraid that many of these charges are genuine. The present Colonel seems to be incompetent. The Herat Garrison .—The Herat Agent reports that two regiments from Herat nth Novemb er . wished to march on Kandahar. The other regiments remained loyal and the danger was averted. The position of the Amir does not appear to be very strong atHerat so far as the loyalty of his troops is concerned. M. Viollet. —M. and Mme. Yiollet have reached Meshed. He is travelling in 12 th November, Persia to find suitable sites to excavate. He recently travelled from Tehran to Astrabad and he corroborates fully my reports as to the seizure of land by the j Russians. He says that their behaviour at Astrabad is a disgrace to civilisation, j He is making a short tour to Karez, Turbat and Turshiz and will return to Meshed. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturing Company. —Mr. Edwards has left Meshed 13 th November, for Hamadan. Mr. Arter, a Swiss, is in charge, with an English Clerk, called Bond, from Constantinople. Mr. Baker, son of one of the directors, will reach Meshed shortly and this will complete the staff. M. Lemanski .—The Polish tutor of the Sirdar of Bujnurd has come in to try Hth November, for Russian support for the Sirdar, who is being pressed to go to Tehran to be squeezed, as he is known to be rich. My colleague is apparently ready to help* him, for a consideration which, upon my advice, is being paid. Permits on the Central Asian Railway—The question of permits to travel on fisth November, the Central Asian Railwav is rather acute. More than a month ago my colleague asked for permits for Captain Marsh, the new Military Attache, and for Major Redl, the retiring Attache. Receiving no reply, he telegraphed a second and then a third time, but all to no purpose. As Captain Marsh left Baku on 9th November for Krasnovodsk and as there is no news of him, my colleague asked me to refer the matter to the British Embassy at St. Petersburg. This I have done. Just now there is a bad epidemic of sopoy fever in Turkistan and this may have something to do with what is in any case an utter anomaly. Summary of Meshed Diary No. 46 of 1913. State of Province .—The Nayyir-ud-Daula, the Governor-General, who has been suffering from gout for some time, was treated at the suggestion of my colleague by Doctor Zaplatinski, but derived no benefit. He has now been attended by Captain Thorburn for some time and is slowly improving. There are rumours of his dismissal: but as he is able to pay large sums to the ministers, he may remain in office until the spring. State of the Roads .—Owing to the movement of large sums of specie, so it appears, the Turkoman have appeared in large numbers on the Tehran road. On the 9th November a large caravan of one hundred returning pilgrims was attacked near Abbasabad. Twelve men weie killed, one by having petroleum poured over him and being set on fire in his kayava or mule palanquin. On the following day a second caravan from Yeramin was attacked in the same neighbourhood. Altogether thirty men have been killed. The Turkoman, who asked “ where is the money ? ” have so far failed in their object. Mr. Evans is safe, according to his latest report. It is to be hoped that the Swedish gendarmerie will be able to tackle these not very formidable human sharks. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General.

The American Missionary .—Dr. Esselstyn has returned from his touring trip. He has decided to stay in Sistan until after Christmas. The Governing Family of Sistan and Kainat .—His Excellency Shaukat-ul- Mulk has telegraphed to Birjand that his departure from Teheran is delayed by the absence of M. Mornard, the Treasurer- General, at Enzeli. He has also sent a message to Hissam-ud-Dowleh to the effect that he is working to get the latter permitted to return to Birjand, so that he can commence proceeding in that direction. Hissam-ud-Dowleh in consequence has come in to his estate 8 miles outside the town. The Teheran newspaper, “ Diwan-i-Adalat,” of 26th October 1913, gives a long account of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. It extols his liberality in maintaining a school at Birjand, and mentions his intention to open a hospital. The Karguzar of Birjand—It has been rumoured in Birjand that this worthy is about to vacate his appointment. Interrogated by the Vice-Consulate Sub- Assistant Surgeon, Izz-ul-Mamalik stated that he has himself applied for a transfer on promotion or his pension. He would like to come to Sistan, It is, however, also rumoured that the Travelling Inspector of the Passport Department has discovered a defalcation of 500 tomans in the Karguzar’s Passport Account, and has reported him to Teheran. Revenue Department in Birjand.—(a) Mirza Abdul Karim Khan, the ex- Director, (see last week’s Diary), after a few days in custody, was released on parole. He informed a number of people that the new Director was pressing him for 2,500 hrans of Government money which he was unable to account for. His attempts to borrow the amount having failed, he then took i hast in the house of the Mujtehid, Shaikh Muhammad Hadi. Revenue sowars demanded his surrender, and the Mulla sent him off to the Deputy Governor. The latter returned him to Ibtihaj-us-Sultan, stipulating that he should be properly treated. (h) A drunken Revenue gendarme in Kain city commenced quarreling with a shop keeper and fired his rifle at him, but by mistake wounded a Saiyid (father-in-law of the Birjand Post-master) in thg leg. The inhabitants petitioned the Deputy Governor of Birjand to have the man severely punished. The Revenue Director refused to surrender the culprit but promised to punish him departmentally, after taking the orders of M. Leleux. Baluch Raids.—(a) Other leaders of the strong lashlcar, mentioned in last week’s Diary as having started for Narmashir, are said to be Wall Muhammad, Yar-Ahmedzai, and Shakkar Khan and Agha Khan, Narois. (h) Thirty-eight camels, belonging to Keh, have been carried off by 20 Baluchis near Deh Salm. Two camel-men are said to have been killed. Gun-running .—I hear from Lutak that Kadkhuda Meshedi Mirak, Kubdani, left Kila-i-Eath (on the Helmund in Afghanistan) last month with 60 followers for the purpose of buying rifles in the Saihad from Sardars Saiyid Khan and Behram Khan. He talked of visiting Kej Mekran.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 48, for the week ending the 29th November (received on the 15th December) 1913. 24th November .—The Rev. Dr. Esselsteyn started on a tour round the Sistan district. He expects to be absent about 10 days. 1,000 tomans. One of Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s servants, who went only as far as Nishapur, has returned to Birjand. He says that Hashmat-ul-Mulk withdrew 6,000 tomans from the Russian Bank at Meshed, and that he was much annoyed at the refusal of his father’s Mustaufi, Kurshid Khan, to accompany him further than Turbat. This Mustaufi is said to be worth 70,000 or 80,000 tomans, and to own landed pro perty at Sistan, Kain, Turbat, Meshed and Teheran. He has evidently feathered his nest well during his long service under Hissam-ud-Daula. Haider Ali Khan, the Baluch cousin of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, 'has received an urgent request by telegraph to remit 16,000 tomans up to Teheran from Sistan. The Deputy Governor of Sistan .—Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan has, during the week, settled two criminal cases which have been under discussion for several months. Compensation has been paid for the pilfering of merchandize by road- guards on the Shela, and three burglars who stole property from the Consulate servants’ quarters have been flogged. The Sartip informs me that he loves his uncle Shaukat-ul-Mulk better than his brother Hashmat-ul-Mulk, but he especially looks to the Consulate for protection and_support! Revenue Department in Birjand—{a) The recently arrived Director, Ibtihaj-us- Sultan Mirza, professes to have discovered a plot, organised by the out-going Direc tor, Mirza Abdul Karim Khan, and a senior officer of the Revenue Gendarmerie (an ecr-Military Amir-Panj) to have him murdered while he was travelling towards Birjand. The informer is the man who was to have done the deed—a gendarme named Karbelai Ismail, who is generally regarded as the murderer of Mulla Sultan of Gunabad in 1909. The relieved Director is now in custody. {b) The Telegraph Master at Birjand, a very respectable old Sartip, has been insulted and threatened with assault by six drunken Revenue sowars. The Director had them flogged, upon which their officer resigned his appointment. Afghan Outrages in Kainat.—{a) A resident of Nozad, a village about 50 miles east of Birjand, has come into the Vice-Consulate Dispensary suffering from a bullet wound and a sword-cut. His storj' is that he was attacked by two Afghans who entered his house at night, asking for hospitality, and then attempted tu kidnap his wife. Both assailants escaped. The Deputy Governor of Birjand has addressed the Afghan authorities on the matter. (b) Nine Afghans attacked a small village near Bamrud, and carried off eleven camels. Sowars from Muhammadabad (north of Birjand) went in pursuit. The result is not known. Baluch Raids.—Yiom Lutak, I hear that Shahsowar Khan, Yar-Ahmedzai, nephew of Mir' Jihind Khan, Damani, has taken 300 men from Sarhad m the direc tion of Narmashir via Koh Gauhar. A number of Brahms from Lutak and the Shela River, under the leadership of Shah Nazar Khan, have gone to 30 m the lash- General.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 45, for the week ending the 8 th (received on the 26th) November 1913. 6th November. —Colonel Vygornitzky, Russian Military Attache and Acting Vice-Consul, arrived in Sistan with his wife from Birjand. He was given an official “ Istiqbal ” as the visit was his first one since assuming charge of the Vice-Consu late. The local officials (Deputy Governor, Acting Karguzar and Rais Qushun) all first made a number of objections, such as ( 1 ) that the officer had been accorded an official reception at the request of Baron Tcherkassov last spring when he first came to Sistan—this I did not endorse, as the British Consulate took no part on that occasion—( 2 ) that the Colonel is only Acting Vice-Consul, though Baron Tcherkassov has vacated the appointment, and (3) that though the Russian Tele graph Inspector, who represented the Consul throughout the hot weather, a Russian Doctor (who has not yet met the local officials) and the Consulate Munshi Bashi were all present in Sistan, there was no one who could make an official application to the Karguzari for the function ! The Director of Customs, M. Paquet, was, however, very solicitous on the subject as Belgians personally enjoy the protection of Russia all over Persia—he had also sent out a large party to meet the Russian Doctor last week. I also was able to inform the Karguzari that I had received an official intimation from the Russian Consulate of the Colonel’s pending arrival, and that I proposed to send out my representative with a party to meet him. Matters were, therefore, satisfactorily arranged at the very last moment. General. Inter-tribal fighting in Sistan.—See Diary No. 43. I hear from Lutak that the Shebak Baluchis captured 800 goats in their raids against the Brahuis of Alam Khan. They presented 100 animals to Sardar Purdil Khan and divided up the remainder among themselves. The Sardar gave a sword and a Khilat (present) to Kadkhuda Dadshah, the Shebak headman. The Outlaw Naushirwan Khan—This man has crossed the Afghan frontier and is staying with Sardar Khudadad Khan of Khwaja Ahmad. He has a following of about 15 men of his own tribe and 35 Afghans of the Gurg tribe. Most of the followers apparently have their families with them. The rumour has reached me that Naushirwan intends to make overtures, through the Consulate, for peace and permission to return to India. The Meshed American Missionary. —Dr. Esselstein, I hear, reached Birjand on the 28th October 1913. He stayed with Mr. Hale, the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, until the 3rd November, when he left for Sistan. He has reached Neh safely and has telegraphed to the Deputy Governor of Sistan for an escort of 6 sowars, which has been duly sent to meet him at Bandan. His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Birjand. — Mr; W. R. Howson left Birjand on the 29th October 1913, for India on six months’ leave. He reached Bandan on the 8 th November. As his successor, Mr. R. H. New, is only due at Koh Malik Siah on the 30th November, Mr. Howson will hand over charge of his office to me at Sistan. The Customs and Finance Department in Sistan. —Monsieur Henri Paquet in forms me that he was taken into the service of the Department as Assistant Director, about three months ago, on a salary of 100 tomans. His brother, the Director, draws 400 tomans per mensem.

New Russian Doctor at Karez, —Dr. SheriofE has succeeded Dr. Sorokine at Karez. It is to be hoped that he will not start any plague campaigns. 2 . A Wealthy Widow.- —The young widow of the very wealthy Muntasir-ul- Mulk is receiving offers of marriage from every quarter. Among her would-be husbands are the Governor-General, an old man of over seventy ; Kardash Bala, the noted ruffian ; and the Sipahdar has also proposed by telegram. The lady is said to reply in a caustic strain. Ahdul Hamid. —My colleague has received orders from the Russian Legation to recover 10,000 tomans from Abdul Hamid which he has taken from Russian subjects. As this would probably cause Abdul Hamid to show up my colleague, he is giving him a recommendatory letter. Armed with this he is trying to produce evidence in the form of a document sealed by Russian subjects that they all like him. I doubt whether this scheme will succeed. 2 . Kalat-i-Nadiri.*—Dming the last few months, several parties of Russian officers have visited Kalat-i-Nadiri. A Russian General is now about to visit it with his staff. Tour of Russian Military Colonel Scourratt has been reported as having reached Karez. On the way he has collected gazetteer information. Arrival of Captain Thorburn.—Captain and Miss Thorburn reached Meshed on 20 th. The road is in a specially bad state. The arrest of Mirza Hashim. —Reference, entry of 9th September, I hear that the Russians imprisoned Mirza Hashim and his companions at Askabad for six days on suspicion of being English spies. He asked me to obtain a letter for him from my colleague : but I was unwilling to do so. However, he pressed me to send him to my colleague and I finally did so. These acts of Russian injustice are of the greatest value to us as they are reported all over India. Mirza Hashim will make a great stir on the subject, ■ J The Hishmat-ul-Mulk. —I hear that the Hishmat-ul-Mulk has left Nishapur for Tehran. Corruption of the Governor-General. —I hear from Tehran that there is much ■ comment on the sum of 15,000 tomans taken by the Governor-General from the Shuja-ul-Mulk of Kuchan. The clean-handed Ayn-ud-Daula is stated to be shock ed ! The Ismailis. —I received a deputation of the Ismailis and warned them not . miflrrP l among themselves. They are proceeding to Kain to install a new Col- ectrof sXcriptions ” at Seh Dei They showed me their authonty from the a™ Khan - and at their urgent request I informed His Majesty s Vice-Consul of their iournev It appears that the Aga Khan derives a large revenue from his followers in Persia : and the post of Collector is quite worth holding. Aliened Russian Outrage.—Some Cossacks recently settled an account with a in the Ark quarter by murdering him. The Russian doctor has given a certificate that the man committed suicide !!! 18th October. 19th October. 20th October, 21st October. 22nd October. 1 23rd October, 24th October. 25th October.Some time ago the Legation informed me of a large consignment of percussion caps which was bound for Herat. Recently a caravan of one hundred unladen camels was seized near the frontier. Two camel saddles were found to contain loads of caps. Consequently they were seized, as also 3,000 tomans worth of kanveiz (native silk). State of Roads —l hear that a large caravan from Kerman has been robbed by thirty Baluchis near Hauz-i-Khan, fifteen miles to the south-west of Naiband. As some Telegraph officials are bound for Meshed with their wives, I am making inquiries. I cannot render any help. Mr. Evans, Inspector of the Tehran-Meshed Telegraph Line, has just reported that Turkomans have attacked a gharry (conveyance) near Miandasht, killing two and wounding one man. Mr. Evans has returned to Miandasht and is awaiting a stronger guard. I have asked him to report the matter to the Director with a re quest from me that the Legation should be informed. Movements of Russian Troops.—The relieved time-expired Cossacks lost three rifles by theft at Chinaran : also two cash boxes were stolen from rooms occupied by officers in the caravanserai. P. M.

Feeders. —Assent of tlie Imperial Council has been signified to the con- graph 378.) In addition permission has been granted for the construction of a broad-gauge branch from Samarkand to Yani Kurghan, and for a narrow-gauge branch from Assake to Kul. (Reference paragraph 456.) 605. Opening of Famine Steppe canal. —-General Sukhomolinov, Minister of War, accompanied by the Governor-General of Turkistan and a number of high officials, presided at the opening ceremony of the new “ Romanovski” Canal in the Famine Steppe on the 18th October. Special trains were despatched to Khilkovo on the Andijan branch for the occasion. The construction of a new town near Sirdarinskaya station on the Central Asian line is discussed in conneotion with this irrigation scheme. 606. Plague in Semiryechia. — The outbreak in the Prjevalsk district is consider ed to be at an end and the cordon of troops has been withdarwn. It is now stated that the disease was not plague but some epidemic sickness 1 L akin to anthrax, and further bacteriological tests have been ordered.^ If such doubt J can exist as to the nature of an epidemic within the Russian dominions, it is not : surprising that Russian rumours of plague in a distant part of Persia should lack j definite foundation. 607. Disorders.—k somewhat serious fracas recently occurred in the Krasno- vodsk district between Kirghiz and Turkomans arising from the theft of Kirghiz children by the Turkomans. Some fatalities occurred and 20 Turkomans have been arrested. 608. Attitude of native population to compulsory service. —A Turkistan corre spondent of the Novoye Vremya states that Sarts, Kirghiz, Tajiks, Usbeks and other races in Turkistan are much exercised by the rumours of the introduction of compulsory service among the native population. They are not opposed to the idea of military service generally and the younger element is not averse to the wearing of uniform and in particular to the bearing of arms. Objections are based on the possibility of the military service being performed far from home and on fears of the contravention of religious scruples. The idea of marching on foot instead of riding is also distasteful. GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways. struction projects of the Kokand-Namangan Railway Company.

Holders of such appointments wi l be considered to have been called out for active service, but will continue to perform their functions on the railways. As a large proportion of the reservists resident in Turkistan are employed on the local railways the extension of numbers retaining their railway employment will materially afiect the mobilisation of units of the lurkistan Military District. 611.

The Timuri Chief. —The Shaji-us-Saltana has been appointed to succeed his father as Chief of the Timuris. He has also been promised his father’s title. The Russian Administration of Turbat.—The Russian Consul has practically taken over the administration of Turbat. He holds his court at the Karguzari and settles all cases. The absence of a British colleague makes this easy. 26th October, 2 . The Russian Advocate. —The Russian Advocate was recalled to Meshed by Mir Murtaza, one of the Russian subjects. He appointed him his Agent in a big case which he has against the Rais-ut-Tujjar in the Karguzari. As the Advocate cannot talk Persian, the Karguzar refused to allow him to plead in Russian. Mir Murtaza on his side declined to allow the Russian Consulate to represent him, and so matters are at a standstill. Russian Activity at Reference entry 2 of 19th October, the 27th October. General has reached Kalat. Another officer has also gone there from Kuchan. My colleague has sent some presents for the leading inhabitants. They, how ever, are not at all pleased and recently protested to Tehran direct. The answer was received that no one should be allowed to enter the fortress without permission from Tehran. My colleague and the Governor-General are now demanding the arrest of the men who dared to petition Tehran. A certain Mirza Habibulla Khan has been appointed to found the post of Russian Agent at Kalat. Attack on Abdul Hamid.—The Russian Attache was shot at a few days ago. 2 sth October. The bullet grazed his shoulder. Activity of Colonel Scourratt .—The Russian Military Attache is collecting in- ffegth October, formation about Kafir Kala on the Afghan side of the frontier. He apparently crossedinto Afghan territory and was seized: but he bribed his captors and was j allowed to return to the vicinity of Karez. I cannot understand the object ot , this activity, which is being watched. Entertainment to Persians. —I gave a farewell party to the leading Persians. 31gt October. The Parcel Post.—^l.

The Meshed-Askabad Chaussee .—I am informed that the Russian head office does not agree to terms mentioned in Summary No. 31. The Bais-ut-Tuj jar is being pressed to sign a new agreement. Movements of Russian Troops—The time-expired Cossacks have returned to Meshed. This is owing to an increase in the length of service which has just come into force. There was also a test mobilisation at Tashkent. Owing to alleged increase of work, the telegraphist had ceased to give us Reuters and so we were in the dark. My colleague thought that war was imminent. The matter has now been explained. ‘ INDUL FOKEIGN SE No 50.VI, dated 11 &lt;•&gt; r f* 1 O Uflb i V Q, M. Prew, Simla,—No. C. 556 F. D,—11-12-13 —2?.—M.

Reports from various stations mention its enforcement and the consequent disappointment caused among all men affected. Having regard to the date of the order the delay in its communication to the Turkistan Military District is curious. 624. Test mobilisation. —From reports received a total of 3,700 reservists were mobilised at Tashkend. They were distributed to the barracks of the various regiments and uniform was issued to them. On the return of the Minis ter for War from Ferghana on the 20 th October he passed from point to point in an automobile inspecting various corps and witnessed the trial entrainment of the 3 rd Turkistan Rifle Regiment. General Sukhomolinov left for Russia on the 22 nd October, and on the 23rd the assembled reservists and the registered transport vehicles and animals were demobilised and dismissed. Reservists of the class of 1908 who had been called out for a month s training were also dismissed. On or about the 24th October a test mobilisation on the lines of that at Tash kend was ordered at Samarkand and in the Katta Kurghan, Jizak, and Khojend districts of that province. All establishments at which spirituous liquor can be bought in these districts have been closed. 625. Exemption of railway reservists. —The Governor-General has notified the Tashkend and Central Asian Railways that by orders of the Minister of War reservists who are employed as watchmen on these lines will be exempted from future reservist trainings. 626.

Conscripts. —Sons of Russian and Armenian residents at Merv who have attained the age for military service have been sent to Russia to undergo their service. 628. Military Works. —Transport sheds are to be built at Kushk at a cost of £ 700, to be completed by May 1914. A barrack for the Prisoners Escort Corps is to be constructed at Askhabad by November 1914 at a cost of about £ 6 , 000 . 629.

He only intends to stay two or three weeks, having sold all his Bibles and other books before leaving Birjand. It seems tolerably certain that his Society will locate Mission branches in these two cities at an early date. General. The Revenue Department in Sistan. —Monsieur Pacpiet convened a Majlis on the 14th instant at which Sardar Purdil Khan, Mulla Muhammad Mehdi, the Mujte- hid, and other notables were present. He told the people that he proposed to import an enormous threshing machine for the use of the district, and also offered to supply each village with other Euro pean instruments of agriculture. He asked the people to subscribe 30,000 tomans for these 'objects and finally suggested that each village might contribute 50 tomans No definite reply was of course given; but it was suggested that a few cheap instruments might first be im- ported for experimental demonstrations. The Question of the advisability of restricting the export of grain, in view of the hil rates prevailing, was also discussed. The suggestion had been made to Meshed by thekarguzaf, but neither the Director nor the Kadkhudas seem to be in favour of the step. There is certainly plenty of grain in the country, but the chief agriculturists are combining to raise prices. tt.« to to. him. H. no. wi.to. m.k. r-to with the British Government.

He has learnt from his Mirza on the frontier that the outlaw has a following of 67 men and 54 women, and that they possess 34 rifles, 2 Mauser pistols, 4 horses, 81 camels and 40 goats. Subsequently, Naushirwan has applied to be made Warden of the Kainat roads, undertaking to prevent all Baluch raids ! The Deputy Governor has received telegraphic orders from Teheran to call upon Khudadad Khan to arrest the refugee, but the Sardar has replied that he has not the power to obey. My latest news is that Naushirwan has commenced negotiations with Major Webb-Ware, C.I.E., Political Agent, Chagai, through the medium of Saidar lakub Khan, Sanjarani (a relative of Sardar Khan Jahan Khan), who was former y a Jemadar in the Chagai Levies and has lately migrated _ to Sistan with a sma following, intending to settle here.

Russian Justice. —Some weeks ago my colleague tried two Russian subjects for forging documents relating to a property. He told me that he was arranging to keep them in prison at Meshed until they had served their two years as they would probably be released if sent to Askabad ! However the two men engaged a leading Russian barrister with the result that my colleague has released both men ! ! The barrister is said to be collecting evidence against my colleague and his staff. The case proves most fully the rotten state of Russian justice. Movements of Russian Troops. —The recruits for the Semirechia Cossacks have reached Kuchan and Meshed.

Traffic was stopped on the Tashkend line about the same time for six hours through damage to a goods train owing to a broken axle near Maiachnaya. On two recent occasions drivers disregarded adverse signals and overrun pass ing sidings, in each case nearly causing collisions. 584.

Return of Governor-General. —General Samsonov returned to Tashkend from Russia on the 9th October. 586. Frontier incident. —The two soldiers of the Frontier Guard whose death was noted in paragraph 570 were a mounted night patrol from Chacha post and were evidently ambushed. Their service rifles, saddles, and ammunition were taken by the aggressors, their horses subsequently finding their way back to the post and the bodies were found by a chance shepherd. Ihe locality of the attack was some 8 miles from Chacha, the frontier point on the Meshed-Dushak road (Atrek being a misprint for Atek pristavate), and Persians are supposed to have been the aggressors. 587 Press The daily paper Samarkand, published in Tartar and Persian, has discontinued issue owing to lack of funds.

A special commission composed of Lieu tenant-General Klembovski (Commanding 9th Infantry Division at Kharkov), and Major-Generals Dobrovolski and Starkovski, was sent from Russia to report on the working of the mobilisation machinery. Reservists are reported to have joined punctually and without confusion at the places appointed, and shops, factories, and other establishments were temporarily to a great extent denuded of their per sonnel. The fact that not a single drunken man was seen is noted as a special ly gratifying feature, but a subsequent statement that all establishments at which spirituous liquour could be obtained were strictly closed by the authorities from the commencement of the mobilisation somewhat detracts from the value of this test of sobriety. Rumours of war caused by the unexpected publication of the notice are said to have been speedily allayed'by prompt official explanations. A correspondent generally confirms the above account as regards Tashkend city, and adds that some 3,700 reservists of the 1st and 2nd category are borne on the register at Tashkend and that all have been called out. The assembly is apparently limited to infantry (and probably sapper) reservists. Great excite ment was caused nor is it as completely allayed as the Press asserts. The peiiod for the assembly of all men liable was fixed at two days. Both horses and transport vehicles were mustered. 590. Reservists and recruits. —Reservists of the class of 1908 were called out at Tashkend for training at the beginning of October. This is apparently the training from which railway employes were specially exempted. Two hundred and fifty recruits reached Charjui at the end of September, 150 of them being despatched by steamer to Upper Oxus posts. 591. Movements of troops. —Troops of the Tashkend and Ashkabad garrisons on completion respectively of manoeuvres and camp of exercise returned to their Stations at the beginning of October. 592.

The Nejd-u-Saltana came to see me after giving up the post 6th October, of Governor of Kuchan. He told me that the Russians have practically annexed the district and that he decided to resign the first day after his arrival.

Two men suspected of being the robbers have been seized. It appears that the local sub-governor was concerned in the matter. M.

Alleged Russo-Afghan Incident .—It is reported that an Afghan patrol was 9 tlj October, recently fired on across the frontier by Russian Cossacks with the result that all four men were wounded. Alleged Russian Outrages .—It is reported that the Russian Secretary caught 10th October, some Russian Cossacks who were robbing a Persian. The assailants were seized. Recently some Cossacks broke into the Persian guard-house and broke up the State of the Province. The Hishmat-ul-Mulk .—As it was important to pre vent the Hishmat-ul-Mulk taking sanctuary with the Russians or in the Shrine, I urged the Governor-General to see that he did not come into Meshed. This the Neiir-ud-Daula promised. It appears that the Hishmat did actually visit the Shrine in disguise. He however made noAttempt to stay. He asked my advice through an Agent and I urged him to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Minister. State of the roads .—The followers of Ibrahim Khan, Baluch, have robbed the post between Gunabad and Amrani. They subsequently attacked four revenue sowars. One of these men was robbed and released. Nothing is known of the fate of the others. A number of robberies are reported from the Kuchan district. furniture. Summary of Meshed Diary No. 41 of 1913. P. M.

Baluch Raids.—With reference to last week’s entry, it has been ascertained rom the Bahluli Headman, who is now in Birjand, that the slaughter of the 12 laluchis was committed in May last when 70 tribesmen (as mentioned m my Mary No 22) recovered their flocks which had been looted from Anjira. The ffair was* kept very secret, as the grey-beards of the tribe apparently deprecated he starting of the blood-feud, and hoped against hope that one would not ensue. *o news has reached me yet of the doings of the avenging band. Man Ms.-Seven (Sistani) Saruni Baluchis were recently taking 32 amels from Mian Kangi (on eastern border of Persian Sistan) to Neh ma Chako n Afghanistan i.e .round the northern shore of the Hamun-i-Sawari.

The Deputy Governor says that the Kadkhudas have been ordered never to obey his summons into Headquarters nor to carry out any of his orders as regards criminal cases and administrative matters without the Revenue Director’s endorsement.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan andKain, No. 41, for the week ending the 11th October (received on the 5th November) 1913. The Governing Family of Kainat and Sistan. —Shaukat-ul-Mulk reached Tehran safely on the 6th instant. I hear that he has telegraphed to his Mustaufi for a large remittance of funds—20,000 Tomans I believe—and that the latter has had some difficulty in raising the amount. i Hashmat-ul-MuIk is said to have arrived in Meshed on about the 7th instant. I have heard this news from both the Persian Telegraph Master and the Director of Revenue. From Meshed I learn that his servants killed a man in a quarrel near Turbat-i-Haideii. The Revenue Department in Birjand .—The Director of Revenue, Ibtihaj-us- Sultan, tells me that he is collecting the overdue taxes from the townspeople of Birjand without much trouble. The butchers, however, have all been on strike since the 9th instant on account of the introduction of a slaughter tax of one kran on each sheep and goat in the town. There is some friction between the Deputy Governor and the Revenue Direc tor over a demand made by the latter for the re-flogging of the men who were punish ed by the Governor for assaulting the Revenue Gendarmes in August last (see Dia ries Nos. 31 and 33). I am now told that three men were then flogged, not only one. The Director also requires that the additional punishment should be inflicted outside his office and not at the Governor’s residence. Baluch Raids .—A caravan of donkeys, carrying agricultural produce from Sistan to Birjand, was attacked on about the 6th instant between Bandan and Anjira. Two men were seriously wounded and the donkeys were carried off in addition to some women. The robbers, nine in number, were probably Sistani Baluchis, but may possibly have been Afghans. I am enquiring further into this question. The Karguzar in Sistan .—Monsieur Paquet has informed His Majesty’s Vice- Consul in Sistan that he is getting this official removed, having detected him in a corrupt conspiracy with a Customs subordinate. As Mirza Ishak Khan only arrived in Sistan last March, and has given no trouble to either this Consulate or the Rus sian, so far as I know, it is regrettable that his period of office should be cut so short.

In the course of the afternoon, the Sanad and Badge of “Khan Sahib” were delivered to Mirza Muhammad Beg, Sub-Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Birjand Dispensary. The title had been conferred on this officer by the Government of India on the 1 st January 1913. 17th October. —I commenced the return journey to Sistan and marched to Mud •—25 miles.

The Naib-ul- Hukumeh, Telegraph Master and Post Master of Sarbisha all called upon me after my arrival in camp. General. Baluch Raids. —With reference to entries in Diaries Nos. 38 (item d.) and 40 (item c.) it appears that the band who went north-east from Bandan only consisted of 13 men. These after carrying off two flocks of sheep near Anjira were all cap tured by surprise by the Bahluli owners, who massacred 12 of them and released the thirteenth after cutting off his nose and ears and plucking out his beard, telling him to inform Sardar Jehind that they would similarly treat other raiders who entered their country. On the 16th instant, a party of 170 Baluchis is said to ha ve crossed the road between Lab-i-Bring and Bandan going north-eastwards to exact revenge for this outrage. They met a telegraph linesman on the road and toldhim that their only object was to punish the Bahlulis. Revenue Department in Sistan. —Sardars Khudadad Khan and Purdil Khan have both been visiting Sistan City during the week in connection with questions concerning the Revenue Department. It was Purdil Khan’s turn this year to con struct the Band-i-Kuhak, and he had done it so inefficiently that Khudadad Khan had to construct it anew after a breach early in the season. The Karguzar in Sistan. —At the entreaty of this official, Mirza Ishak Khan, I telegraphed to His Majesty’s Legation recommending that the Revenue Depart ment should forgive him. In reply I have been informed that the Persian Foreign Office are not transferring the Mirza. The Governing Family of Kainat and Sistan. —Shaukat-ul-Mulk has telegraphed to his mother at Birjand that he is quite satisfied with his treatment in Tehran and his “face has been made white”.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul forSistan andKam, No. 40, jor the week ending the 4th .(received on the 27th) October 1913. The Governing Family of Kainat and Hissam-ud-Daula, I hear, continued his journey from his first stopping place on about the 27th September. He is now at a shrine near Rikat about 20 miles west of Birjand. The Revenue Department in Birjand. —The new Director, in spite of his mina tory proclamations of last week, has kept quiet up to date. This partly may be due to the warning which His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has given to the Treasurer-General. At the same time I hear that the old Director has not yet fully handed over charge, and that he is quarrelling with his successor over the last monthly remittance of 2,000 Tomans from Meshed, which the Bank have apparently delivered to Ibtihaj- us-Sultan ! The money was sent for disbursal in salaries, and no doubt was meant for the outgoing lot of officials and sowars. The latter, in Ibtihaj-us-Sultan’s opinion, perhaps, have forfeited their claims by their attempted desertion and certain subsequent acts of highway robbery. It is said that the new lot of mounted gendarmes are selling their cartridges and pawning their rifles as quickly as they can. There seems to be little prospect of efficiency in this service when the chief officer is a Persian, however plausible he may appear. Baluch Raids. — {a) The news mentioned in last week’s diary under, (c), about the Thanedar of Robat having intercepted some loot, is confirmed by the Political Agent, Chagai. The animals numbered 135 goats, 4 camels and 2 donkeys. The raiders were Zarezais, and the loot is said to have been brought from near Seh-Kala on the Tabas frontier. The Sistan authorities have been requested to take over the animals. (5) There has been little news of raiders during the week, but on the 29th September a Baluch was brought in to Birjand, who had been captured between Duroh and Gesha. He was with three companions who succeeded in escaping into the hills. These men are considered to be spies. The captive gives no account of himself. (c) It has been confirmed that a Baluch band went eastwards of Neh, as they raided two flocks of sheep at Anjira. One of the flocks has been recovered by armed Bahlulis. European Travellers. —I hear from Sir C. Kennard, Bart., of the British Legation in Tehran, that he hopes to travel to India by the Meshed-Nushki Trade Route about next May.

Perso-Afghan Relations. —The Herat Agent reports that on 16th September 22nd September, the Governor received a letter from the Governor of Kain. In it complaint was made that some Lowanis who had had their rifles taken away by the Persian Customs, indemnified themselves by seizing eleven camels which belonged to Kainis. The Governor has made inquiries which prove that the facts are correct. The Difficulties of Collecting Revenue. —It is reported that there has been some 23rd Se Ptemb3r. fighting between the revenue gendarmes and the Timuris. Six casualties are the frontier. They were approached by some Afghan sowars. Upon this they opened fire and wounded an Afghan. The New Commander-in-Chief for Herat.— Amir Muhammad Khan, the new 25th Septembsr&lt; Commander-in-Chief, is reported to be approaching Herat. He has brought four new regiments with him. The Murder of a Russian Subject.—Reference entry of 27th August, my colleague 26th September, states that there is no doubt about my information being correct. He states that the Russian Legation is attending to the matter. I hear that the Russians are complaining that the Persian Director of Telegraphs gives me information: so it rather looks as if they were determined to show me gratitude for the service which I have rendered them !

The Musahad Question.—-The owner of Musabad, Sadik Khan, Timuri, went to 2 Ah September. Kabul some time ago. He has now returned with an order for three ploughs of land and a service of 80 sowars. This means that he will not only become an Afghan subject and thereby strengthen the position of the Afghans in the dis puted territory. but he will also attract many other Timuns to the Afghan side of the frontier. The Ismailis. The followers of Aga Khan are protected to a certain extent 28th September, by this Consulate-General. Recently they have been quarrelling among themselves. I am warning them of the danger of this course. / The Kuchan Governorship.—The Adil-ud-Daula has been appointed Governor of n Qt . Q , Kuchan. He paid the following “fees”: Governor-General, 3,000 tomans ; my 6P Gm er * colleague, 500 tomans ; M. Romonovski, 300 tomans ; and Abdul Hamid, 200 tomans. In this connexion, there are now three parties in the Russian Consulate, Abdul Hamid having quarrelled with M. Romon )vski over the division of the spoils. The Turquoise Mines. —The turquoise mines are still shut as no one will give soth September, the high price demanded by the Persia n Government. The cutters being out of * employment have actually imported turquoises from Mexico. These are inferior to the Persian stone but they are sold in Egypt and at Mecca. There is no import duty on these stones. Death of the Timuri Chief. —The Shaukat-ud-Daula died at Kuchan on his way i 3 t October, back from Mecca. His influence was very great and there will be much quarrelling over the succession. The Governor-General will take a large sum out of the estate. The Cotton Crop. —The Manager of the Imperial Bank states that the cotton 2nd 0ctobf&gt;r crop is a bumper one. The Bank has made record profits during the past six months. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk.- —The Sistan Chief has reached Buriabad near Turbat. 3rd October. He thence despatched a telegram to the Governor-General. His servants appar ently killed a man in a quarrel. Summary ol Meshed Diary No. 40 of 1913. State of the Province. —The departure of Colonel Khakondokoff is to be deeply j regretted. He was an exceptionally good cavalry officer and ^ most friendly to the English colony. He learned all games with much enthusiasm and founded the Club which can hardly exist without some good organiser. The Berheri Question. —The head of the Berberis, Ahmad Ali Shah, has come to Meshed and will probably make terms with M. Leleux. The advice of the British Minister will show him that he will receive no support from this Consulate- General in any resistance by force. State of roads. Bobbery of M. Niedermayer.—It appears that M. Niedermayer was robbed of his effects by night. As the robbers took away his surveying instruments, etc., the loss is serious. The robbers have been traced to a village, and the property will probably be recovered. The Turbat Agent has gone to his assist ance. The German Legation warned him not to proceed with his journey. A Russian subject has been killed near Bajgiran. He was asleep in a waggon. Turkomans are reported to be in force on the road. They have been attacked by the Shahrud sowars and some casualties are reported. P. M.

Communications. Railways. 535. Central Asian line. Freight and rolling-stock. —With the objects of accelerating the delivery of freight and securing the rapid return of rolling-stock, the line proposes to institute “long-distance” freight trains which will circulate from one extremity of the line to the other without uncoupling or taking on waggons in transit. In view of increased freight traffic on lines connected with the Samara system, of which the Central Asian line is one, 1,400 waggons are being borrowed from the Trans-Baikal and Siberian railways. 536. Tashkend line. Accident. — On the 15th September a collision occurred between two goods trains, 10 waggons being smashed and traffic on the line being delayed for several hours. One of the trains, after leaving Sary Agach for Jilga, could not be braked after a steep incline and overran passing-place No. 157, dashing into a train from Jilga on the farther side. No casualties were caused. There is a fall of 364 feet in 12 miles between Sary Agach and Jilga. 537. Semiryechia railway project. —According to the Turkistan News of the 16th September, a hitch has occurred at Petersburg in the arrangements for the line, which may have the effect of delaying construction for some weeks. 538. 0xus railway project. —Imperial assent has been signified to the formation of a company for the construction and exploitation of a railway in Bokhara from Kaghan to Termez via Karshi, with a branch to Kitab.

Bokhara. —A correspondent states that the Russian Political Agent is assuming an increasing degree of control over Bokharan affairs. As this action is supposed to be in accordance with the desire of the Amir the latter has incurred con siderable unpopularity among his subjects. 543 .

Its building has already commenced. 551 Lateral communication 'project. —The Imperial Council has signified its- approval to the construction of the proposed Iletsk (on the Tashkend line) to Uralsk branch, on the condition that: (a) A bridge be constructed across the Volga at Saratov. (b) The present narrow-gauge Uralsk-Ershov section be converted to normal gauge. In addition to the commercial advantages gamed by securing further lat- eral communication between the Volga and Tashkend systems the building of the Saratov bridge will prove an important asset for the projected Alexandov Gai- Charjui line, and would greatly facilitate mobilization m the Turkistan Military District.

Niedermeyer informed me that when he was at Astrahad, 7 ^ September, the Russians were completing a road from Kara Su to the Russian Consulate. He stated that the Governor lived in a small hired house while the Russians occupied the fine palace which they have badly damaged. He confirmed all that has been reported as to the purchase of land by force. Finally he told me that he was asked to address letters of complaint to the Lord Chancellor and other leading British officials. This he did. “ -- - v ^ Russian Activity on-the Afghan Frontier.—It is reported by my new Agent that sth September, the Russians recently constructed a telegraph line along the frontier. In one place the line was constructed on the Afghan side. When this was pointed out the line was taken down. 2 . Luncheon Party.—I gave a luncheon party in honour of the new Karguzar. At it the Mutawalibashi suddenly said that he wished to present an address to Mubarik Ali 'Shah, the Attache who is going on leave. He said that the services rendered to the Shrine by him at their time of need would never be forgotten in Meshed. He then read the formal address from the Eighth Imam. The deed sealed by the “ ever-living Imam ” was then handed over with a gold badge. It is gratifying to know that the services of Mubarik Ali Shah are recognised. New Revenue Officer for Birjand.—The Turbat Agent reports that thelbtihaj- 9 th September. u-Saltana has reached Turbat from Sabzawar with 100 gendarmes. He states that he is bound for Kain with instructions to levy the revenue gradually. The Tea Trade.—An English-speaking Persian, Mirza Hashim, Ispahani, who states that he represents an English firm at Calcutta, has reached Meshed. He states that his firm is the largest tea exporter to Persia. He has proposed to the Russian Legation that he should start a company for growing tea in Gilan. He showed me their reply to the effect that if more than half the capital was Russian there would be no objection to the scheme. His father Mirza Mehdi is the head of the firm and he is a British subject. 21 . An Incident at Saralchs .— It is reported that a Russian soldier recently visited Persian Sarakhs and was killed in a quarrel. The Russian/surrounded // Persian Sarakhs with a force and seized the men who had quarrelled with the dead man. The Sabzawar-Kuchan Road. —The Russians have sent an Engineer to survey loth September, the road between Sabzawar and Kuchan, which is much used for the export of cotton. They have also arranged with the Governor-General to place guards along it. The cotton crop appears to be good : but the final reports are not yet received. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturing Company .— Mr. Arthur Cecil Edwards nth September has reached Meshed to open a branch of this important firm. He is favourably impressed with the local conditions. Two Europeans will be posted at Meshed. 2 . Russian Secret Agent at Herat.- —The Russians are sending a certain Akbar, a seller of postins (wool-lined overcoats) to Herat as their Agent. I am informing the British Agent. Departure of M. Niedermeyer and Doctor Dietz. —The two travellers left after 12 th September, spending the summer at Meshed. They are making for the Kavir to the south of Tusshiz and will march direct to Nain and thence to Isfahan. They are both most capable men.

The Expulsion of Afghans from Turkestan. —The Karguzar tells me that large numbers of Afghans are being expelled from Turkestan. The reason he gives is that they supplied arms for the plot which was being organised by Yamudski, a Tur koman, and lately a Colonel in the Russian army. Kalat-i-Nadiri. —Petitions are being sent to Tehran against Russians being allowed to survey at Kalat-i-Nadiri. Their secret Agent has been threatened and no one will have any dealings with him. The Russian Secret Agent at Herat. —^Reference entry of 11 th September, No* 2 ; my colleague has given a letter toMeshedi Akbar for the old Russian Agent, Abdul Rasul Khan. He has also given a letter for the latter to take to the Russian officer at Kushk. The Opium Monopoly in Afghanistan.—It is reported that the opium monopoly 17th September, has been given to the Suraj-ul-Khawatin and that her agents are taking over the Government opium at Herat at the rate of Tomans 12 per man of 6 | lbs. Denunciation of the Colis Postaux Service. —My colleague told me with much satisfaction that the Russian Government had decided to abolish the colis postaux service as it was used for English, French and German goods to the detri ment of Russian trade. I understand that the Convention can be denounced at the next meeting of postal representatives of the powers, ihe service constitutes a great amenity. The Kaim Makam.—The Kaim Makam-u-Taulia came to say good-bye before quitting Persia for a long period. He states that he has no peace from the Russians, and gave several recent instances of which I give two. When the Russian Bank completed their new premises the Manager ordered him to destroy his ice-house, which is in the vicinity, but not very near, on the grounds that it made the Bank premises damp ! Recently two Cossacks were sent to him at night by the Russian military authorities They took him to an officer who said that the Russians wished to en gage his caravanserai at Kuchan at Tomans 20 per month but that he must repaint. He replied that the Russians had seized it eighteen months ago and had occupied it without permission and equally without paying any rent He said that under the circumstances he thought that the least that they could do would be to execute anv Repairs that might be needed. He intends to settle down somewhere outside^ Persia, in Egypt for choice : but I expect that he will finally return o Meshed.

Retention of “ olchrana —The Minister of War has applied for the extension of the condition of “ strengthened security ” (usilennaya olchrana) for Turkistan and Transcaspia for another year. (For the last 3 years the olchrana has been provisionally prolonged yearly from September to September.) It is stated that although no revolutionary disorders have occurred during the last period and although no anti-government organisation has come to light it does not follow that none exists, and if anything is proved at all by such a condition of affairs it is the efficiency of the olchrana. On this basis the olchrana might well be retained indefinitely, as the more peaceful the country the more credit is due to the repressive machinery ! It is added that since 1905 both the troops and the railway employes have been the object of revolutionary propaganda, and last year’s Sapper mutiny is attributed to these teachings. Communications. Railways. 505. Tashkend line. Sanitary.—k sum of about £2,900 is estimated as the cost of initiating certain precautions in the event of an outbreak of plague. These include the services of an extra medical officer and 3 subordinates, and the fitting up of waggons for possible patients. 506 Siberian-Turkistan communication 'project—A party of engineers and technical workmen have reached Pishpek with the object of commencing the reconnaissance from that place to the Spasski W orks.

The idea prevails that possible hostilities with Turkey are the explanation. No such procedure has been reported from other centres. 512. Recruits. —Seventy recruits reached Charjui at the end of August. 513. Movements of troofs. —Two hundred men of the 2 nd Turkistan Sappers who had been temporarily detached to Kushk returned to Merv at the end of August. Fifty Rifles have returned to Charjui from the Ansari district. Troops are still reported there distributed among the sarais on the Charjui-Kushk road. 514. Meshed garrison. —Fourteen time-expired men of the maxim detachment of the 18th Turkistan Rifles were relieved by a like number of recruits on the 7th instant. The unusually large number of 7 officers of the Semiryechia Cossacks are due to return to their voisho on the expiration of their period of service in the first-category regiment, and 25 per cent, of the rank and file will be relieved by a fresh draft in a month or' so. Resources. 515. Oil comfany. —The composition of the new and very large Emba- Caspian company with a capital placed at over £3,000,000, designed to search for and exploit oil, has been confirmed. 516. Cotton. —According to the “ Gazette of Commerce and Industry ” the amount of cotton despatched from stations of the Central Asian and Tashkend Railways during 1912 totalled 261,303 tons—an increase of 13,305 tons on the previous year.

The number of schools is not sufficient and it is proposed to construct several additional ones. 521. Semiryechia project .—Construction material is reported to be arriving at Arys. The survey of the Kurdai pass between Pishpek and Yyerni is being undertaken. 522. Projected line. —The construction of a line connecting Orenburg with Perm through Ufa is mooted.

The Governing Family of Kairmt and Sistan. —His Excellency Shaukat-ul- Mulk reacned Sabzawar on the road to Tehran on the 22 nd September. Hashmat-ul-Mulk reached Tun, 100 miles from Birjand, on about the 18th September From there he has been corresponding a good deal [with the Governor- General of Khorasan, and I hear that the latter has “ ordered ”‘him to proceed to Meshed. r Th l Revenue Department in Birjand.—(a) The new Director, Ibtihai-us-Sultan Mirza, has brought 100 sowars with him, including 2 officers and 8 Duffadars. On the 25th September, he issued a notice in peremptory language to the effect that he was collecting the revenue on lands, houses, herds and professions, the poll-tax, etc., etc., and that from the 27th instant a 4 50% fine would be added for sums outstanding ! The Deputy Governor has been urging the Director to go slowly and discreetly, to commence levying the taxes first from, the villages in the north which have not been pillaged by Baluchis, and to give all the people a chance of paying in two or three instalments, but the Director is stiff-necked, and has only in a second notice postponed the date, on which he will begin to use force , from 27th September to 1 st October. In reply to a message of advice from myself, he said that he was deter mined to collect the revenues by force if he failed to get them in otherwise, and that if he was prevented from doing this he would resign. The responsibility for preventing disturbances of the peace rested with the Deputy Governor and not himself. I have telegraphed to the Legation on the subject, as a conflict between the gendarmes and the people, in the absence of the Governor, and with the Baluchis still threatening us, is much to be deprecated. The Deputy Governor tells me that the northern villages will certainly pay up if handled tactfully. Out of about 95,000 Tomans due from the district for the past two years, only 5,000 Tomans have been paid up to date. Undoubtedly, however, a good proportion of the balance should be remitted in consequence of the losses suffered at the hands of the raiders. ( 6 ) The Revenue Sowars, who were serving under the late Director, Mirza Abdul Kerim, ten in number, all absconded on the 22 nd September. Two rifles and two horses taken away by them were the property of Government. The men owed a good deal of money in the Birjand Bazaar. The new Director sent his predecessor out after the deserters, and gave him an escort of five Sowars. Eight of the men were brought back on the 26th. The relieved Director is now leaving for Tun. Baluch Raids. —The report mentioned in last week’s Diary, that Baluchis had gone into Sunnikhana is not corroborated. We believe that a laslikar is some where in the desert north-west of Neh, but its actual whereabouts have not been discovered. In all the southern'villages, such as Shusf and Sarbisha, special pre cautions with regard to night patrols, etc., are being taken, and many of the people of Birjand even have buried their valuables ! ( 6 ) I hear from Kuh Malik Siah that a lasKhav of Sarhaddis Shahozai, Reqi and Kubedani Baluchis'—150 strong, were at Duzdab on the 18th September. They had some looted animals with them. (c) I also hear that the British Thanedar of Robat succeeded in capturing two raiders and some camels, donkeys, sheep and goats which had been 1 °°^. ro p Bampur and were being driven, on the 17th September, to Bandar Kumal Khan m Afghanistan. (d) From Kerman it is reported that Taj Muhammad Judah (see Diaries Nos 32, 33 and 35) has been killed at Chahar Gumbaz and that his lashkar has returned to the Sarhad. F. B.

He will be subordinate to the Meshed Branch, and he tells me that Sistan will be similarly subordinate. 15th September. —Hashmat-ul-Mulk started seriously on his journey north wards on the 13th instant, and reached Chahak yesterday. His camel-sowars from Sistan, to the number of 15, duly arrived, but I hear that he has sent back all but 5 of them. 17th September .—Ibtihaj-us-Sultan, the new Director of Revenue for Birjand, arrived from Meshed. 18th September. —Hissam-ud-Dowleh, following his son’s example, left Birjand to-day for the village four miles away, where he will also await some guards from Sistan. He refuses to go to Furk-Darmian, which is in Sunnikhana, but expresses his intention of visiting first his estate at Julga San jab Rud, where he will supervise the repaying of two karezes. He afterwards proposes to visit a shrine (near Sahl- abad) about 72 miles south of Birjand. The Karguzar was delighted at being entrusted with the duty of sending Hissam-ud-Dowleh off, as he duly extracted a cash present before the old man’s departure. General. Baluch Raids.—{a) The Sistan authorities have recovered 26 out of the 31 camels looted near Bandan by Alam Khel Brahuis, as reported in last week’s Diary. ( 6 ) It is reported from Lutak that the Sistani Brahuis, Afzal and Tor Khan (see Diaries Nos. 33 and 36) have safely returned to their homes at Lutak and Muhammadabad. They are said to have brought 100 camels with them which they promptly crossed over into Afghanistan. (c) The Deputy-Governor, Sistan, having heard that a large number of Brahuis were preparing to set out against Kainat, wrote to Sardar Purdil Khan ordering him to prevent them. The result is that Nazar Jan s section have aban doned the plan, but the others have all set off ! (d) From Neh it is reported by telegraph that a large band of Baluchis has passed in the direction of Duroh in Sunni Khana. .The latter district though often enough visited by Afghans, has never been raided by Baluchis before In the circumstances, Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s strong objections to going to Furk are significant.

The Russian Reference Diary No. 23, entry 1 st June, the Herat silt August sowars who took the Russians to Kandahar state that everywhere they took notes and even climbed hills. I asked Colonel Khakandokoff if he knew who the men were and he replied in the negative. As I gave him full particulars, this ignorance is suspicious. Repair of Boundary Pillars.— Amir has given orders that the boundary id September, pillars are to be repaired in co-operation with the Russians. This is probably ordered on account of Russian action reported in Diary No. 31 under date of 2 nd August. Russian Activity on the Russo-Afghan Frontier.—It is reported that a Rus- 24 September, sian General, probably General Redkc, has been inspecting along the frontier. He has ordered a track to be made along the boundary pillars to unite the posts, many of which are new. It is stated that Kara Tapp a is being made into a village. Possibly only houses for the post are being erected. I am arranging to receive better reports from this frontier in view of the activity displayed by the Russians. The Berberi Question. — Haji Husein Agha, son of the Malik-u-Tujjar of Tehran 3 r d Ssptember. and a Russian protege, has offered to seize the leading Berberis if M. Leleux will lend him his gendarmes. M. Leleux having liked the proposal, asked the Gov ernor to agree. He asked my advice and I replied that the whole scheme was open to grave objections and that I was opposed to it. Summary of Meshed Diary No. 36 of 1913. State of Province. —I have recently been making special inquiries about Kuchan. It appears that the government has been almost entirely taken over by the Russians. They have disarmed all the people in the town and along the road. They also disarmed the Governor’s servants : but finally gave him permits for ten rifles. The Russians apparently sell these rifles and keep the money. Cossacks are sent to seize debtors and all cases between Russians and Persians are settled by the Russians. The Governor is unwilling to remain as his position is a most humiliating one. State of the Roads. —Recently some twenty Sistani Baluch came to the Tur- bat district and tried to induce the Ibrahim Khani Baluch to join them in raiding. As Ibrahim Khan is in prison at Meshed, they declined with regret. The Sistani Baluch then raided seventy camels in the Tun district but were pursued by the owners and most of the camels were recovered. It is to be noted that is the first time since I have known Eastern Persia that the Sistani Baluch have penetrated so far north. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General.SECRET.

Its present value is estimated at £16,207,200. i 490. Tashkend Line. Personnel—Two waggons, fitted as libraries, are to be put in circulation on the line this autumn for the use of employes. 491. Projected feeders for RoMara.—Requests for permission to construct the following normal-gauge branch lines to the projected Oxus (Kaghan-Termez) line have been lodged with the Department for the construction of new railways: from:— • ( 1 ) Termez, along the right bank of the Amu Darya to Sarai; length 132 miles. ( 2 ) Termez, along the Surkhan valley through Deh-i-Nau, Yurchi, Sari Asia, Hissar, Doshamba, and Kafiringan to Faizabad; length 212 miles.

Askhabad-Gaudan chaussee.—The Russian portion (Askhabad to Gau- dan, 29 miles) of the Askhabad-Meshed road is stated to be in an unusually dilapidated condition, and worse since its transfer from the Engineering Depart ment to the local administration than before. Of late years the quite inadequate sum of £200 has been expended annually on its upkeep, and it is said that four to five times the amount is necessary to produce any appreciable effect. It is unlikely that useful action will be taken, all the more so in view of the Chacha-Meshed railway project and of a possible alternative alignment for a road from Kuchan to Artik.History. 495.

In May only one of the two machines in possession of the school was in work ing order—a Farman—and it appears likely that this is the damaged machine. E. A. F.

He intends to travel via Sabzawar, and will not go to Meshed. 10th September -Hashmat-ul-Mulk commenced his journey to Tehran at 9-30 p.m. to-day, by driving out to a country residence 4 miles from Birjand. He still awaits his transport and Baluch guards from Sistan. 13th September .—Baron Tcherkassov, my Bussian Colleague, started to-night for Bussia, on leave. He goes straight to Sarakhs on the Perso-Bussian frontier, which he hopes to reach in record time. One of his day's marches is 55 miles long. As he has suffered a long time from insomnia and generally takes little exercise, we hardly expect him to reach his journey's end without a breakdown. General. Revenue Department in Sistan .—Sardar Taj Muhammad Khan, Beqi, has re turned to his home from Sistan. He told the British Trade Agent at Kuh Malik Siah that the Bevenue Director had written to him through Sardar Khudadad Khan inviting him to enlist 300 of his Baluchis, at 10 tomans per Sowar, for Gov ernment service in the Sarhad. I have written to Monsieur Paquet informing him cf the departure of Shaukat-ul-Mulk for Tehran and advising him to move slowly for the present. Baluch Raids. —(1) Thirty Alam-Khan Brahuis, who live on the Shela near Glrdi-Chah, have been raiding southern Kainat. Their leaders are Halim Khan, Sohrab and Shah Beg. Near Bandan they captured 30 camels which were taking wheat from Sistan to Birjand. The Sistan authorities are endeavouring to recover the loot. (2) Crowds of people from Sarchah-Ambari are reaching Birjand and flocking to the Telegraph Office. They say that it is useless for them to return to their homfes, until the Baluch scourge is suppressed. i Revenue Department in Birjand .—The retiring Director is showing some activi ty in the matter of the opium business. He has been abusing and threatening the owners of opium dens for not buying “ Shira ' from his Department, and has been urging the smokers of opium to resort again to the opium shops. Presumably, the people, of late, have been buying direct from the cultivators. The Governing Family of Sistan and Kainat.—On the occasion of the departure of Shaukat-ul-Mulk for Tehran last Monday, there was an extraordinary demonstra tion, engineered by the partisans of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, to prevent the former from leaving. The ostensible reason was that the town would be plundered by Baluchis during his absence. A crowd of 2,000 people surrounded His Excellency in the middle of the town, tried to pull him off his horse and threw stones at his escort. His Excellency had to turn off to the British Vice-Consulate and take shelter there for over an hour. He harangued the people and told them that he was going to bring back troops for their protection. The Chief Mujtihids were summoned and made to speak, but the people would not disperse until orders were given for the leaders to be brought into the Vice-Consulate and flogged. When they saw their names being written down, the worst offenders slunk away. Hashmat-ul-Mulk, of late, has been loudly expressing his determination to enter Tehran in company with his uncle. The latter !s anxious to escape to, partly because he does not care for the expense of entertaining Hashmat-ul-Mdk and his following for so long a time, partly because he fears being murdered by the la ter and partl| because he knows that an open split is certain to occur, whenm ■ Hashmat tries to throw upon him the burden of making good the losses which have occurred^ hTthe Kainat district. These, of course, include the caravan of British goods which was looted at Neh last year. On Saturday the 13th, Hissam-ud-Dowleh received a telegram from Tehran the same time, has been ordered to see that he complies with this order.

A local Khan, Said Mohamed Khan Timuri, intervened. Although he was apparently unarmed, he was shot by the sowar. The people are now besieging the revenue office at Khaf. At Sabzawar the Revenue sowars have beaten the sowars of the Governor and so there may be bloodshed. Murder of a Russian subject. —Reference last paragraph but one of summary to 27th August.

Semiryechia According to the Turkistan News, commencement of work may be expected almost immediately. The first section, Arys-Pishpek, is to be completed by January 1915, and earthwork on the first three sections will com- mence simultaneously. On completion of the 1st section construction on the 2nd section, Pishpek-Yyerni, will be undertaken without delay. From another source, workmen are leaving Tashkend for Arys. It may be remarked that Russian railway projects are more than usually subject to the common lot of plans of mice and men ; at the same time it would certainly appear that the actual commencement of this line is in sight. 471. Siberia-Turkistan communication project. —Engineer Kozyrev has been directed to carry out economic investigations for a railway on the alignment Spasski Works-Pishpek. A preliminary survey of the northern section of this alignment, Petropavlovsk-Kokchetav-Akmolinsk-Spasski Works, was ordered in 1911. 472.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 36 for the week ending the 6th September (received the 29th September) 1913. 1st September —Captain Heron, M.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul, Sistan and Kain, reached Sistan safely. . General. Revenue Department in Monsieur Paquet seems to be suffering irom stress of work and the climate. He was quarrelled rather seriously with Seth Sulaiman, of Messrs. Muhammad Ali and Brothers, the contractors who supply the Kacha garrison with produce of various descriptions. Seth Sulaiman says that the Director sells him barats for wheat and barley, which the Kadkhudas dishonour on the ground that they have paid up their revenue in full, while Monsieur Paquet savs that the barats which he issues on the villages whose produce is mortgaged to Seth Sulaiman are met by decayed stocks of grain of old harvests which have probably been rejected by the Kacha military authorities ! There is probably some truth in both allegations. Monsieur Paquet, in a letter to the Kussian Consul, has intimated his intention of leaving Sistan on the 1st January 1914. ^ In a friendly letter to me, written on the same day, he says nothing about this intention. 7 ? TmrJt —(a') In Diary No. 33 mention was made of a small party of raiders whom ^niecUiml to be Afghans, and who had passed through Muham- mfdabkd and Khauja Ahmad under the leadership of Tor Khan Chanal One Ttht party was captured on about the 25th August at Chah-i-Payo, situated between Bamrud and Majnabad, about 100 miles north-east of Birjand.

The Transport Tax in Sistan. —Some of the Sarhaddi Baluchis who had accompanied Sardar Taj Muhammad Khan, Reqi (see Diary No. 33) to Khauja Ahmad (Khudadad Khan’s place) for the purpose of buying provisions, returned to Kuh Malik Siah with a loaded caravan on the 22nd August. The Customs Director tried to collect the Transport Tax from them. The Baluchis absolutely refused, saying that the Director should first have collected the tax from the Afghan gun-runners. They then threatened to shoot the Mirzas, who consequently allowed them to pass on. I hear that these Sarhaddis also did some damage to the Telegraph line. Monsieur Paquet has asked the Governor of Sistan to send 25 Sarbazes to Kuh Malik Siah. Sardar Taj Muhammad Khan is believed now to be at Lutak.

The health of Prince Captain Thorburn examined my colleague in loth August, consultation with Dr. Zaplatinski. It was agreed that he must go on sick leave immediately. The poor old man should never have returned as he has been unable to do his work. Departure of Captain r/mr&amp;wm.—Captain Thorburn left for England on ten nth August. wgbks leavo. 2. New Customs Regulations on the Russo-Afghan Frontier. —The Russian authorities have notified the Afghan traders that all caravans must enter Turkestan by one of the four following routes : Robat-i-Kashan, Palang Khali, Tanur-i-Sangi and Maruchak. All caravans passing by an unauthorised route will be confiscated and the carriers fined. Name day of the Tsarevich. —The usual parade followed by a ball at the club 12 th August, constituted the celebrations. The elections. —Orders have reached the Neiir-u-Dola to arrange for new 13 th August, elections. He has replied that in Khorasan there is nobody fit to be elected ! This is true but not to the point. The troubles of Prince Dabija. —M. Grigorieff has proved to the satisfaction of Rth August, the Russian Government that my colleague has received 22,000 roubles in bribes. &lt; He has been ordered to refund and is naturally much upset. f Political Summary. State of the Province. —The excitement of the week has been the murder of a Jadid or Jewish dealer. It appears that the man who sold a good many things to the Russians was decoyed into the house of the armourer-sergeant. There he was strangled by the man and his wife and thrown into a well. His wife left for Askabad the next morning. It will be interesting to see whether justice will be done. The Berberi question. —This question is still a troublesome one. I have in formed their leaders that the Minister considers that they should either pay or go. I also pointed out that by making trouble they were hastening the break-up of Persia. State of the roads.— I hear that Askar Yavar, who is in charge of the Shahrud section of the road, has murdered a Russian subject. I have given my colleague the details. I also hear that the Governor of Shahrud is treating the people most cruelly. As his reputation is bad, I am inclined to believe this, and promised to draw the attention of the Legation to the matter. It is reported that a Russian has been murdered near the Darband-i-Arghawan Shah, one of the natural entrances into Kalat-i-Nadiri. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General,CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 34 for the week ending the 23rd August, (received on the 24th September) 1913. Attack on the Mutawalibashis —Kardash Bala, a bravo who has often appeared leth August, in these reports, was recently paid by a Russian subject to threaten the Mutawali- bashi. He sprang out on to him with a revolver and threatened to shoot him. As the man is protected by the Russian Consulate, no redress is possible. The Berberis. —The Berberis are now trying to evade payment of the new 17th August, taxes by bribing at Tehran. They have sent 1,000 tomans to ^Tehran and pro mised two thousand more if the taxes are repealed. This is the best way to work in Persia. Russian Intrigues at Danagaz.- —Both M. Leleux and I have heard that the i8th August. Russian Consulate demanded a large present from the Governor of Darragaz and that as he refused to give it, my colleague is insisting on the Governor-General sending the discredited Governor of Turbat there. As M. Leleux says, the scandal is growing very fast. The Karez Doctor. —The Karez doctor has returned from leave. He will 19th August, hand over to a successor in a few weeks. Arrival of Mr. Frederick Hale. — Mr. Hale reached Meshed. He is going to 20th August, open a branch of the Bank at Birjand, where Mr. Howson has been serving as Agent of the Bank. 2. Arrival of the New Karguzar. —'The Vosuk-u-Saltana reached Meshed. The Attache went out to welcome him. The Salar-ud-Daula.—A letter was recently received by my colleague for 2 ist August, the Salar-ud-Daula from St. Petersburg. My colleague observed that it remained to be seen whether he would agree to the terms offered to him. The letter has been forwarded to the Russian Consul at Kermanshah. Russian Justice. —M. Leleux informed me that his passport officer at Baj- 22 nd August, giran was recently wounded by the Russian Non-Commissioned Officer in charge of a patrol. The Russian was drunk at the time. An officer came to examine into the case and without seeing the wounded man or any of the Persian witnesses, who included M. Leleux s head clerk, declared that no wounding ha taken place! The Troubles of Prince Dabija.—Re entry of 14th August, I am informed 23 rd August that my colleague has only been ordered to refund 18,000 roubles and not 22,000 roubles’ as reported by me.

Central Asian Line, Alterations. —The sum of £23,700 has been assigned for initial work on the rectification of the profile of the line which will be taken in hand early next year. The object in view is the increase in the carrying capacity of the line by permitting the running of goods trains up to 800 tons in weight. The average weight for 1912 for goods trains on the line amounted to 479 tons. 453. Personnel. —So many applications for service on the Omsk line have been received from employes of the Central Asian Railway that the Management of the first-named line has issued a circular that, except in the higher grades of the traffic department, no vacancies exist. 454. Tashkend Line. Rolling stock. —It is proposed to introduce next year a new type of goods waggon on this line with a capacity of 29 tons. (1,800 yuds: goods waggons at present in use are 900 and 1,000 'puds.) The present 3rd class caniagcs are also to be gradually replaced by vehicles of an improved type permitting increased facilities for passengers rest at night. 455. Semiryechia project. —An agent of the Management of the projected line has reached Djarkend to consider the question of the construction of the sections Vyerni-Djarkend-Kuldja. The inhabitants are anxious to ensure construction at the same time as that of the Arys-Vyerni section, and are willing to take shares iu» order to increase the available capital. Coal of good quality is reported to exist in the vicinity of Djarkend. 456. Feeders. —Certain private individuals request permission to construct a narrow-gauge branch for 4 general utility from Assake on the Andijan branch of the Central Asian Railway to Kul in the Skobelev district, 9 miles in length. The Military Governor of Syr Darya recommends the construction of a narrow- gauge branch from Kazalinsk station on the Tashkend line to the town 7 miles distant. 457. Cold storaqe. —The first experimental train in connection with this scheme (reference paragraph 334) reached Moscow from Tashkend on the 3rd August with 32 tons of fruit, vegetables, and meat. It was accompanied by a special commission. Roads. 458. Mechanical traction.—In connection with the recent despatch of traction engines to Kushk, a road train consisting of a traction engine and 7 waggons reached Takhta Bazar from Tash Kepn by the chaussee. _ The construction of a chaussee from Khojend station to the town is to be under- taken.

Khan Yomudski to his share in collecting funds for the Red Crescent in the Balkan war which, as noted before, is the view generally taken by the native population. There is little doubt that the primary cause of whatever disaffection may exist mav be sought for in Turkoman sympathy for their co-religionists but it may well be doubted if the Russian authorities would have taken such drastic action merely to curb the manifestations of a natural sympathy with wounded Turks. 460. Khiva. The Khan of Khiva has applied to Tashkend for the services of a Russian officer as tutor to his young son. 461. Postal Parcels .—Russian authorities are still tilting at the hated Postal Parcels Convention. A proposal from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to close certain points on the Russian frontier with Persia to the postal parcel traffic, and to conclude a special agreement with Persia for the exchange of postal parcels has been considered by the Council of Ministers and referred to the legislative authorities. Militaky. the Turkish Military District invalided among all military 462. Health statistics.—Y ot February 1913 shews the lowest percentage of deaths and men districts 463 Sapper Court-Martial .—It is reported that the Tsar has remitted the uix- expired portion of confinement in a fortress of Colonel Yerantsev, former ly commanding the 1st Battalion Turkistan Sappers. This officer was sentenc ed in January to 1 year and 4 months’ confinement for inaction during the Sap per mutiny last summer by Court-Martial at Tashkend. 464 Reported disturbances .—disturbances among the Ansari Turkomans betweenCharjui and Kerki, which were motived by excessive taxation by the Amir of Bokhara have terminated apparently without much trouble. The rifle detachment has returned to Charjui, and the Bokharan troops to their capital. A detachment of Russian troops from Bokhara, however, is still reported in the Ansari district. 465 Movements of troops. —-Detachments of rifle units at upper and lower Oxus posts have left for Samarkand to take part in the manoeuvres of the 1st Turk istan Army Corps which are due to commence near Samarkand on the 6th Sep tember. Presumably they will be used to approximate the ranks of the complete rifle units participating to war strength. Four hundred Kavkaz Cossacks have proceeded to Kushk for camp of exercise with the garrison and with the battalion of the 13th Turkistan Rifles which proceeded thither somewhat earlier. 466. Reservists. —The training of reservists at Kushk is completed. 467. Recruits. —One hundred and ten recruits reached Charjui between the 18th and 29th July. No explanation of this very unusual proceeding has yet been received. Resources. 468. Irrigation of Famine Steppe. —The main canal is reported to be practic ally completed and its opening in September is expected. It takes off from the left bank of the Syr Darya near the station of Khilkovo of the Central Asian line and runs to the Sart village of Begavat where it divides into two branches. Its total length is 92 miles and it is calculated to irrigate an area of 178,750 acres of previously barren steppe. Its construction has cost the Government somewhat over £500,000. 469. Cheleken oil supply. —During the first half of the current year the out put of oil from wells on Cheleken was 30% less than that for the corresponding period of 1912. E. A. F.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 35, for the week ending the 30th August (received the 22nd September) 1913. 24th August.—The gun which is fired in Birjand during Ramazan to intimate to the people the hours of Aftar (fast-breaking) and Sahar (morning) burst to-day. The unfortunate gunner died from loss of blood before proper medical attention could reach him. 25th August.- Captain Heron, M.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul, Sistan and Kain, started on his return journey to Sistan. General. Baluch Raids. — (a) Our News Agent at Lutak reports that Juma Khan Jalal and Idu (see Diiry No . 28) have sent to Sardar Purdil Khan 200 sheep and goats as panchuk (the fifth share) of the loot taken from Ismail Kadkhuda at Anjira (see Diary No. 21). (b) An Afghan camel-man (British subject) named Paind Khan reports that when he passed through Nasfanda about the 20th instant, he encountered 15 Sistani Baluchis of Lutak lying in wait for caravans. They recognized him and said that they would do him no harm. He was suspicious of their intentions and so sat down witii them until his caravan had nearly reached Shusf. (c) Sardar Khudadad Khan has written to the Deputy Governor of Sistan ofiering to attack the lashkar of Naib Sher Muhammad and Taj Muhammad Judah, which has been looting Sarchah Ambari and other places in Kainat, provided that the authorities will provide rifles and funds ! Shaukat-ul-Mulk tells me that it is notorious that the Kudbadanis pay panchuk to Khudadad Khan. Moreover, I hear from Sistan that the Sardar is actively engaged in strengthening the fortifications of his residence at Khwaja Ahmad, professing to be still in fear of an attack from Sardar Purdil Khan.' The Sardar probably realizes that the day of reckoning with the Revenue Department and the Government generally is approaching, but by increasing his powers of resistance to the utmost he expects to get off with only a nominal punishment. Afghan Gun-Runners.— The outrage reported in last week’s diary was not so serious as at first appeared. It has been ascertained that the Afghans originally had no idea of attacking the Brahuis, but they were desirous of hiring some of their camels. The Brahuis fired on them first, even though the Afghans waved white shawls. The latter afterwards returned the fire and effected the casualties reported. The pursuing party of Brahuis caught the gun-runners up in Afghanistan near the residence of Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan ; the latter would not allow either side to fight, but compelled the Afghans to make some sort of restitution, including a gun which had been earned off. He also took four rifles for himself. The rumour that some silk and rugs belonging to Seth Maham Smgh had been looted proves to be incorrect. The articles have safely reached Kuh Malik Siah. I am informed that the Afghans were Niamat Khel Nasars from Kandahar, led by Hakim Khan and Karim, and Sulaiman Khels from Ghazni, led by Jan Muhammad and Mehr Dil. They numbered 45 men and had 75 camels. They had about 700 rifles and 70,000 cartridges. The Governina Family of Kainat and the 28th instant the three Anura jointly Veceived two telegrams, one from the Ministry of the Interior and India, Foreign Secretary's No. PM, dated 25 SEP 1913•ryjiiflrr ! I I I' 1 the other from the President of the Council, insisting on their coming to Teheran. It is now practically settled that Shaukat-ul-Mulk will start on the 8th September and Hashmat-ul-Mulk a day or two later. The former refused to travel with the latter, telling me that he was afraid of being murdered . Hashmat-ul-Mulk wired to his friend Hyder Ali Khan in Sistan on the 28th instant to send him up Jambazes and Sowars with four fat horses as quickly as possible, as he is about to proceed on a journey. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has received from me a letter of assurance that he will not be detained in Teheran more than a month against his will, and that he will not be forced personally into a Court of Law by either the Treasurer-General or Yamin-i-Nizam, a relation by marriage, who claims properties m Birjand from him. Hashmat-ul-Mulk has informed Shaukat that he is going up under a guarantee from the Russian Consul who assures him that directly he leaves Kainat his person and property will be safe ! We hardly believe that Hashmat will go to Teheran, but he tells me that he is taking proofs with him that will con found some of my friends. I believe he means to insinuate that my predecessors in the Consulate and the Political Agent, Chagai, are the real instigators of the Baluch raids ! Baron Tcherkassov and Hashmat-ul-Mulk have dined with each other c eight times during Ramazan. It will be interesting to see the results of their collaboration.

Karbelai Muhammad Ali Eeza, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s chief adherent and business manager, with his brother-in-law Karbelai Muhammad Hassan, had some 60 camels looted from beyond Muhammadabad. Karbelai Muhammad Hassan is the contractor for supplying Telegraph poles to the Russian Inspector. He appeal ed to the Russian Consul, who addressed the Shaukat-ul-Mulk in a very per emptory way, demanding that he should obtain recovery of the camels under pain of the matter being reported to Teheran. The Governor, I understand, replied that he was not responsible for property looted by raiders, while the Persian Gov ernment maintained no military force here. The Russian Consul sent his Ghulam Bashi and two Ghulams (all Brahuis) to catch up the raiders and recover the camels. Before leaving Birjand the Ghulam Bashi interviewed Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the latter is said to have sent two of his men with the party. The Russian Ghulams have returned from Ab-i-Garm without having over taken the raiders. Afghan Gun-Runners. —On the 18th or 19th instant a party of Afghans, returning from Faraj near Bampur, attacked at Reg Chah a caravan of 50 camels (most of which were unloaded) proceeding to Kuh-i-Malik Siah from Sistan for merchandize. The camels were the property of Brahuis and were being escorted by a few Road camel-sowars. One camel-driver is said to have been killed and two wounded. The Afghans got away with seven camels and three prisoners. The latest report mentions that they also took four bales of silk (kanabez), and a few Persian rugs* etc., the property of Seth Mahan Singh, the Hindu trader in Sistan. A large number of Sistan Brahuis have gone in pursuit. I have written to the Authorities at Chakansur about the outrage. The Governing Family of Kainat and Sistan —His Majesty’s Legation has been pressing the Ala-es-Saltaneh, President of the Council, who is acting as Minister of the Interior, to insist on Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hashmat-ul-Mulk going to Tehe ran, or, in the latter’s case, leaving the Kainat. Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s Teheran Agent has telegraphed recommending compli ance “ as the occasion is critical ”, but the Minister’s promised order has not yet reached Birjand. k Shaukat-ul-Mulk has informed me that he will start immediately after the 1st of Shaban-about the 2nd or 3rd September. Hashmat-ul-Mulk has told me that he will start at the same time ; he has asked me to give him something m writing about the nature of our demands against him, so that when he has satisfied them the members of the Persian Government may not severally extort fees from him. I am ready to do this.4* Enclosure ’ *er fri.Ti Sitritary, !a41a. /V C S 7 M, +rt'&lt; 11 SEP t»13 CONFIDENTIAL. —-«5\ &gt; Y ^ Meshed Diary No. 31 for the week ending the 2nd August (received 8th Sep tember) 1913.

Persia, the Pivot of World Politics.—The fact that King George reached Berlin 31st Jul 7- before the Tsar is interpreted to mean that England has asked Germany to join in turning Russia out of Persia.

Both my colleague and I hear that he has paid 4,000 tomans for the post, which sum he can only recover at the expense of our subjects. Consequently, we shall warn him to be careful when he arrives. This is the first time that the post has been put up to open auction. Afghan Caravans in Turkestan—The Herat Agent reports that Afghan 5thAugust . caravans are now met on the Russian frontier, and given an escort of Cossacks or soldiers to Panjdeh. The men complain bitterly of the sums which the escort squeezes from them. The Kabul-Herat Road—An intelligent Jemadar of the Kurram Militia has recently travelled to Meshed by Kabul and Herat. He states that thirty-two bttl Au g u8t * caravansarais have been built on the road, at all of which forage and supplies can be purchased. Gangs of men are also at work on the bad sections of the road. Nine stages pass through a country inhabited by Shias. _ The Jemadar states that the peasants are treated with great cruelty, their animals being taken, and forced labour being enforced without mercy.

The Central Asian Railway. —According to Petersburg papers the report on the inspection of the Central Asian Railway by the higher railway administra tion presented to the Council of Ministers, notes various shortcomings, the prin cipal being: (а) Serious insufficiencies in water-supply. (б) Inadequate ballasting at many points. (c) Inadequate number of openings for escape of flood water. (d) Unsatisfactory reconstruction of bridges. The condition of the Charjui Railway bridge, owing to danger of washing out by the Amu Darya is considered particularly serious. (e) Necessity for thorough reconstruction of various stations, among those noted being Askhabad, Samarkand, Kokand, Andijan, and Charjui. (/) Inadequacy of goods platforms along the whole line with regard to increasing freight traffic. 421 Derailment.— On the 11th July a goods waggon, derailed owing to a broken axle, interrupted traffic between Emba and Kuduk on the Tashkend fine, and damaged the permanent way. 42 -&gt; Proposed stofion.— The passing-place at the 145th verst of the Andijan branch'oi the Central Asian line is to be converted into a station. Feeter —Application has been made for the private narrow-gauge branch from Melnikovo station on the Central Asian line to the Shurabad coal mines to be rated as a “ branch of general utility. 494 Rumoured branch construction .—Some months ago a rumour was current at Kerki that a line was to be constructed from that place to Takhta Bazar, and thafengineeL hLd Ztt Kerki to prospect.

The papers also confirm the arrest rf several Turkoman notables of the Merv distant, and state that the reasons for such action are kept a profound secret and that it can only be surmised that the existence of a secret organisation has been discovered.^ - From other sources the recent arrest of a wealthy Jadid (or Meshed Jew) is reported at Merv, where also the Turkomans have unsuccessfully sought to learn from the Governor the cause of the arrest of their elders Copies of the HcM-ul- MaTin” arriving at Merv have been confiscated by the police and the names of recipients noted Native opinion still ascribes the action m respect to the Jadid Amfnov and to the Turkoman notables to the determination of the Russian autho rities to prevent Turkoman pecuniary aid from reaching the lurks. Two additional facts are reported this week which may or may not have a bearing on the matter : the one is the move below-noted of certain detachments from Kushk to Merv, and the other the hasty removal of ammunition from an out-lyina magazine at Sorakhs to one in the centre of the cantonment. The latter action would be a natural precaution on the part of an isolated and weak garrison if the temper of the surrounding Turkoman sections were called in questioi. 428 Tkefl of rifle.— Two Afghans being deported from Takhta Bazar under escort of a native djigit, assaulted the djigit and made off with his Berdan rifle. 429 Electric lighting.— The Termez town management committee have concluded an agreement with a private individual for the electric lighting of the civilian settlement. Ethnography. aso Educational . —The Kokand town management committee are purchasing land from private owners at a cost of over £5,000 for the erection of school The Central Asian Railway is building a boarding-school at Merv with quarters for the instructional staff. 431. Immigration. —Owing to the condition of crops in Central Russia, an unusually large number of immigrants to Turkistan is expected this year. Military. 432. Health statistics. —The Press states that the Turkistan Military District occupies the second highest place among military districts as regards mortality for the month of January 1913; the Pri-Amur Military District furnishes the highest percentage. 433. Movements of troops. —150 Fortress Artillery, 100 Frontier Guard, and 50 Kavkaz Cossacks have been despatched to Merv from Kushk. A field-battery of the 4th Rifle Artillery Division has returned to Merv from practice camp near Askhabad. 434. Barrack construction. —The construction of five barrack buildings has been commenced in the interior of Kushk post. Resources. 435. Reported new oil-field. —An oil-field of considerable extent is reported to have been discovered along the Ala Kul bay on Lake Balkash, 80 miles from Vyerni. Dp to mid-July 1,000 applications for concessions had been received. 436. Horse-breeding. —The visit of Prince Sherbatov is expected in connec tion with the institution of horse-breeding establishments in Turkistan. Up wards of 87,000 acres have been ear-marked for the purpose of new studs. 437. Irrigation. —The investigations of the party at work on irrigation re connaissance in the north-western portion of the Famine Steppe are completed. E. A. F. REDL, Major, Military Attache.SECRET.

Press states that the management of the line is considering the construction of five new passing-places in view: of the increase of traffic. . - - ^ This may possibly refer to the Tashkend-Andijan section, where the con struction of additional passing facilities has been contemplated for some time • otherwise it is not easy of comprehension, as, on a i/ecent journey, I noted that certain previously existing passing sidings between Askhabad and Tashkend had been removed entirely and that the connecting gear at others had been dis mantled for the time. About 17% would represent the proportion of existing'pass- ing-places which are temporarily disconnected 439. Accident.—k passenger train had a narrow escape from a severe acci dent on the 26th July, when it ran into a herd of camels on the line between Askh abad and Bezmen. The engine was damaged and had to be replaced. 440. Attempted train-wrecking.—On the 24th July the engine of the Orcn- burg-Tashkend express ran on to a rail placed across the track between Kauljur and Solenaya stations, about 800 miles north of Tashkend. The driver was able to apply the brakes in time to mitigate the shock and no serious damage was caused. 441. Railway extension to Khiva. —The Khivan authorities have signified their willingness for the Khanate to be connected by rail with Russian territory. According to the papers a line from one of the stations of the Central Asian line into the interior of the Khanate is projected. 442. Railway investigation in Khorasan. —Two Russian engineers recently arriv ed at Meshed from Chacha, having carried out a rough preliminary investigation as to the feasibility of continuing the projected Tejen-Chacha branch [reference paragraph 362 (a)] to Meshed. They were deputed by Engineer Kovalevski, the originator of the Kokand-Namangan line and an active participant in the Oxus railway and several other branch projects in Turkistar. They left two days later with the intention of carrying out a similar investigation on the Kucha i-Daiagez- Artik alignment, and on their report will probably depend the alignment of the future branch to and beyond the Persian frontier. On the Chacha-Meshed alignment a gorge 50 yards wide at Chacha and further on two passes, the highest 6 200' in height, have to be dealt with. The Artik route presents less difficulty and a carriage has been driven over the existing track from Kuchan to Artik. The retention of the Ch^cha alignment, however, would facilitate the develop ment of the Tejen oasis by a railway, while, Artik being only a few miles from the Persian frontier, no benefit to Transcaspia itself would accrue from ita adoption as a starting point. activity'in the Tejen district, the movements of military patrols in every direction, and the arrest of Turkomans.

Heat in JJranscas'pia. —The heat prevailing in Transcaspia at the end of July is said to exceed any within the memory of Russian inhabitants. Numerous cases of sun and heat stroke occurred at Askhabad among men and horses, and a detachment of Cossacks marching from Tejen to Merv was so exhausted half way that the journey was completed by rail. According to the “ Askhabad ” the shade thermometer at Askhabad at 1 p.m. on the 28th July stood at 117° Farenheit. Even the cotton crops are reported to have suffered from the excess ive heat. 446. Scientific expedition. —An expedition recently despatched to Turkistan for the study of tropical diseases among men and animals, and headed by Veter inary Surgeon Yakimov—an assistant of Professor Erlich—has proceeded to Bokharan territory. Military. 447. Retirement. —Lieutenant-General Grekov, commanding the Turkistan Cossack Division, retires with promotion to General of Cavalry. General Grekov is 61 years of age and looks older. He entered the service in 1870. 448. Movement of troops. —A battalion of the 13th Turkistan Rifles left Merv at the end of July towards Kushk. Manoeuvres were stated to be the object of the move. 449. Russian movements in Mazandaran. —A correspondent writing from Barfrush on the 24th July states that several Russian detachments had converged on Sari apparently with the object of arresting certain of the principal inhabit ants who, however, made good their escape. These detachments were despatched from: Meshed-i-Sar. 80 infantry with 2 maxims of latest pattern on Sokolov mountings. 30 Cossacks. 40 horses, ten with ammunition ; 30 with supplies. Astrabad. 150 infantry and Cossacks with 2 maxims. Kara Su. 80 infantry with 2 maxims. 30 Cossacks. It was also remoured that a reinforcement was on its way from Ashur Ada. The Governor of Meshed-i-Sar had been dismissed and this place, Sari, Ashraf, and Barfrush were actually being administered by telegraph officials pending the appointment of new governors. An unconfirmed rumour was also current that Amir Azam had come into collision with Russian troops. Resources. 450.

Disturbance in Sistan.—The largest tribe of Sunni Baluchis in Sistan is the Burgich. They have 400 houses in Afghan Sistan, and the same number in Persian. They at one time colonized Sharifabad, from which place they were displaced by Sardar Said Khan Narui, father of Khudadad Khan. In compensation, they were given the villages of Zahidan (deserted) and Kaud. The tribe, which they displaced at the latter village, were Khammar (Shias). Two years ago, the Khammar Kadkhuda Mir Beg regained possession of Kaud village, by undertaking to pay a higher revenue to the Deputy-Governor, Hashmat-ul-Mulk. Of late, the Gurgich headmen, Naw'ab Khan and Sher Muhammad, have been unsuccessfully appealing to the Belgian Revenue Director to restore them to their lands. On the 31st J uly, “ 20 grey-beards ” of the tribe wrote to the Deputy-Governor, the Karguzar, and Seth Suleiman, the leading Indian merchant, to the effect that if their grievances were not at once j redressed, they would either come to the British Consulate for assistance, or would recover their village by force. The local author ities made light of the threat, and sent out men to bring the two Head-men into the city. On the 5th instant, the tribe attacked Kaud village, killing Mir Beg, and five of his tribesmen, and capturing a son and nephew of Mir Beg, who were errone ously reported on the following day to have been murdered. Under pressure from Monsieur Paquet, The local authorities sent out a force of about 720 men to punish the Gurgiches. They consisted of 100 Sowars, under Sartip Zabihullah Khan, 130 Sarbazes, under Sarhang Amir Quli Khan, 150^Sarbandis, supplied by Sardar Purdil Khan, 200 Sinjaranis, sent by Khan Jehan Khan, 100 Sarenis from Deh Dost Muhammad, 25 men, sent by Haider Ali Shah, and 15 Revenue gendarmes, under Mirza Abdullah Khan, and their Drill Instructor. The two leading Narui Sardars held aloof; Khudadad Khan saying that his men could not fight alongside of Purdil Khan’s, and Abbas Khan protesting that the whole affair was the result of an intrigue against the Gurgiches. On the 8th instant, a battle royal took place, in the early part of which the rebels seemed to be having the best of it. Byfnight-time, however, their ammunition had given out and they abandoned the village, and all disappeared across the Afghan border. It is said that they were assisted by a large number of their relatives from Afghanistan, and also by the Jamalzai tribe. It remams to be seen whether they can collect enough ammunition in Afghanistan to make it worth their while to return. The Government forces seem on the whole to have done very well. It is noteworthy that a considerable percentage of them were also Baluchis and Sunnis. The Sistan authorities are trying to' belittle their losses, and have refused to allow the Consulate Sub-Assistant Surgeon to see the wounded. We believe that at least 20 men were killed, including^ the Revenue Mirza. The Drill Instructor, Hyder Khan, was wounded. Kaud is now garrisoned by a small party of Sar bazes. The rest of the force has dispersed. The Headquarters contingent is said to have looted thoroughly every village lying between Kaud and Sistan City. ’Rnl/tu'Ti —It is renoited from Kuh-Malik-Siah that a large lashkar of Sar-G. M.

The Governing Family.—On the 7th instant, His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk received a telegram from his Agent in Teheran, sent through the British Legation, to the effect that he was in danger of losing “everything ” {i. e., his office ?) by pro crastination, and advising him to start within three days. His Excellency is much perturbed and has written to me, saying that if I advise him to do so, he will start for Teheran immediately, viz., within ten days. I have telegraphed to Teheran recommending that the Governor be commanded to take certain measures against Hissam-ud-Dowleh and Hashmat-ul-Mulk himself, before he leaves. On the same date, the Russian Consul informed me that he had just received orders from his Legation to observe strict neutrality in the matter of the three Amirs going to Teheran. Previously, he had received no communication from Teheran on the subject at all. The Birjand bazaar is now full of rumours about Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hashmat-ul-Mulk preparing for a journey. The Government of Chakansur [Afghanistan ).—Eor some months past, the Gov ernor, Sher Dil Khan, has been on bad terms with the Brigadier, Ghulam Ahmad Khan. This fact no doubt accounts for the difficulty I have experienced in get ting replies to my letters, as it is the custom for both officials to sign all communi cations addressed to me. I now hear that friendly relations have been resumed between the two officers.ll ^BirjaS Sari) fid Sowa ^ Briti •&gt; Ids office ]) ij Excellency ^, eitr / -fi 1 measures jfc ives. do dad jnstieciji matter of tk omniimicatife laukat-iillli iths past, tie fe ier, (Mmik: o sign all cont have been res* (1?)

It is believed that this assembly has since dispersed. At the end of the week, it was reported from Lutak that Taj Muhammad, son of Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan Reqi, from Mirjawa in Sarhad, with 200 followers had passed through on his way to Khauja Ahmad, (Khudadad Khan’s chief village Tor the purpose of purchasing wheat. He had an enormous number of Tamels donkeys and bullocks with him.

I still hope that matters will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, having reported to the Legation that Shaukat-ul-Mulk is quite ready to go, and that very little pressure is wanting in the case of Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The latter has sent me three messengers during the week, asking for clemency. Amongst other things, he has told me that the Bussian Consul had been anxious to assist and support him, but he has declined the offer.V r SECRET.

It is proposed to commence construction simultaneously at several points on each section, progress depending on the number of workmen whom it will be possible to secure. Bridges are to be built in the winter time by the employment of special contrivances. Chiefs of sections have been ordered to run the first construction train ly the autumn of 1914, and have received instructions that the line must be ready tor exploitation in three years. Engineers consider, however, that with ordinary favourable cir cumstances a less period will prove necessary. If the Arys-Pishpek line shews a good profit on exploitation, it will be continued without delay to Vyerni and Kuldja, and various branch lines will be constructed. 394. Feeders—Prince Golitsin and Engineer Weinberg have applied for sanc tion to form a company styled “ The Company of Central Asian Railroad Branches, the programme of which is the construction of fourteen branches to the ^ Central Asian Railway with a total length of 417 miles.

Derailment.—Eighteen wagons of a goods train were recently derailed between Samarkand and Rostovtsevo owing to the break- mg of an axle, and traffic on the section was interrupted for nine hours. Owing to the train taking an up-gradient at the time there was little damage to rolling . stock. 407. Ashhabad station water-supply.—During the late hot weather the water available at Askhabad station has proved insufficient to the needs of the station, and arrangements have been made to obtain an extra supply from Bezmen. 408. Feeders.— The company for the construction of Branch Railways has completed a preliminary survey for a narrow-gauge line from Namangan to Sko- belev. In view of the increase of the fishing industry on the Aral Sea, the Minister of Ways of Communication has introduced in the Duma a bill for the construction of a branch about Ij miles long from Aralskoye More station to the sea shore, at an estimated cost of £7,200. This step has been in contemplation for quite a long time. History. 409. Arrest of Turkomans.- —The arrest of some thirty of the principal Turko mans of the Merv district is reported.

Attempted train-wrecking. —A Sart placing a sleeper in front of a train near Kokand has been arrested. Such attempts, as well as assaults by natives on railway watchmen at lonely posts, have not been uncommon lately in this portion of Turkistan. 411.

Hissam-ud-Dowleh and Hashmat-ul-Mulk have been in constant communi cation with the Russian Consul and his mischievous “ Commercial Agent ”, Rajab Ali, on the subject since. Rajab Ali has even called on Shaukat-ul-Mulk, and told him that we are “ bluffing ”, and that this Consulate dares not put into writing its warnings that worse things will surely befall the family, if they disobey the summons. f Raiab Ali was originally a merchant in Birjand who became insolvent a few rears ago He was thrown into prison, but the Eussians befriended him, and ritei effecting his release took him into service, as Russian Commercial Agent in Biriand Tbe man is absolutely unscrupulous, and quite possibly exceeds the nstructions given him by the Consul, when discussing political affairs. At the lame time, Baron Tcherkassov is undoubtedly a party to the intrigues to some ixtent, for he has personally asked the Shaukat-ul-Mulk to treat, as strictly sonfidential, whatever messages Rajab Ah brings him. The Russian Consul seems to be in no hurry to leave Birjand. He says that le can hire no mules I am told that if he would apply to the Governor, he could ret as many as he required in four or five days. Revenue Department in Birjand.-A.

It is reported that 15* July. Murad s murderer, Amir Khan, has gone to Turkish Arabia. f-’ Arrival of Kurrami Three hundred and fifty Kurrami pilgrims i6th juiv have reached Meshed across Afghanistan. A Water Case on the Russo-Afghan Frontier. —The Herat Agent reports that 17th July, an irrigation channel, which watered land on the Russian side of the frontier, has been destroyed by a flood. The Russian Turkoman wished to construct a new channel at once, but the Governor of Herat refuses to allow this to be done, until permission be received from Kabul. The Opening of the New Premises of the Russian Bank. — The new premises isth July, were opened with a reception. The Russians have now bought a very large pro perty amounting to perhaps thirty acres. The Question of the Karguzar. — I hear from Persian sources that the Legation 19th J ul y* have objected to the appointment of the Vosuk-u-Saltana to Meshed, and that he is’not coming. The Russians object to the present most suitable man, as he refuses to sign deeds by which the Russians illegally acquire landed property. I have advised the Karguzar to send a gift to Tehran immediately. Political Summary. State of the Province. —The Berber! question is somewhat acute. There is much shaking of fists as M. Leleux states that he will collect the grazing tax by force, if necessary. On the ot her hand his commander has gone on the sick list. As previously reported, the Berberis appealed to me, but were at first most un reasonable. They have now agreed to sign a paper that they will either pay or go if the new tax is ordered by the Persian Government. I have drafted a telegram to the Legation which I read to them, and which will be sent, if they sign the document. The Russians are intriguing in the matter through Haji Husein Aga, son of the Malik-u-Tujjar of Tehran, but the Berberis refuse to have any thing to do with the Russians. The Timuris are also resisting payment. My colleague tells me that the Russian Bank are negotiating with the Rais- u-Tujjar, who possess the concession for the Meshed-Askabad road, which is in a very bad state. They intend to build a new road to Kuchan, and thence to Darra- gaz and Artik on the Central Asian Railway. I hope to tour in this direction this autumn, as the question is important. __ . ’ ^ P. M.

He fears that public feeling will increase very strongly against the Belgians, and anticipates that their revenue collection will be absolutely suspended. I have reassured him with the information that his power will really be enhanced by the enlistment of more troops, and that his father will come to no harm, if he has the sense to obey the summons. In reply to this, the Sartip promises to continue in office, but expresses a pious wish that nothing untoward may happen before the recruits^ become client soldiers. f Eadmitn * frm /V# 3 ^ &lt;V- 21 AUG 1913 I O / G.

Russian Quarrels .—A petition has beer sent to Tehran by the Russian subjects’ begging that my colleague be removed, as he is past his work. This is the work of M. Romonovski, who is detestably disloyal to his chief. He is also issuing orders contrary to those given by my colleague. I cannot help thinking that he has some proofs of my colleague’s peculations, as otherwise he would surely not be able to cope with him. 9th July, New Afghan Frontier Regulations .—My letters on the subject to the Governor of Herat have borne welcome fruit, as orders have been issued to all frontier officials that they should immediately hand back across the frontier all refugees. This order will please the Russians, whom I have informed. The Officers’ Club .—The club has been organised on excellent lines by Colonel Khakandokoff, and there was an inaugural ball at which the entente was drunk with much enthusiasm. We have been allowed to join this club as temporary members. Political Summary. State of the Province. The End of the Epidemic. The epidemic has been pro- nounced at an end. My colleague tells me that it had been arranged to organise a quarantine, and that M. Leleux had been instructed to pay Ts. 10 000 for this purpose. As I was not informed about this, it would appear that the egregious Conseil Sanitaire has acted up to its reputation. In any case the Legation should have been consulted. A section of the Timuris quarrelled with the villagers of the Kaimmakam, who engaged Kardash Bala to attack them which he did. This worthy Russian subiect resembles the assassins kept in mediaeval Italy. His brother recently wounded aCustoms official. The Russian Consulate is always ready to wink at these ruffians. State of Roads.— It is reported that the Turkoman of Sarakhs have raided across the frontier into Persian territory. This is the first occasion since I have known Khorasan that these Turkoman have raided. 'P M SiVLf Mn/inv 110th July. 11th July. G. M.

Projected convict 'prisons.—The Chief of the Prisons Department is lay ing before the Duma a scheme for the construction of convict prisons in Turkistan in which the convicts will be employed on agricultural labour. Communications. 374. TasJikend Line. Personnel. —The Chief of the Line animadverts strongly on the fact that in the space of nine days three trains were allowed to approach plat forms at which other trains were standing, and two to enter sections (single line) in which other trains were running. In view of the fact that accidents which would have been caused by gross carelessness were only avoided by good fortune, criminal proceedings are being taken against the persons responsible. 375. Central Asian Line. Local freight. —According to figures supplied by the Central Asian Railway, among other local freight conveyed by the line in 1912 were :— cotton, 244,693 tons, fruit, 5,580 tons, silkworm eggs and cocoons, 1,541 tons. 376. Khiva line project. —Engineer Kramfus, who supervised the construction of the Kokand-Namangan line in the interest of Government, has been appoint ed to a similar duty for the construction of the line north from Charjui to Kungrad, and south from Charjui to Kerki. 377. Semiryechia line project. —Chiefs have been nominated for three out of the five construction sections. Two thousand to 2,500 waggons of construction material are expected to reach Arys between the end of July and the begin ning of January. Measures are being taken to form a police force for the line. 378. Feeders. The Council of Ministers have approved and passed on to the State Council the request of the Kokand-Namangan Railway Company for per mission to construct and exploit the following branches: (a) The continuation of the Kokand-Namangan line through Andijan to Jalalabad. Length 106 miles. (5) A branch Andijan to Kokan Kishlak. 11 miles. (c) A branch Andijan to Chinabad. 25 miles. In addition a loop two miles in length for lateral communication. History. 379 Plaque ifepori.-Doctor Grekov, one of the experts deputed to investi gate the reputed outbreak of plague in the Kam district last autumn, kas furnished t report on the subject to the Russian Society of Medicme and Natural Philosophy. He states that Doctor Sirotkin, the Medical Ofhcer at Earn attended two sick women in September, both of whom died. As the symptoms appeared cr&gt; ' { f;to correspond to those of plague lie diagnosed the cases as plague of the pneumonic variety ' he had apparently no previous experience of the disease and was unpro vided with a microscope or any means of making a bacteriological test. According to enquiries made by him, 112 cases in all were reported to have occurred previously to this, but the statements received are admitted to have been unreliable. The specialists on their arrival on the scene at the end of the year, were unsuccessful in seeing a single plague patient or in obtaining any further reliable pviitence Although rodents were reported to have been dymg m great numbers onlv one was found-a “ ground hare Doctor Grekov states that the plague bacillus w J present in this case and that some rats inoculated from it died of plague. ogo Fi re .—A. number of shops at Kaghan (New Bokhara) were destroyed by the SOth June, damage exceeding £ 10,000 being caused. 001 Native newsvaver .—A daily newspaper entitled the New Samarkand, under native Sanagement, has been issued at Samarkand in Russian, Tajik, and Usbek. Military. 382. Reservists.— One hundred and thirty reservists are training at Merv. They are stated to be local residents. 383 Time-ex'pired men .—One hundred time-expired men of the 11th Turkistan Rides have left Kerki. Fifty recruits have proceeded up-stream from Charjui for Kerki or Termez. 384. Movements towards Persia .—A sotnya of Cossacks passed through Sar- akhs for Pul-i-Khatun on the 25th June. It is possible that they were proceeding to the Kariz district, but no news of them or of a previous party has been received from Kariz. 385. Cour-martial. —A captain of the Frontier Guard has been convicted by court-martial at Askhabad of irregularities with regard to forage, and sentenced to 20 days’ arrest in the quarter-guard. 386. Military works .—Tenders are called for for the construction of a trans port shed for the 20th Turkistan Rifles at Vyemi (£550), and for that of sheds for the 1st and 2nd Turkistan Sapper battalions (£1,000 each). 387- Patent fuel .—^Experiments have been carried out at Tashkend with patent fuel. Food for 500 men was cooked in four hours at a cost of 47 kopeks, against six hours and a cost of 1J to 2 rubles with ordinary fuel—oil or coal. Resources. 388. Colonisation .— The Press states that land in the Famine Steppe will in the first instance be apportioned to immigrants, estimated at 50,000, at present residing in towns in Turkistan and awaiting grants of land, and subsequently to colonists from Central Russia, with the stipulation that such colonists must own property of the value of £ 100 . A number of soldiers serving in the Turkistan Military District are stated to be anxious to settle in Turkistan on completion of their colour service, and a course of demonstration in local methods of agriculture is contemplated to assist these men. 389. Dry cultivation. — A credit of £ 3,000 is asked for to fit up an area in Turkis tan of about 400 acres for experiments in dry cultivation. 390. Projected reservoir. — The construction of a reservoir on a very large scale is contemplated on the River Chu. 391.

The Murderer of Morad—W ith reference to the murder of the Indian Hospital 30th June, dresser, I have heard that Amir Khan, who disappeared from Meshed, was sent by the Russian Consulate with or without the knowledge of my colleague to Khii. i^ 1 a ^ G tt ( ? wne ^ Haji Husein Aga, son of the notorious Malik-u-Tuj jar of Tehran. He is my colleague s left hand in such cases. I am awaiting the result of my reference of the case, before taking any action, and am keeping an eye on Amir Khan. The case is singularly discreditable to the Russian Consulate, as ' the man was at large^ at Meshed, and was not noticed, until I drew the attention of my colleague to his return. He was then allowed to quit Meshed for this village. His wife has money, which was used to bribe with. A Typical Case. -A certain Bokharan embezzled money, which belonged to his 1st July, brother, who had died. He came to Meshed, and being followed by his nephews, the case was referred by my colleague to a local mujtahid. This worthy found that the nephews were in the right, but he took 800 tomans from the defendant, to whom he made a promise that he would defer the decision. Not to be defeated, the nephews hired a notorious Russian subject, by name Kardash Bala. He scaled the wall of the mujtahid’s house, and forced him to sign and seal his decision at the point of a Mauser. Afghan D lays. — Three years ago, a man was murdered at Herat, and his mur- 2nd July, derer was imprisoned. The case was referred to Kabul, and the order recently came for the murderer to be handed over to the son of the murdered man. This was done, and the murderer had his throat cut in one of the squares. | The Arms Traffic. —The Karez Agent reports that he hears that a Lowani cara- 3 rd July, van recently passed across the Afghan frontier with 800 rifles from Bandar Abbas. I Russian Quarrels. —The personal quarrel between my colleague and his son-in- 4 th j u iy. law M. Romanovski has become serious. Recently, a mujtahid allowed part of the biggest graveyard to be built over, and a caravansarai was founded on the site. Two of my colleague's servants took shares in the venture, so as to secure for it the protection of Prince Dabija. M. Romanovski, who is working with Abdul Hamid, went to my colleague, and insisted that the whole business was a scandal, which was true. He induced my colleague more or less to agree to this, and then sent at night, and had the building destroyed. He followed up this by insisting on the head ser vant being dismissed. There was a great fight over this, but again he won. _ The whole quarrel is known everywhere in Meshed, and as the servants have petitioned that their savings were all in this caravansarai, the matter is by no means ended # The Adil-u-Dola. —M. Leleux has induced my colleague to agree to the Adil- 5 th July. u-Dola being dismissed. After his return to Turbat, he abused M. Leleux openly, and refused to help his representative. State of the Province. The Epidemic. —The Karez Agent reports that there has been no fresh case for more than fifteen days. His letter was dated 28th June. The Russian doctors had not arrived when he wrote. The Governor of Herat writes that he has sent to enquire from every district, and has been informed that there is no illness in the province of any description. State of roads. —The men of the Amir Azam have returned to Abbasabad. They take one toman from each pilgrim and krs. five for every animal. During my recent tour, I heard of a band of twenty robbers, termed Shik- arries” who have instituted a regular reign of terror near Gulmakan. Upon my return, I induced the Governor-General to send a force to attack these rufnans, but have not heard whether they were seized or not. Curiously enough, Gulmakan is partly the private property of the Amir of Afghanistan. It belonge o a refugee, who has taken land near Kabul in exchange for it.

It is curious that this reduction, motived it is stated, by a deficient estimate on this head, should have been given effect to m the face of recent recommendations for the increase of salaries of minor employes as one means of checking dishonesty on the line. 360. Khiva line -project.—Ike sanction of Government has been received to I the survey for construction of a line 1,160 miles in length from the station of Alexandrov Gai on the Ryazan-Uralsk Railway to that of Charjui on the Central Asian Railway. Presumably this refers to the final survey before the actual commencement of construction. 361. Semiryechia railway pro/ect'.—Engineer Diedulov has postponed his visit to Petersburg till he has completed an inspection of preparatory work along the whole length of the projected line. He will be accompanied by the newly- appointed Government Inspector of construction of the line, Engineer Yesaev. This official was concerned in the construction of the Andijan branch and in that of the southern portion of the Tashkend line. An engineer has been deputed to carry out a survey for the prolongation of the line from Yyerni to Jarkend. 362. Feeder projects. —The Company for the construction of branch lines in ’ Russian Central Asia propose the construction of :— (a) A line (presumably normal gauge) from the station of Tejen on the Central Asian Railway (479 miles from Krasnovodsk) to Chacha on the Russo-Persian frontier. The line would have a length of 59 miles and stations would be constructed at^— As regards construction, the first portion presents no difficulties; but in the latter the ground is somewhat intersected, with a rise to Chacha. The estimated cost is £380,000 (40,000 rubles per verst; the Tashkent line cost 78,000 rubles per verst). The projected line would traverse the richest portion of the Tejen oasis, which exports at the present moment a considerable quantity of grain as well as cotton, but the Company reckons for their profits mainly on capturing the major portion of the caravan traffic between Meshed and Transcaspia and on diverting it from other routes, as the terminal point at Chacha would be little over 60 miles from Meshed by a caravan route used at the present time by both camels and mules. If it proved possible in the future to continue the line to Meshed itself the importance of Askh- abad as a commercial centre would be destroyed. Ak Jukala Kalmyk Bek Meana Juma Bek ..

Waterways. 363. Caspian Mail contract. —Relative to the renewal of the mail contract to the Kavkaz Merkuri Company, an impasse appears to have been reached from which the Minister for Commerce may have difficulty in extricating himself. The pre sent contract expires by the 1 st January 1914, and at a conference at which the Kavkaz Merkuri were represented, the Minister of Commerce proposed to reduce the existing yearly subsidy of £30,500. Far from consenting to this step, the Com pany demanded a subsidy three times that of the original, but after much discussion agreed to abate their demands to an annual subsidy of £,72,600. Other steamship companies approached returned evasive answers and finally, with the consent of the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Commerce refused to renew the contract with the Kavkaz Merkuri and has thrown the contract open to competition. The Press opines that there is very little chance of it being taken up by any other company and the prospect of regular Caspian navigation m the near future looks sufficiently black. ( 4 History. 364. Fatal riot—It is reported that the Khivan inhabitants of Hazar Asp attacked and killed a party of 8 Russian land surveyors and assistants owing to a misunderstanding as to the object with which the latter were prosecuting en quiries. Presumably the party assailed were connected with the land survey for the readjustment of Khivan taxation. No mention of this occurrence appears in the local papers. 365. Study of native languages. —Twenty pupils of the Tashkend Commercial School have been despatched to Pskend for practice in the Sart language. 366. Tashkend Pasteur Institute. —Sixty-two persons completed treatment in May. One death occurred. 367. Locust destruction. —Locust-destroying operations are in progress in Semiryechia under the personal superintendence of the Military Governor. The vicinity of the River Hi is mainly threatened. Military. . v ; 368. Time-expired men and recruits. —The arrival at Charjui of 300 time-expir ed men from Upper Oxus posts is reported, as is also the despatch of 50 recruits to these posts. No explanation of this procedure, which is most unusual at this season, is so far forthcoming. 369. Artillery practice camp. —The 3rd Field Battery of the 1st Turkistan Rifle Artillery Division, stationed at Vyerni,‘has joined the rest of the Division in prac tice camp near Tashkend. 370. Court-martial. —A Lieutenant-Colonel and two captains of the Taman Cossak regiment have been tried by court-martial at Askhabad for malpractices with regard to forage, and one captain has been dismissed the service. While a sotnya of this regiment was stationed at Meshed, two sotnya commanders were in trouble on the same count. Resources. 371.

The 2,000 Sistani Kharwars of grain, which he has thus foregone, the lesser agriculturists fear that they will have to make good.

The New Taxes .—It is reported that M. Leleux has been instructed by M. Mornard to cease levying taxes on the new basis. The Herat Mutiny .—General Abdur Rahim has left for Kabul. 24 th June. The Sarhaddar of Sistan .—The Nasir-u-Saltana has been at Meshed for some days, and dined with me. He gives a most amusing account of his various expe riences. A Shooting Tarty .—I made the experiment of inviting Colonel Khakandokoff, / 24-27th June and two other officers, with a dozen Cossacks to Jaghark for shooting. The shikar- ries, who had been lying out, located the various sounder, and four were bagged in two days, one being a huge beast, weighing 300 lbs. when cleaned. As Russians consider boar the highest of game, and as the bag was a record, we all returned to Meshed happy, after a most enjoyable experience. Quarantine Humours .—The nephew of the Governor of Bakharz sent two servants from infected Feizabad to Teiobad to buy various articles. They were stopped, but forced their way in, and the nephew was so indignant at the idea that quarantine rules should apply to him that he threatened to quarantine all the cc^s of the people of Teiobad, unless they apologised. As reaping was in full swing, the apology was promptly sent. ' ” Qr , ,• i POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of t\e Province.—The Karez Agent reports that there have been two deaths in all, since his last report. The inhabitants are returning to Feizabad. The Agent reports that two Russian doctors with a body of Cossacks are expected shortly at Karez. - It will be interesting to see whether the epidemic is diagnosed as plague. The Consul at Turbat has imposed quarantine, five days against Karez, and one day on all caravans from the South. I have reported the above by tele- gram. State of the Koads.—It is reported that Juju’sbrother is raiding near Sabzawar. In this connection there is a rumour that the Russians had several casualties, when attacking Juju: also that he was not shot, but his brother-in-law. The Colonel told me that Juju was identified only by the fact that he wore a Persian uniform as his head was smashed by the bullet. The Amir Azam has withdrawn the road guards between Shahrud and the Khorasan frontier on the grounds that they were no longer being pai . Muhammad, the Nishapur brigand, is reported to be taking service under the Governor-General, as chief of the road guards. M. Leleux tells me that this force exists only on paper, and that any money paid is embezzled. It is reported that Farhad Khan Tupanlu has rebelled and seized a strong position near Kuchan. His following is said to consis o , men, an i i rumoured that Juju is with him.

Central Asian Line. Personnel. —The expenditure of a sum of £ 21,000 for the increase of salaries of minor employes, drawing not more than £ 75 per annum has been sanctioned. 334. Cold storage scheme. —The Ministry of Ways of Communication has elaborated a scheme for a service of refrigerator cars with perishable commodities between Samarkand and Petersburg. Cold storage depots for the preservation of such freight before despatch will be established at Samarkand and Tashkand (for fruit), Aralskoye More (fresh fish), and Orenburg and Samara (fresh meat). Independently of these the line will be provided with ice depots for the replenish ment of refrigerator cars at intervals of 165 miles. It is calculated that 475 special cars will be required. These will be of the 3-axle type, will have a capacity of about 21 tons, and will cost about £ 736 apiece. Two types, one adapted for fruit and the other for fish and meat, will be provided. 335. Saxaul wood The question of the supply of this fuel has been occupying attention for some time as the more abundant plantations are at an almost prohibitive distance from the railways, and those at hand are ^ becoming exhausted. It is calculated that the Central Asian and Tashkend Railways, for various purposes, consume respectively 160,000 and 225,000 to 250,000 tons per year. 336. Semiryechia railway 'project.- —Advices from Petersburg state that the company for the construction of the line has been formed and the directors ap pointed, the president being General V. M. Ivanov. Shareholders have paid up 50 % on their shares, the sum thus realised amounting to £ 263,000. Ihe realisa tion of the loan will be proceeded with in September. Waterways. 337. Hi and Ballcash navigation. —A company navigation of the River Hi and of Lake Balkash in2 flat-bottomed river‘steamers, adapted for towing barges, and some steel barges, as well as a steamer for the lake, of somewhat larger type, have been ordered. These are to be supplied in sections in the autumn of the current year when the work of putting them together will be proceeded with. History. 338. Anti- V lague measures.-The Ministries of the Interior and of War have decided to despatch two medical sections, equipped for anti-plague measures, ' vicinity of the Persian frontier. It is anticipated that one section wil be sent to Persia itself and the other will remain in Transcaspia near the frontier. 339. Locusts. —Locusts have appeared in Transcaspia in the Tejen and Askhabad districts. The measures taken in Bokhara for the extermination of these pests are stated to have proved successful. 340 Persian robfers.— Nasir, a brother of the late Joju Khan is reported to be giving trouble on the Tehran road between Nishapur and feabzwar. Muhammad, the Nishapur robber and coadjutor of Yussuf Herat'has made his submission to the Governor-General of Khorasan who has presented him with a Wto and appointed him to the charge of the road m the vicinity of Nishapur. Military. 341. Casualties from heat. -Six men of the Merv and 20 of the Kushk garrison are reported to have died of sun stroke during field exercises car led out during the heat of the day in mid-June. The number of deaths is possioly exaggerate 1, at the same time it is a matter of some surprise that as the Russian soldier is ex posed to the fierce heat of the Central Asia sun with no better protection than a-flTmsy forage cap, such casualties are not of more frequent occurrence. This may hasten the advent of the “ English ” helmet with which there has been talk of supplying the troops. 342 Ordnance ..—Six 3-inch guns are reported to have passed along the Central Asian line from the West for Kushk. Two maxim guns have been recent- ly received at that post. 343. Transport. —Forty to fifty iron ammunition carts have been received at Kushk. 344 Kushh emeute. —Another officer and three men have been arrested and despatched to Tashkend in connection with the outbreak among the 16th Turkistan Bifies. 345. Kuchan garrison. —One hundred Cossacks of the Taman Begiment, who entered Persia in connection with the operations against Joju Khan, are repor - ed to be still at Kuchan. Besources. 346. Alleged radium deposits. —The Press states that ore containing has been located in Ferghana and that certain Austrian capitalists have cttereU a large sum for sanction to exploit it but have been refused. 347 Russian trade with Afghanistan and Bokhara. —According to the “Turkistan News ” the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is preparing for to the Council of Ministers proposals calculated to improve the contoons of Russian commerce with Afghanistan and Bokhara. As regards Af g han ' sta '’' s stood that these involve some decrease m the present customs tarms on ^ commodities both for export and import.

They have appa- rently been tightened by a rumour (groundless, unfortunately) that the Sistan authorities are arranging to cut of! their retreat. Revenue Depart^ m Sistow.-Monsieur Paquet returned from Daulatabad to feistan City on the 30th June. The Governing family of Kainat and to.—Nothing has yet been definite ly settled about the visit of the three Amirs to Teheran. The Ministry of the Interior is still advising them to “apply for permission to visit the Conthd ” Shaukat-ul-Mulk says that he will not go, unless he is imperatively summoned* Hashmat-ul-Mulk, we think, will prefer to ask permission to Visit Europe on a tour, if he becomes convinced that the Persian Government is determined to call him at last to account. The Karguzar’s functions.—The Deputy-Governor in Sistan has received a circular telegram from the Ministry of the Interior reiterating the standing order that no official representations should be received from Consular Officers except through the Karguzar’s office. With the present Karguzar in Sistan,’ I trust that no difficulty will be experienced in a strict adherence to this rule. In Birjand, unfortunately, the Governor and the Karguzar are not on the best terms, but cases calling for official reference are very infrequent. So far as I know’ Mr. Howson has always followed the correct procedure. Vaccination work in the Kainat. —Captain Heron, I.M.S., Medical Officer, and His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Sistan and Kain, has submitted a scheme to the Governor, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, which the latter has warmly approved, for the introduction of proper vaccination in the district. The proposals are : (1) to establish seven vaccination centres; (2) to chose from among the professional ‘ c inoculators ’ ’ the most intelli gent men to work in these centres. (Their present system is simply to inoculate one child from another with the real disease, the resulting mortality being very great). These men will undergo a short period of training, under Sub-Assistant Surgeon Khan Sahib Mirza Muhammad Beg of the British Vice-Consulate Dis pensary in Birjand; (3) to supply the Khan Sahib with lymph from India weekly; he is to make arrangements for distributing it to the various centres as required. The Governor has promised to finance the scheme permanently. The cost will be about 6 Tomans per 1,000 persons vaccinated.CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 24, for O i ^ . COPY TO FOREIGN OFFIC 5 AUG 1913 14th June (received 12th July) 1913. Russo-Afghan Irrigation Questions .—The Russians have complained to the Afghan frontier officials that the quantity of water in the Hari Rud is less than usual and that they hear that new canals have been constructed at Ghurian and Kuhsan. In reply the Russians have been informed that no new channels have been dug but that the snowfall was below the average. The New Taxes. —M. Leleux and M. Grigorieff came to discuss the new taxes with me. M. Leleux declared that he was simply redistributing the old taxes more equitably. For instance, the tax on professions was shown as a certain sum and no details were given. It was levied on corporations which meant that the rich paid nothing. He is dealing with individuals so that if the prosperity of the country increases, the tax will bring in more. At my suggestion he is halv ing the tax on the bakers and is also suspending the head tax on Berberies. The latter class includes many ez-sepoys and they were preparing to fight. A Clever Prisoner .—A prisoner at a village near Karez procured some red dye and then gave out that he was ill of the epidemic. The Governor seeing him‘spit ‘ ‘ blood, ’ ’ ordered his release. His brother carried him groaning out of sight and he then ran away. The Julfa-Tabriz Railway .—A prospectus has been received for this railway. The shares are 500 francs each. There is no rush for them at Meshed. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province.—M.. Grigorieff is most unfortunately leaving Meshed for Kazvin. I have been associated with him off and on, for more than eight years, and and have found him an ideal colleague. As Prince Dabija is suffering from senile decay which is rapidly increasing and as his son-in-law M. Romonovski has no experience, the position will be very difficult. There is little news from Karez about the epidemic. The agent states that there have been eighteen cases in all, and that Feizabad has been evacuated. State of the roads.— Colonel Khakandokoff left for Kuchan on 4th June and upon arriving there, he arranged to surround Juju who, hearing of his approach, fled to the hills beetwen Shirwan and Isfaraym. The arrangements made were excellent, and Juju was attacked by a mixed force and shot through the head. His corpse was packed in ice, and sent to Meshsd. There were several casualties, I hear. The Russians have rendered a public service m killing this man. Seiid Hasan ■ The inquiry showed that the Adil-u-Dola was implicated in the robberies of the Seiid. q So much so, that the Governor-General sent to say that he was surprised that I wanted a court of inquiry to prove this. I explain ed that I wanted to know whether there were extenuating circumstances for the Seiif ft was finally agreed that the gang should not be hanged but flogged and imprisoned and then released upon security being given.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Brilannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 25, for the week ending the 21st June (received the 14th July) 1913. 19th June .—Doctor Morozoff, the newly appointed Medical Officer for the Russian Vice-Consulate, Sistan, has reached Birjand from Russia. He was pre viously attached to a regiment. He is 28 years of age and is accompanied by a young wife. He was escorted on the journey by 12 Cossacks, 5 of whom relieve the Detachment in Birjand which guards the Dispensary and Telegraphist's quar ters ; the other 7 are reliefs for the Vice-Consulate escort. At Amrani an affair occurred which illustrates the Doctor’s inexperience and impulsiveness. When the party were about to leave the place in their mule-kaja- wahs, they came across a carriage containing a Persian lady traveller. She appeal ed to the Doctor for protection from the insults of a road-guard. The Doctor called for the man, and on his not being produced, arrested the ‘ Dah-Bashi,’ or Naib of the guards, and brought him down to a few marches from Birjand under custody of the Cossacks! The Russian Consul, on hearing the news, was very much perturbed, and begged the Karguzar in Birjand not to report the affair to Meshed or Tehran. The 4 Dah-Bashi ’ was brought in the rest of the way as an honoured guest and the .Karguzar has asked for 150 tomans compensation for him.' He will doubtless accept a good deal less, if a secret douceur is thrown in. The Karguzar tells me that the woman was one of about a dozen of bad characters who had been deported from Tabas or some such place, and who was now trying to get back to her home unnoticed. This story is quite possibly a fabrication. Baron Tcherkas- sov’s treatment of the case seems hardly typical of Russian methods, and goes to prove that his nerve is lost. The Ehtisham-i-Humayun, er-Karguzar of Sistan, has reached Birjand with his family, including the girl betrothed to Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan. General. The Russian Consul .—Baron Tcherkassov has heard that he will be transferred shortly to Kermanshah. He expects to leave Birjand about the end of July. He will probably proceed first to Kennanshah and then take three months leave to his home. His successor in Sistan is likely to be Monsieur Petroff from Bokhara (brother of the Consul in Rome). Baluch Raids .—No news of fresh activities. Sirdar Khudadad Khan of Khwaia Ahmad in Sistan has crossed the Shela and gone to Baluch Ab for the purpose of plotting with the Sarhaddi Sardars. It is said that J™ua Khan and Idu, the leaders of the raid last March against Tabas, are encamped with then families on the Shela, and that they and other Baluchis gave Khudadad Khan 200 sheep, by way of hospitality. A grandson of Sardar Purdil Khan has also left for the Shela, ostensibly for the purpose of watching Khudadad Khan. It is just as likely, in my opinion, that he intends to claim a share of the Kainat loot. Haider Ali Khan, the Baluch cousin of Hashmat-ul-Mulk and relative of Khudadad Khan, has left Birjand for Sistan. HajiAli Reza, Turkish subject.-This individual who has given our Meshed and Sistan Consulates a good deal of trouble during the past 18 months has now arrived in Birjand en route for Meshed. He was travelling from Bandar Abbas to Meshed on pilgrimage in January 1 , 912 f w ^en ^ e was attacked and lorted by a Baluch lashhar at Ab-i-Garm (3 marches from Tun). His brother was muraerea and three donkeys and a quantity of personal property were carried off, including rr - ^ i 1U o Li. o 1 1 co \ o !! j it- # -j O 1 ::d ; c -J 11. 10 j vj • fc. „ : r a. ; O O ■300 liras in cash. The Haji took an Ishtishhad to this effect from the people of Tun and reported the circumstances to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed After some time it was arranged that the Haji should travel down to Sistan in company with Haji Nasir-es-Saltaneh, who promised to assist him in every way possible, and that he should file a claim against the Sistan Government on the ground that the robbers were Sistani Baluchis. He was assisted by this Consulate as far as possible, and several Majlis meetings were held, but the local authorities challenged the complainant to prove that the aggressors were Sistams, and no progress was possible. In May 1912, the Haji left Sistan for Sarhad. He informs me that he visited Ladis and saw Muhammad Reza Khan Recji, he then visited Sardar Jehind’s camp, and afterwards Khwash, Magas and Arandgan, where he learnt that the lashkar had been commanded by Shamshir, a tribesman of Sardar Jehil Ismailzai. He heard that Shamshir had disposed of his liras in Kerman. He also visited Daman, Pehra and Kasimabad where he saw Sardar Sayed Khan. Shakar Khan, Narui, also told him that Shamshir was his aggressor. The Haji then went to Sardar Jehil who expressed regret that his tribesmen had got out of hand, and declared that he could give no assistance. The Political Agent, Chagai, has heard some stories about this Haji and regards him as a spy. It is quite possible that the man has done some intelligence work for Haji Nasir-es-Saltaneh, whose guest he was so long, along our frontier, but I do not think that he had any mischievous object. He admits having been down to Chahbar, saying that if he could have got a free passage from there to his home in Constantinople, he would not have returned to the north of Persia. He will Pow return to Meshed, as he is quite satisfied that the Baluchis who robbed him were Sarhaddis (under Kerman) and not Sistanis. Customs Department at Koh Malik /SinA.—Mirza Mustafa Khan made over charge of the post of local Director to Saiyid Abu Turab on the 7th June, and left for Sistan the same evening. itarv of ier Secretaryfinclosur? &gt; * f rnm - .

Russian Deserters. — Re. entry of 11th October 1912, the two Russians and the 1 st June. Russian woman have been summoned to Kabul by the Amir. The soldiers thought that they had been sent to make peace between them and the General! I have pointed out to the Governor of Herat that these people are either beggars or spies, and that it would be better in either case to send them back across the frontier. The Governorship of Kuchan .— The Governor-General has been informed by 2 nd June, my colleague that he must send a new Governor to Kuchan, or that a Governor will be provided by the Russians. Birthday Celebrations. —The birthday of the King-Emperor was celebrated 3rd and 4th June * on two days, the officials coming on the first day and the merchants on the second day. The Colonel had had banners worked with the royal arms and after the silver trumpets had used them for a fanfare, they were presented to me by the regiment. Altogether it is most satisfactory to be able to report that the entente, is in full working order in Khorasan, even my colleague being quite different to a year ago. The Local Sowars .— M. Mornard has given orders that the local sowars shall 5th June - cease to draw any pay. The result will be most unsatisfactory. The New Taxes. —M. Leleux is pressing the turquoise cutters, the bakers and 6th June * the Berberis among others to pay new taxes. The oppressed wish to take sanctuary at this Consulate and their shops are shut. My colleague and I are sending a collec tive letter to Tehran pointing out how well M. Leleux has worked and regretting his departure in the early autumn. I have suggested to M. Grigoriefi that he should tell M. Leleux that we cannot send this letter if it is likely that his actions will produce disturbances. This will cause him to moderate his zeal, I trust. 2. The Herat Mutiny. — Re. two previous diaries. An order has been received from the Amir, by the terms of which General Abdur Rahim Khan, Commandant Musa Khan and the Kotwal, who is always appointed fr 0 m Kabul 'are dismissed and ordered to Kabul under guard. Brigadier Fatteh Muhammad Khan is put in charge of the garrison. ^ Emigration of Berberis. Re. entry of 29th May. One hundred families consti- June, tute a second influx. There will be much trouble when the Russians take over the country finally. It seems a pity that these men, among whom are several sepoys of the 106th Pioneers, cannot be kept in India. POLITICAL SUMMARY. Stute of Province. —The Karez Agent writes that on 27th May the Russian doctor visited a case and made the man cough. He then apparently took a speci men of his salivT^T Eleven deaths in all are reported and none for five days. The Conseil Sanitaire unlike its foolish action of last year has not declared quarantine at present. I hear that the Russian interpreter is trying to induce men to state that there are several deaths on the Jam Rud. I am soothing the Governor of Herat as far as possible. State of the Roads. —The Turkoman are still close to Abbasabad. Possibly, owing to the Amir Azam having collected his sowars to fight the Salar, there is no one to drive the man away. Juju was driven away from Shirwan by the new Governor, Mirza Ibrahim Khan. He then went to Fahra, which I visited last autumn, and looted the Revenue stores, carrying off the Revenue official. M. Leleux has sent seventy of his gen darmes to attack him. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Consul-General. G. M. Press, Simla. No C.-218 F. D.—8-7-13—.28—J N.B. oc 1 o' u fi; C‘J I i GENERAL SUMMARY. C OMMUNIC ATIONS. Railways. 292. Projected line. —A request has been lodged with the Ministry of Ways of Communication for permission to survey a line from Orenburg to Kyshtym on the Perm line. The proposed line would have a length of about 450 miles. 293. Projected feeders. —Engineer Weinberg has requested permission to make surveys for feeders to the Central Asian line, the total length amounting to 143 miles. The projects are: (a) . Takir to Chacha on the Persian frontier. (b) . Katti Kurghan to Khatyrchi. (c) . Assake to Jalalabad. (d) . Golodnaya Steppe to Konnogvargeiski. The first named may lead to interesting developments. Takir is a “J station ” 13 miles east of Dushakh, and Chacha is the frontier post on the Meshed-Dushakh road. 294. Train escorts. —In view of crimes of violence on the Central Asian and Tashkend lines preventive measures are under discussion. A proposal to detail an armed escort of 25 men, partly Railway Guard and partly infantry, to every train is stated to have been favourably received. 295. Central Asian Line Stations. —Razyezd No. 124, between Vrevskaya and Kaufmanskaya stations, is to be converted into a station for booking of passengers and luggage. Arrangements for the entraining, detraining, and watering of cattle and sheep are to be made at Krasnovodsk, Kizil Arvat, Askhabad, Merv, and Charjui stations. Waterways. 296. Proposed junction of steamship companies. —Following the example of the amalgamation of the Kavkaz Merkuri and Eastern Companies, the Samolet and Commercial Volga Steamship Companies are expected to amalgamate, and in that event to compete with the Kavkaz Merkuri in Caspian navigation. History. 297. Turkistan Governor-General. —General Samsonov has proceeded to Rus sia on two months’ sick-leave. 298. Bokhara. —A correspondent reports a riot at Karshi in consequence of the population misunderstanding the object of preparations for the railway, in which 4 of a Russian survey party of 10 , and several minor Bokharan officials, were killed. The Amir was stated to have left Kermine for the spot. There is no mention of this in the papers. The Russian troops recently despatched to Bokhara have been withdrawn to Kagan. 299. Flood at Skobelev.—Considerable damage has been caused at Skobelev by a flood due to the sudden rise of the Margelan Sai stream, !■: 28 olit CB -.l v OFFICE ? JUL!913 | ill y2 300. Cessation of newspaper— The Tashkend evening paper Turkistan Post has ceased to appear. 301. Salar-ud-Daula.—The paper Askhabad publishes a very out-spoken letter from a Barfarush correspondent in which the writer states that the Russian policy of complete abstention from any interference seems inexplicable in the light of the serious loss caused to Russian trade by Salar s action and of the loss of pres tige involved by a considerable detachment of Russian troops looking idly on at acts of anarchy. The Russian Consul at Astrabad proceeded to Bandar Gaz with the avowed object of securing the disarmament of Salar’s men, but returned almost immediately, and apparently the only consequence of his journey was the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Barfarush to Bandar Gaz and Meshed-i-Sar, to the dismay of the peaceful sections of the population. Fired' by the spirit of emulation, Turkomans at the Hassankuli Fisheries have been behaving in a riotous and lawless manner and Cossacks and troops were despatched to restore order. 302. Herat mutiny. —Advices from Herat state that the Amir has summoned General Muhammad Rahim Khan and another official with the object of calling them to account for their dealings with the troops which occasioned the mutiny. 303. Arrest of Kurramis. —A party of 10 Kurramis, returning to their country from Meshed through Turkistan, are reported to have been arrested by the Rus sian authorities at Kahka. 304. Disorder in Khorasan. —The Turkomans raiding the Meshed-Tehran road at Meiomei have looted the post waggon, killing one or more of the personnel. ! A detachment of about 100 of the Gendarmerie has proceeded to Kuchan where conditions are still unsettled. Military. 305. Reported mutiny at Kushk. —An abortive mutiny of the 16th Turkistan Rifle Regiment is reported to have occurred at Kushk towards the end of last month. The rising was made at night and shots were exchanged, 2 men having been killed. Thirty of the ring-leaders are said to be under arrest and apparently the majority did not follow their lead as agreed upon. No mention of the occurrence has appeared in the papers. 306. Despatch of troops to Persia. —The departure from Askhabad of 100 Cossacks of the Taman Regiment and a small number of the 18th Turkistan Rifles to the Astrabad district is reported. The action is said to be due to the movements of Salar-ud-Daula. 307. Summer camp. —A portion of the 2nd Turkistan Sapper Battalion from Merv has proceeded to training camp at Troitskoye near Tashkend. E. A. F. REDL, Major, Military Attache. G. M.

He is said to have served continuously in Persia for 35 years without taking leave. Ihe other signaller, Monsieur Rossian, is now in charge of local affairs. 12th June. —I moved my establishment from Bahlgird to Kalat-i-Mustaufi (three miles from Birjand). The garden at the former place contains only two isolated rooms in bad repair, with a number of delapidated hovels, while the latter garden has a small but clean house with five habitable rooms. The want of a prop er summer residence in Kainat for the Consul is very urgent. I hope to examine a number of possible sites during the current year. General. Baluch Raids .-— No news beyond a report, telegraphed from Neh, that the people there are still apprehensive of a visit from Sardar Jehind Khan. The ex-Karguzar of Sistan. —Ehtisham-i-Humayoon left Sistan for Teheran on the 7th instant. The Deputy-Governor, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, accompanied him as far as Lab-i-Baring on the western side of the Hamun, and returned to Sistan on the 11th. The betrothal ceremony between the Deputy Governor and the ex-Karguzar’s daughter took place on the 23rd May. A marriage settlement of 3,000 Tomans was arranged, of which sum 1,000 Tomans are to be paid to the bride’s father within a year. The balance is payable to the lady in the event of her being divorced. Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarhandi. —This Sardar came into Sistan on the 5th June. Being the father of the Deputy-Governor’s first wife, he is strongly opposed to the contemplated alliance with the ex-Karguzar’s daughter, and he is said to be prepared to use force to prevent the marriage being celebrated at present. The Revenue Officials were also somewhat nervous about the Sardar’s intentions towards them, but several interviews have passed off between Monsieur Paquet and the Sardar, and the former appears to be pleased with the results. The Sardar left Sistan City for his home on the 13th instant. He did not visit his son-in-law once. Birjand Revenue Department. —The opium crop of the Kainat has been got in, without the Revenue Department having made any assessment. The tax, which should have realized 30,000 Tomans—even at the old rate, I understand— has perhaps been entirely lost to the Government. The daima crop of un-irrigated wheat is also being harvested now. The out-turn is below the average, but as no assessment of this also has been effected, the Revenue Department will presumably get nothing out of it.

The Herat Mutiny.—The Agent reports that the General is still a prisoner and that the citizens are sending away their families. The various regiments are dis tributing kheirat or alms and maintaining order. They have re-arrested any prisoners charged with murder. Hoods Limited. Mr. Arthur Carr has reached Meshed on behalf of Hoods Limited. He knows no language but his own and is consequently dependent on this office. He is starting an agency and tells me that his firm supplies large numbers of mohair chaddars by parcel post. Emigration of Berheris. About one hundred families ot Hazaras have reached Meshed from Afghanistan. This influx is changing the character of the inhabitants of Khorasan.

As usual he was given much trouble at Krasnovodsk where Russian incapacity is especially marked.

Alleged Armenian Riot. —A numbre of bombs and firearms were dis covered by the Samarkand police in the house of an Armenian, who committed suicide on arrest. Several other local Armenians have been arrested. 283. Afghan Views on Russian Spies. —The Afghan paper Siraj-ul-Akhbar ] of the 22nd April takes exception to the number of Russian pseudo-deserters who enter Afghanistan, profess to adopt Islam, and are then escorted to the Indian frontier and permitted to depart. This paper considers that the majority of such men are no more nor less than spies for the Russian Government^ and recommends that they should be reconducted to Russian territory in the first instance. 284. Capture of Robbers.—A small party of Semiryechia Cossacks have brought in six Persian prisoners—alleged to be followers of Joju Khan and handed them over to the Governor-General of Khorasan. 285.

Between Aliabad and Neh, one lashkarieW in with four Customs sowars, who had been sent by the Sistan Director to relieve the escort of a Gendar merie officer coming from Birjand. These 4 men were deprived of their horses and rifles, and one, who showed signs of resistance, was shot through the shoulder. The raiders then kindly gave the party a camel to carry the wounded man into Neh ! At 4 a.m. on the 16th the Baluchis made an attack upon Neh, but failed to force an entrance into the village, which had been put on its guard by telegrams from Sistan. One of the defenders was killed and two were wounded. The Baluchis, however, seemed to succeed in striking terror into the hearts of the whole country-side, for they then broke up into a number of foraging parties of about 15 men each and practically denuded the whole valley from Aliabad to Shusf of its flocks and herds. We passed through Kaimabad, 5 miles south of Shusf, early on the morning of the 17th and were told that all their flocks had been carried off the previous afternoon. Three of the looted flocks were said to be the property of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. We often heard the cry that if the Hashmat was Governor such outrages would never occur.

Heron, I.M.S., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Sistan and Kain, 1 entered Birjand this morning. I had requested Mr. Howson, His Britannic Majesty’s local Vice-Consul, to apply for an official isiiqbal for him, but the Gover nor and the Karguzar refused it, saying that there was no precedent. An informal isiiqbal of almost equal splendour was, however, accorded, the only practical difference being that no officials were uniform. I am making a reference on the subject to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Teheran. - \ ,V .1 .» 'vij. ii.i.l Jii. 26th May. —Beached Bahlgird (16 miles). 27th May. —Marched into Birjand (12 miles) leaving my office and camp at Bahlgird. I was accorded a very fine istiqlal 3 miles outside Birjand, in which the Governor’s Mustaufi, Misbah-ud-Divan, Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s Mustaufi, Mirza Koshid Khan, Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s cousin Haider Ali Khan, the Chief of the Bevenue Gendar merie Muhammad Kuli Khan, the Bais-i-Qushun’s Assistant Prince Muhammad Taqi Mirza, the Telegraph Master Sartip Hussain Kuli Khan, and the Postmaster Mirza Ahmad Khan all took part. The four first-mentioned notables brought led horses. The Karguzar and the Bevenue Director apologised for not coming out. The foriher is incapacitated by rheumatism from riding, but if he is a full Karguzar it is a moot question whether he is called upon to take part in this ceremony. His predecessor, who was styled Naib Karguzar, always did. The Bevenue Director went out to meet Captain Heron. He is at present unwell. In the afternoon, accompanied by Mr. Howson, Captain Heron, Mr. Huxley and Khan Sahib Muhammad Hassan Khan, I called officially on His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk, His Excellency Hissam-ud-Dowleh and Hashmat-ul-Mulk. 28th May. —In the morning I called on the Karguzar, the Telegraph Master, the Postmaster and the Bevenue Director. The last three visits were paid informal ly (an official exchange of visits not being obligatory) in return for the officers having personally come out (or arranged to come out) in my istiqbal. In the afternoon, I received return calls from Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Hissam-ud- Dowleh, Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Karguzar. 29th May. —I returned to Bahlgird. 30th May. —The Bussian Consul and his party arrived at Amirabad, where they will reside, 3 miles from Birjand. They received no public reception. The officials of Birjand are apparently ready to give one every time a Consul arrives, but Baron Tcherkassov perferred to come in privately. It appears that Sartip Zabiullah Khan received a telegram in Sarbisha announc ing his appointment as Bais Qushun and Sarhaddar of Sistan. He, therefore, re traced his steps from there. The [Governor of Kainat’s officer, Sahib-i-Jam, duly m et the Bussian party at Goraba, and reported his readiness to escort them up to Birjend. His services were, however, rather curtly declined by Baron Tcherkassov, who said that he felt perfectly seciie with his eight cossacks and his Baluch ghulaws. My colleague tells me that in consequence of the latter he feels quite sure no Baluch lashkar jwould think of molesting him. The Baron appears also to have expatiated rather grandiloquently on the might of the Bussian Empire, and Officialdom m Birjand afiects some indignation. 31st May. —Sahib-i-Jam has returned to Birjand. General. Baluchi raids .—The more adventurous band of raiders is reported to have carried off, on the 22nd instant, 1,500 camels from Chahak, Muhammadabad, Tighab and Dustabad, villages about 30 miles north of Birjand on the main road to Meshed. The raiders then passed on to Seh Kala in Tabbas and Tun province. Fears were entertained in Birjand for the safety of a caravan of merchandize coming from Meshed, and a Majlis was convened by the Governor to consider means of protecting it. Subscriptions were invited, but Hissam-ud-Dowleh would only promise to furnish men if he were paid for their services, and the small subscrip tions promised by other persons were considered insufficient. In the end nothing was done. The caravan eventually reached Birjand safely. Seventy Bahluri tribesmen have succeeded in recovering the flocks looted from Anjira. Hashmat-ul-Mulk has told my dragoman that a Baluch raiding party was within 4 miles of mv caravan when we marched from Kasianda to Shush They debated whether they should attack it or not, but decided not to do so, fearing reprisals from our garrison at Kacha. We did, ourselves, hear two shots fired that morning, apparently a signal of some sort. In Sistan it was rumoured early in the week that Sardar Jehind himself meant to head a large lashkar northwards, but no corroboration of the report has been received. The postal service between Sistan and Birjand is disorganized owing to fear of the Baluchis. Letters which should have arrived here on the 20th from Sistan are still detained somewhere on the road. rCONFIDENTIAL.

Held a reception at the \ ice-Consulate in the motning, to which all the high Persian Officials and the Russian Consul with his staff came; also about 20 leading merchants of Birjand, headed by the Malik-ut-Tujar. Mr. Howson had magnificently decorated his house with flags, bunting, carpets in the walls and in the courtyard, looking-glasses, etc. In the evening; I gave an official dinner, at which 14 sat down. The customary toasts were drunk; a display of fire-works followed the dinner. 5th June. —Returned to Bahlgird. Boluch raids. —Nothing has been heard this week of the raiders. The large caravan from Kuh Malik Siah, mentioned in Diary No. 21, under date 20th May, has safely passed Bandan to Duroh, which lies on the road nearest the Afghan frontier. From there 500 camels will go straight to Meshed through Ahwaz, while 200 are said to be coming to Birjand. Customs Office at Birjand.- —It is rumoured that the Customs Office here, which was abolished some time ago, will be re-opened for the convenience of merchants in Birjand and Meshed, who do not care to import their goods through Sistan. Mirza Haidar Khan, Customs Officer at Ahwaz, has just arrived here. It is said that he will be in charge of the new office, and that the Ahwaz office will be reduced to a sub-office. The traffic which passes through the latter place on the Afghan border is insignificant. Russian Bank at Birjand.—See Diary No. 16. This branch has been definitely closed. The Manager, M. Krassovsky, has made over his outstanding claims to Mr. Howson, who represents the Imperial Bank of Persia, and has started for Russia with his family. Only the Bank’s large claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk will be dealt'with by the Russian branch at Meshed. Inter-tribal fighting in Sistan.—A. section of the Brahuis has been fighting with villagers of Janabad somewhere in the vicinity of Hauzdar, south of Sistan. Several of the Janabadis were wounded and their flocks were carried off. They appealed for satisfaction to Sardar Ali Khan, eldest son of Sardar Purdil Khan, but though Ali Khan sent for Haibat, the Brahui’s leader, no restoration has been made. It is said that this Sardar is no less ready than Hashmat-ul-Mulk and Khudadad Khan, who dominate the rival faction of Baluchis, to receive a percentage of all loot acquired by his feudatories. Locusts. Large quantities of this pest are said to have been hatched out in the sands on either side of the Shela. They have been noticed all the way from Reg Chah to Girdi on the Trade Route. Nausherwan Khan’s raid on the Nushki-Robat Trade Route. I hear from the Political Agent, Chagai, that this outlaw has been taken into custody in Kandahar. The 36 camels he looted from Amir Chah have not yet been restored. General. G. M. Press, Simla.-No. C.-207 F.

A German and Austrian Traveller. —Lieutenant Oscar Niedermayer, a German officer, and Dr. Ernst Diez, an Austrian, have recently reached Meshed, The former travelled from Tehran to Astrabad where he met his companion. They then went to Gunbad-i-Kabus, Nardin and Jajarm, Isfarayin and the turqoise mines. They are writing works on the geology, archaeology, anthropology and history of Persia. They will visit Sarakhs and Kalat-i-Nadiri and then return to Meshed for the summer. In the autumn they will visit Sistan. Turkoman troubles at Merv.—Tb is reported that there is trouble among the Turkoman at Merv and that there has been some fighting. New Russian Dress Regulations. —The Russian Colonel, who is most anxious to learn lawn tennis, tells me that the Army has just received permission to wear mufti for all kinds of sport. He puts down this concession to the entente. 13th Mar- 1 'th May. 15th May. Mutiny at Herat. —At the monthly reading of the Amir’s message to the Herat leth May. garrison, the men shouted out that their General had robbed them of 300,000 krans and that they would not obey him any longer. He abused them and they replied, after which the General retired and the men were persuaded by their Brigadier- General to disperse. Political Summary. State of the Province. The case of Seiid Hasan. —I have gone into this case and there is very little doubt but that he was instigated by the Governor of the district, the Adil-u-Dola. I have arranged for a trial by a representative of the Governor- General, M. Leleux and the Karguzar. I have agreed to hand over the gang when sentence has been passed and confirmed from Tehran. The Adil is bribing freely and has given the Russian Attache, Abdul Hamid, a horse. It is to be noted that although the revenue has now been taken over by the Belgians, the Governors pay just as much for their posts. The Adil paid ^,500 tomans for Turbat and the Governor-General paid the Minister of the In terior 15,000 tomans. To find these sums under the changed conditions is not easy and so a band of robbers is useful as an aid. But the responsibility in the last place rests on the scoundrels at Tehran. i State of roads. —Captain Wilson wrote to me from the Russian frontier that he had come on two separate parties which had been robbed a few hours before he passed. The first was near Chinaran and this was the robbery by Aii Jauzi re ported in the last summary. I have succeeded in having a strong party of sowars sent after this worthy. The second robbery was near the Russian frontier. So far as I can learn, the Russians do not interfere with robbers unless their own subjects are attacked. Juju has left Persian territory and is in hiding across the Russian frontier. My colleague hopes to have him arrested. The Reis-u-Tujjar, late member for Meshed, sent arms and ammunition to Juju. This party was captured and he has paid the Governor-General 1,000 tomans as hush money. Juju’s men have .acknowledged that they received arms and money from the Governor of Buchan. i 11 it?2 Muhammad has surrendered to Haji Husain Aga, son of the Malik-u-Tujjar of Tehran. He promises to keep him quiet near Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. Probably he will rob on his account. Movements of Russian Troops .—The infantry of the 13th T. R. R. left Meshed with half the Maxim guns of the 18th T. R. R. Wheu this movement is executed there will only be left the Semirechia Cossacks in Khorasan with some Maxim guns. This regiment is now most friendly but we saw very little of the infantry which was scattered about all over the town. ‘ f P. M. SYKES, His Majesty’s Consul-General, / G. M. Pwm, Simla.—No. C.-176 F.

The mutineers have released all prisoners but are not hostile to the Governor who exhorts them not to spoil their case by rioting. Russian Musketryv were invited to witness the Russian annual course. What struck us was the general casual manner in which loaded weapons werenoint- ed in every direction. We fired with the rifle which had to be aimed two feet below the mark at two hundred yards,at twenty-five metres the revolver had also to be aimed a foot low. Both weapons are inferior to those in use in our army. A Caravanseri on a Cemetery—Ra]i Muhammad Jafar, a Persian Mujtahid, 23 rd Maj has seized a cemetery and is building a caravanserai on it. To strengthen his position, he has given a share to my colleague’s head servant. Indignation meet ings are being held to protest. 22nd May Typical Persian Embezzlement.Shahzada, Hasan, one of the richest land- owners, left a very large sum in trust for a hospital. The Governor-General is ^ ^ arranging that the deed should be declared illegal and he will then seize the land or a good part of it. Political Summary. State of Province.—As I warned the Legation in my diary entry of 28th April, I the Russian doctor has again declared plague at or near Karez. I am requesting Tehran to arrange if possible for the famous Council Sanitaire to despatch a com petent European specialist but I doubt whether such a man will be found. I am also urging that the Government pf India despatch a specialist to get at the bottom of the whole matter. If there is no plague, he will surely be able to expose the fraud. If there should be plague of a different kind to that prevalent in India his researches would be useful. Beyond all this is the desirability of being in a position to exercise joint control of all measures taken. The present position is not calculated to raise British prestige. The ex-Shah and the Salar-u-Dola. —There are persistent rumours that the Salar is raising a large force and that the ex-Shah is with him. Haji Shaikh Rais who was formerly a shining light of the liberal party has recently telegraphed to the Sipahdar that he congratulates him on his journey which was done by order (of the ex-Shah) and that he is awaiting his orders and will execute them when received. State of roads. —A robbery has occurred on the Kakha road in which one man was killed. When Muhammad was in the Sharine he placed part of his loot with various friends. Now he is collecting these spoils and is being allowed to use force. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty' Consul-General, G. M. Press, Simla, No. C.-185 F.

Town finances .—The budgets for 1913 of Tashkend and of several towns m Ferghana are published. It will be noted that in most cases the expected expenditure exceeds the revenue. Town. Revenue.

Projected construction .—Engineer Dedulov, in charge of the construction of the Semiryechia line, reached Tashkend on the 7th May. Three versts have been laid from Arys to convey construction material, but the date of the actual commencement is still uncertain as financial loss would occur on the realisation of the capital in the present uncertain condition of the Bourse. The inception of the Oxus line is still hanging fire while data are being worked out. I was informed at Tashkend that the Khiva line (Charjui-Alexandrov-Gai) is the most soundly financed concern of the three and is the least likely to be delayed. A recent issue of the Turhistan News places its length at a little under 1,000 miles but no details of the trace seem to have been published. It was stated at Tashkend that the left bank would be followed with the object of avoiding con struction of a bridge, and I could see no signs of commencement of buildings for a terminus on the right bank at Charjui. On the other hand the departure of railway and bridge constructing engineers towards Khiva has just been reported, but the latter may be engaged on bridge projects for the Khan. 243. Feeders. — The Samarkand authorities recommend the adoption of Engineer Kovalevski’s proposal to construct a branch line from Cherniayevo to Ura Tiyube. The Central Asian line is reported to have commenced the construction of the short branch from Bezmen to the Firyusa valley, and its completion by mid- June is expected. 244. Andijan branch. Passing-places.—k correspondent notes the comple tion of a new passing-place between Vladykine and Fedchenko stations, and of a short branch from Dragomirovo station towards the Syr Darya in connection with canal construction. 245. Direct passenger communication. —Direct passenger communication be tween Petersburg and Tashkend came into force on May 1st. 246. Automatic speed checks.' —Passenger engines on the Central Asian line have been supplied with the Haushalter apparatus which automatically registers the speed maintained and the length of stoppages. Engine-drivers are fined 3 kopeks per minute for delay. g247 Wasli-ou's. —On 16th April between Katta Kurgan and Nagornaya stations'on the Central Asian line the permanent-way was washed out for i mUe by flood water after heavy rain. A similar wash-out occurred a few days later at the 276th verst on the northern section of the Tashkent line, the flood water being due to melting snow. Telegraphs. 248 New construction in Bokhara—A correspondent reports that the tele- graph line from Termez to Kulab has been completed as tar as lari Kul. Waterways. 249. Survey of south-eastern Caspian—The steamer Prince Gorchakov is engag- ed on a survey of the channel and shores of the Astrabad Bay. Hoads 250 Passenger automobiles —The large passenger cars ha,ve commenced regu lar nassenger runs at Kokand. The construction of an electric tramway for this tAn apTears to have fallen through for the time. Bridges. Orus hridre —A large number of floats and a quantity of wooden super- l n.Uorl (Variui earlv in May and were despatched up-stream pre- StrU Xho Termez Xe the presence h such material is already reported. It LTbe femembemd that among military works in 1913 and 1914 for which tenders were recentlv invited (reference paragraph 220) £4,700 was assigned for bridge tTiiction at Termez. The sum seemed too small for anything in the nature of anermanent bridge, but it might well suffice for an abutment on the Russian shore and perhaps for the employment of hired labour. . History. 252 Plaque.— -The Bussian authorities have now officially declared North-West Afghanistan, Transcaipia, Samarkand, and Bokhara to be free of plague. Festina lente.\ 253 Bokhara. The Amir, who has been passing some weeks in his capital, is reported to have been apprehensive of his personal safety, and to have requested and obtained the services of 2 sotnyas of Russian Cossacks as a safeguard at Bokha- ra ' • • T • 1 254. Afghan-Russian trade. —An article in the Moscow News animadverts on the loss to Russian commerce involved by Afghanistan remaining a closed country and bv the absence of any Russian trade agents there. It is argued that England I could not reasonably object to Northern Afghan markets being thrown open to Russia as the nearest commercial centre. This subject has been occupying considerable attention in the Russian press of late and in a recent interview the Governor-General of Turkistan expressed himself very strongly to me with regard to the unsatisfactory attitude adopted by Afghan istan vis-a vis to both Russia and England, and its unfortunate effect both on Rus- j sian commerce and prestige. 255. Mutiny of Herat garrison. —The Herat garrison mutinied on the 11th in stant owing to grievances against the commanding General Muhammad Rahim Khan Muhammadzai. The General, with a few armed followers, took refuge in the Citadel where he was still imprisoned by the mutineers on the 15th instant—the date of despatch of the report to the Consulate-General. Brigadier Fateh Muhammad Khan apparently succeeded in keeping the troops in hand, although they refused to hand in their arms or to let the General out of the Citadel till their grievances were redressed by the Amir. They permitted water and provisions to be supplied to the Citadel. Military. y 956 Imriectton .—Towards tbe end of April General Samsonov inspected the Skobelef garrison consisting of the 2nd Rifle Artillery Division (2 field and 1 moun-tain batteries), the 6th Orenburg Cossack Regiment, and portions of the 7th and 8th Turkistan Rifle Regiments. 257. Reservists ,—200 artillery reservists are reported to be training at Kushk. 258. _ Training camps.—Troops of the 1st and 2nd Turkistan Army Corps were moving into summer camps at Troitzkoye and Kashi respectively during the 2nd week in May. The Kuban Cossack and the mountain battery from Kahka and one of the field batteries from Merv have joined the artillery practice camp near Askhabad, and the Horse Mountain Battery from Samarkand, the 3rd Field Bat tery from Termez, and a portion, at any rate*of the 2nd Rifle Artillery Division from Skobelev have proceeded to Tashkend for the same purpose. {Note by Military Attache .—I personally passed a field battery from Skobelev on its way to Tash kend by rail on the 10th instant.) 259. Promotions. —^Lieutenant-General Yeropheev, commanding the 1st Turk istan Army Corps, has been promoted General of Infantry. Major-Generals Posoev, Acting Inspector of Artillery, 1st Turkistan Army Corps, and Folbaum, Military Governor of Semiryechia, are promoted Lieutenant- Generals. General Posoev is an Armenian. He is 58 years of age, graduated at the Artil lery Academy, and served in \he campaigns of 1877-78 and 1904-05. General Folbaum must be one of the youngest generals in the Russian Army. He is 46 years of age and was promoted Major-General in 1907. His promotion seems to have been singularly rapid, as although a guardsman and a graduate of the General Staff Academy, he has no war service. His present appointment does not militate against his employment with troops in the future. 260. Rejected application .—The Duma has rejected without debate an applica. tion for an increase of emoluments of officials of the Semiryechia Cossack voislco^ 261. Reduction of Khorasan garrison ,—The three companies of the 13th Turk istan Rifles, quartered at Meshed, left for Merv on the 17th instant. The fourth company of this battalion and its machine detachment at Kuchanwill join them en route, one officer, 24 men and 2 maxims of the 18th Turkistan Rifles maxim de tachment at Meshed left at the same time for Kuchan. The only Russian troops remaining in Khorasan will be the Semiryechia Cos sack Regiment (2 sotnyas and maxim detachment at Meshed, 1 sotnya at Kuchan, 1 sotnya chiefly at posts on Meshed-Askhabad road) and the maxim detachment of the 18th Turkistan Rifles, half at Meshed and half at Kuchan. 262. Skirmish with Persian rovers—During the 2nd week in May a sotnya of Semiryechia Cossacks and the maxim detachment of the 13th Turkistan Rifles took part in some minor operations against Persian outlaws near Kuchan and Baj giran. They were unsuccessful in capturing Joju Khan, who is said to have crossed the Russian border, and in proceeeding against a robber band in the mountains near Bajgiran killed 8 and captured 3 of the band but allowed the maj or portion to escape. Russian casualties were 2 Cossacks wounded and 3 horses killed. The maxim party did not come into action and from what I heard, both from senior officers at Askhabad and from Cossacks on the road who had taken part in them, the operations were not considered particularly successful. The Cossack horses, which are only shod in front, suffered severely from the rough mountain going. 263 The late Genera^ Shosiak .— An annual pension amounting to about £ 450 has been granted to the widow of the late General Shostak, Governor of Transcaspia. Resources. 964 Irriqation in Bokhara .—The Amir has assigned a sum of £5,370, for investigations connected with irrigation of his territory from the Amu Darya. 265 The movosed Atrelc colony.—It is anticipated that some 55,000 acres can be irrigated from the Atrek and utilised by Russian colonists for cotton cul- tlVatl ° n ' E.

Projected Construction. — The question of the construction of, and funds for, the proposed section Uralsk-Uetsk (246 verts) is before the Imperial Council. The completion of this section is important inasmuch as it will supply lateral communication between the present Ryazan-Uralsk company’s Sazanka-Astra- chan line and the projected Alexandrov Gai-Charjui line with the Tashkend line at Iletsk. 267. Feeders in Ferghana.' —The Ministers of Finance and Ways of Communi cation have recommended to the Council of Ministers the grant of permission to the Kokand-Namangan Railway company to construct a line from Namangan to Jalanabada (162 versts), and one from Andijan to Kokan Kishlak(19 versts). History. 268. Trans-Caspian correspondents state that Salar-ud-Daula is collecting Turkoman adherents. A reliable correspondent from Barfarush states that Salar’s followers have come into collision with the Government troops of Amir Saiyid, in command of Persian forces in Mazanderan, have defeated them and killed upwards of 20 men. The Russians took no steps to interfere. He gives the distribution of Russian troops near Astrabad as under:— Astarabad .. 2 companies, 19th Turkistan Rifles. Meshed-i-Sar .. 1 company „ „ 1 battalion. Barfarush Astrabad Meshed-i-Sar 1 company 200 Taman Cossacks. 100 Taman Cossacks. Barfarush • • 100 Taman Cossacks. 269. Attempted Train-wrecking .'—Native shepherds, discovered by line watch men, piling ballast on the track of the Andijan Branch between Cherniayevo and Shabski, assaulted and severely injured the watchmen. Military. 270 Aviation School .'—Progress is not considered entirely satisfactory, owing to lack of facilities. Only one aeroplane, a Barman bi-plane, is in working order; another machine being useless till a motor is received. There are four pupils who are expected to have qualified for their certificates bv the autumn. On3 hundred metres is the record highest flight and the duration offlkrto does not as a rule exceed 10 minutes. Officers desirous of qualifying as pilots prefer to attend one of the Russian central schools. 271 Communication with Summer Camp.—The 1st Turkistan Sapper Batta lion hasbeen directed to open telegraphic communication from the 14th May be tween Tashkend and Troitskoye camp with the military telegraphic material on their charge (Note by Military AttacM.-Tvro out of the five companies of this batta lion are tvgraph companies.) They will also institute hehographic communica tion from 14th June between Troitskoye and the sanitarium at Chimgan. Cl 871®272. Transport.—Two traction engines and nine trucks have been despatched to Kushk. The narrow-gauge material which has been sent away was mainly used for conveying stone for building from neighbouring quarries and the traction ■ engines are apparently intended to supply its place. Fifty two- wheeled transport carts have been despatched to Upper Oxus posts from Charjui. Resources. 273. Relief to Mangishlah Kirghiz. —Government has assigned a sum of about £46,000 as a loan to poverty-stricken inhabitants of the Mangishlak Peninsula to enable them to replace their live-stock. Several years of scarce f odder and disease had practically annihilated the formerly numerous herds of the Kirghiz. 274. Apiculture in TurUstan. —Latest statistics shew this industry to stand as follows:— Province. Bee- farms. Hives.

Komonovski’s marriage to the daughter of Prince 4th May Data j a was a most interesting function. As the bride has received an English education, a wedding cake and bouquet were added to the Kussian customs, Russian Discipline. —Colonel Khakandokoff recently visited the Cinemato- 5t h May. graph and sent an order to the soldiers present to stand up. He kept them in this position during the whole performance. Departure of Captain TF^sow.—Captain Wilson left for England. Altogether eth May. there was a party of nine, including nurses and children. Russian Celebrations. —The anniversary of the Semirechia Cossacks was observed with much eclat. In the morning there was a Review and Service. In the afternoon, sports. Among these was a poor steeplechase, in which only men rode, and a flat race. In both events the riding was bad. The Cossack events are 44 circus tricks,” but yet not without military value. In the evening, a ball and supper. At the latter healths were drunk and much friendliness shown towards \ this Consulate. The festivities continued until the morning. Return of Jamshidis and Baluchis to Afghanistan. —The Herat Agent reports 7ihMay. that thirty more families of the Jamshidis have returned to Afghanistan : also that Selim Khan Baluch has returned with his 100 families. He will take up his old grazing grounds near Chakansur. Russian Men of Business. —M. Grigorieff tells me that, when at the Legation, 8th May. he wrote to the leading firm of carriage builders at Moscow, calling their attention to the opening for carriages at Tehran. In reply, he received a curt letter to the effect that the firm was making plenty of money at Moscow but that the Legation was free to deal in carriages and would be allowed a discount Movements of Belgian Officials. — M. deWeerdt passed through from Sistan. 9th May. M. Degraeve is being moved from Meshed to Kuchan. The Salar-u-Dola.' —The latest news of the Salar-u-Dola is that he is collecting ioth May. money and revenue in Mazandaran. He was at Sari, but has now returned to Kurd Mahalla. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —The event of the week has been the arrest and deportation to Meshed of the Governor of Kuchan. My colleague recently insisted on this indi vidual, who is a drunken degenerate, being dismissed, the Governor-General promised to do this, but, as he and his staff had received Ts. 22,000 as a present for the new year, he was unwilling to keep his promise. Meanwhile, the Governor had instructed Juju to display activity. As a result, the Bank Manager of Sabza- war, although he was travelling with Cossacks, was attacked near Kuchan. Two Cossacks were wounded and three horses killed. The Cossacks killed Juju’s brother and are in pursuit of the main body. The Russian Agent remonstrated with the Governor, who threatened to do much more. Here it is to be noted that the Agent is an Oriental and engaged in all the local intrigues. My colleague upon hearing this, gave orders for the Governor to be arrested and brought to Meshed, where he was handed over to the Governor- General. Two of his advisers have since been arrested and brought to Meshed by Cossacks. Seiid Hasan. —The robber chief in his confession has deeply incriminated the Adil-u-Dola, Governor of Turbat. He accuses him of being the instigator of his crimes. This fact is also stated in my diary No. 3 of 1913 and M. Leleux has received similar reports. I consulted M. Leleux and my colleague and it was agreed to ask the Governor- General to summon the Adil-u-Dola to Meshed. This he has Y--— 'State of Roads.—On the same day that Captain and Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Sykes left Meshed, Ali Janzi robbed a number of pilgrims close to the first stage. I had arranged for an escort of Cossacks to be provided along the route. This worthy has subsequently stripped a revenue gendarme and is now looting m the Vi ills npa,r Moshed. Movements of Russian Troops —The departure of the Kussian infantry has been postponed for the time beiog owing to the disturbed state of the province. One hundred Russian Cossacks with two guns have reached Darragaz. A Russian General, possibly General Savitski, has reached Karez with an escort of twenty Cossacks, P. M.

Boycotting of Revenue Sowars. The Revenue sowars who were sent to Biriand 27 th April, were boycotted and have returned to Turbat in a worn out condition. Inventing Plague.—The Russian interpreter at Karez, Mehdi Khan by name 28th April, was chiefly responsible last year tor spreading rumours as to an outbreak of plague in Afghanistan which never occurred. He is now busy in the same direction fnd has stated that 40,000 rats have been seen dead near Herat. I have warned my colleague who was most sensible on this subject last year. The Whitewashing of Abdul Hamid. —Reference entry of 26th March. Abdul 29th Apri1, Hamid has returned to Meshed from Tehran. Thanks to M. Lutkine who acted the part of honest broker, he has been whitewashed at the cost of two thousand roubles and two emeralds. As he has made ten times this sum, the “ fees ” were not high. The Salar-u-Dola.—lt is reported that the Amir Azam has gone to Astrabad 30th April to check the Salar-u - Dola who is collecting men with a view to returning to Khorasan. An Afghan Fanatic. —The Karez Agent reports that he has heard that an lst May, Afghan, who was employed in the Arsenal at Merv, killed two soldiers and wounded two more. He then escaped with a rifle to Sarakhs where he killed another soldier and fled to the Turkoman. He was pursued by an officer and six Cossacks : but shot two of them and finally escaped across the frontier. Arrival of the Relief Escort .— The relief escort consisting of 14 non-commis-2nd May. sioned officers and men of the Corps of Guides reached Meshed safely. Among them is the able surveyor who was at Meshed three years ago. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —The event of the week has been the capture of Saiyid Hasan and his gang by the relief escort. The question will be reported separately. Here it suffices to state that initiative and courage were shown by the escort which has impressed Meshed and raised British prestige. State of roads. —Juju has been joined by some Kuchan sowars and intends to create trouble at Darragaz. The Governor-General has dismissed the Governor of Kuchan for a consideration and he is at the bottom of the intrigue. My colleague states that he is thinking of sending 100 Cossacks to Darragaz. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Consul-General. Late News. —The Russian infantry is to be withdrawn from Khorasan. This will leave only the Semirechia Cossack regiment. The machine gun detachment will also remain, I imagine. J 5SECRET. ! O f /H s a Ar. ,i4 ,, ^!5 9 ^ Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 17, for the week ending the 3rd ^ May 1913.

As far as the infantry are concerned, reports of the strength at Askhab .d appear to confirm the correctness of this statement.* At Gunbad-i-Kabus there are apparently 1 sotnya Taman Cossacks, 1 sotnya Turkoman Division, detachment of Frontier Guard, 80 riflemen and machine gun detachment of 19th Turkistan Rifles. _ 22 ?; Meshe d garrison. An informant states that Colonel Khakandokov [ Umcei Commanding Russian garrison, has applied for a sum of over £10,000 fur the improvement of barrack accommodation for the troops. It is uncertain whet] er improvement of existing temporary premises or new construction is contemplated ! but it is unlikely that so much money would be required for the former purpose! ; This statement at present lacks confirmation. Indications point, however, to the occupation of the Sc miryechia Cossacks being of a fairly permanent character! In addition to the selling off of surplus regimental stores at Katta Kurghan, the office records and even the officers’ billiard table are on their way to Meshed. In the event of a protracted stay of the regiment in Khorasan considerale imnrovement m the present makeshift quarters is obviously desirable. ^ Colonel Khakandokov, who is transferred from the command of the Chita to that of the Semiryechia Cossack Regiment, is a graduate of the General Sta f Academy, and was made a Chevalier of St. George for services in the Russo-Japa nese war. He is 38 years of age and has been a full Colonel for some two years. Resources. 226. Irrigation .-— With reference to paragraph 208, a later issue of the TurJcis- tan News states that the Mam Canal in the k amine Steppe is designed to irncjate 330,000 acres. ° ' An interdepartmental commission has been considering the request of several capitalists, for permission to undertake irrigation projects in the Famine Steppe and in Transcaspia, and has decided that permission should not be granted for the present. Among the applicants is M. Altbrandt, one of the initiators of the Kerki-Merv canal project. 227. Oil on Cheleken. —The total output of oil on Cheleken for 1912 is given at 250,441 tons. 180,321 tons of this amount is furnished by the Nobel and Cheleken Oil Companies in almost equal proportions, and the firm of Isa Bek Gadjinski is responsible for most of the remainder. The total output represents an advance of 30% on 1911. 228. Locust destruction .— -The Governor-General of Turkistan has sanctioned the expenditure of £2,000 from local funds on the destruction of locusts in Samar kand province this season. Operations will be carried out with the Vermorel Shweinfurth green spray, the Shkilin burning apparatus, and moveable metal screens for confining the locusts in the area of destruction. 229. Colonisation .— '11,807 allotments of land have been made to immigrants in Semiryechia this year. The Kirghiz in this province are reported to be losing live-stock from dearth of fodder and pasturage, and settlers, in addition to a want of pasturage, to be in need of seed grain and agricultural machinery. * No mention is made of artillery.Peasants’ Banks.—The institution of peasants’ banks and loan and sav- mg bank societies is making great progress in Syr Darya. It m estimated that such societies will number 18,000 members m the current year. 231. Financial stress in Fer S W^Money is reported f.^^Xwcon- tivators in Ferghana at the present season, and banks are compelled to allow con siderable delay to creditors. It is expected that the usual grant of heavy ad vances by large firms made in the spring will relieve the tension. E. A. F. REDL, Major, Military Attache G. M. Pre##, C. 136 F. D.*—39*5*13. 25.

Ihtisham-i-Humayun, the out-going Karguzar for Sistan, paid me a farewell visit. He says he is not leaving Sistan for 5 or 6 weeks as he has not finished collecting the revenue for the year “ Reel ” (1910;, the farm of which the Mahk-ut-Tujjar of Tehran had taken on contract. I have telegraphed to H. B. M.’s Minister my opinion that this worthy’s departure should be expedited, as he has a wonderful capacity for intrigue, and is becoming very intimate with the Acting Rais Qushun. He did his best to land his successor in difficulties at the outset by persuading him to write to both the Deputy Governor and myself, inviting us to pay the first calls on him! Karguzar of Sistan .—As anticipated in my Diary No. 14 for the week ending the 7th April 1913, some friction is now apparent between Ihtisham-i-Humayuu and the Deputy Governor. The ez-Karguzar in order to get out of his undertaking to marry his daughter to Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, has demanded that the latter should reciprocally betroth his daughter, aged 1^ years to Ihtisham-i-Humayun’s son, aged 17 years! The Deputy Governor says that the proposal is an unprecedented one ; both parties are at present awaiting the result of a reference to Hissam-ud-Dowleh the technical (?) Governor of Sistan. Sarhad news. —Telegrams, which require confirmation, have just been received that two bands of Sarhadi Baluchis are starting on raiding expeditions to the Kainat under the leadership of Sher Muhammad Khan, Jamshir Khan, son of Nasir Khan, and Shahsowai Khan, nephew of Mir Jahind. 4 j COPY TO FOREIGN OFF ICE i i 16 JUN1913 *Enclosure t+ er from F n 'rrztary, Indin L. 21 «. daf 'e./ 22 MAY 1913 CONFIDENTIAL. i Q Meshed Diary, No. 16, for the week ending the ^th~ April (recetyid the 17th May) 1913. tt T J\ e r The Herat Agent reports that there has been no rain in the 4 th A P riI - X alley { or ^y-Hvo days. At Meshed and in Khorasan generally the rain fall has been abundant. . The Governor-General.—The Governor-General and various heads came to the 15th April, usual luncheon party. At it he received the news of his re-appointment. This made him very happy. The Russian Bank.—-The Russian Bank has purchased new premises in the 16 th April. Ark quarter or close to it. I hear that a Bourse will be opened in it to attract merchants. Some of the houses have been taken by force from the owners at a valuation. They appealed to me but I was unable to help in any way. The Income Tax.—The Herati merchants have approached me through the 17 th April. Afghan Tajarbashi on the subject of the new income tax. I requested Abdulla Khan to furnish me with a list of the merchants who reside at Herat and only come to Meshed for business. He gave me twenty names and these I sent to Herat to verify. The Agent confirms the list in the case of sixteen men and I have asked the Legation for support in the matter as it is not a question to settle locally. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —It is rumoured that the Salar-u-Dola is thinking of return ing to Khorasan. I trust that the Legations will not permit this. The^ Governor-General is the Neiir-u-Dola, a Prince of the old school who is capable in the old way. At first he was slow in settling my cases but he is now quite satisfactory in every way and I was very glad to hear of his reappointment. State of Roads. —Muhammad, the Brigand, has changed his mind and has returned to the road. The Chief of Bujnurd is out with his new gun to prevent the Turkoman from raiding. The Postal sowars report that they have seen thieves again on the road. I have warned the Governor-General. The Departure of Colonel Drozdovski. —-To our regret Colonel Drozdovski, who commanded the garrison, is being replaced by Colonel Khakandokov. He has always shown himself most friendly to this Consulate and to the English colony in general.S33SS5SE! 'iso) 0 SECRET.

The figures are mainly founded on statistics for 1910-11, those for later years being incomplete. Imports from Russian territory are mainly cotton goods and sugar. Cotton goods amount to 1,607 tons and constitute about J of total imports of such goods to Persia. Sugar amounts to 723 tons and constitutes about ^ of total imports to Persia, Exports to Russian territory from Khorasan annually, are:—- Wool, 1,750 tons. Raw cotton, 5,512 tons.

The band also collected 3,000 tomans mostly from pilgrims. 100 mans (Sistani) of burnt opium (Sukhta), 120 loaded caravan camels belonging to Tabas, and 50 loose camels from the desert.

Deportation of Jews. —A deputation of Bokharan Jews has proceeded to Petersburg to protest against their total expulsion from Turkistan. In 1910 their residence was limited to six towns in Turkistan, but in the course of last year the Governor-General, General Samsonov, reported to the Minister of War that their presence exercised a harmful effect on the population, and demanded their total exclusion from Turkistan. The petition of the Jews has been supported by both the Kokand and Moscow Bourse Committees, and the Amir of Bokhara is stated by the Press to have promised them his assistance. 145.

The sum due is about 12,000 tomans, to be paid in four annual instalments. On 2 nd March, 6,000 tomans became due, on account of last and this year’s instalments. As His Highness continually put me off I told him that by way of protest, I should not call on him on “ No Ruz ’ ’, and should report the matter to Tehran, unless I received 3,000 tomans. After much skirmishing, I have received a bill for 3,000 tomans, and have agreed not to give it to the Bank, until 20 th April, in case the Governor-General is dismissed. I, therefore, fervently hope that he will be kept in office. He has also paid up 200 tomans, which the Legation instructed me to demand, as a fine for the postal sowars being fired upon. State of the roads. —Muhammad, who was supposed to be besieged in the Turbat district, met the Telegraph gholam near Shurab. He has 37 men, and is now living near Sabzawar. A revenue gendarme, who had been robbed of his rifle by Seiid Hasan, found The New Year Calls. The usual calls were paid on the Governor-General and 22nd March. POLITICAL SUMMARY.

CONFIDENTIAL Meshed Diary, No. 13, for the week ending 29th March (received the 30th April) 1913. One Advantage of the Bombardment. —In a recent case which was tried at Herat, it was shown that Abdulla Khan, the Afghan Tajarbashi at Meshed, had given a document to the effect that the defendant had been killed by the Russians in the Shrine, whereas he is known to be trading at Samarcand. This is typically an Afghan trick. M. Leleux and the Shrine. —M. Leleux, who has been instructed to take one-tenth of the revenues of the Shrine, is threatening the Mutawalibashi with imprisonment if he defers payment. The Shrine officials have sent the following telegram to Teh ran :—“ We take refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed ! 0, Believers ! Do not be friends with Jews and Christians but with Believers. It is now more than a century that the English ’have taken India and during that period they have not interfered with Moslem Shrines or Mosques. Yet you have handed over the Shrine, the Glory of the Shias, to a Christian. Is there no honest Moslem who could be placed in charge ? ” The New Drill at Herat. —An officer has been sent from Kabul to teach the Herat officers the new drill. To prevent slackness, it is ordered that each case of non-attendance will be fined from 7 rupees in the case of a Commandant to 1 rupee in the case of a Captain. Russian Intrigues. —Abdul Hamid, the Attache of the Russian Consulate, has been summoned to Tehran owing to the complaints made against him. I have more than once reported his evil deeds. Unfortunately he was appointed by M. Grigorieff, who will probably suffer by being connected with such a super scoundrel. A Stern Chase from RoMam.—Some days ago, I received a telegram from some British subjects at Bokhara to the effect that two of their number had run away owing some thousands of roubles. The two men were found in the bast of the Shrine, and two days later the plaintiffs arrived. The Mutawalibashi sent the men to be examine4, when they denied all knowledge of the plaintiffs. As they were evidently telling lies, I sent them back to the Shrine with a letter to the Mutawali bashi to the effect that I should hold him responsible for the money claimed and, as I expected, he promptly handed them over to me. Seeing that the game was up, the men.at once acknowledged everything and are now amicably returning to Bokhara to resume business. American Carpet Buyers. —'Messrs. Keillor, an Englishman, Bathgate, an American, and Ertelt, an Austrian, called. They had been all over Northern Persia and wished to return by Merv and Samarcand. The Murder of Morad.—M. Grigorieff has informed me that the guilt of Amir Khan has been established and that he will be sent to Askabad for sentence. State of the Province.— The Attach on Mr. Although the attack on Mr. Meriton took place outside my district, I have been trying to ascertain who attacked him. I have been fortunate enough to obtain the names of seven men, all of them Russian subjects. My colleague is much exercised about Russian com plicity in these raids, and yesterday informed me that there was undoubtedly something in the situation which required clearing up. I have written a special despatch on the subject. 25th March, 26th March. 27th Mai ch. 28th March. 29th March. : J V, JI£ . POLITICAL SUMMARY.Tie Sahr-u-Dola .—The Chief of Police informed me that he holds documentary proof that the Salar wished to visit Meshed as it had been arranged that on his arrival there should be a rising. He hoped by these means to secure the governor ship of Khorasan. There is little doubt that my colleague was m this_ plot, as he mentioned to me that he wished the Salar to come to Meshed and that he might be our new Governor, P. M.

Thirty-eight Gendarmes have reached Birjand from Meshed for duty under ft- e ^ enue Departm^it. Their Commander accidentally shot himself in the toot and remained at Turbat-i-Haideri. Monsieur de Weerdt, of the Customs and Finance Department, has left Biriand for Tun, en route to Meshed and Teheran. General. . Sarhad News.—(a) It is reported from Lutak that Mir Jehind Khan Damani with 20 Baluchis has proceeded to Magas to arrange a peace between Shah Jehan and Bahram Khan, the latter having driven out Shah Jehan from his village about two years ago, since when he has been living in Kerman until he recently came to Mir Jehind Khan for mediation. (b) From Koh Malik Siah it is reported that Sardar Jehil Khan Ismailzai has come with 10 followers to Manzalah, about 30 miles from Koh Malik Siah, to collect his Sardari tax of sheep, etc., from his tribesmen. He will probably return to his home in a few days’ time. (c) The following of Taj Muhammad, son of Sardar Muhammad Khan Reqi, who had been summoned to Bampur as reported in Diary No. 13, did not proceed very far, as Jehil Khan objected to their passing through his.country. It is said that a number of Shahuzais, intent on punishing the village of Jardip for killing four of their tribesmen last winter, were with the party, under the leadership of Ata Muhammad, but they also have returned home. Governor of Birjand. —It is rumoured in Sistan that the suddenly formed friendship between Shaukat-ul-Mulk and his nephew Hashmat-ul-Mulk is ap parently fading. This statement receives indirect confirmation in a report, received from Mr. Howson, that whereas Monsieur de Weerdt on arrival in Birjand was very friendly with Shaukat, he has latterly been seeing more of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and has been rather reserved in his attitude both towards the Shaukat and His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul. It is known that Hashmat has been appealing to Monsieur Leleux to get him made Governor of Kainat. mi I U 1 $. rv, India- « Bnclosvrr - 24 ] no- x ' ' — ---^ — r CONFIDENTIAL.

He had just returned from visiting Haji Nasir-es-Sal- ane , is superior officer, at Khwaja Ahmad and Mian Kangi, where they had been selecting the site for a small military frontier post. General. Karguzar of Sistan. 'Ehtisham-i-Humayun received notice by telegraph on e 2 nd April, that he would be relieved by Mirza Ishaq Khan, who had a ready started, and that orders about his next appointment would be com municated later. An unfortunate domestic complication has arisen, in that the daughter of the Karguzar has just been betrothed to Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, the Deputy Governor, after being refused to the son of Sardar Purdil Khan. The Deputy- Governor has spent a considerable sum of money in the negotiations, as, being of low birth on his mother’s side, he was most anxious to ally himself with a daughter of a lady, who had been a widow of the late sovereign Nasir-ud-Din Shah before she married the Karguzar, the ez-Royal Head Gardener. The engagement has not been publicly announced, and it is doubtful now, whether the marriage will be consummated. The Deputy-Governor was just about to return his present wife to her father Sardar Purdil Khan’s home, and, as the last-named notable is Sartip Muhammad Reza’s most powerful supporter, it will perhaps be as well that the contemplated marriage should fall through.' Customs and Finance Department .—Monsieur Paquet has received informa tion from the Treasurer-General that it is proposed to establish primary schools throughout Persia, the cost of which will be defrayed from general revenues. There is one such school in Sistan, at present maintained by the Deputy-Governor assisted by a collection from other officials at the time of the annual examinations. It is said that a Majlis will be held in a few days’ time to discuss the subject. SarJiad News .—The raiding band of Ismailzais, mentioned last week, is now on its return journey southwards. It is said to have looted a Kainat caravan of 80 or 100 camels near Sarchah Ambari, and has last been heard of near Haiderabad, due west of Nasratabad. Sardar Purdil Khan, on behalf of Nazar Jan, has sent two envoys to Jehil Khan to attempt a settlement of the Ismailzai-Brahui blood feud. The people of Sistan seem to think that the matter can be satisfactorily arranged.——'' r_ ■ «+-&gt;ry, India. 5 Enclosur' ' ' ‘‘er F A/:. 16 % d I?

The Sirdar Munazzam.- —The Sirdar Munazzam, who was formerly Commander- 9 ^ Marc k in-Chief and later Governor of Kuchan, came to say good-bye, before leaving for Tehran. He is anxious for a post in Southern Persia, and can be highly recommend ed as a capable man. The Sm Chah or “ Black Well ” of Herat. —By order of the Amir, the “ Black 10 th March. Well ” is being filled up. The prisoners in it are to be kept in chains, and their cases referred to Herat. Removal of Tribes from the Frontier. —Orders have been received that from 11 th March- Bala Murghab to Kuhsan, all tribes are to be moved to a distance of 24 miles from the frontier. This order, if carried out, will leave a wide strip of unoccupied country along the frontier. The Case of Mustafa Khan. -The son of the Governor of Bakharz went to 12 th March Sarakhs to meet his father, who was returning from Mecca. On the frontier he was seized, and made to walk for three farsaks by the Russian officials. Finally, he was released upon his identity being established, but his money, etc., was not res tored. The Salar-u-Dola. —The Pretender robbed the Sultan, and men of the Karai 13th March, regiment, who were at Sabzawar, not only of their rifles, but also of their private effects. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province. —The Governor of Darragaz recently called. I have known him for many years, and he was a great friend of Major Watson. He tells me that he gets on very well with the Russians, but that, in his opinion, they are aiming at upsetting the frontier. At the same time individual officials work to keep the peace. He instanced the case of Juju, the noted bandit, who was allowed to use Transcaspia as a base for raids. State of the Roads. —Muhammad Nishapuri was recently besieged by 300 sowars in a village near Nishapur. However, he beat off the enemy with a loss of eight men and the rest fled. Such is Persia. Seiid Hasan was attacked by a force of sowars in the Turbat district, but he beat them off Timur Khan, the famous robber on the Yezd-Tabas road has apparently been captured by Bakhtiari sowars. There has been much talk about covering the tomb with black on the anniver sary of the bombardment, but I am using my influence to prevent any open demon stration. Many people have sworn to keep the day as a day of mourning. This may be done, although it clashes with “ Nao-roz ” celebrations. The crops are excellent, and trade is prosperous, so far as I can ascertain. P. M.

J A Mountain Gun for Bu^nuri.—lho Sirdar of Bujnurd has been given a 4 th March mountain gun with 1,500 charges: also 400 rifles. I have been working for this through M. Leleux, and the Persian authorities. The Turkoman are much afraid of artillery. Repor^d Departure of Sivedish Officers for Meshed.-l have heard from 5 th March Shahrud that three Swedish officers with fifty men have reached Shahrud bound for Meshed. Neither my colleague nor M. Leleux have heard anything about this • £0 the report may not be correct. Tercentenary of the Romonov Dynasty.^-The celebrations commenced with a 6 th March service and parade. At the latter, after the Tsar and Imperial family had been honoured, Colonel Drozdovski called for three cheers for the King-Emperor, and the band played the National Anthem. In this connection, Colonel Drozdovski / is most friendly to this Consulate, and a firm believer in the Entente. In the after- 5 noon there was a reception, and in the evening a dinner. On the 7 th March there was a ball at the Officers' Club. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province.—The Salar-u-Dola has left Khorasan, and is due at Shahrud in a day or two. He recently sent a messenger to my colleague, who, in reply, sent him the copy of a telegram, received from the Russian Legation, and also two thousand cartridges. The Pretender was met by one Russian officer, and 10 Turkoman at Miandasht. State of Roads.—Muhammad, the Nishapur brigand, joined the Pretender, and burned two or three villages in the Sabzawar district. The Pretender then asked that he should be placed in charge of the road, but the Ain-u-Dola refused. A body of sowars is pursuing Muhammad. Seiid Hasan, the Tubat brigand, recently stripped nine of the Revenue Gendarmes.

Plague measures.—Tho road from Persia at Sarakhs was declared open on the 21st February, but a few days later again closed to traffic. Two or three sotnyas of Cossacks who have lately been stationed at Saxakhs, apparently in con nection with the closing of the frontier, have left that place. Since the Merv outbreak sanitary house to house inspections have been frequent in all towns occupied by Russian troops. Two subordinate medical offi cials and three policemen were recently carrying out such measures at Kerki among the dwellings of the local Turkomans when the Turkomans assembled and killed all five. 132. Turkoman deputation. —A deputation of Turkomans is proceeding to Petersburg to protest against the order for their evacuation of certain land near Merv city to admit of building extension. 133. Deportation of Jews.- —The “nationalisation of cotton campaign^ is apparently making headway as the Russians have ordered all Jews domiciled in Kerki to leave the place.

According to a recent report, about one-third of the narrow-gauge material present at Kushk last summer has now been sent away. About 50 men of the Kushk Railway Company are stated to have ac companied this material. History. 117. Arrival of Trans-Caspian Governor. —Lieutenant-General Lesh reached Askhabadon the 21 st February, and assumed office as Governor of Trans-Caspia and Officer Commanding the 2 nd Turkistan Army Corps. He apparently inspect ed the troops at Kushk and Merv on his way from Tashkent. 118. Earthquake Shock. —Two sharp shocks were experienced at Djarkent on the 23rd February, and considerable alarm was caused. 119. Proposed Russo-Perpian Postal Convention. —The Turkistan News states that the Tehran Agent for the Minister of Commerce and Industry is trying to conclude a convention with the Persian Government for the exchange of heavy postal parcels between Persia and Russia (colis de messagerie). It is hoped by this means to decrease the growing postal parcel traffic (colis postaux) by means of which so many commodities from Western Europe reach the Persian market with out paying transit duty to Russia. In view of the unsafe condition of roads in the interior of Persia, it is only proposed at present to serve towns in the northern provinces. Rates will probably vary between 1 ruble 10 kopeks and 1 -| rubles per 36 lbs., and between 2 rubles 20 kopeks and 3 rubles per 110 lbs., according to distance. [Note. The Russians have been trying for some time to find a loop-hole for repudiating the International Postal Parcel Convention as regards Persia, and the matter is to be brought up at the Madrid Conference in 1914. In the meantime, their commerce with Persia suffers considerably, as, owing to the exhorbitant transit duty charged by the Russian Customs, both residents and traders in Persia prefer to face the comparatively heavy postal rates for “ coZ«s postauxT As an instance, a small case of wines, value £1-19, unfortunately consigned to me from London per Batum, is detained at that port pending payment of transit custom duty amounting to £5-1 —E.A.F.Redl.) 120 . Plague. An order by tjie Governor of Trans-Caspia, dated the 18th Feb ruary, declares that Northern Khorasan is now free of plague and directs that the Russo-Persian frontier be considered open. In this instance, the Russian mills have been grinding more slowly than usual as the last ^authenticated” case occurred near the Jam river at the end of last Oc tober and Northern Khorasan has been free of plagueJhroughout. 121.

In 1911, 28,300 tons of cotton oil were exported from Russian Central Asia, 89% of the quantity being supplied by Ferghana. The total exceeded the export for 1910 by over 3,000 tons. 129.

On the follow ing day, messages were sent to every village m Sistan to send a quota of men to protest against the tyranny initiated, and in the evening the Deputy Governor wrote to Monsieur Paquet, asking him to call upon him the following morning for a discussion of the situation. On the 29th March, Monsieur Paquetlwent to the Government House, where fie found the Karguzar, the Mullahs, and all the mercantile notables assembled. Ifiey informed him that the position was critical, and persuaded him to sign a paper, promising that local agriculturalists should not be taxed for their animals, but only professional carriers working on the trade route. Whilst the meeting was still sitting, two Customs Sowars were badly assaulted by a crowd of several hundred men collected outside. Monsieur Paquet was able safely to return to his residence, escorted by ten armed gendarmes, but at one o’clock the contingents from villages outside had collected in force, and they proceeded to besiege his front gate, and to break every window of the Custom House. I received two notes from him, in the first of which he begged me 'in view of the excitement of themum T^nr&gt;V to use ITY influence to appease them and to prevent accidents, and in the second (received after a short interval) “ as he feared his life was in danger to intervene with force to protect him.” I walked round to the Custom House, as soon as Pol Me, accompanied by Captain Heron and three armed Gholams and was followed a few minutes later by my Indian Sowars (including a few of the men who are on their way to Meshed). The crowd was perfectly inencfy to us, but thev declared their intention to compel Monsieur Paquet to promise not to impose any new taxes, or to enhance old ones. After some parley they allowed ™ to go inside to ascertain what reply Monsieur Paquet would give. Half an hour later the Deputy Governor, the Karguzar, and two Mullahs arrived and also entered the Belgian’s house. Their guard of 60 or 70 soldiers had no difficulty in dispersing the crowd ; they also arrested 5 or 6 men, whose release, however, the Mullahs did not hesitate to demand, promising to guarantee their future good behaviour The Governor expressed surprise that Monsieur Paquet had not ap pealed to him for protection, and said that as he was still ill, he had been sleeping and had only been awakened to learn of my appearance at the Custom House. Evidently the wire-pullers of the outbreak had not intended to push matters to extremes on this day, and they anticipated that they would intimidate the Belgian into conceding their demands. My intervention embarra^d them so much that, for the time being, they decided to take no further active measures, and, consequently, the much larger gathering of rioters which approached to within 5 miles of the city on the following day, was sent back home, under the peremptory commands of the six leading Mullahs, Monsieur Paquet and his brother behaved very sensibly throughout the affair, in my opinion. They never lost their heads, and very wisely restrained their gendarmes from using their rifles under the considerable provocation of a shower of brickbats. The situation now is an impasse^ unless the Teheran or Mefts^d authorities will be satisfied with the collection of full revenue and arrears, for a year at least, at the existing rates. The problem of getting the State dues out of the Kadkhudas and Sardars is a different one, and considerably more difficult, as the latter will now see that the vaunted body of revenue gendarmes is not of much use, the Belgians not daring to go to extremes in the use of them. In my opinion it was the height of follv to endeavour to introduce the new Transport tax, the proceeds of which are to be “ solely expended in cleaning and improving the streets of Hussainabad and Nasratabad,” while so much difficulty is still experienced in the collection of the old rates of land-revenue. AwyiugI Inspection of Pctso-A fcjhcin PoundciTy PHIclts. Captain Heron, and Messrs. Huxley and Dormer duly completed their tours along the frontier, and returned to head-quarters. Nothing of note occurred to report.

He called on Mr. Howson, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, on the 26th instant, and received the return visit on the following day.

Customs and Finance Department. —The shopkeepers, artisans and peddlers, who, as reported in last week’s Diary, claimed to have taken “ bast ” in this Consulate,' departed of their own free will on the 19th instant, thanks largely to the mediation of Seth Suleiman, our foremost British-Indian trader. A two days’ spell of bitterly cold weather, and the fact that I would not place any room at the refugees’ disposal also conduced to bring about the desired result. The men had some grounds for dissatisfaction with the Finance Department, as it transpired that Monsieur Paquet had never issued any public notification, ex plaining the Profession tax, though, in similar circumstances preivously, it has been customary to post notifications in various public places. Monsieur Paquet argued that he was only reviving a rate of taxation, which was introduced many years ago, though it has never been enforced, but he promised to do what the people desired, and to convince,them that he had authority from Tehran for the imposition. He also let it be known, through Seth Suleiman indirectly, that he would not press the Deputy Governor for the punishment of the instigators of the strike. On this understanding the traders expressed their willingness tc re-open their shops, and to pay whatever sums were legally due from them under the altered terms of the tax. Scarcity in Sistan.- —Owing to the poorness of last year’s harvests, and the un rest, which permeates the agricultural community, in consequence of the assump tion of the Revenue Administration by the Belgians, the cost of living has risen very appreciably of late.

In four recent cases, however goods to the total value of £2,500 have been abstracted in transit by the substi tution of falsified documents for the original ones. 100. Sedition among raihvay employes . —With the object of weaning their employes from the reading of seditious literature, the authorities of the Central Asian Railway contemplate the institution of reading-rooms, at various stations supplied with works of a patriotic character. 101. Narrow-gauge material .—engines for a narrow-gauge railway, and six waggons of rails for the same have passed eastwards along the Central Asian Railway from Kushk. The station of Juma is again reported to be the destination. Waterways. 102.

Apparently, however, the Company has found means to burke inconvenient demands, as a departmental commission has reported in favour of the renewal of the subsidy and has attached no stringent conditions to its recommendation. 103. Amu Darya navigation .—Navigation on the upper Amu Darya between Charjui and Termez opens officially on the Uth March. One regular steamer weekly (on Tuesdays) will be despatched, notice of the departure of other steamers being given as necessary beforehand. Navigation between Charjuj and Retro-Alexandrovsk opens officially on the 13th March. Telegraphs. 104.

Askhabad-Meshed chausee .—A sum of £135 has been sanctioned for the repair of the Russian section of this road—Askhabad to Gaudan. Very econo mical engineering will be required to efiect any appreciable improvement with this sum.History. 106. Salar-ud-Daula. —Salar has left Sabzwar, apparently for Bandar Gaz, but nothing is as yet certain. He recently took possession of the arms of the police and soldiers at Sabzwar, and indulged in some looting of granaries and caravans. The owners of the latter had the option of buying back their goods at ten tumans per load. The force of 500 savars recently summoned to Meshed is still here and their numbers have been increased during the last week by 170 Turshizi and Barbari savars. 107. Russian plague experts. —The Bussian bacteriologist and doctor, deputed to enquire into the plague in the Jam Rud district, have returned to Askhabad through Meshed. A marmot caught early this month in the vicinity of the Merv Turkoman en campments is reported by Russian local experts to have died of plague. There is thus apparently no primd facie reason to suppose that the Meiv outbreak was caused by infection from Persia. Military. 108. Cossack draft. —A draft of 200 Cossacks has been despatched to Kerki for the 4 th Orenburg Cossack Regiment. These men would appear to have join ed without horses. The regiment was, according to one informant, nearly 300 men below strength before this draft was despatched. 109. Russian troops in Bokharan territory. —From reports received it appears likely that Sarai will become the permanent station of a battalion of Rifles, prob ably' detached from the Termez garrison. Resources. 110 . Russian trade with Bokhara and Afghanistan. —The unsatisfactory posi tion of Russian commerce with these countries has for some time past occu pied attention. The Central Organization of Trade and Industry recently approached the President of the Council of Ministers with a report on measures considered essential for its improvement. Among these is the right of Russian subjects to reside, to acquire landed property, and to enjoy unrestricted faci lities for trade in both Afghanistan and Bokhara. With respect to the latter country it is pointed out that large tracts of irrigable land, of which the natives cannot or will not avail themselves, are, by the existing agreements with Bokhara, impossible of acquisition by Russian subjects. As far as Afghanistan is concerned, the Transcaspian Review opines that “ as Afghanistan is within the sphere of British influence there may be some difficulty in acquiring landed property there.” At a final meeting to discuss the improvement of trade with these countries, at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, it was resolved :— (a) to improve postal and telegraphic communications in Bokhara; ( 5 ) to form a commission to ventilate the question of the imposition of customs dues on goods imported from Afghanistan, and to bring the tariff of 1894 into line with the general Russian Customs Tariff of 1903 ; (c) to determine customs posts on the Afghan frontier in accordance with the requirements of Russian trade. 111 . Fisheries.—ThQ Department of Agriculture proposes to institute measures during the current year to preserve all rivers and lakes well provided with fish in Russian Central Asia. 112 . Manufacture of agricultural machinery.—The Turkistan branch of the Department of Agriculture has determine,d to open a local factory for the manu facture of agricultural machinery, and an engineer has been appointed to super vise it.3 eandtleir Barbatj 'toman ea- uo.

Irrigation capacity of Amu Darya. —In a lecture before the Petersburg Geographical bociety an engineer stated that the average current of the 4mu Darya at present irrigates 405,000 acres. This extent could be increased by proper supervision without the formation of a reservoir to 1 755 000 acres With a reservoir 5 400 000 acres could be irrigated. The lecturer pointed out that the basm of the Waksh River forms an excellent potential reservoir. E. A. F.

Panic at There is a panic at. Turbat, as it is feared that the Pretender 20 th February, may go there. This shows how disturbing his presence at Sabzawar really is. Prices at Meshed have risen, and both meat and eggs, which used to be very cheap j are now as dear as in England. The Governor of Sabzawar. —Tim Salar Humayun, Governor of Sabzawar, 21 at February, called. He is not ashamed in the slightest degree for having run away, and detailed to me how fast he travelled with some pride. Review of Persian Troops. —Acting upon my suggestion, there was a review 22 nd February, of the Persian garrison. Five hundred sowars, some soldiers, who do not count in Persia, and four modern guns marched out for a mile or two, and it is to be hoped that Meshed is impressed. and has informed the Russian Consul at Astrabad, who is sending him messages, to this effect. M. Leleux is also arranging to pay him 4,000 tomans for expenses. On the other hand, there is the possibility that the Persian Government may have realised that the Salar at Resht will be a constant source of danger : at any rate there is no final settlement to report. Meanwhile, the emissaries of the Pretender are stirring up his supporters at Meshed, and 7,000 tomans have been sent to him with a warm invitation from the Shrine officials. To show how ready Persians are to change their views, Haji Shaikh Rais, the well known liberal is now in favour of the Salar-u-Dola. The Salar has asked both my colleague, and the Ain-u-Dola to arrange for him to make a pilgrimage to Meshed. The latter refused, but my colleague tried to induce the Governor-General to agree. The latest complaint made by the Salar is that the tobacco at Sabzawar is bad, and that he wants some Shiraz tobacco to be sent him by the Governor-General. A force has been sent to Nishapur mainly with a view to protect the property of the Governor-General. Muham mad, the bandit, has been making money by not allowing the rich people of Nishapur to run away without first paying him something. However, he left Nishapur upon the arrival of the Meshed force. It appears that a Russian officer was with the Salar, as far as Hardin. Con sequently, the Russian Consul was aware of his movements and the report that he had returned to Khoja Nafas requires elucidation. My colleague is trying to secure the dismissal of the Governor of Nardin, apparently, because he did not run away, but stuck to his post. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Consul-General.

Passports for Persians.—The existing regulation with regard to Persians domiclied in Russian territory rules that after 6 Inonths , residence they must hand in their Persian passport bearing the visa of a Russian Consular official at the town of issue, and receive a Russian passport in lieu. As, however, Russian Consuls in Persia are few and far between, the obligation for the Consulate visa has proved so vexatious that the matter was some time since submitted for the consideration of the Senate. There appears to be no reasonable prospect of this body pronounc ing their decision on this question, and the Governor-General has provisionally ruled that the Consulate visa shall not be considered indispensable. Communications. v / Railways. 87. Grain Stores.- —The opening of storage accommodation for grain is pro posed at several stations on the Central Asian Railway. 88 . Snowdrifts. —Heavy snow fell on the 5th instant between Merv and Charjui, and trains on this section were delayed by snov drifts. 89. Narrow-Gauge Material.- —Several waggon-loads of narrow gauge rails and steel sleepers have been despatched from Kushk to the Central Asian line, their destination being reputed to be Juma, the station immediately west of Samar kand, (Reference paragraph 55). History. 90. Deportation of Jews. —According to the Trans-Caspian Review, several families of Jews have been expelled fromKaghan (New Bokhara), and the deporta tion of others is expected. The action is attributed to the influence of the Russian.Diplomatic Agent on the Amir, and is ascribed to the desire for the so- called “ nationalisation of cotton ”, i.e., the limitation of the exploitation of cotton to Russian hands. The Jews are engaged, and probably successfully, in cotton operations. Therefore they must go. 91. Fuel Shortage in Trans-Caspia. —As usual when any severe winter weather is experienced at Askhabad, considerable distress is caused among the poorer elements of the population by the high price of wood fuel. A Government store exists for the purpose of retailing fuel at a reasonable price to the poorer classes, but its operations are so hedged about with red tape, often involving waiting one’s turn for several days, that it is not so useful as it might be. With increas ing shortage of wood fuel in these regions, the failure to develop the local coal resources argues a certain lack of initiative. 92. Hospital Accommodation at Askhabad. —According to the local Press, the, town hospital at Askhabad is full to overflowing, and convalescents are accom modated in the sheds prepared for possible plague patients. 93. Salar-ud-Daula. —Intrigues with reference to the pretender are in full swing, and his agents busily visit Meshed. The situation appears to have reached a somewhat unfortunate phase. Acting on the assumption that Salar had accept ed the Government’s terms, the Treasurer-General has telegraphed orders for the savars assembled to oppose him to be paid off.

S^haddar and Rais-i-Qushun. Haji Nasir-es-Saltaneh readied Koh Malik-Sian on the 11 th instant. The Deputy Governor has received a telegraphic order from the Ministry for the Interior to the effect that the Sarhaddar should not come to Meshed till further orders. A similar telegram was addressed to the Sarhaddar himself. Customs and Finance Department.— Director has been active during the past fortnight in collecting the profession tax from Persian merchants and shop keepers. ^ In former years, a uniform tax of 6 krans per shop has been levied at Nauroz, but the assessments now imposed vary from 12 krans to 960 krans. On the recommendation of the Deputy Governor, Monsieur Paquet decided for the current year only to demand half rates, and all the substantial traders are believed to have paid what was demanded of them. On the 13th instant, about 70 or 80 petty shop-keepers, artisans and pedlars came to this Consulate, to ask for my support in their refusal to pay. They said that many of them only earned a kran a day, net profit, and that they all had been over-charged. I informed them that I could not interfere, and advised them to pay under protest with a view to getting their objections con sidered at leisure. They seemed willing to follow my advice for the moment, and some of them left the Consulate, but in the evening it was reported to me that about 60 men were still inside, and that they resused to depart. I have since informed Monsieur Paquet that the men have not been formally given sanctuary by me, and that I shall not object, if he proceeds to attach their property. Sarhad News. —The Ismailzai lashlcar, mentioned in last week’s diary, has not visited Lutak, but has proceeded due north from Nasiatabad Ispe, through the upland pastures west of the Hamun, as far as Haidarabad, where rumour says it has raided a larger number of cattle. It is believed that Jahil Khan Ismailzai, Aibu Abdul Aziz Narui, and Jamu Jalal Narui are the leaders of the lashJcar, which numbers 300 or 400 men. They will probably continue proceeding north wards, threatening the villages on the border of the Kainat. A party of Baluchis from Afghanistan has also raided 20 head of cattle, 3 of which belong to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, near Koh Khwaja. The Deputy Governor hopes to be able to cut off the retreat of this party, before they reach the frontier. State of the roads. —A small unarmed caravan, proceeding from Bunjar (in Sistan) to Koh-Malik-Siah, with merchandize for India, was waylaid near Hauzdar, on the 11 th instant, by 6 robbers. They wounded one driver, but some Jambazes from Girdi appeared opportunely on the scene, and the robbers got away with only 3 donkeys. The large caravan, mentioned in last Week’s Diary, as being on its way from Koh-Malik-Siah, has reached Sistan safely. V V G. M. Press, Simla—No. C-4 F.

I am receiving complaints that the Russians, on the pretext 9th February, of searching for arms, are opening all parcels, and stealing the contents. Some time ago, I complained of repeated thefts, and they ceased for a while. The Increased Tax on Opium. —The tax on opium is being increased by loth February. 3 shahies per miscal. This brings up the tax to Krs. 288 per man of lbs. Reconciliation of the Kain Family. — The Ain-u-Dola has telegraphed his February, approval of the reconciliation, which ha*s been made between the Shaukat-ul- Mulk and the Hissam-u-Dola. Recollections of Yusuf Herati. —In the December number of the “ Shia ”, a 12 th February, monthly published in India, there is an account given of the part played by my colleague in the bombardment of the Shrine, and, subsequently, in the death of Yusuf Herati. The Imam Riza. —The Imam Riza, who is theoretically alive, has sent the 13th February. Shah a robe-of-honour via Askhabad. This is an annual function. Russian Action \at Karez. —The Karez Agent reports that on 9 th February 14th February, a large wool caravan reached Karez from Herat. With it was a Berberi, who was suffering from frost-bite, and a cough. The Russian doctor detained the caravan for two days. I immediately protested, and my colleague telegraphed to enquire. The Governor of Herat. —I have received a most friendly letter of thanks isjhi February, from the Governor of Herat upon the occasion of the removal of the quarantine. Ever since the bombardment, which demonstrated to the Afghans that Russia was the enemy of the Islam, the Governor has become more and more friendly. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province. —The Salar has spent the week at Sabzawar, where he is making money in the usual manner. In this connection he has robbed the Agent of a British Indian firm. He has also seized the Government granary at Mazinan. My colleague, who regards him as harmless, and perfectly correct in his behaviour has informed him that he must either accept the governorship of Gilan, or else he will lose Russian pro tection. He has asked that a Russian representative may be sent to discuss matters with him at Sabzawar. Meanwhile, the Ain-u-Dola is threatening, and sowars are being collected from every point. The Meshed forces have already left for Nishapur, and it seems probable that the Salar will either accept the governorship of Gilan, or retire, In this latter manoeuvre he is an expert. The Mutawalibashi informed me that he hated the Salar, as he knew of several cases of children having been eaten, owing to the famine the Salar had caused in Western Persia. The Governor-General was at first in a panic, as my colleague denied that he had received orders to prevent the Salar from entering Meshed. I was, however, able to reassure him on this point, and the Neiir-u- Dola is now the bravest of the brave. State of the Eoads.—Captain Wilson was riding near Meshed, when a man rode up pursued by three robbers. The man was protected, and brought in. The robbers are believed to be some of the late Yusuf Herati s men. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Consul-General, G. M. Press, Simla,F.

Communications. Railways. 75. Merv-Kushlc Franck.- —Men of the Kushk Railway company are engaged on some alteration of the Merv extremity of this branch, the exact nature of which is not yet apparent. 76. Kohand-Namangan Branch. —Direct passenger and goods traffic was opened on this line as on a Russian direct communication railway on the 1 st Jan uary. Booking of passengers and goods is, however, only carried out locally. History. 77. Severe Weather in Trans-Gaspia. —Heavy snow fell in Trans-Caspia at the beginning of the current month, and sleighs were in use at Askhabad. The cara van traffic with Persia was much impeded, and cases of loss of pack-animals are reported. 78. Diversion of Atrek River. —It was recently discovered that the lake of Beumbash, 14 miles from Hassan Kuli, through which the Atrek flows, had dried up and the fishing industry in the Hassan Kuli Bay was adversely affected. In vestigation revealed the fact that the river had been dammed by Turkomans and its waters diverted to Persian territory and to the Khoja Nafas steppe. The dams were destroyed and the river turned into its former channel. 79. Solar-ud-Daula.- —The pretender is still at Sabzwar, and it appears that the force with him is between 100 to 300 strong only. The Khorasan autho rities are taking heart of grace, reflecting that Salar can be attacked on three sides and that he bears no character for excessive bravery. About 100 serbaz have left Meshed for Nishapur, where the conduct of affairs has been entrusted to Munshi-i-Nizam, the former head of Meshed police. The Governor of Nishapur, the family of the Governor of Sabzwar, and the Governor of Tabas have arrived at Meshed. The last named, with 50 sowars, has been ordered to proceed to Nishapur. % The Russian Consul-General has ordered the Commandant of the Russian garrison to hold his force in readiness for eventualities, and a local informant states that the Kuban Cossacks battery at Kahka has been warned to be prepared to start for Meshed, if required. Muhammad the robber has not joined Salar, and has signified his obedience to the Governor-General of Khorasan. /#- \G. M. Press, Simla.—No. S.-789 P. D.—26-3.13,—25.—J.N.B. Military. 80.

The company owns 2 motor boats and 200 small craft, and is establishing departments for the sale of fish at Tashkend, Orenburg, Kokand, Ayerni, and Chimkent. 84. Seal Disease. —The catch of seals in the Caspian is expected to be very small this winter owing to epidemic disease, which has caused great morta lity among seals. Investigations are being made by the laboratory of the Fisheries Department. 85. Tejen Water-supply. —The water in the River Tejen is very high at pre sent, but owing to the primitive nature of the water works and the absence of reservoirs, it is expected that the greater part of this water will be lost to culti vation, Resources.

Perso-Afghan Border.—k blood fend has started between two Kadkhndas of the Gurgich tribe, residing in Afghanistan, and one of them has fled to Khwaja Ahmed, Sirdar Ivndadad Khan s village in Persian Sistan, where he has enlisted a following of 30 men of his own tribe, to help him defeat his adversary. The Deputy Governor is trying to prevent the party crossing the frontier. Sarhad News.—With, reference to last week’s diary, entry (b), I hear that Sardar Jehil Khan has not yet started on the war path against the Sistan Brahuis, though his men are all collected. An Indian Outlaw—A. Brahui, calling himself Sardar Abdullah Khan, aged about 60 years, who has been staying some weeks with Sardar Pasand Khan at Lutak, after being deported from Afghanistan by the Chakansur authorities, left ostensibly for his home in Quetta, on the 26th February 1913. He gave out in Lutak that he had killed an Englishman some years ago at Mastung, after which he fled to Kandahar. He expects only to be punished by a fine of Rs. 2,000 if arrested, as the crime was committed a long time ago. The Baluchistan Administration has been informed by telegraph. Naushirwan Khan's raid on the Nushki Trade Route. —See Diary No. 7. The Deputy Governor informs me that the Karguzar, after a consultation with him, recently telegraphed to the Foreign Minister that there was a possibility of Naushir wan entering Persian territory from Afghanistan. The Deputy Governor has now received a telegram from the Minister for the Interior ordering him to apprehend the outlaw, and hand him over to this Consulate, if he can do so.Enclosure ' ' *tcr from Fr ^^••'retary, India.

A A certain amount of anxiety exists for the safety of a large caravan of 246 camels, carrying merchandize, owned by British subjects (including 18 camel loads of stores and wines for myself !), which left Koh-Malik-Siah about the 7th instant.

He declares that the ZasA/car are not com- mg out tor loot , but only to avenge their fellow-tribesmen. NausUrwan Khan’s raid on the Nushki-Robat Trade Route.—The Governor of Kamat, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, has informed Mr. Howson, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, that he has received two letters from Naushirwan, asking for asylum.

Indeed most of them have arrived. The other cordons are being raised, so far as I can ascertain. M. Grigorieff tells me that it is a matter of days only, if they are not already raised. The Governor of Herat is most grateful to this Consulate-General on account of the raising of the Karez quarantine Afghan Pth/nms.—Regarding entry of 5th January, the Governor of Herat 3 &lt;kh January, has given orders that m future pilgrim passports are only to be issued via India ihe Agent reports that the returned pilgrims are complaining deeply about the hJ treatment, and that even the Turkestan pilgrims travelled back via India' The result of Russian tyranny is that the trade will be diverted from Batoum. ’ 1 i K} ^l^ e Baluch.

State of Province.—On 29th January, the Governor of Nardin telegraphed that the Salar had reached Husemabad, some six miles from Nardin and that hie were in contact with his force. This is reported to consist of 200 of his own sowars and a number of Goklan Turkoman. It is stated that the Goklan headed by Kilich Ishan, their spiritual leader, have agreed to follow the Salar on’ condition that he first attacks and destroys Nardin. As previously reported by me the Governor of Nardin killed Muhammad Geldi Khan, the Chief of the Goklan, some two years ag^ Consequently the Goklan are burning for revenge. The Governor concluded by asking for help of every kind. fh»f k 6 jTf t0 “r T* th , e above “formation, and stated that the Sirdar of Bujnurd had telegraphed that he had received a letter from the feaiar to the effect that unless he joined him, it would be the worse for him Durdi Khan, who was the Governor of Ament and Incha on the Atrek, and is under Bujnurd, also received a letter from the Salar couched in similar terms, and also a letter from the Ishan, who summoned him to the Salar, the Support of Islam , I told the Commander-in-Chief that I had already, at the request of the Gover- nor-General, telegraphed to the Legation. He next asked me whether he should show the telegrams to my colleague. I replied that he should certainly do so and I have since ascertained that he had already done so. * In the evening, M. Leleux told me that he feared that Russians were at the bottom of the whole affair, and this seems to be probable. My theory is that it is the old story of the Minister arranging one thing, and the man on the spot playing his own game. My colleague is openly delighted, and says that it is another blow to Persia, and that the sooner the country is divided up the better. P* M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Oonsul-Qenerah G. M.

Subscriptions for the Bed Cross. —About 2,300 tomans have been collected in Khorasan for the Red Cross. It is doubtful if this sum will ever reach the wound ed Turks. M. Miller to the Russian Foreign Office. —I am informed that M. Miller has been appointed to succeed M. Klemm, who has been posted to Baden Baden. M. Miller is notorious in Persia, and has held posts all over Persia. Consequently, the Russian Foreign Office will have an experienced expert in charge of the Persian department. Export of Opium to China via London. —A merchant recently sent 1,950 lbs. of opium to London, by parcel post, and it reached China safely by this route. He sent off double this amount a week or two ago, but it has been stopped on the Russian frontier. I do not know whether the action taken by the Russian author ities is legal or not. Earthquake and Snowstorm—About 4 p.m. on 5th February, there was a sharp shock of earthquake, lasting perhaps 30 seconds. Two feet of snow have fallen this week—a heavy fall for Meshed. Russian Hospital in Ark GWdew.—Regarding entry of 16th January. The Minister telegraphs that he has agreed to the Russians building the hospital, but that the entrance will not be made opposite to the main gate of this Consulate- General. This is, after all, the most important question. Mehrab Khan the Rakc/L—Regarding entry of 31st January. It appears that Mehrab Khan is being sent to seize a village about which a dispute has been raging for many years, and which the Russians are now interested in, the Jalal- u-Sultan having nominally handed over his claims to the Russian Attache. Al together, the affair is of the most shady description as I know from the details. Political Summary. State of Province. —Since my report of last week, the Salar, who has a force of about 300 men with him, has apparently seized Nardin, the Governor of which place prudently retreated. He then struck the trunk road near Meiomei, and was due at Sabzawar on 7 th, but I have no news of his actual arrival, as the line is not working. It was arranged that the Commander-in-Chief should march to meet him, but no sowars will come in, and the guns are apparently too rusty to be used. The local authorities wished to prepare for a siege, but I advised them to do nothing without consulting my colleague. The Governors of Sabzawar and Nishapur are flying back to Meshed. It is of interest to note that the Russian Minister informed the British Lega tion that the Salar was believed to have returned to Khoja Nafas. My colleague has been instructed by his Legation not to allow the Salar to enter an area occupied by Russian troops. It will be interesting to see what he actually does. ! State of roads. —Timur Khan, whose activities I was able to stop some years ago, has again taken up his position on the Yezd-Tabas road, and is robbing. He is protected by the leading Mujtahid of Tabas, or rather was protected I ha ye had orders sent to have him driven away : but probably nothing will be done. Late News.—I have just heard that the Salar reached Sabzawar on the even ing of 7 th. He has about 300 men with him. The few Persian soldiers joined the pretender, but the Amir Azam is said to be pursuing him, and so he may sta y at Sabzawar. p M SYK ES, Major, His Majesty s Consul-Generah O. M. Frees, Suali^N..

Peasants' Banks .—Three more loan offices or peasants’ banks are being inaugurated in the Merv District of Transcaspia. They are designed to obviate the borrowing by cultivators at usurious rates, and, according to a recent statement of the Acting Governor-General of Turkistan, the movement is making good progress. Communications. Railways. 54. Oxus Railway project .—From reports received it appears that sites for stations for this line are being determined between Karsbi and Kerki. 55. Narrow-gauge material .—A considerable quantity of rails for narrow-gauge lines is being despatched cast along the Central Asian Railway from Askhabad and Merv. Its destination is variously stated as Termez or the Andijan branch, but it appears probable that the latter is correct, as the scl ernes for feeder lines to this branch require a quantity of narrow-gauge material. By implication the material for the late Askhabad-Firyusa line, stored at Askhabad, has thus probably been despatched east. Telegraphs. 56. Khiva line.—k small camel caravan with telegraph material has been des patched towards Khiva from Charjui. History. 57. ?alar-ud-Daula.— From a reliable source it appears that Salar-ud-Daula has reached the neighbourhood of Nardin on his way to Meshed. The Command ant of the Russian garrison at Meshed yesterday stated that his information was that Salar had already reached Nardin. 58. Plaque .—Although Khorasan is declared free of plague, the Turkistan press is only just speaking of special precautions on the Russo-Persian frontier being relaxed. . . The native population of Turkistan and Transcaspia evinces great incredulity as to the existence of the disease, as although it is declared to have been raging m Afghanistan, arrivals from that country disown any knowledge of it. Even by the population of Merv the outbreak in their vicinity is disbelieved in, and Russian action is attributed either to dark designs on Afghanistan or to a desire to punish the Turkomans for intriguing with the Afghans and ‘ for their refusal to furms recruits for military service. 59. Snow in Trmscasfia .—Au abundant snow-fall was recently recorded on the Central Asian Railway between Krasnovodsk and Kazandpk. Ethnography. 60. Immigration in ^.-According to the Turkistan News, the total of Rus sian immigrants to Russian Central Asia during the past year amounted to 260,000 persons—Si increase of 40,000 on the previous year. The number of returning emigrants was also considerably less than m 1911.

Plague. —The Governor of Merv reports that, with the object of bringing the plague cordon to an end the Merv Turkomans concealed plague cases and buried their dead secretly at night. The total of cases in the enclosed encampments was thus 54 and not 29, and the last case occurred on the 28th and not the 21st December. Corpses were disinterred and disinfected, and a careful medical inspection of survi vors revealed no suspicious sickness. 67. Salar-ud-Daula. —Salar-ud-Daula, with a force of Turkomans, has now reached Sabzwar on his way to Meshed. The Governor-General is considering the despatch of soivars and a gun to oppose his advance and it is stated that Muham mad, the robber, has been offered the command of military operations. Reports state that Muhammad has already joined Salar, and such action on his part seems most probable. The sowars, if despatched, would no doubt join the pretender themselves and he has a large number of sympathisers among the population. The Russians at Meshed express the greatest satisfaction with the trend of events. Military. 68. Ordnance. —A quick-firing field gun with shield of the latest pattern has been received at Kushk. 69. Inspection of fortress.- —The inspection of all magazines and secret works at Kushk, during which all natives are excluded from the fort for several days, has taken place. This seems to be a yearly occurrence. 70. Automobiles. —An automobile for military purposes has been received at Askhabad. This is the first of the kind to be received there. 71. The Sapper mutiny. —The trial of 40 non-commissioned officers and men of this corps, implicated by recent revelations in the mutiny during the summer, was fixed to commence at Tashkend with closed doors on the 23rd January. Resources. 72. Land purchase. —In the Kokand, Namangan, Andijan, and Osh districts of Ferghana non-irrigated land is being freely purchasd by private individuals with the object of irrigating it by pumping machinery. The price of non-irrigated land even has risen considerably in consequence. /&lt; A'r, E &gt; V - 0 V A73 Factories in Fergfoww.—According to official statistics the total o£ lactones and works of all sorts existing in Ferghana at the present time is .

The new Manager for the Sistan Branch, Mr. 20th February. Nelson, has left Birjand. I TJie Sarhaddar and Rais-i-Qushun. —This officer has held an official reception 2ist February, of local and foreign officials in honour of the completion of the construction of an “ Arsenal ” in the “ fort ” of Sistan. The building simply resembles a caravanserai with a number of small cham bers opening on to the interior courtyard. The Rais-i-Qushun’s office is situated m the building, and we were told that, in addition to some rifles and ammunition, a couple of breech-loading guns were the stores in stock. The only soldiers visible throughout the proceedings were the dozen men forming the guard. The money sanctioned for the work was 350Tumans, but as nothing was spent on labour (which the soldiers and the corvee supplied), and the burnt bricks were all collected from adjacent ruins, the cost, I am told by the Deputy Governor, who at present is very friendly, has not exceeded 200 Tumans It is hardly necessary to add that HajiNasir-us-Saltaneh is charging the Govern ment the full sum allotted. The Sarhaddar is now anxious to start the construction of barracks in the vicinity of the Arsenal. At present, he says, the Sarbazcs mostly spend their nights in opium dens, or worse places. GENERAL. SarJiad News—{a) With reference to Muhammad Khan Dadshah’s raid into Afghanistan, relations between this Consulate and the Russian were rather strained for a day or two in consequence of my writing an informal note to Baron Tcherkassov, begging him to use all his influence with Sardar Pasand Khan, his ex-Ghulam Bashi, so as to enable the local authorities to satisfy the Afghans. My colleague promised to do everything he could, but he indignantly declared that the Sardar was not a Russian protege, and that he had not been set at liberty through any intervention of his. He also objected to my befriending the Afghans, but was eventually satisfied about my right to do this. On the 20th instant, the Deputy Governor re-arrested Pasand Khan, and kept him in comfortable confinement, until the 22nd, when an agreement was executed by Juma Khan, the Russian Consulate Ghulam Bashi, countersigned by the Russian Consul, to the effect that if 25 camels are not handed back to the Afghans within the next three months, either Pasand Khan or Muhammad Khan Dadshah shall be imprisoned, or else Juma Khan himself will pay up the value of the camels. The Deputy Governor has, on his part, given a written premise to Sardar Pasand Khan to the effect that he will do his utmost to recover from the Afghans the 29 camels stolen from Muhammad Khan and others in 1911. Four camels actually in Pasand Khan’s possession, and six others in Sardar Khudadad Khan’s village are being made over now to Samad Khan, who has accepted this settlement on my advice, as the best which can be arranged for the moment. (b) Sardar Jahil Khan, Ismailzai, has started out from Sarhad with two hundred or three hundred men to attack the Sistan Brahuis, who have taken their herds to graze on the upland pastures beyond the oasis of Sistan. He wishes to kill one man in reprisal for the death of a tribesman, named Banda, who was shot last summer when Sardar Khudadad Khan led the Sistanis out to punish the Sarhaddis for their caravan raiding.

State of the Beads .—No outrages have been reported during the week. The Deputy Governor has informed me that the band infesting the Bandan-Lab-i- Bring road consist of seven men from Sardar Khudadad Khan s following, and one who is related to Pasand'Khan. It is to be noted that Khudadad K-han is related to the Hasmat-ul-Mulk,' and is, therefore, not very friendly with the present Deputy Governor, whom he regards as an interloper. , VCONFIDENTIAL. p Enclosure ' f *ter fro.n F-- India.

An Unfortunate Tragedy. —Murad, the dresser of this hospital, and an Indian, 21st January, was leaving the house of a patient with a Persian, when he was shot from the roof of an adjoining house by a certain Amir Khan, a Russian subject. The Mauser bullet passed through the shoulder of his companion, and then struck the unfortunate dresser in the abdomen. The shot was fired at about 8 p.m. in brilliant moonlight, and both men recog nised the man^who fired, whom they knew. Murad was operated on, and it seem ed that he w^ould recover. A deposition was taken by Captain Wilson, and sent to the Russian Consulate, and the man was arrested by the Persian police, and handed over to the Russians. M$rad died two days after the wound had been inflicted. Raj)e by Russian Soldiers. —A woman, who was returning from washing clothes, 22nd January, was raped, and then killed by some Russian soldiers. Persians heard her screams, and were afraid to intervene. Upon the whole the Russian soldiers behave very well, and such cases are rare. The “ Tws.”—The “ Tus ”, a weekly paper, has been prohibited for commenting 23rd January, on the action of the Commander-in-Chief, who, it was stated, would not listen to the petition of the troops in Sistan, but said that he had no time, and left the Telegraph office. A Baluch from Jacobabad.—k Baluch, Mehrab Khan by name, has reached 2oth Januar y* Meshed. I hear that he states that he was a notable of Jacobabad, was imprison ed for eight years, and, as his seat at durbar was taken away, he had to leave. My colleague is kindly interesting himself in the man, and tried to induce M. Leleux to give him temporary employment. This was not arranged, and so arrangements have been made for him temporarily, pending permanent employ ment promised by Prince Dabija. I mention this matter in case the man is wanted by the police in India : also it shows the lines on which my colleague continues to work. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province. —I have heard secretly that the Salar-u-Dola has reached Nardin, between Shahrud and Bujnurd, in force. On the other hand, I hear from the Legation that the Salar has made terms with the Government. Consequent ly, it is to be hoped that my information is incorrect, or, if correct, that the Salar is only taking a roundabout way to Tehran. State of the Roads.—Muhammad Nishapuri, the noted brigand, had, as reported, been quietly living in his village, and levied money on the surrounding villages for his support. In fact he was considered a reformed character by the Governor- General. A body of gendarmes, i.e., Revenue officials, disturbed this peaceful state of affairs by trying to seize Muhammad, who escaped, and has since returned to the road, where he has robbed some travellers in a carriage.CONFIDENTIAL, EncJosur- ' ' “er fr - rj p— A'r,. 11 1J, 13 M Sistan Consular Diary of Major F.

Military Attache to the Russian Consulate, Sistan.-'Reterence my Diary No. 4, for the week ending 25th January 1913. Colonel Yygonitzky and his wife have arrived safely in Sistan. They had an exciting experience a few stages, after leaving Turbat-i-Haideri, when they drove into an ambush of 20 bandits, with rifles levelled at them. The two Persian Sowars, who were escorting the carriage, succeeded in settling matters amicably. As the result, a few hours later the travellers paid a friendly visit to the chief robber, in a cave near their halting place, and exchanged presents with him, the Colonel receiving a beautifully ornamented sword. 5th February. —Monsieur M. deWeerdt, the Belgian Director of Customs and Revenue, who has been relieved by Monsieur Paquet, left Sistan for Meshed, en route to Europe. He has been granted three months’ leave, from the date of crossing the frontier. a copy of a telegram, he has received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 549, dated 28th Safar 1331, in which it is stated that his proposed transfer to Kerman is cancelled, and that he will be retained in Sistan. Sistan-Koh Malik Siah Road. —Three incidents of thefts of camels, while at graze (one in each case), have occurred at Grirdi Chah, during the last fortnight. They have been brought to the notice of the local authorities. It is believed that the culprit in one case is known. Sarhad News. —Reference my Diary No. 4, for the week ending 25th January 1913. An Afghan, by name Samad Khan, has been sent by the Chakhansur authorities to Sistan to press the local authorities to return the looted camels. Sardar Pasand Khan, Brahui, who initiated the raid, was sent for, and confined by the Deputy Governor for a few days, but was eventually released on the recommendation of the Sarhaddar, Haji Nasir-us-Saltaneh, to whom the Russian Consul had appealed. The two sons of Sardar Pasand Khan are in Baron Tcher- kassov’s employ as Ghulam Bashi and Ghulam, respectively. The Deputy Governor has sent out eight sowars to bring into Sistan the men, who are said to be in actual possession of the camels. Sistan Revenue. —The assembly of Sardars and Kadkhudas mentioned in last week’s Diary has dispersed. Sardar Purdil Khan is said to have spoken most strongly on the side of law and order, and to have told his fellow-landlords that he could not countenance any outrage, which would bring trouble upon his son-in-law, the Deputy’Governor. Sistan Consulate Hospital. —There have recently been a few cases of small-pox in the outlying villages, and, as a consequence, the people are flocking to this Hos pital to have their children vaccinated. One hundred and seventy-seven vaccinations were performed during January 1913, a large number of operations were postponed each week for want of lymph. State of the Roads. —News has just been received that a band of 10 or 12 rob bers is frequenting the Sistan-Birjand caravan road, between Labi Bring and Ban- dan, and holding up all small parties of travellers. A telegraph Sarhang, who is travelling to Meshed in a carriage, was waylaid about five days ago, and other individuals have also been looted. Genekal.

He discussed with His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Mr. Howson, the murder of the late local Director, Mirza Ibrahim Khan, {vide this office Diary, No. 32, for the week ending 10th August 1912), and concluded by saying that he would tell the Treasurer General that he thought the charges against the Governor of complicity in the outrage had best be dropped, as they were in capable of proof, after such a lapse of time. GENERAL, Messrs. Muhammad Ali &lt;&amp; Brothers^ grievance against the Director of Customs and Finance. —See diaries Nos. 43, 44, and 46 of 1912. The solution of the ques tion of appointment of Jcadkhudas for villages, Chilling, Tuti and Alia bad has been very difficult, owing to the impotence of Monsieur de Weerdt, and his successor, against the intrigues of various Sardars, who, in conjunction with Mirza Sadiq Khan of the Customs Department, had arranged to oust the old kadkhuda i Messrs. Muhammad Ali and Brothers client. The abstract justice of our claim, which was based on contracts countersigned by both the Karguzar and Major O’Connor, was readily admitted, but only recently have the orders relating to two of the villages been brought into effect to our satisfaction, while in the third case, that of Aliabad, it appears unlikely that Sardar Abbas Khan will withdraw, until the Belgians are strong enough to use force against him. In the case of Tuti, the three leaders of the opposing faction were imprisoned by the Deputy Governor for several weeks before they would sign an undertaking for their future good be haviour. The Department of Customs and Finance. —Monsieur Paquet has received sanc tion to raise his force of Revenue Sowars from 50 to 150 men. They will be given 8 tomans a month pay each. A large number will be enlisted from the followers of Sardar Purdil Khan. Naushirwan’s raid on the Nushki-Robat Trade Route. —See Diary No. 1 of this year. Two messengers from this outlaw have arrived in Lutak, and put up with Sardar Pasand Khan, whom they have asked to arrange safe conduct for them to Sistan, as they bear a letter to the Deputy Governor here. It was rumoured in Lutak that Naushirwan was planning a big raid against a caravan, either in British territory, or on the road between Koh Malik Siah and Nasratabad. It seems, however, more probable that he is inconvenienced by the attentions of the Kandahar authorities, after his last escapade, and that he hopes to gain asylum again in Sistan, where he actually was residing a few years ago. The two messengers have not yet come to Nasratabad. The Political Agent, Chagai, and the Officer Commanding at Kacha have been informed of the rumour regarding Naushirwan’s contemplated raid. State of the Roads. —The road between Lab-i-Bring and [Birj and is still unsafe, owing to the presence of the band of robbers mentioned last week. The Deputy Governor has asked the Sarhaddar to send out a force against them, but the latter officer says that all the horse and camel sowars are still on strike, and that he can do nothing in the circumstances, beyond providing small escorts for travellers. The road between Koh Malik Siah and Sistan must also be considered unsafe, both on account of the conduct of the Jambazes, and the uncertainty of the intentions of Naushirwan Khan. As regards the Jambazes, I have made urgent representations both to the Sarhaddar and to the Director of Finance, G. M. Press, Simla.— No. C-755 F. D.— 7-3-13.—29—M D.

GENERAL SUMMARY. Administration. 38. Governov for Trans-Cas'pici. —The Trans-Cctspian Review states that Lieu tenant-General Lesh, at present commanding the 1st Turkistan Army Corps, will probably be designated Governor of Trans-Caspia and Commander of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps. [ Communications. Railways. 39. TashJcend Railway. Profits for 2922.—Although full statistics have not yet been issued, the Press states that preliminary calculations shew that the net profit for this line for 1912 will amount to about £842,000. 40. Central Asian Line. Engine ivories. —Fundsfor the construction of engine building works for the line at Tashkend have been applied for. 41. Coal su'fyply. —The Central Asian Line calls for tenders for the supply of 6,425 tons of Don coal. 42. Building. —The Central Asian Line calls for the supply of burnt bricks to the sum of £11,370, lime to the sum of £l,260, and stone to the amount of £260. Tenders are to be filed at the offices of the 11th to 18th sections of the line. In this connection a correspondent has recently stated that engine-repairing shops on a large scale on the right bank of the Amu Darya opposite Charjui are to be built. 43. Kokand-Namangan Line. —This line has now, with the assent of the Ministers of Ways of Communication and Finance, been included in the Russian system of direct passenger and goods communication. 44. Cotton conveyance. —With the object of economising rolling-stock, the Tashkend and Central Asian lines have lately been conveying cotton on open trucks. The Moscow Cotton Committee now enters a strong protest against this practice as causing deterioration of the cotton so carried. If the protest is acted upon, both lines are likely to be embarassed in the matter of covered rolling- stock in the future. Waterways. 45. Amu Darya. —-The river-training works up-stream of the Charjui railway bridge are being rapidly pushed on with the object of completing them during the present low water. History. 46. Plague .'—The troops on plague cordon round the Merv Turkoman encamp ments returned to their cantonments at the beginning of January, by orders of the Governor-General, who apparently visited both Merv and Kushk in person. The Governor of Trans-Caspia is advertising for eight feldshers (subordinate medical staff) to be employed at Askhabad at a salary of 60 roubles per mensem, to be increased, should plague occur, to 100 roubles. The Turkistan News reports that “ according to official information, plague in Afghanistan has now been localised.” The improvement is rapid, as only a few weeks ago the same paper reported wholesale deaths of Afghans by plague. • • /a that the Russian authorities at Merv are recovering » ,1 ssrSTi-oi pi*, i»« «•» of Merv, and half from the Turkomans. a i a i ia 47.

The Governor of Herat on tte Russians. -The Governor of Herat has written lath January to warn me not to be deceived by the Russians. He says that as quarantine has been imposed, when there was no epidemic, there was evidently some other motive at work. The leading Turkoman at Sarakhs, Tekke Khan by name has stated that the Russians will keep on the quarantine, until the spring and’that as there is no sickness in Afghanistan, it must have been imposed to prevent Afghans from helping the Turks. This is possibly what the Governor of Herat thinks. New Karguzar for Birjand.—Saiyid Mirza Husein, Izz-ul-Mamalik, a member 13 th January, of the Meshed Karguzari, has been appointed to Birjand. He is friendly to this Consulate, and, apparently, a suitable man. At the same time, he may not go after all, as the last man appointed cried off at the last minute. Revenue Troubles at Sabzawar—There is much trouble at Sabzawar, to which nth j a town most of the revenue gendarmerie has been sent. M. Leleux claims that ' anuary * revenue be paid in cash, or kind, and that, if money be paid for grain, the present full market price should be paid. The custom has been to fix the rate very low, and for the Governor to make his profit out of the transaction. A Club for Meshed.—k club has been organised for the employes of the Cus- loth January, toms Revenue, and other departments. Ts. 2,500 have been collected ; a house taken, a library started, and theatrical representations will be given once’ a week. Arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Nelson.—The new Bank Manager for Sistan, and his wife, reached Meshed after a very trying journey, via Shahrud, Astarabad’ Bandar Gaz, Krasnovodsk and Askabad. He has given me much valuable information which I am reporting separately. Russian Attempt on the Ark Garden.—The Governor-General informed me i 6fc i secretly that my colleague has forced him to reopen the question of selling part of ' anUary ’ the Ark Garden to the Russians for a hospital. As the plan included the opening of a road opposite this Consulate main gate, I opposed the scheme, and the Mi nister informed me that the Persian Government would resist ’ all pressure before selling any part of the garden. I have informed the Legation of my col league's activity, and have no doubt that it will be checked. As the site is unsuit able for the purpose, it can only be supposed that my colleague has ulterior motives. Indeed, if he honestly wished to pay for the site, why should he not buy one in a suitable position elsewhere. Revenue Troubles.—W. Leleux is displaying much activity in collecting revenue from owners of gardens, from trades people, and from mechanics. He 7 Januar y- deserves much credit for his energy in the face of many difficulties. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. Supposed Plague.—Thunks to Captain Wilson's visit the quarantine has been abolished. Trade has suffered considerably during its continuance, and the cost of food has risen at Meshed. British prestige will be considerably enhanced by the fact that the quarantine was removed soon after Captain Wilson's arrival at Karez. With my ex perience of Russians, and bearing in mind what I heard, I have little doubt that the quarantine would have been maintained, until the spring, unless he had been sent to investigate. I am now working hard to induce the Russian authorities in Turkestan to abolish the second quarantine, along the Turkestan-Afghan frontier. 15lv!- r n i f a 101 J 'f4JAdil-u-Dola 700 tomans, as the Governor s share.

He was then being frequently visited by the ussian Consul. On his decision to make his peace for the present with the Persian Government he dismissed the Turkomans by alleging that Muhammad Ah Mirza had been reinstalled on the throne at Tehran, and, as he himself had been summoned as Sadr Azam, their services would not be required. 31.

His defence was that, as previous investigations of continual reports of sedition had proved unfounded, there was no good reason to suppose the cry of “ wolf ” to be justified in the present instance. DeIn the course of the proceedings it was stated that in 1908 almost half of one company was under suspicion and was being observed and reported upon by the other half. 34.

Indeed, ever since the bombardment, and my help to the Persians, which was enormously exaggerated, his attitude has changed, and he is now really friendly, and settles our cases. The Turkoman.—The Russians are now demanding a male camel, a ram, and 7th January, a he-goat from each head of a Turkoman clan. They have replied that last year girls were demanded from them to be given to the soldiers as prostitutes. Ihis demand they refused, and they threaten to leave Turkestan, if this demand be pressed.

Fifteen wagons were completely smashed and others were derailed. Prompt measures were taken to clear the line and pas senger trains reached Tashkend four hours behind time. On the 28th December, on the Central Asian line between Yakatut and Murgak stations, a goods train of 25 wagons left the rails. History, 15. Return of Cover nor-General .—General Samsonof, Governor-General of Turkistan, returned to Tashkend from Petersburg on the 27th December. 16. Plague in Trans-Caspia. —No fresh cases of plague have been notified in the Turkoman encampments near Merv, since the 21st December. The Merv bazaar has been re-opened. Several of the Turkoman headmen have been arrested by the Russian autho rities. Native rumour assigns sympathy with the Turks or intrigues with Af ghanistan as the cause of the headmen’s, offence, but the arrest was no doubt made in connection with the attempt to break the cordon. The Council of the Governor-General has advocated the establishment of sis medical observation posts on the Central Asian line. The management of the line asks for a sum of £3,560 to defray present expenses in connection with plague measures, and for a total credit of £9,360. Military doctors from other stations have been despatched to Merv on plague duty. 17. Oxus Bridge. — Fourteen floats and an inconsiderable quantity of superstruc ture are reported to be lying on the Russian bank at Changiz Tapa between Kilif and Termez. 18. Russian Movements from AfesW.—Major-General Savitzki, Chief of the Staff of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps, returned from Turbat-i-Haidari on the 7th January, leaving for Askhabad on the following day. An officer and 31 Cossacks of the 3rd and 4th sotnyas (at Meshed) of the 1st Semiryechia Cossacks left towards Khaf on the 8th January with 3,500 rounds of small arms ammunition. 19. Russian Military Attaches.—Colonel Yygornitzki, the new Russian Mili tary Attache for Sistan, left Meshed for that place on the 8th January accom panied by his wife. He has completed his period in command of a battalion of the 1st Turkistan Rifle Regiment, and expects his nomination to a regimental command in four years’ time.

Proposed Increase of Frontier Guard.—The Petersburg Telegraphic Agency states that a committee has been formed at Petersburg to consider the advisability of the increase of the Frontier Guard in Trans-Cacausia and Central Asia. It is proposed to form two new brigades, and two detachments to guard the inland sea coasts. Besources. 25.

I have heard two rumours, both from Russian sources, which are amusing, if nothing else. The first is that he was offered the post of Ambassador at Berlin, but was too fond of Persia to accept the promotion. The second is that he was told that he was too old to return to Persia, but that he begged to be allowed to return to die there. This was finally allowed, but he was instructed to die as quickly as possible. Arrival of Lieutenant Jowk—Lieutenant Fowle reached Meshed on 31st 3 | s t December. December. As the road to Tehran is unsafe, and travelling has been prohibited by order, he will stay at Meshed for some weeks, and then proceed to Tehran by Askabad. J The Durbar. —The usual Persian calls were received, and the Durbar was held. 1st January. The merchants and servants were entertained as usual. 2. Prince Dabija. —My colleague called. He is older, and more feeble than when he left, and his senile decay has increased. In no other country would a man in such a state be allowed to hold such a post. Although he accused me of being permanently drunk, I hope to maintain the usualTriendly relations with him, as the charge is'more’amusing than serious. Increase of Afghan Guards.—The Karez Agent reports that the Afghan posts 2 id January, have had their garrisons increased from seven to fourteen men. Looting of British subjects at the time of the bombardment.—K. Grigorieff told me 3rd January.' that he had been instructed to inquire into the two claims by British subjects, who suffered losses during the bombardment. He frankly said that it was unlikely that they would receive any compensation. He subsequently asked me for details, which I gave. The above took place just before the return of Prince Dabija. As I pointed out there is plenty of proof available, but they are unwilling to inquire into the matter. soothing letters to the Governor of Herat every week. From Merv it is reported that there are no fresh cases, and that many of the Turkoman have been killed, as they tried to break out through the cordon. The bazaar is shut at Merv, and a panic reigns, as it is believed that everyone, who was attacked by the epidemic, was poisoned by the doctors. I heard that this was done near Astrakhan, but I hope that both reports were untrue. The Russians, who first stated that the smuggler, who brought the plague (?; came f rom Afghanistan, finally declared that he came from Khorasan.

GENERAL SUM M ARY. Communications. Railways. •i ^ * ^ en ^ ra ^ Asian Railway Estimate. —The estimate for this line for 1913 pro- vides for the expenditure of £1,693,209 or £210,255 in excess of the expenditure provided for last year In addition a sum of £157,709 is asked for to carry out improvements for the facilitation of commercial and industrial ends. History. , J?' m Trans-Casf ia. —The existence of plague in the Turkoman oba of Churmk, 8 nines from Merv, was first reported to the authorities on the 12th December 1912. The disease, imported by a smuggler from the Jam Rud region entering Russian territory by way of Sarakhs, was discovered to be plague of the pneumonic type. The encampment was immediately surrounded by a cordon of 4 companies of Rifles and a Cossack sotnya, and these measures were subsequently extended to neighbouring encampments and to the Central Asian Railway in the vicinity of Merv. All movements of Turkomans were forbidden, and the bazars of Merv, Takhta Bazar, and Yolatan were closed by orders of the authorities. Pre cautionary measures were taken at Askhabad and other towns, and the Central Asian Railway placed special waggons at various stations to receive possible plague cases. In addition 3rd and 4th class carriages, in which only native passengers are permitted to travel, have been attached to trams. These are observed during the journey by subordinate medical officials. The plague specialist from Astrachan has proceeded to the locality of the outbreak and other doctors have been sum moned, but the papers complain that the number of doctors available is insuffi cient. Up to the 21st December, 29 deaths were officially notified in the Turkoman encampments, but none had occurred in Merv itself or elsewhere. According to advices of the 28th December, no deaths have occurred since the 21st December nor have fresh cases been notified. I A sum of £7,000 has been placed at the disposal of the authorities in the first instance for dealing with the epidemic. It is stated that the cordon of troops will be maintained for at least 15 days after the occurrence of the last case of plague. It is reported from a reliable source that the Turkomans made an organised armed attempt to break the cordon, and the rumours of Turkomans having been shot by Russian soldiers which have been prevalent, are thus explained. This phase of the proceedings has been carefully excluded from the papers. 3. The Persian Pretender. —Rumours are current at Krasnovodsk that Salar- ud-Daula is in the neighbourhood of Astrabad. The departure of a well-known secret agent of the ex-Shah from that place for the Persian coast has caused remark. 4. Caspian Gale. —A severe gale raged on the Caspian on the 19th ultimo; fifteen fishing boats were wreckd near Derbend and it is surmised that the occupants, 41 in number, have perished. 5. Departure of Chief of Staff of 2nd Turkistan Army Corps. —General Savitzki left Meshed for Turbat-i-Haidari on the 29th ultimo. 6. Return of Russian Consul-General. —Prince Dabija has returned from RussiaG. M. Press, Simla.—No. C.-705 F. D.-S-2-13.-25,—J.N.B. 7 Investigation of plague reports on the Jam Rud .—Captain Wilson, and Doctor Zanlotinski of the Russian Consulate-General have left Meshed towards Kariz to investigate the reports of the death of rats in the Jam Rud region. Military. 8 Reliefs. 728 recruits reached Tashkend in one troop-train on the 19th De cember, 268 being retained for the local garrison. ^ Seventy-five recruits only are reported as arriving via the Caspian between the 10 th and 20 th December. 9. The Sapper Mutiny. —Investigations have revealed the complicity of 40 men still serving in the Turkistan Sappers in the mutiny at Troitzkoye camp. They are to be tried by court-martial. Ten officers in all, including one colonel and one lieutenant-colonel, will be arraigned on the charge of “ inaction ”. 10. Arrival. —Lieutenant-General Bakharlovski, newly appointed to command the artillery of the Turkistan Military District, reached Tashkend on the 22nd December. 11. Appointment.— The Officer Commanding the 3rd Ural Cossack Regiment, Loginoff, has been appointed to the command of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Turkis tan Cossack Division. Resources. 12. Deforestation of Turldstan. —The Turkistan News states that the authorities are about to take energetic measures to deal with the wholesale destruction of saxaul by the nomad population. The Tashkend line is threatened with an invasion of sand dunes over a stretch of 40 miles in consequence of their depreda tions. E. A. F.

The Governor at Chakhansur, however, prohibited the raid, and asked the Deputy Governor nf Sistan to settle the question. He also moved his superior at Herat to communicate with the Persian authorities at Meshed, with the result that Sartip Muhammad Reza has received ex plicit orders to settle the case to the satisfaction of the Afghan authorities. The Deputy Governor is doing his best in the matter, and, as the result of the better relations, which may ensue, he informs me that he is hopeful that the Cha khansur authorities will settle some of the outstanding claims of Persian subjects against Afghans. Sistan Revenue. —The Sardars and Kadkhudas have apparently decided to com bine in passively resisting the Belgians’ attempts to collect revenue. Monsieur Paquet has informed me that he is at present powerless to proceed against them, but he is applying for sanction to entertain a force of 100 Revenue Sowars, similar to the 300 men, under the orders of the Provincial Director in Meshed. I have recommended him to give careful consideration to the two prin cipal (though perhaps only ostensible) matters of complaint, and to proceed slowly for the present. Karguzar of Sistan and Koh-MaliJc-Siah. —Negotiations are proceeding between the Ehtisham-i-Humayun and Sardar Purdil Khan Sarbandi, the most influential land-owner in Sistan, for the marriage of the former’s daughter to Ali Khan, eldest son of the Sardar. Presumably, the Karguzar still entertains hopes that his transfer from Sistan will not be insisted upon. Military Attache to the Russian Consulate, Nisfcm.—Colonel Yigornitzky and his wife reached Birjand on the 22nd January, and left on the 27th for Sistan.

Major-General Savitski. —The Chief of Staff of the Askabad Army Corps reached Meshed on 26th, on inspection duty. He called on 27th, with his aide-de- camp Captain Morgounoff. Major Redl met him at Askabad, and found him friendly, and this was the impression I formed. Colonel Vygornitzki—The new Russian Military Attache for Sistan reached Meshed with his wife on 27th, and called. He was under M. deKlemm at Bombay, and must be known to the Government of India. He speaks most enthusiastically of India in curious English. His wife is ijl, owing to the journey, and I am afraid that they will have a very bad time before they reach Sistan. It is to be noted that he is a full Colonel. • Prince Dabija. —My colleague has reached Kuchan, and his return is imminent. 2. An American-Turkish Armenian in trouble .—An Armenian, M. H. Tir- yakin, giving as his address 33, East 17th Street, New York, reached Meshed some days ago from Kerman via Tehran, with the intention of opening a carpet agency for the American firm of H. S. Tavshanjian. It appears that some Russian sub jects in the carpet trade from trade jealousy and on the ground that he was using new coin, which they alleged to be counterfeit, rushed into his room with revolvers, and beat him. The police appeared on the scene, and the zealous Chief sealed up his property, and took him to the police station, and then to the Karguzari. When communicated with, I asked Dr. Esselstyn to see the man, whom he recognised as one of his old pupils. The man has put himself in the wrong by using a Persian passport, although he is actually a Turkish subject. He hopes to become an American citizen next year. L POLITICAL SUMMARY. 25th December. 26th December. 27 th December. 28th December. 28th December. State of Province. Supposed Plague. —The Governor of Herat has sent a second letter, denying the existence of plague in the Herat province. The Karez Agent reports that the quarantine is in full force, and that 200 Berber! pilgrims were recently turned back. An arrangement has been made with M. Grigorieff, whereby both Captain Wilson and Dr. Zapolitinski will start on 29th December for Karez. Both have plague experience, and full powers will be given them by the Conseil Sanitaire of Khorasan. The arrangement is especially advantageous to us, as hitherto we have had no share in the control of the quarantine, and as peur bleue, and thirst for special allowances rages in the Russian mind, it is ex tremely important to get at the truth of the matter. From Merv comes the disquieting news that a smuggler from Afghanistan re cently died in a Turkoman encampment near Merv, and that plague has broken out there. I still hope that the information is incorrect, knowing as I do the mentality of the Russian doctor. At the same time, it is impossible to ignore the possible seriousness of the position. State of Roads .—Saiyid Hasan, one of the supporters of the late Yusuf Herati, has been pardoned by the Governor of Turbat, and has been placed in charge of the roads. As he is not being paid, it will be interesting to see how he maintains his twenty followers. No movements of Russian troops to report. P. M.

The Director, it is said, has made a con cession to Sardar Purdil Khan, the most powerful land-owner, and a relation by marriage of the Deputy Governor, which has perhaps conduced to this result. The warning which I gave the Deputy Governor, against allowing any agrarian outrages may possibly also have had some good effect. The Kadkhudas are, how ever, still said to be discontented. Sarhad News—The rumour about Sardar Muhammad Baza Khan Begi having been killed at Bampur is apparently untrue. It is now said that he has returned to his home. Baluch Raids.—(See Diary No. 52 for week ending 28th December 1912). It is reported from Birjand that the Baluch raiding party of 200 men has attacked a caravan near Naiband (about 110 miles west of Birjand), killing 8 men, wound ing 3, and carrying off 300 camels.

Gulran to Kushk. —80 sowars and 64 Khwanin sowars, or a total of 144 Kara Tappa. —36 khassadars. Raiding Parties on the Herat Frontier—The Herat Agent reports that the 18th December, frontier officials complain that the Russians allow parties of thirty to raid across the frontier. Presumably, it is much the same as in Khorasan. The Russian Day. The Tsar’s birthday was observed by a reception. Owing 19 th December to Muharram, there was no dinner. The Muharram Processions.—Owing to the presence of the Russian garrison, 20th December, there was a very spiritless celebration of Muharram. Political Summary. State of Province—Supposed Plague. —On 14th December, the Sanitary Coun cil unanimously declared that as there was no epidemic in Afghanistan, or in Khorasan, quarantine should be abolished. On 17th December, I asked M. Grigoiieff if instructions in this sense had been sent to Karez. In reply, he stated that he was awaiting the protocol. Two days later, he informed me that sus picious rats had been found on the Jam Rud. It is probable that this is all part of a plot to continue the quarantine, in which connection the Governor of Bakharz has been induced to seal a document to the effect that there is still some sickness in the district. It is a known fact that every year a few cases of cholera are false ly reported in Transcaspia, in order that the special allowances may be drawn. In this case similar motives are apparently at work. Captain Blair reports that on the Chaacha road there was strict quarantine, the soldiers threatening to shoot anyone approaching the Russian frontier post. At the same time, the' Russians freely crossed to buy food to Persian Chaacha. On the next road to the north, by Karatikan and Mehna, there was no quarantine at all, and on the Dushakh road only wool and hides were being stopped. State of Roads. —The telegraph line is still stopped by Turkoman, who have cut it. I imagine that the gholams are afraid to repair the line. Mr. Eldrid, who has recently been to Nishapur, reports that Muhammad is living like a prince near the town. He levies blackmail, as he requires money, and is never refused. So afraid are the villagers. Movements of Russian Troops. —As per diary of Military Attache. sowars. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General. G. M. Presa, Simla.—No. C-673 P.

In addition the survey for the Oharjui-Khiva line is completed. It is pro posed to continue this line northwards between the Aral and Caspian Seas and to link up with the Russian system. The idea for the construction of this line ori ginated in a proposal to double the Tashkend line. A recent report states that there is no truth in the rumour of new construc tion from Dushakh on the Central Asian line. A short branch used for supplying sand ballast is probably responsible for the rumour. 624. Feeders in the Famine The construction of a net-work of narrow- gauge feeder hues in the Famine Steppe is proposed, to further the development by irrigation. In addition, it is proposed to join the stations of Syrdannskay and Jizak on the Central Asian line by a line of 5' gauge. As the existing distance between these two points is 100 miles by the present railway alignment, and as the proposed line would have a length of 135 miles, the latter will have no significance as shortening the line for military purposes. Waterways. r 625. Close of North Caspian navigation.—Navigation of the Caspian from Astrachan was discontinued at the beginning of December, although the mouth of the Volga was still unfrozen. 626. Registration of water transport. —The Russian authorities have ordered a registration—probably a re-registration—of all country boats plying on the Amu Darya above Charjui. History. 627. Plague measures. —The “ Turkistan News ’ ’ computes the monthly expen diture on troops employed on anti-plague duties at £2,100, plus an initial expen diture of £3.200.■ 2 The Trans-Caspian Gazette of December 8th states that the Trans-Chspian Administration had recommended the opening of the Eusso-Persian frontier, in view of the absence of plague in Khorasan, but advocated the closing of the Russo-Afghan boundary between Maruchak and Puj-i-Khatun (Zulfikar presum ably). The mills of God grind slowly, however, and the open door is not always a safe one, as notices are posted in Persian frontier villages on the principal caravan routes that Persians crossing the frontier will be shot. Eight Russian doctors are reported to have reached Russian Sarakhs towards the end of November. Movements of small parties of Cossacks are reported near Kariz. Each ' .section of Turkomans near Sarakhs has been ordered to furnish six men (one of them mounted) to assist in guarding the frontier. 628. Bokhara. —The Amir of Bokhara passed through Tashkend on the 4th December on his way to Bokhara from Yalta. Recent reports state that all is quiet at the capital, and that the troops recently reported to have been sent there from Kushk have continued their journey towards Tashkend. These were probably time-expired men. 629. Persian pretender .— The gun-boat Ardaghan was ordered to the south east Caspian coast near Khoja Nafas at the end of November. The Trans-Caspian Review connects this movement with rumours of the presence of Salar-ed-Daula at this place. 630. Spy fever .— Two Afghans have been arrested at Kerki on suspicion of being spies. 631. Earthquake shocks.— Szvztq shocks were experienced at Vyerni and slighter ones in Turkistan generally in early December. Ethnography. 632. Closing of Musalman school.—The Caspian states that the new-style Musalman school at Vyerni has been closed by the authorities owing to a refusal to admit a teacher of the Russian language.

Red Crescent Society. —On the 10th January 1913, a meeting was convened by the Karguzar in Sistan to collect subscriptions for the Red Crescent Society. The Deputy Governor took the chair. The sum collected at the meeting was 325 tumans. Further contributions are expected. New Karguzar for Sistan and Koh-Malik-Siah. —The present Karguzar, Ihtisham-i-Humayum, has announced that Mirza Muhammad Ishaq Khan from Rasht is likely to succeed him. Sistan Revenue.- —There is considerable dissatisfaction amongst the Sardars, Kadkhudas and agriculturalists of Sistan against the Belgian Director of Finance and his subordinates, for attempting to collect the arrears of the past two or three years at one season, and making insufficient allowance for injuries to the old crops. The Deputy Governor sympathizes with the revenue-payers, and M. de Weerdt will probably get little assistance from him in a case, which has just occurred at Miankangi, where a Mirza and two or three Revenue Sowars have been beaten by the villagers.'

The Quarantine against Sistan.—Th* British Agent at Turbat informed me that it was intended to examine Lieutenant Fowle, who is travelling from Sista-n tn Meshed, for plague. I informed M. Grigorieff that I considered this showed that the whole question was being used to cover abuses, and I reminded him that he had originally stated that caravans from Sistan would not be affected bv the nnarau- tine. He sent the necessary instructions. ^ Reported Russian Colonisation near Doshakh. —I hear on good authority that the Turkoman in the vicinity of Doshakh are being dispossessed in favour of Molokan settlers. 8 th December. 9th December, A New Belgian Official—A M. Collard has reached Meshed to replace M. Paquet M. Grigorieff on the Turkoman.—M. Grigorieff, who may be playing a deep game, tells me that he is convinced that I am right, and that the Governors of Nardin and Bujnurd arc doing good work in trying to stop the Turkoman raids. He has asked me for details as to route, and the names of the leaders. Juju, the Bandit.—Tha famous Darragaz bandit has been released from a Russian prison, and was met by the Governor’s carriage, and granted an ovation. He will now act as a robber of the Governor, who will take most of the proceeds of his industry. The Return of Prince Dabija.—My colleague is due at Meshed at the end of the month. Captain Wilson expressed the opinion that he could not return on the assurance of the Russian doctors that he was suffering from stone. As a matter of fact, he has been successfully operated on for stone. A Proposed Executive Medical Council. —The Russian doctor proposed at the last meeting of the Consejli Sanitaire that a permanent body should be formed with executive powers. Captain Wilson pointed out that he had no authority to express an opinion on such a question. 10th December, llth December, 12th December. 13th December. 14th December 2. The Military Attaches. —During the course of the week, Major Red! has returned, and Captain Blair has left. He made himself especially popular with the Russian colony. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. — Supposed Plague. —The Karez and Herat Agents deny the existence of any epidemic. The former states that the Russian doctors have found nothing whatever to go.on, and are somewhat perplexed, as they naturally wish to write a report. So far they have not found a corpse to exhume. Last week, at my request, M. Grigorieff telegraphed to Askabad and Tashkent to the effect that I had stated officially that there was no plague in Afghanistan. Major Redl, who has just returned from leave, states that there was much scepticism shown as to the existence of plague in Transcaspia. One way or another I hope that the quarantine will be a thing of the past before the return of my mischievous colleague. Every week I have written a soothing letter to the Governor of Herat, and assured him that I was doing my best in every way to get rid of the quarantine, but that it would take some time.G« M. Pfesi* Simla,—No. 0659 F.

It will be interesting to learn how Captain Blair fares. At my suggestion, a telegram was sent to Tashkent to help him. State of the .Roads—Robberies are reported from near Bajgiran, Russian protec tion being ineffectual. The Turbat Agent reports robberies m every direction.

I was visited by the Deputy Governor, the Karguzar, the Sar- haddar, and other civil and military officers, on the occasion of New Year’s day. 3rd January.-—A. caravan of 150 camels carrying the goods of Ghulam Muham- ma Peshawan (British Indian trader), left Sistan to-day for Biriand and Meshed. The sowars supplied by the Sarhaddar to guard the caravan are temporarily en- gaged men, as it appears that the local cavalry force is hesitating to remain in the eervice on the new rates of pay. The Sarbazes (Infantry), and the Jambazes (Camelry), are satisfied with their new remuneration, and are giving no trouble. 4th January.-—NL. Paquet, accompanied by a younger brother, has reached Birjand, on his way to relieve M. deWeerdt, Director of Customs and Revenue in Sistan. GENERAL.

Grigorieff and the Turkoman. —M, Grigorieff informed me that he had com- 2nd Deoembe*, plained to the Bussian Legation that the Sirdar of Bujnurd had been killing some Turkoman. I said that as the Turkoman were murdering when attacked, I could not understand why the Sirdar should be compla ned of. My colleague was confused, and said that they had been attacked unawares. This all shows how the wind blows, M. Grigorieff and the Administration. —My colleague has drawn up a portentous 3rd D0cemb0f * document, giving some useful information about the province, and making some suggestions. He wishes it to be signed by us both, and sent to Tehran, as a proof of the force of the entente at Meshed, A New Revenue Officer for Sistan, —M, Paquet, who has been here for some time 4th December, and is friendly and obliging, although a lover of red tape, has been appointed to Bistan. A New Chief of Police, —The Munshi Nizam has been dismissed, and the Shuja- 5th Decembw - ul-Eiala appointed. The dismissed men would not work in with M, Leleux. POLITICAL SUMMARY, State of the Province.—Supposed plague, —The Kariz agent reports the arrival of the two Bussian doctors on 28th November. Ee and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon visited them, and the Kariz Bussian doctor acknowledged before them that he had not seen a single case of the epidemic himself, and that he had reported it to be plague because the Persian deetor said it was. The doctors were leaving for Turbat- i-Shaikh Jam, accompanied by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahman. I have informed the Legation and the Government of India both that there has been no plague in Afghanistan, and also that the Governor of Herat is most uneasy at the massing of Bussian troops along the northern frontier and the formation of the two quarantines. I have asked the Minister to help in removing the two quarantines before the return of Prince Dabija. The Russians now have 250 Cossacks along the Perso-Afghan frontier, and hum- dreds of local levies. To show how matters strike the people, a placard, apparently anonymous, has been posted up to the effect that the Russians are sending 7,000 troops to the Afghan frontier via Meshed, and that the populace should not be frightened. The Governor of Herat will hear this, with additions. The Governor-General. —The Neiir-u-Dola came to see me, and I told him that I had to send in a list of the cases settled by him, and should also write what I thought of him. I said that he had settled very few cases, and so would have a bad report. He begged me to wait a few days, and promised to settle up our cases. State of the Roads.—On 3rd December, I was alarmed to receive a report from Meiomei in the Shahrud district, that Mr. Meriton had been seized by Turkoman, and that two of his people had been killed. I immediately wire J to the Governor of Shahrud that the British Government would hold him responsible for pursuing the Turkoman, and rescuing Mr. Meriton. I also wired to the Sirdar of Bujnurd, who immediately sent off orders for a body of sowars to be despatched. A few hours later, I was relieved to learn that Mr. Meriton had reached Meiq- mei in safety. He was sitting by the driver of the wagon, when 15 Turkoman opened! i n fire. The first bullet passed between him and the driver, and the second killed the driver. The Meiomei gholam was also killed. He was stripped to his socks, I but these were given back. It seems hard that Mr. Meriton should be stripped, and nearly killed by Turkoman, whom the Bussian Commissioner at Gunbad-i- Kabus sends out to murder and plunder. Mr. Meriton has probably collected some information on this subject. Mr. Nelson has reached Meiomei, but is asking permission to return to Tehran. The Turbat Agent reports several robberies to the south of Turbat. I am send* ing four Persian sowars to meet Lieutenant Fowle, who is on his way from feistan to Meshed, P. M.

The plans have been approved by the Ministry of Communications and the financial ar rangements are being completed at Petersburg. 606. Feeder Lines in Ferghana.- —The construction in 1913 of a line, 8 miles in length, from Posyetovka to Naukot, on the Sir Darya, and of a line from Melni- kovo to Isfar (26| miles) has been approved. The branch Andijan-Shinabad is reported to be in construction. Waterways. 607. Amu Darya.—W \\q service between Charjui and Petro-Aleksandrovsk ceased, owing to low water, at the beginning of December. Steamers were still running between Charjui and Termez during the last week of November. History. 608. Plague Opera^ows.—According to reports there are now J sotnia Semi- rechya, J sotnia Taman, and 1| sotnias Caucasus Cossacks (total, about 250) on the line Khaf, Karez, and Sarakhs. The Frontier Guard posts from Zulfikar to Maimana have been reinforced by Cossacks and Turkoman. These movements are causing great uneasiness in the Herat district. It is reported, from Russian sources, that a disease resembling plague has broken out in Badakshan. 609. Unrest in Bokhara.—Whe despatch of more troops to Bokhara at the end of November is reported. 610.

Seven hundred and seventy left Skobelef and district about 16th November and six hundred left Termez on 14th and 17th November. Resources. 617. Development of Russo-Afghan trade. — It is proposed to make the pas sage of Russian goods through Bokharan territory easier by the adoption of various measures, including the creation of Russian enclaves at Termez, Kerki, etc. It is also proposed to reduce the duty on cotton imported from Afghanistan and Persia. It has been decided not to establish a Customs post at Serai, in view of the smallness of the trade to be expected. 618. Cattle in Sir Darya Province. —According to official figures, the number of cattle, sheep, etc., in Sir Darya has risen from 5j millions in 1901 to 8,449,468 in 1910. 619.

Five subordinate officers and 100 sowars attempt ed to take sanctuary in this Consulate, on the morning of the 16th instant. The 5 officers, who were allowed to enter the Consulate to represent their grievances, complained that the troops in Sistan had not received any pay for the last six months, and that the order recently telegraphed by the Provincial Director of Customs and Finance to the local Director on the subject, only authorized a certain number of them to be paid at reduced rates, and vetoed the payment of salaries to the others. These officers refused to leave the Consulate, until they had assurances that a satisfactory settlement would be reached, and they accordingly stayed in “ bast ” about 48 hours. I promptly communicated with Monsieur de Weerdt, the local Director of Customs and Finance, who very civilly gave me all the informa tion I asked for, stating that he had for several days been endeavouring to get the Meshed orders modified. On the 18th instant, he was able to tell me that all the soldiers would get their arrears of pay in full, and that the new rates introduced would probably satisfy the smaller number of men, who were being retained. There is no doubt that hitherto, the chief officers of the garrison have been pocketting the pay of a large number of men, who only existed on paper. Birjand News.—The Shaukat-ul-Mulk is said to have become reconciled to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk on the occasion of the latter’s recent marriage, when the Shaukat-ul-Mulk gave his nephew most expensive presents, and entertained him lavishly. It is suggested that this rapprochement may account for the falling off of Baluch raids this autumn. Sarhad News.—With reference to last week’s Diary, the party sent out by Sar- dar Pasand Khan to Khashrud and Janni, to plunder camels, returned to Lutak on the 16th instant with 70 camels they had looted from Afghanistan. With reference to my Diary No. 48 for the week ending the 30th November, it is reported that the Bamri tribe made their submission, and paid up their arrears of revenue, as soon as Sardar Muhammad Beza Khan Kegi joined the Governor, Sardar Said Khan. Sardar Muhammad Beza Khan Begi has returned to the Sarhad. Ychya Khr.n Governor of Dishu and Malakan in Afghanistan, is reported to have killed an Afghan, and to have fled to Sistan; he is now living with Sardar Pasand Kb an. The Political Agent, Chagai, informed the Trade Agent at Kuh-i-Malik Siah by telegram, on the 17th instant, that some hundred camels had been carried ofi by a small party of Sarhaddi thieves from near Amir Chah (north of Mashki Chah), and suggested that the various routes to the Shela should be blocked, and a careful patrol of the Shela bank be made. The Persian camel sowars at Girdi were at once informed, and the Sarhaddar (Rais Qushun) of Sistan, at the request of this Con sulate, sent out a Jambaz to inform Sardars Pasand Khan and Said Khan, and ask them to blockade the various routes over the Shela. The fact that all Persian troops in Sistan were on strike at the time, probably resulted m very feeble mea sures being taken, but no news of the perpetrators of the outrage has reached the Consulate as yet. It is thought in Kuh-i-Malik Siah that the ra-ders were prob ably Baluchis from Afghanistan, who may have escaped, through Bahrain '- ah. t G. M. Pr**, Simla.— No. C-645 F.

They first appeared in Gaud-i- Neh (about 50 miles N.-W. of Neh), then were heard of in the neighbourhood of Khusf, Deh Salm, Sarchah and Ambari, and finally reached Khur (50 miles W. of Birjand), whence they are supposed to have gone off towards Tabas. Sarhad News. —With reference to entries in Diaries Nos. 50 and 51, on the subject of Muhammad Khan Dadshah’s raid into Afghanistan, it is reported that Sardar Pasand Khan was induced at once to return 40 of the stolen camels to their owners, who, fifteen in number and themselves Baluchis, followed up the party to Lutak. The other 30 camels are said to have been presented by Sardar Pasand Khan to Sardars Khudadad Khan and Purdil Khan. The Afghan authorities are believed to have made a protest on the subject to the Deputy Governor of Sistan, as the latter has summoned Muhammad Khan Dadshah to Nasratabad. With reference to the raid of camels near Amin Chah, in the Chagai Poli tical Agency, (referred to in last week’s Diary), the Sarhaddar of Sistan has heard that the perpetrators were Nausherwanis, who have migrated from Mekran or Kharan to Budbar in Afghanistan.

State of Province.—Supposed Outbreak of Plague .—No fresh cases are reported by the Karez Agent, who considers that the whole epidemic is a thing of the past, but that the interpreter of the Russian doctor is anxious to prolong a state of affairs from which much profit accrues to him. The report of the Herat Agent is awaited. I have sent Sub-Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahman, who has experience of plague, to Karez with instructions to report and to visit any cases, which may exist. A Sanitary Council has been started, and it has been decided to start a quaran tine post at Fariman on the Herat road. The Russian doctors have reached Meshed.

Ten families recently crossed over the frontier. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province.—Supposed Plague. —The Karez Agent reports that the dis trict is free of the epidemic, and jmy colleague corroborates this report. At the same time the Russian papers are full of rumours of plague at Ak Robat, east of Zulfikar. In this district hundreds of cases are supposed to have occurred. Police notices have also been issued, warning travellers not to go to plague-stricken Meshed. In fact, as before, the Russians have lost their heads. As I pointed out to M. Grigorieff, the Herat Agent would have reported even one or two cases, but in the last report he makes no mention of any epidemic. Meanwhile, the quarantine cordon is being drawn more tightly, and the people of the district have petitioned that as there is no plague it is useless to harass them. State of Roads. —A new robber has appeared on the Khorasan stage. He is termed Jahangir, and has robbed a post near Sabzawar.^ He then seized the garrison at Miqndasht, and stripped the sowars of their rifles and clothing. He is now established in this strong caravanserai. Seiid Hasan has seized and stripped a body of the Gendarmes organised by the Treasury near Turbat.

Russian Troops at Astrabad.—Tte Russian troops have left Kara Su, and 25 th November, returned to the Ark at Astrabad. Arrival of a Belgian Architect. —M. Leleux brought a certain M. Gyselinx 26th November, call. He is appointed as architect to Khorasan. The appointment would appear not to be urgently required. The Turkoman Raids and M. Leleux. —I have given M. Leleux details of the 27lth November. Turkoman raids, and have pointed out to him that by giving a machine-gun to the Sirdar of Bujnurd, and a second one to the Governor of Nardin, these raids could be stopped. He will, I think, take action in the sense desired. The Salar-ud-Dola. — Muhammad Riza Khan Afshar, who is a follower of the 28th November. Salar-ud-Dola, has written to the heads of the Turkoman, inviting them to join the Salar-ud-Dola, who is at Khoja Nafas, awaiting the arrival of the ex-Shah. The Sirdar of Bujnurd has telegraphed this information to Tehran. Russian Action in the Panjdeh District. — The Herat Agent reports that the 29th November. Russians are busy registering horses, camels and wagons in the Panjdeh district. They have also seized all arms belonging to the Turkoman. POLITICAL SUMMARY. Supposed Plague.' —At a meeting of the Conseil Sanitaire on 23rd November, a report was read by the Russian doctors to the effect that 15,000 members of one tribe alone had been carried off by plague in the vicinity of Herat. Other / ' details were equally lurid. On 28th November I received a report from Herat, and a letter from the Governor of Herat, to the effect that there neither was nor had been any epidemic of any description in the province. He added that, to make quite sure, he had sent letters to each district. I immediately informed M. Grigorieff and M. Leleux and suggested to the former that we should approach our Legations with the proposal that the quarantine should be abolished. I would add that both the Agent and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon report from Karez that there has been no case of the epidemic for 26 days. Even the Russian newspapers point out that all merchants deny the existence of any epidemic, whereas the official reports are very serious, and all pilgrims are being stopped at Baku. I am informing the Governor of Herat of the steps I am taking for the aboli tion of the quarantine, as he has sent an Urgent messenger to Kabul, asking for permission to despatch troops to the two frontiers. The Herat Agent reports that the Russians have sent a large force to the Afghan-Russian frontier, and have closed every route, except that by Bala Mur- ghab. They have notified the Afghan authorities to this _ effect, and have informed them that any one crossing the frontier will be punished with prison for three years. The Russian doctors with the incapacity, which so habitually characterises the Russians, have gone to Turbat-i-Heideri, and have summoned the Russian doctor to that town, which is due south of Meshed, and must not be contused with Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, which is near the scene of the late epidemic. State of Roads.—The Askabad post was held up by Ishak Kurd, a few miles from Bajguiran. He took out some parcels, but did not touch the letters.9m mmmmrnmmmmm * Jaliangir at Miandasht is levying blackmail from all passers-by at Miandaskt. Mr. Nelson of the Imperial Bank is still at Shahrud, as the authorities there will not give him an escort. I have arranged for him to be met at Alhak, where the Khorasan province commences. Movements of Russian Troops. —I hear from Bujnurd that a Russian officer with eleven Cossacks recently visited Bujnurd, and then proceeded to Jajarm and Shahrud. I should not be surprised if this party has been sent to inquire about my movements. The Russians generally pay me a compliment of this sort, in which connection my shikar camps of 1908 were all visited from Gunbad-i- Kabus, a month after my journey. As this party is accompanied by an inter preter, there is little doubt as to their task. Fifteen Cossacks reached Turbat-i-Heideri on 15th November, and 40 Cossacks on 24th November. The latter are being sent to the Afghan frontier. P. M.

There is a vague report of some disagreement between the Amir of Bokhara and the Russian authorities. 593. Plague Operations. —The civil authorities in Trans-Caspia are authorised to indent for troops if they require them to maintain the quarantine line on the closed portion of the Russo-Afghan frontier. All reports, except those from Russian sources, state that there is no plague in Afghanistan. 594. Brigandage in North Eastern Persia. —During October the Chief of Buj- nurd inflicted a severe defeat on a Turkoman raiding party, near Nardin, but brigandage is again rife in the neighbourhood of Shahrud. Miandasht, on the Meshed-Tehran road, has been seized and is still occupied by brigands. Nu merous, robberies are reported from the Turbat-i-Haideri district. On 24th Nov ember, the post was robbed close to Bajgiran, on the Meshed-Askhabad road.

The Sarhaddar (Rais Qushun) and the Troops .—(See Diary No. 44 for the week ending 2nd November.) The Deputy-Governor has informed me that the Sowars and Sarbazes of the Sistan garrison have received no pay for nine months. They are ordinarily paid out of the revenues locally collected, but the present Directer of Finance (Monsieur de Weerdt) has never paid them anything. In consequence of the men’s troublesome attitude some weeks ago, a quantity of grain, equivalent approximately to three months’ pay, was issued to them by the Director on the per sonal security of the Deputy-Governor. The men are now again worrying their commander, the Sarhaddar, very much. From Monsieur de Weerdt I understand that the above story is true. He has several times telegraphed to his superior officer at Meshed on the subject, but has never received any orders from him for the pay ment of the troops. Birjand Revenue Officials.—(See Diaries Nos. 47 and 48 for the weeks ending 23rd and 30th November 1912.) On the night of the 6th instant a number of Revenue Sowars (natives of Tun) ran riot in the town after a drinking debauch. They assaulted a servant of the Governor, fired on two of Mr. Howson’s men, who went to the rescue, and also fired at a shoemaker, who was accompanied by his wife and children. Mr. Howson and his*guest, Lieutenant Fowle, Indian Army, went round immediately, after personally ascertaining that some of the revellers were still drinking inside the Revenue Office, to the house of the Director, Mirza Abdul Karim Khan, to inform him of the affair, but they were refused admittance, nor did the Mirza on the following day make any attempt to communicate with Mr. Howson. An enquiry was commenced by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk on the following day, in the presence of the heads of the Telegraph, Posts, Military and Judicial Departments, and the Naib Karguzar. The Customs and Revenue Director did not attend, but he applied to the gentlemen in charge of the Russian Bank and Hospitals for permission to take refuge under their flag. He was told, after a reference had been made to the Russian Consul in Sistan, who promptly com municated with me on the subject, that he should, if in any danger, apply to the British representative for protection, but he has not done so. [Note. —Since the close of the week, I have learnt that the trial lasted two days, and that two of the Sowars were duly convicted of being drunk and riotous, and sentenced to 40 and 80 stripes, respectively. Their chief was also convicted and sentenced to dismissal from the service, hut was afterwards pardoned, apparently at the instance of Mr. Howson. All the gentlemen abovenamed, as Assessors, signed the judgment, as did also Mirza Ali Asghar Khan on behalf of the Director of Revenue.] Sarhad News.—Some Ismailzai tribesmen, who recently proceeded from Dehaneh Baghi to Bam and Narmashir to purchase wheat, were recognised at Fahreh, as being in possession of stolen camels. The country people seized them and took them before the Governor of Bam, who confiscated the camels and other property and imprisoned one of the men. The Ismailzais, then, while returning homewards, looted some cows, a report of which outrage reached the Governor of Bam before they got beyond his reach. They were pursued by Sowars, who are said to have killed eight of the Baluchis. Roads. —A traveller from Kirman to Sistan has been looted at Hauzdar by robbers, who are reported to have taken from him 100 Tomans in cash, and 10 or 15 pieces of longcloth. Perso-Afghan Boundary.—It is reported that the son of Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, Governor of Bandar Kamal Khan, accompanied by 30 jambazes, is inspecting the boundary pillars between Robat and Band-i-Sistan. He was close to the Shela River on the 3rd ^December.Sistan Consular Diary of Major F. B.

He had arrived in Birjand on the 27th November, his departure being delayed by the lameness of his camels. General. ' The Sarhaddar (Rais Qushun) and the troops.— See Diary No. 49 for the week ending the 7th December 1912. No orders have yet been received by the Direc tor of Finance about the pay of the troops. The patience of the sowars and sarbazes seems to be nearly exhausted. Monsieur de Weerdt has sent another urgent telegram to Meshed on the subject. i • Sarhad News. 1 (a) With reference to Diary No. 48 for the week ending the 30th November 1912^, in which mention was made of a raid by Bahich Khan, brother of Sardar Jehu Khan Ismailzai, on a caravan at Zardali, it is reported that Sardars Muham mad Reza Khan Regi and Jehind Khan have protested to Sardar Jehil Khan that this action was contrary to the terms of the agreement, made between the Sarhad Sardars and Sardar Khudadad Khan, in which they had promised hence forth not to molest caravans proceeding to or from Neh (vide Diaries Nos. 21-30 of 1912.) (b) It is understood that Sardar Pasand Khan Brahui has sent Muhammad Khan Dadshah with seven other Baluchis (four mounted on horses and the remainder on camels) to Khashrud and Janni, near Farah, in Afghanistan, to raid camels from those places. These men left Lutak on the 9th instant. They said there that the Afghans of those places had carried off their camels. Birjand Revenue officials.— With reference to Diary No. 49 for the week ending 7th December 1912, Mr. Howson reports that Mirza Abdul Karim has called on him, and denied having asked the gentlemen m charge of the Russian Bank and Hospital for permission to take refuge under their flag. i G.

Khiva Railway. —It is reported that the line has been pegged out as far as the Daweh-i-Bughaz, a gorge on the Oxus about half-way between Charjui and Petro-Aleksandrovsk. Iron material has been collected there for a bridge, the con struction of which is expected to commence as soon as the water falls. 557. Semirechya Railway. —A report from Aris states that earth-work is ex pected to be begun in the spring of 1913, and that the line will pass north of Chim kent, with a branch to that place. The “ Semirechya Railway Company ” has opened temporary offices in St« Petersburg. 558. Traffic Arrangements on the TashJcend Railway. —On the section Orenburg- Ak Tyube, the Vershinin electric staff system is in use. Information of the despatch of trains is given by telephone. The serious collision in September 1910 near Ma/achnaya was due to the telephones being out of order and to neglect of the traffic regulations. All passing-places on the Tashkend railway were opened from 28th - October, in order to deal with the cotton traffic. Roadsi 559. The Pamirs. —A pack road, capable of conversion to a road practicable for wheeled transport, has been built from Khorpa to Darwaz. It follows the mountainous valley of the Panja. The “ Pamir Gold Company ” has offered to undertake the improvement of the road from Ferghana to the Pamirs, on condition that its concession is extended. Ethnography. 560. Aral Sea District. —There are now 6,000 Russians settled at Aralskoye village and along the eastern shore of the Aral Sea, History, 561. Termez.—About 12th October the Russians prepared to throw the floating bridge across the Oxus at a point near Termez, but the operation was abandoned owing to telegraphic orders from St. Petersburg. According to one account, some bridging material was placed on the Afghan bank and representations made that the bridge was only a temporary structure, which would be of use to the Afghans as well. According to this account bridging operations ceased under the pressure of Afghan threats. 562. Plague Operations. —Thirteen Semirechya Cossacks left Meshed for Khaf on 11th November. The line of plague posts extends from Sangun (14 miles S.-S.-E. of Khaf) via Karez to the Hari Rud, in the Vicinity of Pul-i-Khatuun. Caravans from Afghanistan are not allowed to cross this line. The three Russian doctors have reached Meshed. Military. 563. Appointment. —^Lieutenant-Colonel Yuzbashinski (see;Diary 41, paragraph 525), supernumerary Lieutenant-Colonel 18th Turkistan.

The men serve on a silahdar basis, bringing their own^horses and providing their own food and forage. They receive 30 roubles (equal to about 47 rupees) a month. [Note by Military Attache. —Rates for food and forage are higher in Trans- Caspia than in India.] 565. Movements of Troops. —The Russian troops in camp at Kara Su have returned to Asterabad. A portion of the garrison of Kerki is reported to have moved out to Bosagha (a village on the left bank of the Oxus, close to the Russo-Afghan frontier). 566. Reservists. —Dour hundred reservists are training at Merv and 70 at Krasnovodsk. A few have also joined at Askhabad and at Kerki. 567. Transport. —Orders have been issued to measure all country boats working on the Oxus and to ascertain how long they require to reach Termez from Charjui. [Note by Military Attache.—Sincz the visit of the Minister for War great activi ty has been shown in registering all means of transport in Turkistan this year]. 568. Proposed Pamir Militia. —A proposal is on foot to form a native militia for service dn the Pamirs and to withdraw the Russian detachments. 569. Training. —General Samsonof attended manoeuvres and field-firing carried out by the Kushk garrison on 14th and 15th October. In his official report he points out that during the attack, the timing was bad and portions of the attack ing force was thus exposed to defeat in detail. The storming of fortifications by means of scaling ladders and a raft thrown on the water filling the ditch was well executed and showed that the technical training of the engineers, a company of the 2nd Turkistan Sappers, is good. Such exercises have a valuable moral effect, as they demonstrate to the troops that, with determination and good training, the most formidable fortifications can be taken. The inspection in physical training revealed a tendency to train a few specialists in each unit and to neglect the deve lopment of the mass of the men. Resources. 570. Export of Cotton. —The export of cotton fibre during 1912 is estimated at 213,000 tons from Turkistan and 16,000 tons from North Persia. 571. Saksaul. —During the winter of 1911-12 the railways carried 140,000 tons of this fuel, which is largely consumed in Turkistan. 572.

Prideaux, C.I.E. —I reached the capital of Sistan with 26th November. Mrs. Prideaux at 10 a.m., to-day. The customary ‘ Istiqbal ’ reception was paid me in which representatives of the Deputy-Governor, the Karguzar, the Sarhaddar and the Director of Customs and Finance came out, about half-a-mile from the town, accompanied by many lesser Persian officials to escort me to a tent pitched outside the City, in which tea and other refreshments were provided by the Deputy- Governor, and from there, after an interval, to the Consulate.

The Russian Consul returned my official visit to-day. 29th November, GENERAL. Unrest in Birjand.—(Vide last week’s diary).—Mr. Howson reports that on the 25th November, a large crowd of Birjandis, including practically all the merchants, and men of position in the town, collected at the Telegraph Office, and clamoured for a reply to the telegram, which they had recently sent to the Cabinet. They objected to pay their revenue until such time as they were granted security from Baluch, and other robber bands. The crowd afterwards peacefully marched to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s village, and asked him to do something for them. The merchants pointed out that their trade was being interfered with by Baluchis in the South, and by robber bands in the North. They were law-abiding people and would pay the Revenue if Government would grant them security. The Shaukat dismissed them after promising to telegraph to Tehran, and requested the Director of Revenue not to press for payment till the Persian Government replied to their petition. The Alghoris have returned to their homes, leaving a few men to receive a reply to their telegraphic complaint. Sarhad News. —Sardar Saiyid Khan, headman of the Narui tribe at Bampur, has written to Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan Regi, Kadkhuda Jehil Khan of the Ismailzai tribe and Sardar Jehind Khan Ahmadzai, asking them to join him with their followers, in the punishment of the Bamrai tribe and in an attack on Nawab Khan. Kadkhuda Jehil Khan and Sardar Jehind Khan have refused to go, but Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan Regi is said to have collected from 600 to 1,000 men and to have started for Bampur about 18th November 1912. Two small caravans have been looted by Afghans in the vicinity of Daroh. Baluch Khan, brother of Sardar Jehil Khan (Ismailz^i), with ten Baluchis, has plundered a caravan of some Persian traders at Zardali on the Neh-Bandan road, capturing 85 camels without loads, and taking them off to Sarhad. Two donkeymen of Sikwali, who were returning from Sarhad, have been looted near Dazdali by Ismailzai Baluchis. They reported the matter to the Customs Mirza at Kuh-i-Malik-Siah, who instructed them to report the matter to Sardar Khudadad Khan. Roads. —With reference to Captain TIunter’s Diary No. 47, dated the 23rd November 1912, it is believed that the Khunik robbery was committed by the Afghans, whose opium was confiscated some months ago by the Revenue officials. .

Meanwhile, his son is thinking of going to Herat to join other members of the tribe who have been well received by the Afghan authorities. A New Russian Frontier Post.—The Russians have informed the Afghan frontier officials that they are constructing a new Post at Chashma Selim between Jangurak—apparently the Changurak of the map and Chashma Tarbar. An Opium Case.—N female spy of the Opium Department was recently set on and killed by some Persian and Russian subjects in Meshed. Ninety man of opium were found in the house. • M. Leleux and the Manager of the Imperial Bank. —Mr. Eldrid recently engaged a house for the use of his accountant. The contract was duly signed and the transaction was completed. M. Leleux apparently wanted the house for an em ploye and, as its owner was an official of the Revenue, he compelled him to make a “ gale ” of the house to another member of the staff. He then wrote that Mr. Eldrid could not have the house. In order to avoid friction with this crooked individual, I have asked M. Grigorieff to give him a hint on the matter. In any case the rights of the Bank must be protected. The Russian Commandant.—Colonel Drozdovski, the new Commandant is 30th October, an officer of the Guards and speaks a little French. He appears to be most friendly. He was with Kuropatkin throughout the war and considers him a splendid lighting general but too fond of the firing line and too kind-hearted. He thinks him un fitted to direct large operations from the rear. Of Linievitch he states that he too was over fond of the firing line and that his boots had to be hidden away to keep him at headquarters. Aniline Dye Case—An agent of a British firm has petitioned me to the effect that the Customs were claiming that all carpets were to pay duty as containing aniline dye, whereas his had none. I spoke to my colleague on the subject who said that the Russian Legation had informed him that the new rule would be re pealed. Meanwhile, he was not to allow his subjects to pay. The Case of Baidulla Jan.-The Agents of this Afghan merchant, who em- bezzled his money and escaped to Tehran, were sent to Meshed by the gydoffices of the Legation. The Governor of Herat has written that he is sending Baidu Jan to Meshed to settle the case. The Governor of Herat and the Gemral.-The. Amir has decided in favour of the Governor, who complained that the General was interfering in civil affairs. Ihe latter has been warned to desist from such meddling in future. , Political Summary. State of Province.—The supposed outbreak of Plague.— colleague called on SoToctoter and informed me that the Russian Frontier had been closed from Zorabad, opposite Zulfiiar Pass, to Kara Tikan, near the Gurgan Defile .that four Russian doctors had been despatched from Tas en , a a , , , r, ’ would be woof froWbited? Twenty-five Cossacks Cossacks have been sent to Zorabad. The idea is to surround the district, but I 31st October, 1st November, 2nd November, 28 DEC 1 SI 2 \hear from the Karez Agent that all the nomads, among whom the disease broke out, have already fled and taken up their temporary abode in the Hashtadan Plain. The Karez Agent reports that the report of plague at • Karez was fabricated by. ■ the Mirza of the Russian doctor and that his informant was the Mirza of the Russian 1 ' cwnmandant. He also states that only the families of the Gaudam section of the aCuri which ate the poisoned camel, have died. I thought of sending our only Sub-Assistant Surgeon to Karez, but he is ill just now. v.intp nf the Roads.—The Sirdar of Bujnurd has reported that he has killed and captured one hundred Turkoman and recovered 12,000 sheep and 1,000 cattle. He has asked for a fresh supply of cartridges, etc. The Turbat district is in a very bad way as the Governor is apparently in league with the robbers. Muhammad, the brigand, is apparently about to be placed in charge of the Mesked-Nishapur road. The people have petitioned that the sowars who pursue him are worse than he is himself. Movements of Russian Troops.-My colleague informed me that two sotnias ’ of Cossacks were ready to march into Khorasan to take the place of two sotnias, who would be sent to the infected area. Other movements are given in connection with the plague campaign. P. M.

I Russian Survey Operations.—Parties are being sent from Askabad to survey the frontier districts of Darra Gaz, Kuchan and Bujnurd. Daud Khan, son of the head of the Magazine, is being sent to assist them. The Case of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk .—Please refer to summary, Meshed diary No. 33, and to Sistan diary No. 36. I hear that the Agent of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk has been given two horses by the Governor of Herat. I would remark that the Shaukat would not be likely to acknowledge his action, and also that, by inform ing him of the report, our sources of information at Herat may dry up. It is not the first time that he has intrigued with the Afghan authorities. Death of the Muavin-u-Tujjar .—The notorious Muavin-u-Tujjar died last night. Originallyji Herati, he and his two brothers were protected by this Consulate. Lately they threw in their lot with Russia and intrigued in favour of the ex-Shah. The Murder of the Ismailis .—The Muin-ul-Ghuraba, who was exiled for his leading share in the murder of two Ismailis three years ago, has been permitted to return to Meshed. 3rd November. 4th November. 5th November. 6th November. The Rais-u-Tujjar .—The Rais-u-Tujjar, who left Meshed seven years ago as 7 th November a member of the 1st parliament, has recently returned. He told the Attache that °’ em 9r ’ he was bound to bribe the Russians as otherwise his interests would suffer, as the Persian authorities only took the money and did nothing. Arrival of Mr. Merriton. —Mr. Merriton, the Telegraph Inspector, has reach- sth November, ed Meshed from Tehran. He had much difficulty in avoiding the Turkoman. He states that it is a matter of common knowledge that these raids are inspired by the Russian Commissioner at Gunbai-i-Kabus. The Sons of Sirdar Isa Khan .—The Herat Agent reports that the Amir is per- gth November mitting the sons of Sirdar Isa Khan to return to Kabul. They petitioned him that they^were in great poverty in Russian Turkestan. 2 3 4 5 2. A Persian Comedy .—Some days ago, a number of police officials took sanc tuary at the Revenue Office. M. Leleux demanded an inquiry into the charges made by them against the Chief of Police, but the Governor-General would do nothing. He applied to us and we induced the Governor-General to have the case tried in open court. On the appointed day the judge, who arrived two hours late, said that he had appointed a Councillor to represent the bastis. This individual began a long harangue, which showed that he knew nothing of the case. Upon this the bastis asked to be heard, but the Judge said that if they spoke he would close the case. Upon this the bastis asked for what purpose they had been summoned. The reply of the Judge was that he did not know. As the bastis persisted in being allowed to be heard, the Judge pronounced that his dignity had been attacked and that the case was at an end ! As M. Grigorieff and I have intervened in the matter, we cannot allow M. Leleux to be made a fool of in this manner and we are sending the two Attaches to protest against the comedy and to demand a proper hearing. However, I hear that the Governor-General again wishes to resign. 3. Attack on a Postal Sowar near Herat.— The Governor of Herat has paid com- pensation, both for loss of rifle and for damages done to the sowar who has le- covered. The assailants have not been caught. 4. M. Leleux and the Bank Manager .—Please refer to entry of 29 th October. I M. Leleux, thanks to the good offices of M. Grigorieff, has agreed to withdraw from this case. 5. Prince Dafo/a.—Yesterday the members of the Russian colony were more cheerful as they had heard that there was hope that Prince Dabija would not return.'If he does, the entente and good relations, which exist all round, will cease until he leaves Meshed. The Russians are far more hostile to him than 1 have ever agarn i been’. POLITICAL SUMMARY. Supposed Plague Outbreak.—The Karez Agent reports that there are no fresh cases and that the epidemic is at an end. He, however, states that the Russian interpreter has informed him that it exists near Herat. As the Herat Agent men tions nothing of the kind, it seems to be most improbable. The Russian doctor has stopped the quarantine which he had instituted between the Russian cantonment and the village. He is enlisting 700 sowars and 100 footmen at 10 tomans and 6 tomans, respectively, to form a cordon along the Afghan frontier. All caravans are being stopped. As the Russians are damaging their own trade, I am only watching for the time being. The Russian doctors are due to reach Meshed in a day or two, and it is probable that the quarantine will be kept up for some time. After all it is the Persian Government which pays and there must be rich pickings. The Persian post at Fariman is taking money from all caravans which pass. In other words, the whole quarantine as run by Persian sowars will be a farce. However, it may allay Russian nervousness. State of Roads .—Much as usual. Movements of Russian Troops. —Fifty-seven Semirechia Cossacks reached Meshed with 35 wagons containing ammunition and stores. Twenty-five Cossacks from Khaf have reached Karez. They have a machine- gun with the party. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General. G. M.

Disappearance of lakes. —The chain of lakes (Urumbi, Chibintoi, Stant- sionnoye, and Okh-Mankul) ordinarily fed by over-flow water from the Sir Darya is disappearing. Great distress is being caused to the fishing villages on their banks. 544. Attack on postal sowar. — The Governor of Herat has paid compensation General, near Herat. {See Diary 35, paragraph 438). 545. Plague operations. —According to Russian information, not confirmed from other sources, plague has broken out to the north of Herat. There is now declared to be no plague in Persian territory. The Governor-General of Turkistan has allotted £ 1,000 for precautionary measures in Trans-Caspia. Seventy Cossacks are on plague duty at Turbat-i-Haideri and Khaf. It is proposed to employ 700 Persians in addition. Three Russian doctors, including a bacteriologist, are expected to arrive at Meshed within the next few days. 546. Disaffection among Russian troops. —The troops in garrison at Tashkend and the 17th Turkistan Rifles at Askhabad are reported to be in a disaffected state. Regulations strengthening the control of the authorities over the Press have been published in the Trans-Caspian province. 547. Appointment. —Lieutenant-Colonel Vigornitski has been appointed Russian Military Attache in Sistan. He was expected to leave Tashkend in the beginning of November. {Note by Military Attache. —The last holder of the appointment was a Staff Captain, who is now employed on the staff of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps). 548. Reservists. —Three hundred reservists are under training at Skobelef and an unknown number at Kushk. 549. Russian reconnaissances. —Preparations are being made for the des patch from Askhabad of a party to carry out surveys in the Daragaz, Kuchan, and Bujnurd districts. A Persian Official from Meshed will accompany the party. Colonel Tetruyef has arrived at Meshed.

Communications. Waterways. Geography. History. in the case of the attack on a postal sowar of His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate- Military.2 — T li;I! 'Hf; , ' v 550 Meshed garrison.— On 7th November, twenty-three hired foutgons, seven two-wheeled transport carts, four ammunition carts, and one kitchen cart, escorted by 57 Semirechya Cossacks, arrived at Meshed. They brought 115 boxes of rifle and 40 of maxim ammunition, 115 rifles (as L a reserve), medical and veterinary stores and equipment for regimental workshops. 551. Movement of troops.— The troops sent to Termez for manoeuvres in September commenced returning to Kerki, their permanent station, on 10th October. Twelve Taman Cossacks, said to be the relief for the Consular escort in Sistan, left Meshed on 6th November. 552. Equipment. —Infantry regiments at Tashkend have been equipped with a new pattern of two-wheeled transport cart, at the rate of four per company. New tents and uniform have also been issued and equipment at that station generally overhauled and completed, where found deficient. I Resources. 553. Horse-breeding in Turhistan. —It is proposed to establish a stud-farm in the Osh district (Fergana). A farm with 100 stallions has been opened in the Sir Darya province, and Captain Pyanovski is enlarging his stud-farm near Prejvalsk (Semirechya). 554. Number of camels available in Bokhara. —It is estimated that the cons truction of the Oxus railway (Bokhara-Kerki-Termez) would throw out of em ployment 60,000 camels, now used to carry goods to various stations of the Central Asian railway. 555.

The Katkhuda of this village is also Katkhuda of Aliabad The Director has now given half of Aliabad to S. Abbas Khan. The result is that the Katkhuda cannot fulfil the contract he made with Mohamed Ali and Brothers and the firm will suffer loss in consequence. I see no reason for the changes made by the Director, and can only attribute them to intrigue on the part of his subordinates. The firm s contract with the Katkhuda was made before the charge of the revenue was given to the Director of Customs, and the contract was officially approved by the Karguzar and countersigned by the Consul.

In the course of conversation, he mentShe wfsanxfousll W Sis^ ' ' Nmember - A few days ago, I heard a rumour that he was leaving Sistan shortly and that his successor, the Nazm-ed-Dowleh was already on his road here from Tehran. It is to be hoped the present man is being transferred from here. He is a man w ose a bits, I believe, are not of the best; he is undoubtedly anti-foreign and he has tried to be obstructive to us on various occasions. He has settled only a few of our minor cases and recently has been doing his best to put Ze Deputy Governor, Sirteep Muhammad Reza Khan, against us. P ^^ Birjand Revenue Officials. -Mv. Howson informs me that some ' ty People from Alghor have come into Birjand to protest against the treatment hey have been subjected to by the revenue officials. It appears that these officials have been taking money under false pretences from the Alghoris, entering their harems, and that they raped an Alghon woman. I understand that some of the men employed by the new Director of Revenue, Birjand, used to be robbers, while the rest are the scum of Birjand. From what I hear the Director is a man of low origin and an intriguer. Petition jor protection of Kainat from Balueh Raiders.-k long petition, sealed by most of the chief Mullahs, traders etc., of Birjand, has been sent to Tehran praying that the necessary steps should be taken to protect the province from tfaluchi raiders, and pointing out the poverty-stricken condition of the south of tne provinces, winch has resulted from recent raids.

Supposed Spies. —The Afghan frontier officials at Dahana Zulfikar have seized 20th October, a man, who has Russian letters with him, and is supposed to be a Russian spy. He has been sent to Herat. On the other side of the frontier, an Afghan, dealing in pistachio nuts, has been seized at Tashkent, and imprisoned as being an Afghan spy. The Nishapur Bank Case. —I am pressing the Governor-General and Karguzar 2ist October, to finish this important case. The first large instalment was duly paid, but the late Karguzar took a bribe of 400 tomans, and delayed payment of the second instal ment. As I have proved this fact, I am shaming the Persian authorities into activity. The Russian Attache. — Mirza Abdul Hamid, who was a poor clerk in the Im- 22nd October, perial Bank of Persia, two years ago, has just bought a property, valued at 12,000 tomans. The Return of Prince Dabija. —I am informed that Prince Dabija has recovered, 24;th 0ctober * and intends to return to Meshed. M. Grigorieff tells me that the Governor- General of Turkistan is making great efforts to prevent his return. Return of Leading Agitator. —Aga Mirza Ibrahim, one of the leading agitators, 25th Octol3er - has been allowed to return to Meshed. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —M. Grigorieff informed me that he had heard from the’ doc tor at Karez, who had been sent to the infected area, that the malady resembled plague, and that there was only one case left. The Governor-General told me that the Persian Aesculapius, who had been deputed, had frankly said that he would con fine his activity to collecting local opinion. Acting on these reports, M. Grigorieff convened a meeting at which this Consulate was represented by Captain Wilson, and it was agreed to take precautionary measures. These consist in sending 100 Cos sacks and 100 Persian sowars to isolate the area under the Russian doctor at Karez. The Conseil Sanitaire has been asked to send a European doctor from Tehran to take charge of the arrangements, and funds have been demanded from the Persian Government. I have often reported how alarmed Russians become when there is a rumour of plague, and M. Grigorieff is fully justified in taking energetic precau tionary measures. I am informing the Governor of Herat, as the infected w area is between Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and the Hari Rud. Captain Wilson considers that it is extremely unlikely that the epidemic is plague. This week M. Grigorieff and I have been inquiring into the state of affairs, and M. Leleux has prepared a statement, which he read to us. We are preparing a collective report, which will, we hope, be useful to the two Legations. Mean while, we have sent a collective telegram to help the Governor-General. It appears that M. Leleux is making some progress, but that the Commander-in-Chief is using all his energy to embezzle money. The sanitation of the Ark quarter has certainly improved. State of Roads, and Leading Brigands.Aw Khan is still at Meshed. He has offered the Governor-General 1,000 tomans, as his share in the plunder he Las col lected, but the Prince is holding out for a larger sum. It is facts such as these, which make the independence of Persia impossible to maintain. Muhammad was dealing with the Governor-General for pardon, but the nego tiations have broken down, probably owing to the greediness of the Prince. Muham mad is now near Kadamgah, and his brave pursuers keep a respectful distance from him. This utter and habitual cowardice is also bringing Persia to her end. 11 &lt;G. M.

Native Affairs in Trans-Caspia. —Representatives of the native popu lation assemble annually at Ashkabad for three weeks or a month for the discussion of questions affecting native interests, the settlement of tribal disputes, etc. A Russian official acts as President; in recent years he has been assisted by Lieutenant- Colonel Yuzbashinski, 18th Turkistan Rifles, a Sunni Muhammadan (Tartar) of the Caucasus, who has a good knowledge of Turki, of Muhammandan law, and of Turkoman and Kirghiz customs. The mullahs still oppose the opening of schools in which Russian is taught to native children. History. 526. Reported outbreak of plague. —The Russian doctor sent to Turbat-i- Sheikh-Jam has reported the presence of plague, said to have been brought from Afghanistan, in certain villages. A Plague Committee is being formed at Meshed, and Cossacks and Persian troops are to be sent to isolate the infected villages. Military. 527. Appointment. —Lieutenant-General Vakhlovski, from the Artillery School, is appointed to command the artillery of the Turkistan Military District vice Lieutenant-General Skorobogatov, placed on the retired list. 528. Non-Russian officers. —Colonel Yuzbashinski [see paragraph 525 above) estimates that there are from 12 to 15 Muhammadan officers in the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps and about 20 more serving in the Caufcasus Military District. Of these, 3 or 4 are Turkoman and the majority of the remainder Caucasian Muhammadans (Tartars, Lesghians, etc.). Considerable feeling still exists in the Caucasus against a Muhammadan receiving a Russian education and entering Russian Government service. This feeling is due, in part, to racial and poli tical dislike of the Russians and, in part, to a fear, sometimes justified by events, that a man who takes Government employment will eventually become Christian. Muhammadan Officers of the Russian Army pass through the Military schools and cadet corps in the ordinary way and are in all respects on an equality with their Russian comrades. They usually adopt Russian manners of life, while retaining their religion. The number of Armenian officers in Turkistan regiments also appears to be considerable. The Colonel commanding the 18th Turkistan Rifles and the staff officers of the Merv (4th Turkistan Rifles) Brigade are of this race. hi528-A. The Turkoman Mounted Division—This unit consists of 2 satmas. Head quarters and one sotnia are at Kashi (the western suburb of Ashkabad) and the other sotnia at Gunbad-i-Kabus. The divisioms a Colonel s or Lieutenant- Colonel’s command. The officers are Russian, with the exception o wo Turko man officers who have passed through a Russian Military fechool. The men are volunteers. They enlist for one year, with optional extensions of 3 years at a time. Men who have served 10 years in the Division are exempted from taxes. In summer a cotton khaki jacket, similar to that of the Semirechya Cossacks, is worn: in winter the national long coat. A trooper must learn Russian to qualify for promotion to Non-Commissioned officer. Russian officers of the Division are not required to learn Turki, although most of them can talk it. They speak highly of the men, who, they say, are fine natural riders and easier to discipline than Cossacks. A proposal to increase the Division to a 6 sotnia regiment has, however, been negatived on political grounds. \Note hy Military Attache. —There must be some hundreds of ex-troopers resident in Trans-Caspia. It is not known if it is intended to expand the Division on mobihsation by em bodying these men.] 529. Meshed Garrison. —Twenty-six men are at present sick in hospital. No small-pox cases. Two horses have died and 43 are sick. Resources. 530. Resources of Bokhara. —It is calculated that the region to be tapped by the projected Oxus Railway (presumably the district of Kashi and southern Bokhara as far east as Termez are meant) contains a population of 3,200,000 and 15,378,000 head of cattle, sheep, etc. Three milhon acres are irrigated : 900,000 more could be cultivated in this way and another 13 million acres cultivated without irrigation.

Return of Consul General from Tour. —I returned to Meshed on 5th October, after an interesting tour. Relations between Prince Dabija and the Russian General. —Captain Blair, who has recently returned from a short tour in Transcaspia, was informed by officers lately at Meshed that relations were so strained between the Civil and Military that all social relations were suspended by order of the General. If this helps to prevent the return of Prince Dabija, I shall be very glad. The Boot Trade. —The leading Indian trader tells me that he has just received a large consignment of boots by caravan, and that he hopes to find an excellent market for them at Herat. This is the first consignment, which has been received by caravan. Russian Barracks at Turbat-i-Haidari. — The Turbat Agent reports that bar- 1 9th October, racks are being constructed for the Russian escort at Turbat. I am inquiring as to size. The New Director of Telegraphs. —The Khabir-u-Dola, whom I have known for many years, called. He tells me that Mr. New is improving the Persian Service ; but, that as all perquisites have been abolished, it will be hard for him to live. Formerly, thej Governor-General always gave one hundred tomans a month to the Director to be well reported on : but now he gives nothing. The Russian Converts to Islam. —The Herat Agent reports that two Russians, with a Russian woman, have crossed the Afghan frontier at Guzar Ismail, near Dahana Mangan. They state that they are converts to Islnm, wishing to see the King of Islam. They are being detained, pending instructions from Herat. • • 1 Russian Looting in the Shrine. —A Russian infantry officer remarked to Captain Blair that none of the infantry looted in the Shrine : but only the Cossacks. The value of this remark lies in the fact that it is the first time that the Russians have acknowledged that there was any looting. 10 th October. 11th October, 12th October, POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province.—The Turkoman Raids. —During my tour, I was in close proximity to two Turkoman alaman, and collected the stroi '.gest evidence that the Russian Commissioner of Gunbad-i-Kabus instigates these murderous raids ; that the raiders are chiefly Russian Turkoman, and that jigits of the Russian Turkoman division take part in them. I am writing a special report on the subject. State of the Roads. —Muhammad Nishapuri is in the Turbat district, and is be ing pursued by Berberi sowars, who make no attempt to overtake him. Robbers are reported as raiding the Kuchan-Bajgiran section of the Askhabad, and as retiring into Russian territory. The general belief is that these robberies are instigated by the Russian authorities ; but this I doubt. Movement of Russian Troops. —Colonel Scourratt, the Military Attache, has returned from his secret expedition to Kalat-i-Nadiri. He was met by Captain Blair at Kakha. The Plague Scare—M. Leleux, some days ago, heard from his agent at Turbat- i-Shaikh-Jam that there was some mysterious disease in the neighbourhood. He sent an alarmist telegram to Tehran, and the Conseil Sanitaire, without reference to the European doctors at Meshed, apparently declared that it was plague. My colleague received orders to act with vigour, and sent Cossacks to stop all traffic, with the result that there were soon hundreds of starving pilgrims. He then cancelled the order, lil4 - '€.0 .'a;G. M. Prew, Simla.—No. C-540 F. D.—13-1M2.—29.—J.N.B.

The Russian Consulate has asked the Agency Surgeon to send for some plague serum from Bombay, P. M. SYKES, Major, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Late News.—I have just heard that Mr. Merriton, who is mending the Tele graph line, is at Meiomei, some forty miles to the east of Shahrud.

The Treasury Gendarmes .—About two hundred of the new force has been re cruited. They are paid 12 tomans per month, with an allowance of 2 krans a day, when away from Meshed. They are the only force of this kind now in Persia, so I am informed. It is intended to send a body to overawe any village, which refuses to pay taxes. It will be interesting to see how they behave. Alleged Murder by a Russian Soldier .—It is reported from Imam Kuli, near Kuchan, that a Russian soldier broke into a villager’s house, and killed the owner and his wife. The man was seized by the other villagers. The Jamshidis.—lAi&lt;d Afghan frontier officers have recently reported to Herat that of 339 familes, which originally left Afghanistan, with Saiyid Ahmad Beg, 129 families have returned. Of the families still on Russian soil, 60 are at Ynlatan, and the remainder at Chaman-i-Bid. Russian Liquor Regulations .—A notice has been posted up by the Russians to the effect that any one, who sells liquor to the troops, without the permission of their officers, will be imprisoned in the Russian military prison, and will also be fined. # POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province .—During the past week, I have been visited by every Persian official of any importance. The general feeling is that the British Govern ment is attempting to perform a miracle, and bring back to life a dead corpse, but that the Russians will take care that the miracle does not succeed. The Gover nor-General has tendered his resignation on the grounds that neither the police, troops, or any other department is paid. In this connection, I am consulting with my colleague to help the Governor-General. The fact is that M. Leleux knows no Persian and is, in consequence, run by his staff. Also it is believed that M. Mornard is trying to show a large balance by the simple expedient ot paying no body. State of Roads. —Muhammad, the leading brigand, is at Kadamgah, one stage to the east of Nishapur. Among other occupations, he cuts and carries off miles of telegraph wire. Recently he captured a Cashier of our Bank, and asked him politely what present he had brought him from Meshed. He was then engaged in rolling up strands of telegraph wire. Salar Khan, the second brigand, has reached Meshed to interview the Governor- General. Huseinzada has left Khorasan for the time being. The Turkoman have stopped all traffic on the Meshed-Tehran road, and I hear from Bujnurd that a fresh alaman is collecting. Russian Troo-ps.—A draft of 180 recruits for the Semirechia Cossacks with 8 wagons reached Meshed on the 16th instant. ^ Reference entry of 19th September. The Russians have left Fyazofl’s house. It seems possible that their policy of scattering men all over the city m defiance of military precautions is dictated by the desire to familiarise the Meshidis with their new masters. This theory is widely held. Some days ago, two Russian officers in disguise are said to have gone to Hash- tadan to examine that section of the Perso- Afghan frontier. Some days ago, the Russians practised climbing over houses in the middle of the town to the immense annoyance of the towns-people. The Plague Scare .—There is no further news about the plague scare, which is apparently unfounded. P. M.

GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications, Railways. 507. Accident. —On 12th October 1912, a derailment occurred between Iskander and Uzun Su (Central Asian Railway), owing to the breaking of an axle. One employe was injured, and 1,400 yards of the permanent way damaged. Roads. 508. CJiaussee from Task Kepri to Taldita Bazar. —Work is not expected to commence before December. The whole cost, estimated at £11,600 is to be debited to local funds, — an unfair arrangement in view of the fact that the road is largely required for military purposes. A branch railway may eventually be constructed along it. 509. Bridges in Bokhara. —The Amir has allotted £30,000 for the construc tion of six bridges over the Zerafshan. Waterways. 510. The Aral Sea. —Two motor boats have been ordered for fishery pro tection, and it is expected that another will be ordered for similar work on rivers. History. 511. Attempted theft of arms. —Five artillerymen have been arrested at Vyerni on a charge of attempting to steal rifles and powder from the Artillery store at that place. (Note by Military Attache.— Owing to the high prices obtainable in Persia, cases of Russian soldiers in Turkistan selling rifles and ammunition to natives, are becoming increasingly frequent.) 512. Brigandage in North East Persia. —Muhammad is reported to be in the vicinity of the Meshed-Nishapur road. 513. Health. —The prevalence of Malta fever in the Trans-Caspian province is causing the authorities anxiety. Measures are being taken to establish the causes of the disease. Military. 514. Russian strength in Astarabad and district. —In September 1912, the Russian garrisons at Astarabad, Meshed-i-Sar, and district stood at 400 infantry (of the 19th and 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiments), 8 maxims, 50 men and 4 guns of the mountain battery of the 4th Turkistan Artillery Division, 270 Taman and Caucasus Cossacks, and 40 Turkoman irregulars. The strength at _Gunbad-i- Kabus was reported to be ICO Taman Cossacks and 100 Turkoman irregulars. Total, all arms, 1,040. A Russian subject has built a landing pier at Kara bu. 515. Meshed Garrison. —A draft of 180 men has arrived for the Semirechya Cossacks, in replacement of 118 time-expired men, whose departure has already been reported. 74 boxes of Small Arms Ammunition have been received at Meshed. An epidemic of small-pox has broken out among the Persian popula tion. 516. Training. —The training camp of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps broke up on 4th October 1912. Units not belonging to the Tashkend garrison were railed to their permanent stations, between that date and 13th October, m 13 parties. 256 railway wagons were required for their transport. ilk !g-.-*'—■ • T ‘ 1 1 '.. ,, 2 *:•; 4 . ' ' o ... | Owing to an*Qutbreak of influenza among the horses of the mounted arms, the proposed ihaneeuvres of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps between Ak Tepe and Gaudan have been abandoned. The annual practice camp of the artillery of the 2nd Turkistan Army Ccrps took place near Askhabad and lasted two months, commencing on 14th May. It was directed by Major-General Nishchenkof. Methods of fire against attacking infantry, using modern formations, from the time it enters the zone of artillery fire to the moment of assault: the use of battery, section, or single gun fire according to the size and tactical importance of the target presented : and fire on areas of ground known to shelter an invisible enemy, were especial ly practised. Practices of the last description did not always give satisfactory results, owing to their difficulty. As the ground used was unknown, useful prac tice was afforded to officers and scouts. All the prizes were won by batteries of the 4th Turkistan Artillery Division. 517. Aviation—The school of the Turkistan Society of Aviation at Tashkend is expected to open about the middle of October. Staff-Captain Sakharof will assist in the instruction of officers and men. Another instructor has also arrived from St. Petersburg. The school will have two sections : one for the free instruc tion of officers and men of the Turkistan Military District and the other for the instruction, on payment, of members of the society and other civilians. A Gov ernment grant of £50 and a donation of £300 from the Amir of Bokhara have been received. Officers of the Turkistan Military District continue to be sent to the Schools of Aviation at St. Petersburg and Sebastopol. 518. Reserve and Militia. —Militiamen {oratniki o'polcheniya) of the 1st ban, residing in the Askhabad and Tejen military districts, who have not served in the Active Army and belonging to the classes of 1908-09-10-11, are ordered to report for 6 weeks’ training to the Askhabad District Commandant (local re presentative of the Turkistan Local Brigade) on 27th October. Reservists and militiamen residing in the Caspian villages and along the Central Asian railway from Krasnovodsk to Jebel are to report to the Krasnovo- dsk District Commandant. Resources. 519. Irrigation. —Applications have now been filed for permission to lease and irrigate various areas of State land, amounting to 1,700,000 acres, in Rus sian Turkistan, Khiva, and Bokhara. 520. Supply. —During 1912, 12,000 tons of compressed fodder have been bought for troops in the Turkistan Military District in Orenburg and other provinces of European Russia and forwarded by the Tashkend railway. 521. Petroleum. —In 1911 Turkistan produced 306,000 tons of petroleum and consumed 467,000 tons, of which 410,000 tons were used by the railways. (See Diary 37, paragraph 466.) 522. Cattle rearing in Turkistan. —The annual loss of cattle and sheep from avoidable causes (want of fodder etc.) is estimated at 600,000 head. Measures for improving the conditions of the industry are being considered. G. W. BLAIR, Captain, i Officiating Military Attache, G. M. Press, Simla,—No. C-551 F.

Director of Customs and Sistan KatJeliudas.—The Director recently made some 24 th October, changes amongst the Katkhudas of some villages here, and, as in two cases these changes considerably affected Muhammad Ali and Brothers, contractors for the supplies of the Robat Column, I called to-day to see the Director about the matter. Ine nrm nad made contracts with certain Katkhudas for their grain, and made large advances to the Katkhudas in payment of it. These contracts were made beiore the revenue management was transferred to the Customs. The result of these changes will be that the firm will receive only a portion of the grain they contracted for. Before communicating with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister on the subject, I shall enquire into two or three points mentioned by the Director, as reasons for making the changes.

DirectoT of Customs and the Sistan Katkhudas. —I mentioned in my last diary that the Director had made some changes amongst the Katkhudas of some of the villages here, and that in two cases these changes considerably affected an Indian firm here. I am glad to report that the Director has now cancelled his recent orders, regarding one village, and, I believe, will cancel his orders shortly, regarding the other village. Baluchi Raids—It is reported that 75 camels ‘were looted at Sarchah Ambari by Baluchi raiders a few days ago. Details have not been received yet. I hear that some Baluchis in the Sarhad are preparing to start off on a looting expedition, but it is not known whether they are going to Kainat, or to Narma- shir. Roads. —It is reported that a caravan returning here from Birjand was looted recently by Afghan robbers at Nasbandeh on the Angira road,Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 39, for the week ending 12th October 1912. GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways, 492. Termez Railway. —The alignment proposed from Kaghan, near Bokhara, would run via Karshi to Kerki and thence up the left bank of the Oxus, via Kilif, to Termez. Total length, 310 miles, with a branch line of 80 miles to Guzar and Kitab, from Karshi. 493. Semirechya Railway .—The chief engir eer of the new line has arrived at Aris where construction material will be assembled as soon as the cotton traffic comes to an end. The question of the alignment has, however, not yet been de cided. The authorities insist on the line passing through Chimkent, but, as this alignment would involve an additional expenditure of £1,000,000, the concession aires are anxious to carry the railway directly east from Aris, passing 40 mi les north of Chimkent. They have offered to construct a branch line to the latter place. A new town is springing up near Aris station. 494 New Branch Lines.—The construction of a narrow-guage line from Melni- kovo (on the Andijan branch, 33 miles west of Kokand) will commence m (Rus- sian) Februarv 1913. The line will run 36 miles north-west to the newly-opened coal mines akShurab, owned by. Syatopolsk-Mirski and Company. The cost » estimated at about £1,800 per mile. Armroval has been given to the construction of a short branch line of broad- eua^Ctal Sea sta^on to the property of the “ Khiva ’’ Company. (Note by Military AftocW.-This appears to be a branch connecting the Tashkend rail way with the landing place at Aralskoye village). Tt is nronosed to extend the Kbkand-Namangan railway to Jalalabad, rid ,. lt 13 , ,,V 12 o miles. Branches would be built northwards to Kokand Kishlak (121 miles) and southwards to Chinabad (24£ miles). The total expenditure is estimated at about £1,400,000.

He has appealed against the sentence. 500. Mutiny near Tashkend. —Major-General Malishevski, Commanding Tur- kistan Sapper Brigade, has been placed on the retired list, and Captain Godlevski- Godilo, of the Turkistan Sappers, has been dismissed the service. The 2 nd Turkis- tan Sappers are now in camp near Askhabad. 501. Brigandage in North-East Persia. —Muhammad, after another successful skirmish with Persian troops sent to capture him, advanced to within three miles of Nishapur. He is now reported to be in the vicinity of Sabzawar. The Tehran- Meshed telegraph line has been cut several times during the past fortnight and the post seriously delayed, (See also paragraph 495 on page 1). Military. 502.

The engineer who carried out the “ mineralogical ” reconnaissance to Turbat-i- Haideri, Turshiz, and Madan, was an officer of the 2 nd Turkistan Sapper batta lion. Twenty-five Cossacks are reported to have left Meshed in the direction of Turbat-i-Haideri on 9th October. The Russian Military Attache and his party returned from Kelat-i-Nadiri on the same day. 505. Espionage.—Thioe, Afghans, arrested four months ago on a charge of spying, have been tried and acquitted. From the conversation of Russian officers, it is clear that the authorities are suffering from an attack of spy-mania. Two alleged Russian spies have been arrested near Zulfikar by the Afghans ^ and two more at Kafir Kala. All four are said to be Russians in disguise. g 506. Russian Post at Karez .—The stabling is being increased to sufficient for 80 horses, but up to 6 th October the Post had not been reinforced.

I hear that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is trying by means of emissaries sent out into various districts to get the people to clamour for his appointment as Governor, and also that his emissaries are threatening the Kainis with the reappearance of Baluchis, if they do not do so. Mr. Howson informs me that he has heard that telegrams are being exchanged in French, through the Russian office, between Monsieur Leleux, Directorof Customs Meshed, and the Director of Revenue, Birjand, on the subject of a change of Gov ernors in Kainat. Director of Customs, Sistan, and Sirdar Khudadad Khan. —I understand that Sirdar Khudadad Khan has sent Tomans 1,000 to the Customs, towards the pay ment of his revenue. ^ Russian Military Attache. —Reference Diary No. 23 for the week ending 12th June 1912. Baron Tchercassov tells me that Lieutenant-Colonel Vigonnitsky leaves Tashkent for here in the beginning of November. Baluch raids at Neh in April last. —The total of the claims of British subjects for property looted by Baluch raiders at Neh in April last amounts to Krans 212 994-17 (at 373% Rupees 56,798-11). These claims have been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, as it was impossible to do anything here owing to the Kainat authorities refusing all responsibility in the matter. Roads. —Unsafe between Birjand and Turbat, I'hMeshed Consular Diary, No. 40, for the week ending 5th October (received 2nd November) 1912.

State of the Province. —Talub-ul-Hak, the agent provocateur, with P two Bussian Cossacks, left for Bussia on the 29th September. It is reported that he will get a monthly allowance of fifty roubles from the Bussian Government, during his sojourn . in Bussia. Before leaving, the Bussian Consulate General entertained him and his friends at the house of their Attache. Khan Salar, a royalist agitator in the Shrine during the bombardment, was shot dead at Shahrud by a Mujahid constitutionalist, whilst en route for Meshed from Tehran. There is a rumour in Krasnovodsk that all Turkoman and Persians have been asked to hold themselves in readiness for the return of the ex-Shah. : - ^ - Nardin. —Major Sykes reports 300 Turkoman raiding there on 17th Septem ber. Monsieur Mornard has forbidden Monsieur Leleux to pay the military and police, till further orders, and the latter threaten to strike. The Bais-i-Nazmiah has borrowed 700 tomans, and paid them to go on with, in order to avoid Bussian intervention. The Bussian Consul General has bribed a clerk in the Maliyah to obtain the exact figures for the revenue of the province. He also gets a weekly report on the income from animal tax. Herat. —The news of two Bussian spies captured by Afghans at Zulfikar, and sent to Kohsan, as reported in last week’s diary, is confirmed. A migration of twenty Timuri families from Persia to the frontier of Gulran is reported. A bazaar in Panjdeh was burnt down. Turbat. —The Bussian Consul here has started for Karez ; he visited the rebel Salar Khan on his way, and put up for the night with him. State of the Hoads.—Abbasabad.—Pom hundred Turkoman were reported in the district, on the 29th September. Eight hundred pilgrims at Mazenan, and three hundred at Shahrud are detained in consequence. Four Tehran posts detained at Shahrud have arrived. Telegraph Line. —This was cut, and repaired as usual. Movements of Russian Troops.' —The Bussian military authorities are now hiring houses in the Naughan and Pain Khiaban quarters, at the opposite end of the towm. Telegraphic orders have been received for the Bussian troops to vacate the Persian military barracks at once, and hand them back to the Governor- General. This will serve as a further pretext to hire more houses in the town. A staff officer, with four cossacks and two Turkoman, arrived at Meshed on 29th September, via Sarakhs on an inspection tour to lurshiz and Daragez. Forty-two boxes of small arms ammunition arrived from Askhabad on the same date. F. E. WILSON, Captain, I.M.S.,Meshed Consular Diary, No. 38, for the week ending 21st September (received 24th October) 1912. September 16th.• —Shuja-ul-Mulkhascome to Meshed, and is leaving shortly for Mecca, with the Governor-General’s consent. Pilgrims .—One thousand Shirazis, inhabitants of Darab and Sirjan, have arrived on pilgrimage. It is reported from Turbat that the men left their rifles in villages on the Meshed road to be called for on their return. September 1 M.—Russian troops, in three parties of one officer and ten men with one interpreter each, were discovered making lists of houses in Meshed, with value and owner’s name attached, when they were stopped by the Russian-Con sulate, who pointed out that they had a list already prepared by the former Rais-i- Nazmiah, who had enumerated all houses and shops. September 19th.—Two Russian officers have taken a house, belonging to one Fyazoff, a well-known Russian subject, next door to the Attache’s and Military Account clerk’s quarters and directly opposite to the entrance to the sowars lines in the Consulate back lane. A strong protest was lodged, before the officers moved in, and all responsibility disclaimed in the event of an incident. Monsieur Grigorieff informed me, in writing, that no incident could possibly happen, and much less from fault of theirs. As drunken cossacks have assaulted men and women, I still think it danger ously close: besides hampering our intelligence bureau. A side-light on the rela tions between political and military was thrown by Monsieur Grigorieff, who neither knew of the house, nor that the military authorities had taken it. September 21st.—M.. Romanovsky will arrive in a few days to relieve M. Ya- kovlieff, the second secretary. POLITICAL SUMMARY. 'A 1 Afahan-Sistan Frontier.— AbAuWah Khan, the Afghan Agent, told the Attache that he had been ordered by the Governor of Herat to discuss this question with the Karsuzar, as His Majesty the Amir was very anxious to have it settled amicably ; otherwise, His Majesty would be compelled to ask for a commission This was confirmed by the Karguzar, in conversation with me, and is the result ot Baluch raids on Afghan villages, reported in Sistan diaries. Mahmud “ Khan, ” Darungari of Daragez, has settled down at Kaltah Chinar on the Daragez (Russian) frontier. He has robbed Russian subjects at Russian Badiahiran fought the Cossacks and robbed the Daragez, and Kuchan Persians. When pursued by Persian troops he retreats into Russian territory. Mahmud’s brother was killed by the Governor of Daragez some time ago. From Persian Badjghiran, telegraphic reports have reached the Governor- General of an affray between Russian soldiers and Persian shop-keepers m which a Persian was wounded. At night a Russian officer with sixteen men is said to have come over from Godaun, and beaten all the witnesses of the affair. Shuja-ud-Dola has returned to Kuchan He reported to the Governor-Gene ral that he had not fled, but gone to pursue Mahmud, and that the Russians had made out that it was a flight. Customs and Kemwe.-Monsieur Leleux sent off one hundred gendarmeri sowars with four officers to Chahar Burj, near Tus, to seize Najd-us-Saltanah and take him to Tehran. ' This independent action on M. Leleux s part has raised great excitement among our notables. Najd-us-Saltanah was late Peshkar-i- Malivah and was reported badly on by M. Leleux to Tehran for instigating land- owners Act to pay revenue. The Governor-General prayed M. Leleux not to be rash, as Najd-us-Saltanah had promised to go to Tehran of his own accoid. He is2 of the opinion that M. Leleux got orders from M. Mornard, and says that, as they have sent thirty sowars to Sabzawar, and an equal number to Kuchan, disturbances must arise everywhere. Meshed District.- —Forty camels grazing at Dahani Tangal Shoor, four farsakhs south-east of Meshed, were looted by a band of twenty men. Muhammad —Muhammad was encountered at Khasroabad, between Sabzawar and Nishapur, by Kambar Agha, head of the Nishapur troops. The twenty Timuri sowars of Kambar Agha fled, Muham r ad having one casualty This report shows a large increase in Muhammad’s following to_76 men, who then came to within two farsakhs of Nishapur, and, after several desultory encounters retired. About this place Agha Mirza Ah the Imperial Bank cashier was caught while Muhammad was engaged m cutting the line, and carrying it off. The cashier was robbed of everything, and his papers read, one of which referred to specie leaving Nishapur for Kuchan, for which we have lust arranged for the guard. The cashier was released after one day’s detention, and the line has been restored up to Nishapur. Huseinzada.- —Huseinzada, who was at Miandasht (Diary No. 32 of 10th August) intends to come towards Turslnz, and Salar Khan, Baluch, is collecting men to raise a rebellion. It was a great mistake on the part of the Minister of Interior to have allowed Salar Khan to leave Tehran without security. Turkoman Abbasabad reports 1,000 Turkoman at Maiomai, where they have cut the line, and burnt 47 poles. They have ordered the villagers to have their “ revenue ” ready. Herat. The Herat Agent reports that Persian officials, such as Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Hazara chief, deal directly with the Governor, in one recent case the chief sending in a report to the Governor of thieves at Bakharz, whom he had caught, and handed over to the Afghan frontier officials at Kafir Kila. In return, he asked for the thieves, who had stolen horses, rifles, and money from Taiubat. This was promised him at once.

One camel worth sixty tomans and seven tomans cash, were seized in lieu of customs’ dues and pass-port fees. The people of Karez are now afraid to allow their animals out to graze as they fear Saidu’s reprisals. ktate of the JRoads, Karez. —On 15th September Shuja-ul-Mulk’s servants, while returning to Karez, were attacked by ten robbers at Chah Bahadur Khan, near Pariman. Two horses and 170 tomans cash were taken and the servants beaten very severely. This is the same place where our dak sowar w T as fired at {Vide Diary No. 23 for 8th June). Turbat. —The Turbat Agent reports that, between Yunsi and Mian Deh, twelve farsakhs from Turbat, a caravan of sixty camels carrying carpets was robbed. The owners are unknown. Saiyid Hussein, a Turbat ruffian, is raiding and collecting money round Turbat. A caravan from Birjand reports that on the Bijistan road four men are levying taxes.

Kalat-i-Nadiri .—Previously referred to in Diary No. 30 of 27th July. Another Russian officer, Colonel Scourratt, with ten or twelve Cossacks from Meshed, left secretly for Kalat on the night of 14th September to examine the famous valley, especially as regards its fortifications. On his arrival on the 18th instant, he found that the permission to enter the place, secretly accorded to him by the Neir-ud-Dola, without reference to Tehran, was an ambiguous one, and the Governor of Kalat had to ask if definite permission were granted or not. The Governor-General has now referred to the Karguzar. A Russian engineer with n ine cossacks is visitingiTurshiz, Turbat and Madan, to enquire about the mineral resources of those places. An Armenian newspaper called '‘Hovizoon ” states that the ex-Shah is not hopeless, and is very likelv to leave Russian soil for Azeroaijan in the immediate future : that the well-wishers of the ex-Shah are increasing every day and that the Anglo-Russian entente will no longer allow Persia to remain in the way of Russia.

New Director-General of Telegraphs. —Khabir-ud-Dola, who held the post before, and was dismissed, has arrived, and taken over charge from Mubashar-ul-Mulk, relieved by the authorities at Tehran. September 24th. —Another woman was raped by Russian soldiers in a garden outside the town. Many cases of Russian soldiers embracing women are reported, and I myself saw a party of Russian soldiers, hustling two women one night, but on my appearing they desisted. As Persian and Turkish women are dressed alike, there may be collisions with the Turks. | The Shirazi pilgrims left Meshed on their return journey. At Turbat the Amin-i-Maliyah wished to levy nawaqal, as it had not been paid. (It never is paid by pilgrims here.) On the Shirazis offering fight, the Maliyah men withdrew.

The others were released. Monsieur Grigoriefi then sent an official written demand for the Talib-ul-Hak by a ghulam with four Russian soldiers. The Karguzar complied, and the Talib was re moved to the Russian Consulate at night. The Persian pass-port demanded for his journey to Russia was, however, refused ; the Karguzar explaimng that his. orders were to send him to Tehran. M.

Kuchan—Vae Russian Consul-General has sent instructions to his agent at Kuchan to seize Shuia-ud-Dola, Governor of Kuchan, and send him to Meshed, under guard, in eonneition with Rais-ut-Tujjar’s claim for money, borrowed by him for Shuia from the Russian bank. The Karguzar was deeply annoyed, and said that the Russians governed the country when they could imprison Persian Governors, and send them about the country under guard. This he wired to Tdxr£in The whole matter is an intrigue on the part of Abdul Hamid, Attache at the Russian Consulate-General, who has married Muavm-ul-Ayala s daughter, and the latter is the Rais-ut-Tujjar s agent. * j 4.1 Turhat There are no troops now at Turbat,'since the Governor wired on the 20 th instant to our Governor-General that the 30 Hazara, and 50 Karai sowars left without permission, as they had received no pay.

Use of oil fuel .-—The Central Asian and Tashkend Railways together re quire an annual minimum supply of 400,000 tons of oil fuel, of a value of £700,000. Supplies are at present obtained from contractors: it is calculated that if the State worked the naptha fields itself, a saving of more than half this sum could be effected. At the same time it would be possible to break the monopoly now enjoyed by Nobel Bros, and to reduce the cost of oil for the private consumer. Owing to the ex haustion of the supply of saxaul the demand for oil in Turkistan is very great. A scheme has been forwarded for the approval of the St. Petersburg authorities. 467. Pace of trains on the Tashkend Pailway ,—The maximum pace for all trains has been raised to 27 miles an hour. This increase is possible owing to tech- uical improvements on the line and to the settling-down of the permanent way. 468.

The gauge should be the same as that of the State railways and the higher personnel exclusively Russian. Administration. 486.

His orders regarding the confis cation of the villages, although not carried out, had not been cancelled, and the Sirdar was still keeping himself ready to resist being expelled from his villages Monsieur deVYeerdt, however, said he would cancel his orders at once.

Customs and Sirdar Khudadad Khan .—I understand Sirdar Khudadad Khan has written to the Director of Customs, asking that no action be taken against him and saying that he is willing to pay his revenues and obey the Director’s orders in every way. The Director told me, a day or two ago, that there was nothing in the report, that there was any difficulty between the Customs and Sirdar Khudadad Khan! Beyond that, however, he said nothing. I hear that Sirdar Khudadad Khan has built 5 sanghars at Khwajah Ahmad in each of which he has a number of armed men, and the Sardar himself is fre quently to be seen on the top of the tower of his fort, surveying the country around with his glasses.

September 4th. —The Russian Legation has since wired to M. Grigorieff that it would be better if troops remain quartered in the Ark for the present. This order may be circumvented by enlarging the “ Ark Quarter ” to any required extent. All incidents of this nature could be easily avoided by the military authorities arranging such matters through their consulate. The young Shah has wired to Neiur-ud-Dola, asking after his health, and about affairs in Khorasan. This is considered locally as a high honour.

Meshed Consular Diary, No. 37, for the week ending 14th September (received 12th October) 1912. Centenary of Borodino. —This was celebrated in great style by the Russian Se i»' om1j er 8th. troops. The divine service held at 10 a.m. in the Ark square was attended by the Governor-General, Commander-in-Chief and Karguzar, much to the surprise of the Persian crowd, who, on seeing holy water sprinkled on these high officials, mistook it for a baptismal ceremony. The above Persians also attended the public luncheon afterwards in spite of the fast, and a photograph was taken with Russian ladies standing round the Neiur-ud-Dowla. These are now matters of public scandal. When the Karguzar called in the afternoon, he said that they were compel- September 9th. led to attend divine service in order to please the Russians. Meshedi Ghulam, a Russian subject and druggist, is a well-known smuggler September ioth. of firearms by post from Russia. On going to take delivery of some parcels, one was found broken, and pistols fell out. All his parcels were then confiscated, and, on being opened, ten Mausers, and ten Brownings were discovered. In his defence at the Customs office, where his case is now being tried, the man said that he had ordered them for the police of Meshed. j With reference to Meshed Diary of August 8th, the Ilkhani of Kuchan, Shuja- September 12th. ud-Dowla, has bolted from Kuchan, owing to debts, especially to the Russian Bank Meshed Diary of August 25th, September 1st and 4th. The townspeople are September 13 th. in much fear of this spreading of Russian troops about the town. On Thursday, when in the Shrine, the Governor-General was approached by a large crowd, who prayed him to save their women from the Cossacks. He repli- • ed that he had written to Tehran, and expected an early reply. POLITICAL SUMMARY. f I State of the Province. — Karez. —Referring to Meshed Diary for August 19th, the quarrel between Shaukat-ud-Dowla, the Timun Chief, and the Ilbegi, has been compromised for 500 tomans cash, two camels and some carpets from the latter to the former. In return he received a modern rifle. Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Hazara Chief, is now coming to Meshed with presents for Neiur-ud-Dowla, the share of loot taken at Gaisur, when he defeated and killed Muhammad Ali Gunabadi. This consists of four mules, 25 rifles and 1,000 tomans in cash. The Chief of Bujnurd has agreed to send 25 sowars to Monsieur Leleux for the revenue office. The latter is delighted as the Ilkhani has paid nearly the whole of his revenue. The “Trans-Caspian Review”notes that Prince Dabija has only two months leave. On the other hand, the Prince's effects are now stored at Askhabad. The Karguzar has received a letter from the Governor of Herat to the effect that there should be greater reciprocity between the different officials on the frontier, as they are two friendly Muhammadan powers ; that, as for himself, he has ordered all Afghan officials to desist from high-handed methods, and robberies on the Persian side of the border, and he asks the Karguzar to issue similar orders. The original orders appear to have come from Kabul. &lt; ■j V f State of Roads. —Major Sykes, writing on September 5th from Bujnurd, was informed that 500 Turkoman had just left their country for robbery on the Tehran-Meshed road. The Ilkhani; is positive that they are instigated by the Russian Commissioner.if ; 'f' Movements of Russian Tvoops. —The Russian Consul-General has asked th^ Governor-General, who has comphed, to order the Governor of Kuchan to keep ready in store for the troops 1,000 kharwars of wheat, 500 kharwars of barley and 500 kharwars of lucern. Russian Cantonment. —Nothing further has been heard of the resumption of operations since Prince Dabija’s departure. With reference to Summary of Meshed Diary, No. 28, of July 13th, Monsieur Beleux has constructed a grain store about 80 by 35 paces. This is a well ven tilated hall of burnt bricks on pillars and with a wooden floor, suitable for troops in emergency. F. E. WILSON, Captain, Offg.

UoMMUNICATIONS. Railways, 451. Tashkend Railway. —In the first six months of 1912, the line carried 540,000 tons of goods and 4,119,330 passengers. The number of locomotives and ef covered goods wagons has been increased by nearly 30 per cent, and it is hoped that it will no longer be necessary to borrow rolling-stock from other lines. In view of the increase of traffic in the autumn, caused by the export of cotton, certain razyezd’s (passing-places) will be opened and the additional staff, dismissed in the spring, when these passing-places were closed, will again be employed. 452. Semirechya Railway, —It is reported that difficulties have arisen between the Ministry of Finance and the Concessionaires on the question of the alignment via Chimkent and that the former is considering the transfer of the concession to another group of capitalists, 453, Narrow-gauge Material, —The Ministry of War has refused to hand over the narrow-gauge material stored at Kushk to the Central Asian Railway for the construction of a light line to Firyusa. The “ Turkislan Gazette ” suggests that this material might be usefully employed for a line to Termez. It is, however, stated that the Ministry of War proposes to transfer all of it from Kushk to Kiev. Administration, 454, Opium. —In spite of all efforts to suppress the sale of opium, the opium i habit is spreading in Trans-Caspia and is seriously affecting the rural Turkoman population. A den with 120 opium lamps was recently discovered at Askhabad and two heads of Turkoman villages have been prosecuted for connivance in the opium traffic. Ethnography, 455. Population of Tashkend. —The present population of Tashkend is 265,000 of whom 185,000 are natives. History, 456. Riot at Samarkand—It is reported that a serious riot took place among railway workmen at Samarkand on 1st September 1912. Military, 457. Tashkend Cadet School— number of cadets is to be increased by 75. 458, Russian troops at Meshed^-i-Ser, —The garrison, which was formerly 300 men, now stands at 40 men of the 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment with 2 maxims, and 90 Taman Cossacks. No Russian troops are now at Sari. 459. Posts on the Askhabad-Meshod Road. —Posts of from 7 to 11 men each are maintained by the Semirechya Cossacks at Askhabad, Kurt Su, Hur Badam, Tazah Kand, Shirin Su, Mirabad, Chinaran, Gunabad, and Kazimabad. It is reported that the men steal food and fodder from the villagers. The garrison of Kuchan is 4 officers and 140 men (including 26 mounted scouts) of the 13th lurkistaij Ride Regiment and 5 officers and 150 men of the Semirechya Cossacks, one sotnia and headquarters of the sotni^i^^^iljg^the posts along the road, v TT*. 2 NOV 1912 )460. Discharge of time-expired Men. —Small parties of time-expired men of various units returned to Russia during the second half of August. Time-expired men from Meshed are expected to march about 20 th September, after relief by drafts from Trans-Caspia. 461. Meshed Garrison. —The troops are leaving the camp in the Bagh-i-Mustofi and occupying houses and serais in the Ark quarter. About 40 men are still in hospital. 462. Training. —The bulk of the troops in Turkistan are now assembled in the two Army Corps training camps : units of the 2 nd Turkistan Army Corps, near Askhabad, and those of the 1 st Turkistan Army Corps, near Tashkend. 463. Persian Forces.- —The Governor of Nishapur maintains 24 serhazes and 40 sowars. He proposes to increase the number of the latter to 50. There are also 10 Treasury sowars at Nishapur. A temporary reinforcement of about 40 sowars has been sent there, as Muhammad, with a band of 25 robbers, is reported to be 40 miles west of Nishapur on the Sabzawar road. Two sowars were killed by another band of robbers, about 35 miles north-west of Nishapur last week. Of the Central Asian supply, only a small proportion at present comes from the two Khanates. In 1911, 266,000 acres were sown for cotton in Bokhara, yielding about 80,000 tons of raw cotton (equivalent to from 20,000 to 24,000 tons of fibre). In the same jyear, 84,000 acres were under cotton in Khiva. In a good year the yield would be about 10,000 tons of fibre. The Khanates could un doubtedly supply much larger quantities : it is calculated that, if Bokhara were fully developed, the annual yield might be increased to 60,000 or 70,000 tons of fibre. More and more American cotton is sown every year, displacing the inferior, native, variety. &amp;Q5. Reclamation .—It is proposed to form a company to reclaim certain marshy districts in the Sir Darya province for the cultivation of cotton and rice.

Customs and Sirdar Khudadad Khan .—I hear that, as Sirdar Khudadad Khan has not paid up his revenue, the Customs have got instructions from either Meshed or Tehran to give his villages to certain other people. The Deputy Governor, however, refused to sign the order without the permission of the Hissam-ud-Dowleh. Sirdar Khudadad Khan has collected about 200 men at Khwajah Ahmad, and is building a small fort. He has written to the Russsian Consul and myself, saying the authorities want to take his villages from him, and drive him out of Sistan ; he states, however, he is willing to pay the revenue, if he is allowed to remain in possession of his villages. Sirdar Purdil Khan accompanied by various Katkhudas and a number of men have gone out to repair the Band-i-Kohuk. He is said to be ready to go against Khudadad Khan should he get orders to do so. hra, yield] 14 . ra, tes Be 70 , ig tie infer® wtainiiislj I have not been able so far to find out what the facts of the case are from the point of view of the Customs.

Mutiny near Tashkent!. -The sentence of the court-martial has been pro nounced. Fifteen men are sentenced to death (including one sergeant and one lance-corporal) ; 18 to penal servitude for life ; 62 to penal servitude for 15 years ; 15, 8 years ; 16, 4 years ; 63 to imprisonment for 6 years ; 16, 4 years ; and 16 to serve in the disciplinary company for from 1 to 3 years. Seven men were acquitted. Fourteen of those sentenced to death were hanged at Tashkcnd on the 26th August. One death sentence has been reduced to six years’ imprisonment. It was stated in evidence that the object of the mutiny was to kill General Malishevski and certain other officers and to demand the reduction of the period of service, the improvement of rations, the reduction of drill and fatigues, a change in the manner in which men have to address officers, and the grant of commissions to the ranks. The sappers had been in communication with revolutionaries in Moscow and with the rifle regiments and artillery in camp at Troitskoye. The mutiny was precipitated by a rumour that the sapper battalions were to be dis armed ; the other troops did not join in the outbreak. The editor of the newspaper “ Askhabad ” has been fined £ 50 (or 3 months’ imprisonment in default) for reproducing from a Russian newspaper an article deal ing with the mutiny. The town of Askhabad is patrolled at night by Cossacks and infantry owing to “ obscure rumours It is reported that the Governor-General is about to retire and that a “ reviziya ” (special general enquiry) will be held in the Turkistan Military District. 436.

Attack on British 'postal sowar. —The sowar (Turkoman) carrying the consular post-bag with mail from Meshed, dated 17th August 1912, was attacked and beaten by Afghan robbers about 20 miles west of Herat. His rifle and horse were taken ; the mail bag was cut open, but, finding only letters, the robbers did not take them. They were recovered by the British Agent at Herat and forwarded to Quetta. Military. 439. Registration of Transport. —A census of horses, camels, and other trans port animals will be taken simultaneously in the five Russian provinces of Turkistan between 29th August and 10th September. Sixty officers from European Russia will assist in the work. 440. Training. —All machine-gun detachments of the 1 st Turkistan Army Corps have been assembled near Tashkend for a special course of training. 441. Aviation. —Lieutenant Pavlof of the 2nd Turkistan Rifle Regiment, having completed a course of training on Farman and Bleriot aeroplanes at the Sebastopol school, will shortly return to Tashkend. Large numbers of officers (10 from one regiment alone) have joined the Turkistan Society of Aviation. The instructional courses have not yet commenced. 442. Appointment. —Lieutenant-General Lesh, from the 2nd Guards Infantry Division, is appointed to command the 1st Turkistan Army Corps in succes sion to General Kozlovski. 443.

Cam'p at Askhabad. —Certain troops of the Merv garrison are assembling at Askhabad for the annual training camp of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps. Resources. 447. Irrigation. —Engineer Blumberg with a party of experts is at Karshi. He will investigate the possibility of using the water of the Kashka Darya (near Karsh), the Amu Darya, and Surkhan rivers for irrigation. 24,300 acres of land suitable for irrigation in the Kara Kala steppe (Kokand) are to be thrown open to settlement. 448. Coal. —A company has been formed to acquire and work coal mines at Shurab (Isfarin volost). It is proposed to connect the mines with the main rail way line. 449. Cotton. —Although the area sown for cotton this year in Turkistan shows a decrease, the yield is good and it is expected that the amount gathered, especially of the higher qualities, will be little less than it was last year. 450. Future cultivation of cotton and of cereals. —The cotton growing districts of Fergana and Samarkand import 320,000 tons of wheat annually from Orenburg, Samara, and the Caucasus. It is estimated that Semirechya will be able to supply from 300,000 to 450,000 tons a year when the railway is completed to Yyerni. This amount will be available for consumption in the cotton-growing districts. The latter will, however, not be able to produce all the cotton, which their natural qualities enables them to supply, until the Semirechya railway is con nected with the Trans-Siberian line. The cotton-growing districts can then be entirely fed from Semirechya and from Siberia. G. W. BLAIR, Captain, Offig.

Hunter, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 38, for the week ending 21st September (received 7th October) 1912. Arrival of the Russian Consul from Birjand. —Baron Tchercassov and his wife 16 th September, arrived to-day from Birjand. Sowars were sent out to meet the Consul by the Direc tor of Customs, the Bais-i-Qashun and myself. Seemingly, the Deputy Governor and the Karguzar did not send anyone at all to meet him. The Baron told me he regarded their not having done so as a slight, and would report the matter to his Minister. It seems to me not unlikely that the date of the Baron's arrival was not com municated properly to the Karguzar. Hap Nasir-es-Sultaneh, Rais-i-Qashun. —The Haji called on me to-day. 19tJl September. Ke is afraid the sowars and sarbazes will cause a “ shulugh ' shortly, owing to their not getting their pay, and he said he could not afford to pay them from his own pocket. At the time of Sardar Khudadad Khan's Sarhad expedition, the Director of Customs paid the Bais-i-Qashun Tomans 9,000 to defray the expenses of the expedition. I have heard that the Haji spent about one-third of this amount, the balance being pocketted by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and himself. The Governor- General of Khorasan wrote recently to the Deputy Governor for a proper state ment of accounts of the expedition, as he suspected false statements had been submitted. The Deputy Governor has seen the Rais-i-Qashun on the subject, but I have not heard what the result of the interview was. General. Robberies. —Several small robberies have occurred recently. The shop of Meshedi Reza, a Russian subject, was broken into. An Afghan subject was arrested, and the evidence against him is very strong, but the Karguzar is trying to prove that a British Afghan .subject was an accomplice. He has not succeeded so far in doing so. This Meshedi Reza used to be an employee in the Russian Bank here, but was sent away from Sistan by the Russian Consul, owing to his complicity in an anti-Hindoo riot in 1908. (Vide diaries Nos. 22, 25 and 37, dated 20th May, 10th June and 30th August 1908). Imperial Bank of Persia. —Mr. TVilkinson, the Manager of the Sistan branch, tells me that this branch, for the half-year ending 20th September, shews a consider able net profit. The previous half-year also shewed a considerable net profit. Roads. —Nothing to report. ! IMeshed Consular Diary, No. 35, for the week ending 31st August (received 27th September) 1912. Russian Quarters. —Thirteen houses have been engaged by the Russians in 25th August, different quarters of the town. This dispersal of their force seems to be question able. Arrival of Colonel DsodovsJci. —The new commander of the troops, Col. Dso- 20 th August, dovski, has reached Meshed. Sanitary Improvements. —As soon as Prince Dabija left, I suggested to M.27tli August. Origorieff that we ought to make an effort to improve the sanitary condition of the Ark quarter. Both he and M. Leleux agreed, and we have drawn up a few simple regulations, which M. Leleux will publish. Of equal importance is to have M. Grigorieff’s promise that he will insist on the Russian troops observing ordinary sanitary precautions. These they neglect, and have much sickness in consequence. I was asked to influence the Governor-General to approve of our scheme, as he is against M. Leleux, and this I have done. His Highness considers me his only friend, and is consequently most ready to do what I ask. 2. The Artillery Garden. —M. Leleux informed me that it was intended to build barracks for 500 men, and stabling for 500 horses in the Artillery Garden. This strip of land is contiguous to the Consulate southern wall, and is only 30 yards from the house. It is also flanked by the hospital, and by the residence of the Bank. Finally, the Telegraph quarters are close to it. In other words, if this scheme were carried out, the sanitary position of the entire English colony would become intolerable. As there are many acres of empty ground close to the present barracks, there was no reason for this scheme, except that some ruined buildings could be partially utifised. Both M. Grigorieff and I pointed out to M^Leleux that this scheme would not only make the position of the English colony intolerable, but it would also defeat our plan of improving the present sanitary position. Finally, M. Leleux promised to look for a site elsewhere. The Governor-General has also agreed that I am entirely in the right, and that he will oppose any such scheme. I do not think that M. Leleux will try to proceed with this scheme, but I have referred to it at some length, as it is vital to the English colony not to have our sanitary posi tion ruined. The Kazvin-Hamadan Road. —Dr. Esselstyn, the American missionary, has 2 8th August, recently returned from Hama dan, and gives a gloomy picture of the state of the country. He just escaped being robbed by a gang of 25 men, near Hamadan, by driving back to the last stage, after being warned by some muleteers, who had been looted. He states that the road is in the charge of an American, Colonel Merritt. This individual has hanged a few men, and blown up a few villages, but Dr. Esselstyn was informed that in every case the innocent were alone punished. The Salar-u-Dola. —Dr. Esselstyn heard at Hamadan that the Salar-u-Dola 29th August, was in terror of being assassinated, and never went out, except in disguise, and mingled with his servants. Impending Departure on Tour. —As Captain Wilson and the other members of 30th August, the colony who were ill have recovered, I hope to start on tour on 1st September. Political Summary. State of Province. —General Redko and his Chief of Staff have left. M. Grigorieff and I have revived the entente, which is now as close and cor dial a§ it could possibly be. The Persian authorities also are delighted to be able to deal with a reasonable man like M. Grigorieff, and it is to be hoped that Prince Dabija will not return. However, there is no examination of officers who haveGj M. Press, Simla, —No, C.-455 F.

As the Tabb-ul-Hak is still in prison, M. Gri- corieff has not delivered this letter. This fact proves yet again that there is double dealing together with exceptional ineptitude in high quarters in Russia. State of roads —Huseinzada has murdered one of his prisoners. He then fled to the north as he heard that the Amir Azam was coming to Miandasht. My col league and I have suggested to our Legations that this very strong caravan serai should be garrisoned for some time. M^UoTv.mcirl is said to be surrounded Movements of Russian Troops—General Redko sent off two parties to recon noitre, one towards Bujnurd, and the other to Kalat-i-Nadiri. The guard at this famous natural fortress refused to allow the party to enter. M. Gngoneff only heard of this when a telegram reached the Governor-General from Kalat, and he has ordered the Cossacks not to attempt to force their way in. He has also pro tested strongly to St. Petersburg. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-GeneraL m iSECRET. Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 34, for the week ending 31st 408.

At the height of the fishing season the j. opulation rises to 2 000* Russians and natives, chiefly engaged in the supply of caviare to the Russian market. 413. Disturbance in Bokhara. —The cutting of a telegraph line near Karshi is reported. The offenders were dealt with by the Bokharan officials and the line has been repaired. 414. Transport. —Fifty-six four-wheeled transport carts have been received at Tashkend. Four carts of this pattern and 12 two-wheeled carts have been sent from that place to Kushk. The registration of transport animals is reported from Tashkend. 415. Supply. —It has been found that part of the flour held in store at the Askhabad supply depot is unfit for consumption. Extensive irregularities have evidently been discovered as General Shuvaef, Director-General of Intendance at St. Petersburgh, is expected to visit Tashkend in connexion with the affair. 416.

He will, as senior officer, command the reduced garrison in Khorasan. The first echelon (mounted troops) from Meshed crossed the Russo-Persian frontier at Gaudan on 25th August 1912. The second echelon (infantry and machine-guns) was expected to cross on 31st August 1912. Twenty-five men of the Taman Cossacks, the original Consular escort, remain in Meshed in addition to the troops previously detailed. 419. Duration of occupation of Khorasan. The Russians are negotiating for the hire of houses for the infantry, at Meshed. They are hired for six months, but owners are told that they may be required for an additional six months. An officer of the Semirechya Cossacks states that his unit has received notice that it will remain in Meshed for a year from now. I/? 420. Health of Russian troops .—There are seven cases of enteric in the Russian garrison of Kuchan. The troops there have suffered from fever and dysentry, but not so severely as those at Meshed, where seventy-five men are still under treat ment. Forty horses are reported sick at Meshed. 421. Mutiny near Tashkend.—Two hundred and twenty-nine men are under court-martial in connexion with the recent mutiny at Troitskoye. 422. Training .'—The troops of the Semirechya District, assembled in camp at Tishkan (near Jarkent), will carry out one week’s manoeuvres, which will be followed by a stafi ride attended by the senior officers of all units. General Folbaum is acting as Director. 423. Boy Scouts. —Sixty-one (Cossack) boy scouts (“ play troops”) have visited St. Petersburg. They rode from Yyerni to the railway station of Kabul Sai, about 450 miles in 21 days. G. W. BLAIR, Captain, Offg. Military Attache.f CONFIDENTIAL. Sis(an Consular Diary of Captain .f. B. D.

He seems pleased with the results of his visit. 1 Arrival of Mr Huxley, Indo-European Telegraph Department.—Mr. Huxley Hth September transferred from Dehaneh Baghi to this Consulate for duty, arrived in the after- noon. °f Sistan. —M. deWeerdt, Director of Customs, Sistan, told me to-day that M Mornard, Tehran, had requested him to ask me if we would approve of the removal from office of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and of the permanent appoint ment of his brother, Sirteep Muhammad Reza Khan, as Governor. I replied I thought it would be better if M. Mornard consulted His Britannic Majesty s Minis ter on the matter. M. deWeerdt was not surprised at my reply, as he said he did not think I would give my opinion, but, when communicating with M. Mornard the result of his mission, he would state that from his own observations he did not think we would disapprove of the dismissal of the Hashmnt, and the appointment of his brother. r General. —Nothing to report. ! Ifgto of State.The Jamshidis .—The Herat Agent reports that the Jamshidis, who came to isth August, Panjdeh with Saiyid Ahmad Beg, have been ioformed that, in future, they will have to pay one rouble per family, and that they should select four Elders, who will be responsible for this revenue, and also for robberies. The Jamshidis state that they cannot brook the injustice of paying revenue, and will return to Afghanistan. . Disturbances near the Afghan Frontier .—The Timuri Chief and the Ilbegi have 19 th August, quarrelled, apparently about the loot brought back from Sabzawar. Both sides have collected men, and some skirmishing is probable near the Jam Bud. Notification about the ex-Shah .—Beference to entry of 4th August. As the ru mour of the return of the ex-Shah by Bush ire with English consent has been spread far and wide by my colleague, who even mentioned it as a fact to the Governor- General, I have written an official letter to the Karguzar, stating that the rumour was untrue. This had a good effect. The return of the Muavin-u-Tujjar .— The Governor-General is allowing the Muavin-u-Tujj ar and his brother to return. It is to be hoped that they have learned their lesson. The departure of General RedJco.—General Bedko and his staff called to say good-bye. They were extremely cordial and the General said that he was sending me a photograph of himself and staff, as a memento of our friendlines and hospi tality. M. Grigorieff and my Tour.—\ hear that M. Grigorieff has written to the Ilkhani of Bui nurd to send him reports as to my movements. Russian activity at Astrahad. ~ Beference entry of 15th August. The land in question is situated near Astrabad on the Shahrud road. It has recently been visited by the Bussian Consul and some Persian officials. It rather looks as if a cantonment were intended. I also hear that'the Bussian Consul will visit Shahrud, and will examine the Elburz range with especial reference to hill stations. Delay in Tour .—Owing to Captain Wilson breaking his collar-bone last week, I have delayed starting on tour until 1st September. M. Grigorieff also is anxious to discuss various matters. 20 th August, 21st August, 22nd August, 23rd August, 24th August, Political Summary. My Russian colleague left for Russia on 22nd August. It is considered unlikely that he will return. A petition has been drawn up and sent to Tehran to the eflect that he was a good official. He was especially disliked by the General and officers. Reported Russian Barracks at Karez.-The Karez Agent reports that it is in tended to increase the Karez force by 25 Cossacks, and that barracks are being constructed. In this connexion, Karez is not m the Russian sphere of influence On the other hand, it is an important Post from our point of view, as being on t Afghan frontier, and less than 100 miles from Herat. State of Roads .—Muhammad is now at Aliek, to the north of Sabzawar. Other robberies as usual. Beference to summary of diary No. 30, last paragraph. A retired Hazara, who is drawing a pension as a Native Officer, states that his crops, which were ram- fed, were seized by the Bussians. As he had merely bought the crops, I was unable to help him, but his evidence is of value. fG. M. Press, Simla.—No. C. 437 P.

GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. 391. Semirechya Railway .—The trace of the line has not been definitely fixed. A party of engineers is now studying the question of carrying the line through Chimkent. Engineer Yanushevski, the head of the party, states that construc tion will begin in (Russian) March of next year. Administeation. 392. Expulsion of Jews. —13 Jews living at Askhabad without the necessary permission, have been expelled from Trans-Caspia. Ethnography. 393. Immigration of Kalmucks. —550 Kalmucks who crossed the frontier in June owing to the disturbances in Chinese territory, have petitioned to be allowed to become Russian subjects and to settle in Semirechya.

Visit of the Governor-General of Turkistan to St. Petersburgh. —General Samsonof has been summoned to St. Petersburgh. 397. — Mutiny near Tashkend.'-To the causes for discontent given in Diary 30/paragraph 364, must be added the irregular issue of clothing to the troops. It is said that some company commanders compelled their men to buy clothirA; at their own expense as it was not issued according to regulation by the Intendancek^ It is, however, now certain that the outbreak was to a large extent political in char acter. The village of Niazbeg, close to the camp at Troitskoye (which itself lies 20 miles from Tashkend) was the centre of a revolutionary propaganda. It is reported that the Tashkend garrison was in communication with troops at other stations, including Kushk. The outbreak in the Troitskoye camp, however, took place prematurely : no disorders have been reported from other stations. An enquiry is being opened under the presidency of Major-General Klimas- hevski. 3 ring-leaders (sappers) fled to Chimkent, where they have been arrested. The prisoners are being brought into Tashkend from Troitskoye in small batches. The Turkistan newspapers are not permitted to publish full accounts and there are other indications that there is still unrest among the troops. The present visit of the Governor-General to St. Petersburgh is said to be connected with the mutiny. 398. Departure of the Russian Consul-General in Khorasan—Viince Dabija left Meshed for Russia on sick leave on 22nd August 1912. Military. 399.

The de tachment will rejoin its regiment at Askhabad via Robat. ^No reconnaissances have been carried out recently to the south or south-east from Meshed. The Persian Governor of Bakharz has been warned that a party of 2 officers, 25 Cossacks, and 7 gun (maxim ?) will shortly pass through his district. (Note by Military Attache. —The Russians have already a small post at Karez, on the Herat road, in the Bakharz District. It is not known if the present is a move ment in relief or a reconnaissance). 402. — Reduction of the Russian garrisons in Khorasan. —The troops marched from Meshed, as detailed in Diary 32, paragraph 396, on August 18th and 21st. The mounted troops are expected to reach Askhabad (177 miles) in 10 days’ and the infantry in 14. Transport was almost entirely hired fourgons. Battalion headquarters, 3 companies, band, and mounted scout detachment of the 13th Turkistan Rifle Regiment arrived at Meshed from Kuchan on 18th August 1912. The battalion marched, with band playing, to its camp by a cir cuitous route through the city. Strength about 400 all ranks. 403. Health of Russian troops. —20 sick (light cases) accompanied the troops which marched out on 21st August 1912. They were carried in fourgons. When the sickness was at its worst at Meshed, the Semirechya Cossacks alone had 130 cases of dysentery and fever. The death of 46 Russian soldiers is reported from Asterabad. There was also heavy mortality (apparently due to fever) in the garrison of Kushk during July. Resources. 404. Development of the Aral Sea district. —About 150 fishing boats, of from 30 to 60 tons each are at work now on the Aral Sea. Fish is salted and despatch ed to Russia by the Tashkend railway. Steamers belonging to Nijegorod owners carry Russian manufactured goods to Khiva and raw cotton from Khiva to Aralsk village. The trade of the latter has an annual turn-over of £500,000. It lies on a peninsula in the Sari chagan gulf, on the shores of which are several Rus sian fishing villages. The “ Turkistan Gazette ” points out that so far every thing has been done by private enterprise. Government should now assist by building a harbour at Aralsk, improving communication by the Sir Darya, and doubling the Tashkend railway from Orenburg to Aralskoye More (Aral Sea) station. 405. Petroleum. —A spring which appeared on Cheleken Island in July is cal culated to yield 800 tons of oil. 406. Locusts. —Operations for the destruction of locusts are proceeding in the Hi valley and in the Ferovsk and Chimkent districts. , Military. 407.

State of Provinces. —The sarbazes continue to worry the Hajji Nasir-es-Sul- taneh for their pay. I hear they have succeeded in getting a few krans each out of him, but as the men want several months pay they naturally are not satis fied. The Hajji Nasir-es-Sultaneh.—It was hoped this official, deputed by Tehran to assist us in obtaining settlement of our out-standing claims against the Persian Government on account of Afghan robberies 2 years ago, would have been of help to us. For a time he seemed to be doing something in the matter, and a few weeks ago, he told me it was a question of a few days only, until these claims would be paid up. Settlement, however, has not been arrived at yet, and, I think it questionable, if the Hajji is now doing much, if anything at all, to attain that end. I have requested His Britannic Majesty’s Minister to assist me by bringing pressure to bear on the Hajji in Tehran. Shaukat-xd-Mulk. —His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, in his diary No. 33 for the week ending 13th August 1912, mentioned that the Shau- kat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kain, had written to the Governor of Herat, urging him to anex Kain, and if not, to allow him to reside in Afghanistan. The Shaukat denies having written such a letter. I think it not unlikely either there has been some confusion in names or that one of the Hashmat’s supporters sent the letter in order to get the Shaukat into bad odour in Tehran. The Shaukat has sent a secret agent to Herat to investigate. Russian Consul. —His Britannic Majesty’s Vice Consul, Birjand, informs me that Baron Tchercassov has received orders to return to Sistan, and that he leaves Birjand for here at once. Mr. Howson heard indirectly that the Baron received a very kind letter from the Russian Minister, telling him to return to Sistan, and promising him a much better post after six months.

The birthday of the Shah was observed with much nth August, pomp by the Governor-General, who spent much money out of his own pocket. At the dinner, by a mistake, the band did not play the Russian National Anthem.* Seeing that the Karguzar was oblivious of the fact, I suggested to the Governor- General to propose the health a second time, after warning the band. This was done, and I received a grateful message from His Highness for having saved the situation. The Nameday of the Tsarevitch.—The Officers’ Club invited us to celebrate 12 th August, the nameday of the Tsarevitch. The General proposed his health, and after that there was dancing. Quarters for Russian Troops. —A large house has been engaged for the three isth August, companies, which are coming from Kuchan, not very far from this Consulate- General. The Kabul Rupee. —The Afghan authorities are considering a scheme for 14 th August buying up Kabul rupees at Meshed, and then refusing to allow Persian two- Kran pieces to circulate in Afghanistan. The scheme is unlikely to be carried out. The Kabul rupee is', in reality, a two-kran piece, but its value is less than that of the similar coin minted in Persia. Russian Activity at Shahrud and Astrabad. —I hear that the Russians have 15 th August purchased for a nominal price a large tract of land at Kheirat, two farsakhs from Shahrud. They are hated by the Turkoman, as they send out Cossacks to recover debts, and also flog Turkomen freely. In short, the Russian Consul is described as the Governor of the district. 2. Affray on the Russo-Afghan Frontier.- —A month ago, a gang of Firuzkuhs stole sixty camels, some of them with loads, from Tejend. Thirty were sold at Merv, but the remainder were pursued by Cossacks, and overtaken near Ak Robat. There was a skirmish during which there were casualties on both sides : the Cossacks having two men wounded. The Talib-ul-Hak. — ^Reference to entry of 6th August. The Persian Govern- i6 t h August, ment have abused the Karguzar for not taking stronger action in the case of the Talib-ul-Hak. In reply, it has been pointed out that he was one of Prince Dabija’s proteges, and that no strong action is possible until his departure. Proposed New Chief of Police. — The Nejd-u-Dola, son of the Nizam-u-Sultana, nth August, has been appointed Chief of Police. The present Chief has recently received a robe of honour, and promotion to the rank of General: so it is evidently thought that it is high time to dismiss him. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kain, has written to the Governor of Herat to urge him to annex Kain, and, if not, to allow him to reside in Afghanistan. The Governor has referred the matter to Kabul. State of Road. —The Turkoman on the Tehran road have carried off six women and some children. Muhammad is still in the Nishapur district, and recently seized three horses, which belonged to the Ismailis of Dizbad.- Movements of Russian Troops. —The Governor-General has informed the Shuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz, that two officers and 25 Cossacks with one gun will shortly march through his district. The General and officers dined at the Consulate last night. General Redko made a speech, thanking the colony for its friendliness and hospitahty. He referred especially to the help given by Captain Wilson, who has saved one or more lives. Captain Blair has also assiduously worked to improve relations. It is satisfactory to know that the entente has been re-established, and that it is likely to continue. J P. M. SYKES, Major, His Brittanic Majesty’s Consul-General. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C.-420 F.

Hunter, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 35, for the week ending 31sf August (received 15th September) 1912. GENERAL. State of Provinces.—In the beginning of the week some 200 Baluchis who had accompanied Sirdar Khudadad Khan on his recent Sarhad expedition, gathered in the town here to demand their pay. They were told to go to the Haji Nasir-es- Sultaneh, who, evidently afraid of what might happen otherwise, paid most of the Baluchis, at least part of the pay due them. Some 50 men of the Gurgich tribe were not paid anything, as Sirdar Khudadad Khan said that they had return ed from Sarhad, without his permission. These men surrounded the Haji next day, when in the Customs House, and threatened to shoot him, if he did not pay them, and had it not been for Mirza Sadiq Khan of the Customs, who succeeded in calming the mens’ excitement, things might have been serious for the Haji. Short ly afterwards the Deputy Governor, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, cleared the men out of the town. • The Kaini sarbazes stationed here also clamoured for their pay, which, I hear has been pocketed by the Governor for a long time past, but the Haji put them off for a time by promising to telegraph to Tehran about the matter. Russian Consul .—I hear that Baron Tcherkassov’s transfer has been can celled. I understand the transfer was not meant to be a censure, but to give him an opportunity to withdraw his letter.

Death of Haji Abdur Rahim. —Reference to first para, of the summary of diary 5th August, No. 27. Haji Abdur Rahim has apparently committed suicide. He dissolved his diamond ring, according to one account, and drank the mixture. He wu,s an * especially Rise and intriguing individual. The Examination of the Agitators. —My colleague himself attended the exami- 6th August, nation of the Talib-ul-Hak, whom he had promised protection in return for services rendered, as mentioned in the first para, of the summary of diary No. 24. He insisted that he was innocent, and should be released. The Governor-General has telegraphed on the subject to Tehran. A second witness was asked whether Yusuf had any relations with the British Attache. He replied in the negative. 2. Departure of the Russian Police Officer. —Kharonoff, who acted as Police Officer when the Persian Police were arrested, left for Askabad with three wagons. His share of the loot is estimated at 60,000 roubles or £6,000. Owing to his position he had exceptional chances. Sickness among the Russians.—Thexe is much sickness among the Russians. 7th August, Their sanitary condition is not much higher than that of the Persians. The Murder of the Revenue Official at Birjand.—M. Leleux has openly accused 8th August, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk of the murder. The latter has telegraphed to Tehran to de fend him against the aspersions of a low individual, who was a wine-seller. The Ilkhani of Kuchan. —The Russians have sent a force of Cossacks, and seized a village near Meshed which is the property of the Ilkhani, who is said to owe the Bank a large sum. He has telegraphed to Tehran that he will protect himself, unless justice be done. Russian Artillery Competition. —We were invited to witness a shooting compe- 9th August, tition between the various guns of the battery. The range was only 900 yards. The shooting seemed to be moderate, and the slow way everything was done, was noticeable. 2. The Governor-General.—The Governor-General and leading officials lunched at the Consulate. His Highness is much worn, and the Karguzar has a hunted look. However, they are delighted with the news of the departure of my colleague. Two Murders of Russian Soldiers by Afghans.—The Herat Agent reports that 10 th August, two Russian soldiers were murdered some time ago by an Afghan cam, van, which was crossing into Afghanistan. Also that a gang of Achakzais murdered two more soldiers. The Afghan General has complained to Kabul that the Governor has not caught the murderers. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —My colleague, who called to say good-bye, states that he is leaving on 22nd August. The report has spread that he has gone mad. State of Roads. —Huseinzada, who is still at Miandasht, has telegraphed to the Governor-General to the effect that he will kill him for commencing the repairs of the shrine. This telegram was sent through our Attache. Huseinzada was once the head of the revenue office, and well-known at Meshed. I hear that the Gover nor of Shahrud is placing him in charge of the road. He only seizes arms and opium. Fifty Turkoman are again looting near Meiomei.Muhammad Nishapuri was recently in the hills near Zushk. He is now rob bing on the Turbat road. Devarture of the Russian Troops. —It is almost certain that about one-half of the Russian troops in Khorasan will leave about 20th August. As over one thousand will remain, the military occupation will continue as before. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Brittanic Majesty’s Consul-General. -\ 4 G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C.-406 F.

Communications. a Railways. ^ i b 1 ; 372. Termez Railway. —A party headed by Engineer Andreef is about to make a reconnaissance for the Termez Railway. Katta Kurghan appears to be the best point for the line to leave the Central Asian Railway. 25,000 tons of raw cotton and 10,000 tons of wheat are despatched from this station in good years. The engineer ing difficulties between Katta Kurghan and Karshi are slight whereas, if the line commences from Juma, the alignment will meet mounds and, if from Khagan, there are both mounds and hills to be faced. 373. Semirechya Railway. —The formation of the Semirechya Railway Com pany has been formally approved. The company receives the right to work the line for 81 years from the date of the opening of the first section. The railway, of normal (Russian) gauge, is to be built from Aris station (on the Tashkend Railway) via the village of Maldibai to Pishpek, a distance of about 357 miles. Branches are then to be constructed from Pishpek to Tokmak and from some station on the Aris-Pishpek line to Vyerni. The original capital of the line is to be £515,000, of which half is to be paid up within a year, when the concession will be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance. 375. Condition of Fergana. —Cases of robbery and brigandage in Fergana are constantly occurring. They are due to the rise in prices which has followed the development of the cotton industry, the exactions of usurers, and the weakness of the rural police. The numbers of the last-named are being increased and it is pro posed to establish a Peasants' Bank. 376. Afghan and Bokharan trade. —The working of the new passport regulations for Afghan subjects and the expulsion from the Samarkand Province of Bokharan Jews are causing great inconvenience. Trade with Afghanistan has diminished by half and that with Bokhara has greatly decreased. 377. Population of Sir Darya Province .—The population of the province in 1910 was 1,911,464, (1,023,762 males and 887,702 females). The tendency for nomad Kirghiz to settle and adopt agriculture is strongly marked : the area of culti vated land in the Perovsk and Kazalinsk Districts is ten times larger than it was 15 years ago. Europeans form 7'08 per cent of the population (^.e., 135,331). 378. Russian immigration.—BztvtQzn 14th January 1912 and 14th JulyJ1912 a nett total of 3,600 Russians passed through the Tashkend Settlement Office. 379. Shahsevan rising.—General Fidarof s column has occupied Elikeduk. ^One battalion of the Tiflis regiment and 2 sotnias of Cossacks have been despatched to reinforce the troops operating against the Shahsevans (telegram published 23rd July 1912). 600 Turkish Kurds have pillaged the village of Khassiskomae. The “ Turkistan Gazette ” observes that the present operations against the Shahsevans and the Kurds resemble the long-drawn-out struggle m the^ Caucasus. Ethnography. History.. ,1 - ;i i( !if 9 in i If II i/' i' It is only due to the protection of Russian detachments that caravans have been able to move at all during the last 3 years. In 1911, £300,000 worth of goods were ex ported to Persia through Astara and Ardebil and £120,000 worth imported to Russian territory. The subjugation of the mountaineers is therefore of great commercial importance. It is incorrect to attribute the hostility of the Shahsevans to loyalty to the e.x-Shah, who has been deposed by Russia. The reason is rather to be found in the inflammation of Muhammadan feeling caused by the Turco-Italian war and to an instinctive fear that Russia is destined to put a stop to their profitable profes sion of brigandage. 380. Mutiny near Captain Jiltsof, of the 2nd Turkistan Sapper Battalion, who distinguished himself in the suppression of the mutiny, has been specially promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. Military. 381. Training. —The 20th Turkistan Rifle Regiment from Jarkent went into camp at Tishkan for training on 14th July 1912. Detachments from Cossack and Turkistan Rifle Regiments are attached to the 1st and 2nd Sapper Battalions for courses of instruction. 382. Registration of transport.—AW serviceable transport animals have been registered at Sarakhs. 383 Aviation. —A meeting of the Turkistan Society of Aviation was to take place at the Military Staff Offices at Tashkend on 27th July 1912. The com mittee was to be elected and M. Krilofs proposal for the opening of a school of aviation at Tashkend to be considered. One aeroplane, for instructional purposes, has already arrived. 384. Reduction of Russian garrisons in Khorasan. —The reductions reported in Diary 29. paragraph 351, will take place almost at once. The battalion of the 18th Turkistan Rifle Regiment (now at Meshed) will, however, return to Trans-Caspia and the battalion of the 13th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, which is at Kuchan, will be transferred to Meshed. The number of troops (approximately 1,100) to be left in Khorasan remains the same. The troops will leave Meshed in two echelons, on August 18th and 21st. General Redko is expected to leave on the 22nd. 385. Meshed garrison.—TWz Russian Field Hospital is crowded with dysentery cases and a large number of men are being treated in camp. 386. Persian /orces.—Present in Meshed and receiving pay Artillerymen (Kazvinis) 131 ; Infantry (Turshizis and Karis), 245 ; Persian Cossacks, 52 ; Band, 35 ; Sowars (Timuri 55, Bujnurdi 51, Khaji 10) 126 ; total 589. About 100 men have now been enlisted for the Treasury Gendarmerie and are receiving pay. They are to draw 12 tumr.ns a month in Meshed and 18 when on duty outside. The men provide their own horses and rifles and receive uniform from the Persian Government. They are being drilled by two instructors. Of these one, Mirza Hussain Tabrizi, has received some military training at Tehran : the other is Ghulam Haider, an ez-sowar of the Q. O. Corps of Guides, discharged 3 years ago as insane. Resources. 387. Harvest. —This year’s harvest in Turkistan is exceptionally good. Prices for oats are, however, so low in the nearest districts of European Russia that troop are finding it profitable to order their supplies of this article from Russia. The harvest in Khorasan, which has been almost completely reaped, is also very good. G. L. BLAIR, Captain, Offg. Military Attache. G. M. Press, Simla—No. C. 402 F.

Movement of Ackahmi and Nurzai .—The Herat Agent, in reply to my inquiry, reports that members of the above tribes have moved from the Kandahar to the Herat province, as they disliked the Governor of Kandahar. This disposes of the rumour mentioned in my diary entry of 28th May. The Examination of the Agitators .—A representative from the Russian Con sulate-General is attending the examination of the agitators by the Persian author ities. He insists upon any evidence, which is unfavourable to the Russians, being cut out. As this evidence maybe used to prove the innocence of my colleague, it is important to know how it is being cooked. Haji Sheikh Rais .—I have exchanged visits with the well known liberal leader. His brother is an old friend of mine. Migration of Hazaras .—A large number of Hazara families has crossed the frontier to join the section of the tribe, which has been well treated by the Afghan authorities. M. Grigorieff and the Karguzar.—The Karguzar informed me that M. Grigori- eff had said to him that the day Prince Dabija left, he would consult me as to how various questions should be settled, and that the entente would be re-estab lished. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province .—Some days ago, the Revenue Collector was killed at Birjand. My Russian colleague has actually written to the Governor-General to the effect that unless the murderers are seized and punished, severe action will be taken by him. The Governor-General!^showed this letter to the Attache, and asked if would support him, if he took a strong line. I deprecated anything of the kind, I and pointed out that Prince Dabija was leaving: but I promised to report the mat ter to the Legation. My colleague expects to leave in abofft a week or ten days. I gave a farewell dinner in his honour on 1st August. He gives out that he will return in the autumn. State of the roadfc.—Husseinzada has recently robbed Salar Khan, the Baluch brigand, who was besieged, and escaped some two years ago. Other robberies as usual. Movements of Russian Troops.—The Karguzar told me that the Russians were arranging to send a sotnia of Cossacks to Sistan, and that it had suddenly been stopped. This corroborates my report on the subject. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General. 28th July. 30th July. 31st July.GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications . Railways. 355.

Russian Population. —The latest estimates put the Russian rural popu lation at:— Trans-Caspia • • 4,775 Samarkand .. • • 4,804 Fergana • • 8,782 Sir Darya • • 40,234 History. 360. Shahsevan Rising. —Lieutenant-Colonel Radchenko’s column has marched for Meshkin from Duzan. General Fidarof’s column of 1,600 men at Sumarin has been joined by 400 Persian cavalry with some guns. It is said that 4,000 men of the Khoja Beg tribe took part in the skirmishes of July 12th and 13th near Ahar. 361. Accident on the Oxus .— Three men of the Oxus Flotilla were drowned in a boat accident near Termez. It is stated that the accident was due to inexperience and that the men of the Flotilla are insufficiently trained for their duties. 362. Theft of Arms .— Fifty Smith and Wesson revolvers have been stolen from the Samarkand Artillery Depot. 363. Turbulent Turkomans .—The sentences reported in Diary No. 25, para graph 289, have been reduced as follows:—Death sentences to 4 years’ penal servi tude, the sentence of 15 years’ penal servitude passed on the ex-orderly to 3J years’ imprisonment, and the other sentences to 8 months’ imprisonment in each case. 364. Mutiny near Tashkend.-—The “Turkistan Gazette,” of 17th July 1912, gives the following account of the mutiny which took place in the summer camp at Troitskoye (near Tashkend) on 14th July 1912. At 8-30 p.m. some 100-130 men of the 1st and 2nd Turkistan Sapper Batta lions left the camp, with their rifles and ammunition, and endeavoured to induce the other troops to follow them. Finding themselves unsuccessful, they opened fire on the companies as they formed up under their officers. A large number of sappers left the camp during the fighting which ensued, their motive being either fear or a wish not to be involved in the disturbance. By 2 a.m. the muti- for the outbreak, which is stated to have been unexpected. The total casualties wereStaff-Captain Rokhvisnef and 2nd-Lieutenant Krasovski killed; 2nd Lieu-mm 2 tenant Koshchenets subsequently died of his wounds (all three officers of the 2nd Turkistan Sappers); 3 officers wounded; 1 non-commissioned officer died of wounds and 2 men killed; and 11 men wounded. A later number of the same newspaper corrects the number of prisoners to 174, which probably represents the number held for trial. Additional information from other sources is to the effect that some men of the 1st Turkistan Rifles also took part in the mutiny, and that the mutineers seized 8 machine-guns. The reason for the outbreak is said to have been discontent caused by bad rations, low pay, and onerous conditions of service (sappers serve 4 years as compared with the infantrymen’s 3 ). The troops were also in a disturbed state of mind, because they had heard that they were going to be sent to Persia. [Note by Military Attache. —During the troubles of 1905-06 in Turkistan the Sapper battalions were notably disloyal. These units have a higher proportion of educated men than other arms and are therefore more open to seditious influences.] 365. Afghan News. —A report from Herat does not confirm the statement that large quantities of arms and ammunition have arrived from Kabul. (See Diary No. 23, paragraph 307), nor the rumours that the Afghan posts on the Russian frontier have been strengthened. A considerable number of Achakzais have arrived to settle near Herat. It is expected that when the Kandahar-Hcrat road has been improved as far as Farah, the Governor of Herat will be ordered to carry on the work. At present nothing is being done on the Farah-Herat section. Military. 366. Conduct of Russian troops. —The General Officer Commanding the Tur kistan Military District has issued a complimentary order, thanking General Redko and the troops of the Khorasan Detachment for their good behaviour in Persian territory. Staff-Captain Kharanof (Provost-Marshal at Meshed) is specially mentioned for good work. [Note by Military Attache .— General Kedko is a strict disciplinarian and the conduct of the troops stationed at Meshed under his immediate supervision has, on the whole, been satisfactory. Drunkenness is rare. It is noticeable that the major ity of minor complaints (e. g., of men taking fruit in the bazar without paying for it) are made against the Cossacks, who appear to be less well disciplined than the men of the 18th Turkistan Rifles. Two cases of soldiers molesting Persian women have been reported. In spite of strict orders against all intercourse with Persian women, venereal disease is appearing among the troops. Concealment of disease is being practised: on several occasions Russian soldiers have applied for treat ment at the free hospital attached to the British Consulate-General. The conduct of the Cossack posts along the Meshed-Kuchan road and of Cossack patrols has been bad. Apart from the murder committed near Kazimabad (see Diary No. 29, paragraph 349), there have been constant complaints of Cossacks molesting women and robbing villagers]. 367. Reduction of Russian Garrisons in Khorasan. —Forage and provisions, which were previously purchased in large quantities, are now only being bought at Meshed for a few days at a time. There are other indications that the troops detailed to return to Trans-Caspia (see paragraph 351 of last week’s Diary) are expecting orders to march. 368. Registration of Transport. The registration of privately-owned horses by the Askhabad Military Remount Office commenced on 17th July 1912. The chiefs of the Turkoman tribes near Merv, Yolatan, and Tash Kepri have been ordered to supply returns of transport and riding animals. Resources. 369. Cotton. It is estimated that Khiva produced about 5,000 and Bokhara from 19,000 to 24,000 tons of cleaned cotton in 1911. . 370. Minerals. Mr. Scott, who is working in the interests of English capi talists, is investigating the possibilities of mining for coal in the Kopal, Djungar, Alatai, and Lepsin districts. 371. Locusts. Locusts, which are supposed to have come from Bokharan territory, have appeared in the Samarkand District. G. W. BLAIR, Captain. Offg. Military Attache. G. M. Press, Simla,—No. C. 382 F.

Sartip Muhammad Beza Khan will become Deputy Governor, when his brother leaves Sistan. General. to his departure for Kainat, nothing of importance has occurred during the week. Roads .—No robberies reported. With the exception of the Hashmat’s move out to Kaimabad, preparatoryThe Deportation of Aga Mirza Ibrahim. —The Governor-General has ordered 20 th July, Aga Mirza Ibrahim, one of the leaders of the agitation, to leave Meshed. He will probably be allowed to return in the winter. The Governor-General and M. Leleux. —The Governor-General has been threa- 23rd July, tened that unless he helps M. Leleux, M. Mornard will stop his pay. In reply, he has said that he will make a gift c&gt;f his pay to the Persian Government: but that unless the various departments receive their pay, he cannot rule the province. The Journey of Mr. Evans. —Mr. Evans, lately in charge of the Kerman Tele- 25th July, graph Section, has passed through Meshed. He is, so far as I know, the first European to cross the Lut in summer. He describes the heat as terrific, and states that there were numerous bands of robbers. POLITICAL SUMMAKY. State of the Province.—The news of the week is the departure of my colleague. A week ago Captain Wilson was asked to attend a board, which decided that he must leave for Russia without delay. He gives out that he will return in a month : but Captain Wilson considers it unlikely that he will return to Persia. I have heard from a reliable source that the General bitterly resented my visit to the Shrine on the theory that it was theirs by right of conquest. He tried to persuade my colleague to avoid this Consulate, and this was done by him for some weeks. The General himself has never visited the Consulate since the bombard ment The egregious Colonel Scourratt obtained a sword studded with jewels, and much other loot. Part of this he had to give up, and he bears me a grudge for this. My informant, who saw the sword, says that it was kept hidden away. The above is from a reliable European, and corroborates previous information. The Limits of the Bast. —The Bast has been restored to its original limits with the exception of a covered bazaar. If the Persian Government are wise, they will now limit it themselves, but this is unlikely. State of the Roads. —The Berberis, who live in the Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam district, have raided a village, belonging to the Malik-u-Tuj jar of Tehran. My colleague has urged the Governor-General to take action, and sixty sowars have been sent. Huseinzada is still holding Miandasht. He is levying blackmail and ransoms, and states that he will build a bath with the proceeds. Movements of Russian troops. —It is reported that in the autumn the Russian garrison in Khorasan will be reduced from about two thousand to eleven hundred men. The sotnia of Turkoman has already been sent back. This shows that there is no intention of giving up Khorasan, and no doubt the Shah Sivand operations afford a plausible excuse. A par tv consisting of one officer and eight Cossacks, has visited the famous natural fortress of Kalat-i-Nadiri, and surveyed it. Persians attach enormous im portance to this remarkable natural wonder, which, m their hands, possesses no military importance. . The Governor-General is very bitter about the Russians, who are robbing freelv both from shops and in the country. Some villagers have already been killed both by stray bullets, and also by playing with unexploded shell of which quite a number have been picked up. Perhaps, the greatest wrong inflicted is that the villagers in some cases have been unable to reap their crops. From the frontier near Chaacha, I hear that gardens planted fifty years ago have been destroyed and that many hundreds of villagers are without food. As there is a force of six hundred Russians marching from place to place, the peasants, who are probably quite ignorant of the Protocol, are suffering terribly, even villages being destroyed. P. M.

He is expected to leave Meshed about the middle ot August. 347. Shahsevan mm?.—Russian newspapers report that the Shasevans en deavoured to seizeAhar on 8th July 1912 but withdrew on the approach of the Russian column. The Officer Commanding at Ahar issued a proclamation declaring that the column had come to punish the Shahsevans who had insolently dared to attack Russian detachments near Ardebil and had killed Russian officers and men The peaceful population had nothing to fear from the troops. Jn skirmisher Nefeyal (near Ahar) on July 12th and 13th the Russians lost 3 men killed and 1 officer and 6 men wounded. Persian troops are co-operating with the Russians. On 21st July 1912 a memorial service was held at Meshed for those killed in action against the Shahsevans. Reports indicate that the Russians have suffered heavy losses, but accurate information is not obtainable here. Military. 348. Projected. Russian cantonment at Meshed. — No further signs ofactivitv are noticeable. The Russians have not taken delivery of the 200 large beams men tioned in Diary No. 24, paragraph 277. Of the 2,000 planks and 500 small beams ordered by them, (see Diary No. 25, paragraph 295), some have been used as flooring for tents and the remainder for the construction of targets. 349. Meshed garrison. —Fever is prevalent among the troops, especially in the 1st Semirechya Cossack Regiment. The men of this unit are said to be weakened by the unhealthiness of their peace station, Katta Kurghan. Last week the men of the Cossack post at Kazimabad (11 miles north-west of Meshed) killed a Persian traveller and reported the occurrence as an attack by robbers.

The infantry battalion has 15 horses, 2 cooking carts, and 3 2-wheeled trans port carts and the Cossacks have also 2 cooking carts and 3 2-wheeled carts. Ihe sotnia furnishes posts on the Kuchan-Bajgiran road. The sotnia of the Turkoman Irregular Mounted Division has been withdrawn. It is said that the men disliked serving so far away from their homes and showed signs of becoming too friendly with the Kurdish population. The troops are now under canvas in a garden, hired from the Persian Gov ernor on the north-east of the town. Horses and guards remain in serais inside the town. A temporary rifle range has been constructed about H miles to the west of Kuchan. The town is reported to be quiet. 351 Reduction of Meshed and Kuchan garrisons.—Information has been ob tained from sources which are usually reliable that General Redko has received orders to withdraw the 4th Kuban Cossack Battery, the sotmas of the Taman and Caucasus Cossacks now at Meshed, and the battalion, 13th Turkistan Rifle Regi ment to Trans-Caspia. The date of the withdrawal is not yet known. General Redko to hand over command to the Officer Commanding Semirechya Cossacks. One company of the 18th Turkistan Rifle Regiment to move to Kuchan from Meshed. These arrangements would leave the garrisons at : — Meshed.

Hunter, I.M.S., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 32, for the week ending 10th August 1912. Birjand Incident—The Shaukat-ul-Mulk has assured Mr. Howsonthat he will inflict severe punishment on the policemen, who assaulted the late Director of Opium and Land Revenue, Birjand. I hear a new Director has been appointed, and also that the Director of Customs, Meshed, Monsieur Leleux, is sending about 100 sowars to Birjand. A ttempt by Russians to bring certain people in Kainat under Russian protection. —His Britannic Majesty’s Minister has informed me that enquiries made by the Russian authorities from the Russian Consul here shew that protection was promised to the Chief of the Nakhai tribe, Hussain Kuli Khan, and Lis family, at the Chiefs request, but that there was no intention to bring the whole tribe under Russian protection. In the Russian Consul’s letter to the Chief the word used for family was “ bastagan ” which has a somewhat elastic meaning, and might be applied, if desired, to a number of people, not members of the Chief’s family . # HasJimat-ul-MulJc .—The Hashmat tells me he has received permission from Tehran to go to Kainat, and intends leaving Sistan for there very shortly. Return of Sirdar Khudadad Khan from Sarhad. —Sirdar Khudadad Khan arrived here at the end of last week. He was the last of the Sistani lashkar to return. He has recovered many thousands of sheep and goats, looted by Baluch raiders from Kainat. Practically all these sheep have been sent to the Sirdar’s own village. Nearly 100 Kainis came here recently to claim their looted animals which, seemingly, they had been given to understand would be handed over to them on Sirdar Khudadad Khan’s return to Sistan. So far all they have had handed over to them are some old and decrepit goats. These people have nothing, and are now begging in the bazaar. Roads. —Nothing to report. General. 16SEP1S12CONFIDENTIAL.

So far the Governor-General has sheltered himself behind his orders from Tehran. relations of the boy actually paid 150 tomans to the Governor in order to have the sentence carried out at Baik. State of the Province. —With reference to entries in the diary, respecting action by the Russian authorities near Chaacha, I hear that there is to be a Commission on the matter. This will be composed of five Russians and five Persians. M. Grigorieff heads the Russian party. This is unfortunate for us, as he alone is easy to deal with. The other member of the Consulate staff is well meaning, but a nonentity and hardly in possession of all his faculties. He was off his head two years ago. The Karguzar, as I feared, is quite incompetent. I have had to threaten to complain to Tehran, unless he settles our cases. Saiyid Ali Sistani, who escaped from prison at Kalat, and joined Yusuf, has been seized, and sent back to Kalat-i-Nadiri. Behaviour of Russian Troops. —I continue to hear that the Russians rob the villagers, and are trying to seduce their women. No case of actual rape has been reported. A few days ago one of the sons of the deported, Haji Abdur Rahim, struck the road near one of the Russian posts. Knowing that his rifle, and that of his servants would be seized, he rode away on seeing a patrol. His party was pur sued, and one of his servants was shot. He fell from his horse wounded, and was apparently finished off by the Cossacks, as his skull was broken. He was also ripped. State of the roads.—A body of robbers is holding the Tehran-Meshed road, and all traffic is suspended. There are practically no pilgrims this year which means a heavy loss to the inhabitants of Meshed. August) 1912.

Both the Russian Consul-General and the local military authorities are opposing the withdrawal. Resources. 340. Export of Cotton. —The total export of cotton from Russian Central Asia in 1911 was 210,000 tons. Of this amount 135,000 tons was exported via Kras- novodsk and the remainder by the Tashkend railway. 341. Locusts. —Locusts have appeared in the Perovsk and Chimkent Districts. They have not yet been entirely destroyed in the Kara Kala pristavstvo of the Askhabad District. 342. Irrigation. —A Commission will shortly arrive to examine the irrigation possibilities of the rivers Hi, Chilik, and Charin. 343. Fisheries. The Trans-Caspian Review, of 11th July 1912, states that the fisheries of the Aral and Caspian Seas and of the lakes and rivers of Central Asia yield a total of 105,000 tons of fish annually, of a value of £2,500,000.

M.S., His Britannic Majesty’s ^ Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 31, for the week ending 3rd (received 16th) August 1912- Fatal assault on the Birjand Director of Customs. —Mirza Ibrahim Khan, the 29 th July. Customs Director in Birjand, in charge of the collection of revenue, was assaulted to-day by the Birjand policemen and died, shortly afterwards, from his injuries. Two Customs gendarmes were wounded and taken to the Russian hospital. Two of his mirzas sought protection in our Vice-Consulate, and one with the Russian Consul. The payment of the policemen’s salaries had been entrusted to the deceased by the Director of Customs, Meshed, and he had paid them one month’s pay, but for the past two months had not paid the men anything, putting them off, saying he had received no further orders to do so. This is said to have been the cause of the assault. The Revenue office was closed, the mirzas taking the papers, money, etc., to the Vice-Consulate with them. The Governor has ordered the arrest of the guilty police. Re-opening of Birjand Revenue Office. —The Revenue office was re-opened to- 3 rd August, day, the Head mirza being temporarily in charge. General. —The assault on the Customs Agent in Birjand in the beginning of the week, caused at the time some excitement, but it quickly died down. The police are local men, so this incident may, perhaps, be considered as shewing the trend of public feeling against the revenue officials, who, through their inexperience and their faulty methods of administration, have already been the cause of public demonstration against their department. ( Please see Diaries No. 12, dated 23rd March 1912, and No. 22, dated 1st July 1912.) I hear that the Director of Customs in Meshed, Monsieur Leleux, in a circular telegram to the directors under his orders in Khorasan and Sistan regarding this affair, practically imputed the asault to the instigation of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Shaukat heard about this, and at once telegraphed to Tehran, and to the Governor-General in Meshed, protesting and asking the Persian Government to insist on an apology. Attempt on part of Russians to bring a tribe in Kainat under Russian protec tion.—Recently the Russian Consul in an official letter to Hussain Kuli Khan, the headman of the Nakhai tribe, stated that he and those connected with him, at their request, had been taken under the protection of the Russian Consulate. The chief man lives at Khusf, just within the neutral zone, but many of the tribe, which comprises between 6,000 and 10,000 families, and is the largest tribe in the Kainat, are settled within our sphere of influence. I have communicated with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister on the subject. I understand that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk has telegraphed to his Government protesting against the action of the Russian Consul. Roads. —No change.'i- CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Consular Diary, No. 28, for the week ending 13th July (received 9th August) 1912, The Repair of the Shrine,— Governor-General, and the Shrine officials, sth July, attended in state to see His Highness lay three bricks with mortar, and thus start the repairs. The whole ceremony seemed to be strangely out of place. The Limits of the Bast. —The Persian Government is trying with the utmost 9th Jul 7* tenacity to have the limits of the Bast restored. My colleague is still receiving instructions on the subject. The Gendarmerie Sowars. — M. Leleux is raising 250 sowars for the purposes ioth July, of collecting the revenue. So far he has engaged fifty men, and, as they are not being paid, they are deserting. The Meshed Garrison. —The detachments of Kuchan and Bujnurd sowars have 11 th July- deserted as they were not being paid. So far M. Leleux has showed no signs of improving the financial position, which is one of chronic anarchy. The Harvest. — The harvest is now reaped, and is considered to be extremely 12 th July, good : but prices do not appear to have fallen. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —My colleague has induced the Governor-General to recom mend that 3,000 square yards of the Palace or Ark garden should be given or sold to the Russians for a hospital. He is anxious to drive a road through the garden to a point opposite the main gate of this Consulate. As this would be a serious inconvenience, I am addressing Tehran on the subject. There is apparently some truth in the report that my colleague by dint of heavy bribery has been allowed to remain at Meshed for five months. This is especially unfortunate as it is out of the question to have the friendly relations, which it is so very important to maintain with an individual, who cannot be truthful even on paper. The Russian Cantonment. —The civil engineer, previously referred to, besides examining the site purchased, was also seen to measure two vacant pieces of ground inside the Ark quarter. On one of these M. Leleux was intending to construct a wheat store : but my colleague has apparently vetoed this, although I have no details. The man Askarofi, who purchased the site for the cantonment, has been given a gold medal, as a reward for his services. State of the Roads. —Much as usual. Russian Troops. —There are the usual complaints regarding stealing fruit. Among the complainants is the Afghan Agent, who owns a garden some ten miles from Meshed. He states that every evening a body of soldiers rob his garden. I am 4 trying to stop this.O i ibi o j Enclosure ? --ef.ry, / n rf/,.

Hospital-cars. —Eive hospital-cars of an improved type, twice as large as those of the old pattern, have been received for the Central Asian Railway. The Tashkend line has no cars of the new type, 283. Refrigerator-cars. —The Tashkend Railway is about to organise the des patch to Russia of perishable goods (fish, butter, meat, game, etc). The railway possesses refrigerator-cars and cold storage has been provided at the following stationsTashkend, Turkestan, Perovsk, Kazalinsk, Chemsar, Embo, and My- enovoi Dvor. The service will commence in 1913. Telegraphs. 284. New Line. —Telegraphic communication has been opened between Tash kend and Chimgan. Navigation. 285. Caspian Sca.—The “Russia” ( Rus) Company will open a service (Trans- Caspia, Caucasus, Volga, Black Sea) from 14th July 1912. Its rates will be the same as those charged by the steamer companies which are already working. Ethnography. 286. Russian Immigration.—The “ Rossia ” states that there are now only 150 Russian villages with a total of 14,500 families of settlers in the whole of Turkistan. The density of the native population on the irrigated areas and the comparative infertility of unirrigated land are given as the main factors which check Russian immigration. Three thousand peasant families coming, for the most part, from Central Russia, will be placed on the land during 1912. Fifteen Russian villages have recently sprung up, along the Tashkend line, on land belonging to the railway. Arrangements are being made to regularise the settlers* tenure of the land. Immigrants for Semirechya are registered at Aris and those for the Samar kand, Fergana, and Sir Darya districts at Tashkend. The official figures, how ever, always understate the numbers of settlers as many do not register their names. Administration. 287. Education. —A secondary school, for Kirghiz only, will be opened at Chimkent this year. Geography. 288. Trans-Caspian Province. — The range between the pristavstvo s of Kara Kala and Durun has a height of 6,230 feet. History. 289. Turbulent Turkomans.—Oi the twenty-nine Turkomans tried at Askha- bad for murder and brigandage, fifteen were acquitted, four were condemned to death, and ten to various terms of penal servitude. An ex-native orderly of theTeien Administration was convicted of receiving stolen goods and condemned to U5 yearn’ penal servitude. A recommendation to mercy was, however, forwarded with these sentences. &lt;.1111 n 290. Frontier troubles.—On 18th June the Pristav of Askhabad with some Cossacks and about 500 Turkomans entered Persian territory ai^ destroyed crops belonging to Persian villagers near Chacha, Amirabad, and K ur. According to one account, some villagers were wounded. (Note by Military Attache.-Thz Persians are bound by treaty only to take a limited amount of water from streams which, lower down, are used to irrigate Russian territory. The Pristav was pro bably punishing real or alleged infringements of this provision.) Three men of the Frontier Guard have been killed on the Afghan frontier, near Kushk. 291 Frontier Guard.—The head-quarters of the 7th Frontier Guards District are to be transferred from Tashkend to Askhabad not later than November 1912. The Customs head-quarters will follow in 1913. 292. Training. —The officers and non-commissioned officers who took part in the Brigade Staff Ride returned to Tashkend on 9th June. Major-General Pozoef, Inspector of the Artillery of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps, left Tashkend on 2nd June to inspect the batteries at Samarkand, Kerki and Termez. 293. Sanatoriums . —The Sanatorium at Pyandj Ob (Panj Ab), for the use of the garrisons of Termez and Kerki, was opened on 14th June. All sickly men from Tashkend have been sent to Chimkent. 294. Proposed despatch of a Sotnia to Sistan.—The British Minister at Tehran has been informed by the Russian Legation that, if the statement that the mili tary authorities propose to send Cossacks to Sistan is correct, they can only be intended as reliefs for the Consular escort. (Note by Military Attache.—-The Russian Consular escort consists of 25 men). Local information at Meshed indicates that the question of the despatch of a sotnia has been referred to Army Corps Head quarters at Askhabad. 295. Russian Cantonment at Meshed. —A Russian civil engineer has arrived at Meshed. Five hundred beams and 2,000 planks have been purchased, but these are apparently required for floors for tents : the troops are now in camp in the Bagh-i-Mustofi. Resources. 296. Destruction of locusts. —It is stated that the locusts in the Famine Steppe have been completely destroyed. Reports as to the success of the operations in the Trans-Caspian Province are conflicting. 297. Cotton and wheat cultivation. —An article in the TurJcistan Gazette of 15th June 1912 points out that the necessity for cultivating cereals is checking the pro duction of cotton in Turkistan. Even now the Tashkend Railway imports 160- 240,000 tons of cereals annually from Russia to Turkistan: in 1910 the figure reached 290,000 tons. Reliable authorities state that the area sown for cotton this year is only |rds of that sown in 1911. Cereals and lucerne are being cultivated in place of cotton. 298. Dry Farming—The TurJcistan Gazette of 13th June 1912 has an article on the success of dry farming in certain Russian villages in Turkistan. 299. Liwerne.—The Turkistan Gazette of 18th June 1912 states that the profit from the export of lucerne amounts annually to more than £200,000. 300. Irrigation Projects. —The same paper (14th June 1912) states that twenty- one applications have been received for irrigation concessions. Details are given of the most important enterprises. Its number for 16th June 1912 describes Ananyef s concession at Shirabad and Baisun, in Bokharan territory. G. L. BLAIR, Captain, Offg. Military Attache. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C 336 F.

GENERAL SUMMARY; Communications. Roods. 314. Maintenance of roads. —The provincial administrations are responsible for the maintenance of roads and the 5 provinces spend about £32,000 in all yearly on this head. This sum is totally insufficient, but it is impossible for the provin- eial budgets to find more. It has been officially calculated that to metal all the important roads would cost nearly £6,500,000. The Governor-General’s Council has now proposed to the Minister for War that the Imperial Treasury should relieve the provincial budgets of the cost of the maintenance of magistrates and that the funds thus saved should be ear-marked for roads. 315. Pishpek-Arasan road. —A direct cart road is under construction from Pishpek to Arasan. The latter is a village with natural hot springs, standing about 7,000 feet above sea-level. There are already cart roads to Arasan from Pishpek (46 miles) and Tokmak (30 miles). 316. Tashkend-Chimgan road. —The road from Tashkend to the Governor- GeneraTs country house at Chimgan is fit for motor traffic. Administration. 317. Education. —In 1911 the Central Asian Railway maintained 25 schools, with 105 teachers and 2,834 pupils. Ethnography. 318. Russian immigration. —All suitable land in the Prjevalsk District is now occupied and settlers are being diverted to the Jarkent and Depsin Districts. There are 22 Russian villages in the Prjevalsk District. An Immigration Bureau for Trans-Caspia will be opened during 1913. In Semirechya an expedition, under Professor Sapojnikof, has left Vyerni to ex plore the Hi valley, the Kar Kara district and the Tian Shan mountains in the interests of the Immigration authorities. Military. 319. Study of Oriental Languages. —Five officers have completed the 8 months’* preparatory course of the School of Oriental Languages, Tashkend. Of these, two, Lieutenant Kondratyef of the 7th Turkistan Rifle Regiment and Lieutenant Gramolin of the 6th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, are studying Persian and Urdu, one officer Persian and Pushtoo, and the remaining two Persian and Sart. 320. Use of heliographs. —The signallers of the 7th and 8th Turkistan Rifle Regiments maintain a heliographic service between Osh and the sanatorium of Jalilabad (30 miles N. N. W. of Osh). 321. Promotion. —Major-General Voronof, Commander of the 1st Turkistan Rifle Brigade, is promoted Lieutenant-General and appointed Commander of the 6th Siberian Rifle Division. 322. Military IFor&amp;s.—Tenders are required for the following (amounts show approximate cost of work):— (1) Hutting for troops at Troitakoe (Tashkend District), £7,000. (2) Rebuilding of store for packing materials attached to the Artillery Store Depot at Vyerni, £540. Repair of supply magazine, £660. (3) Barrack latrine at Naryn, £160. ''D / '!TCk\2 (4) Cook-house and bakery for one sotnia of the Siberian Cossack Regi- * ment and cook-house for a company of the 21st Turkistan Rifle Regi ment at Jarkent, £1,000. (5) Barracks for the 1st Battery of the 6th Turkistan Rifle Artillery [Divi sion at Jarkent. (6) Barracks for a sotnia at Kulja. (5) and (6) together £3,400. (7) Repairs and new construction, supply magazine at Askhabad, £300. (8) Supply of a total of 382,100 bricks, wood-work to the value of £360, concrete and re-inforced concrete at Andijan. (3) and (7) to be finished by 14th November 1912. (1) and (2) „ „ 28th October 1912. (4) (5), and (6) „ „ 14th October 1913. 323. Russian occupation of Kashgar. —A detachment of two companies of infantry, with two machine-guns, and 300 Cossacks has marched from Irkeshtam for Kashgar to protect Russian subjects and the Russian Consulate. (Turkistan Gazette.) 324. Troops in N. W. Persia. —It is reported on reliable authority that 2 battalions of infantry, one regiment of Taman Cossacks, and 2 Kuban Cossack batteries (12 guns) have arrived at Ardebil from Baku for operations against the •Shahsevans. 2 sotnias of Taman Cossacks are at Barfurush. 325. Projected Russian cantonment at Meshed. —Before returning to Askhabad, as reported in last week’s Diary, the Russian Civil Engineer measured 2 pieces of land lying inside and to the north of the Ark Gate. On one piece the Persian customs intend to build a store-house, but the Russian Consul-General has pro tested against this (ground of protest not known). Negotiations are also pro ceeding with the Governor-General for the sale of land in the Ark quarter for a Russian hospital. The Engineer took with him to Askhabad tables showing rates for building materials at Meshed. The Trans-Gaspian Review says that it has heard that a “ fortification for a detachment of Russian troops ” will be built at a village near Meshed. 326. Transport. —According to reports 75 4-wheeled transport carts have been forwarded to Charjui from Merv and 24 to the same place from Tashkend. 327. Persian forces. —250 of the Treasury Gendarmerie will be stationed a! Meshed : they will be under the direct orders of the Director of Customs (Belgian). 50 men, including some Berberis (Hazaras) have already been enlisted but they are receiving no pay. The Persians have here 2 Creusot Quick Piring guns. A Russian officer who has examined them states that the recoil mechanism in both has been so neglected as to be useless. Resources. 328. Petroleum.—Mi. Hamilton, an English oil expert, with some Russian engineers has inspected the fields on Cheleken Island and will also visit the Naptha Hill (near Bala Ishem on the Central Asian Railway). He is working in the interests of a group of English (Dalziel, London) and Russian capitalists. 6 It is said that Cheleken Island produced 25,000 tons of oil during Mav of this year. &amp; J It has been decided that the Naptha Hill shall not be handed over to the Central Asian Railway, but shall be worked by private enterprise.

Hashmat-ul-Mulk .—One does not hear much now about the Hashmat obstruct ing the Customs in their Kevenue work, and he assured me, a few days ago, he would do all he could to help them. He seems anxious to go to Birjand, but evidently cannot get permission. He asked me on two occasions, lately, if I could not recommend him a change of air, but without success.

Handing over of agitators to the Governor-General. —My colleague handed over 15th June 1912, the Talib-ul-Hak, and twenty other agitators, to the Governor-General. He has given instructions that the Talib-ul-Hak is not to be severely punished, in return for services rendered, as detailed in the last diary. Migration of Timuris into Afghanistan. — A party of 100 families of Timuris 16 ^ h June * have crossed the Afghan frontier at Gulran. The Shia-Sunni troubles at Herat. —The Amir has imprisoned the leaders on 17th June, both sides who were responsible for the ill-feeling and outbreak at Herat. Execution of a follower of Muhammad. —A follower of Muhammad who killed a isth June, policeman who had been made prisoner by Yusuf, was hanged to-day. The Elections. —The Governor-General has received instructions to hold elec- 19th June * tions. He is keeping the order a secret. The father-in-law of Yusuf. —The father-in-law of Yusuf recently returned to 21st June, the village of Chahar Bagh-i-Turkan, near Herat, which was Yusufs home. The Governor sent for him, abused him, flogged him, and threw him into prison. Political Summary. State of Province. —My colleague has been handing over his accounts to M. Grigoriefi. There has been no announcement of his departure. I hear on good authority that the Russians have purchased a piece of land through a Russian subject, termed Askaroff, some two miles south of Meshed near Kuh-i-Sangi. They are arranging for the erection of buildings, using military labour and transport. Armenian masons are employed, and no Persian is allow- ed to approach the works. This corroborates previous reports. On the 17th June, my colleague officially informed the Governor-General that martial law had ceased. Since then firing at night has recommenced. ^ This is done by Russian subjects, who wish to prove that the local authorities are mcapab e of maintaining order. Movements of Russian Troops.—I hear that the Russians are sending a sotnia of Cossacks to Sistan, either from Meshed or from Pul-i-Khatun. State of Roads. —Nothing special. The Habl-ul-Matin in its issue of 13th May gives a detailed account of the bombardment, and states that it must have been done m conjunction with us. In the following number, the tone changes, and I am adjured not to conceal the matter, and it is agreed that I did my best topreventthe outrage. Uponthe whole this account is as satisfactory as can be expected. The Herat Agent reports that whereas formerly the Russians patrolled the frontier, they have now built posts everywhere opposite the Afghan posts from Gulran to Maruchak. P. M.

The Russians have ordered 200 beams, 24 feet long, at Meshed and have arranged for a supply of kiln-baked bricks* 278 Proposed Despatch of a Sotnia to Sistan. There are constant reports that a Cossack sotnia is to be despatched to Sistan, and that it is proposed to send this sotnia from the Semirechya Cossacks now at Meshed. A report from barakhs states that the sotnia may be sent from Pul-i-Khatun. (Note by Military Attache.— ably from the Merv garrison, as the latest reports show only 50 Cossacks in the neighbourhood of Sarakhs). One report, however, states that the destination of the sotnia is Birjand not Sistan. 279. Meshed Gamsow—Forty-four Taman Cossacks and twenty-two men of the Kuban Cossack Battery arrived on 11th June. These men are mainly recruits. They brought with them 220 boxes of small arms ammunition and some miscel laneous stores. Resources, 280.

Sale of Bibles. —Dr. Esselstyn, the American missionary, tells me that he is selling more portions of the Bible at Meshed than have ever been previously sold. He has sold a large number in Russian to the troops, in which connexion he is well received by the officers and men. He is also selling a very large number of portions of the Bible in the town to Persians. He considers that they are utterly upset owing to the bombardment, and are more ready to read these portions of the Bible on this account. The Governor of Nishxvpur. —The Salar Humayun, Governor of Nishapur and recently appointed to Sabzawar, has made his peace with Prince Dabija by a present of 500 tomans. The Aadil-u-Dola, brother of the Rukn-u-Dola has also given my colleague a bribe in the hope of securing a post. As the Governor-General also takes money in the old way, the amount to be squeezed out of the peasantry will be greater than ever. 2. Arrival of Captain Blair. —Captain Blair, who is replacing Major Redl, arrived on 10th June. He travelled from India via Constantinople in one month and a day. - * The New Karguzar. —The Motamin-u-Saltana called. He is a very old friend nth June, of mine, and will do his best to settle our cases. He complains bitterly of the utterly illegal demands of the Russians. The difficulties of the Commander-in -Chief. —The Sirdar Muazzam, the new 12 th June. Commander-in-Chief, whom I have known since he was a boy, called. He tells me that before the left Tehran, M. Mornard discussed the question of the pay of the troops with him. It was agreed that instead of 4,000 men there should only be 2,000 men of whom 600 should always be under arms. Upon arrival at Meshed, he found all the troops without money, and declined to take up his appointment, until M. Mornard had carried out his promise. He has now been informed the* - ' only 250 gendarmes are required, and that no money will be given for any other branch. He says that M. Mornard is suffering badly from a swollen head ; that | he does not know Persian, and that he is always weaving theories. As he was for some time a deputy, my informant, who talks French very well, is in a position to judge. The Nabil-ul-Mulk. —The dismissed Karguzar called to say good-bye. He deserves very well indeed of his country, as he never lost his head during the dis turbances, and also managed to keep in with the Russians. He is one of the very few Persians in existence to whom the epithet “ capable ” can be justly applied. I hope that he will call at the Legation, as his knowledge of affairs in Khorasan is exceptional. Departure of Major Redl —Major Redl left for England. The Area of the Bast.—The new Governor-General is trying to arrange with my colleague for a modification of the Bast. It will be recollected that my col league was given “ categorical orders ” not to change it: but he scorns such instruc tions, if really given. :;ii 13th June. 14th June. 15th June, POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of the Province. — There are persistent rumours that my colleague has been recalled. In any case, he has organized two petitions to the effect that the Persians themselves asked him to restore order, and that they are most grateful to him for what he has done. The second is from Russian subjects, who laud him as an excellent official. He has, moreover, obtained a document from the Talib-ul- m—— -^crw under the Golden Dome, and ^ , t x algo hear that there is a very ^'Sin^g^^^ConsSate General, as it is now feared that there will be “ nob^ow the Afghan Ag ent f 0 i ^ a ^ e Tecre%\^ di^ustedat thLSt rLS?d,’ wthintenSp, he does not receive the money he has asked was flogged by the Governor-General. , Tb^lutkomeii have recently killed f ^ t r^ a g h f^^' theVuchan district! -i— ptop * rt - v ”&gt;• misdeeds will be carried far and wide. A typical incident is reported. . The General was riding with two orderlies 'when a man did not get out of his way fast enough. , , ' , He struck the man, and one orderly followed suit.

Hunter, I.M.S., His Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 26, for the week ending 30th June (received 12th July) 1912. Ha)i Nasir-es-Sultaneh and His Sarbazes. —Abour forty sarbazes gathered in front of the Haji’s house this morning, demanding their pay, and abusing the Haii, who does not seem to have paid them anything since he came here. After some time they were promised their pay on a certain date, and they dispersed. GENERAL. Baluchi Raids.—No fresh news. The rumour last week that some Baluchis were on the way to loot in Kainat seems to have been without foundation. Sistan Lashkar.—Dming the week little has been heard about the Lashkar part of which is said to be at Galugheh, and part at Nazar Chah. I understand that between 3,000 and 4,000 sheep, and about 16 camels have been recovered ; the figures given in last week’s diary seem to have been much exaggerated. Deputy Governor and the Customs—The Hashmat-ul-Mulk does not seem to be interfering with the revenue collection in the way he was, and now he gives out that he is willing to help the customs as much as he can. The disbursement of various monies, for the payment of pensions, building of the bund, etc., etc., which used to be in the hands of the Deputy Governor, has been transferred by the Persian Government to the Customs. I am told that a number of pensions have been regularly drawn by the Deputy Governor, although the pensioners have been dead for many years, and as regards the bund the allow ance seems to have all gone into his pocket, as the labour employed at the bund was forced labour.

Afghan Garrisons. —In reply to a question put by me, the Herat Agent informs 25 th May. me that the arrangement of Afghan troops both at Herat and on the two frontiers is normal. He adds that no ordnance stores have been received this year from Kabul. Herat Rumours .—The Herat Agent reports that there are persistent rumours 26 th May. that British troops have occupied Chakansur, and will advance on Herat. The new Governor-General. —The Neiir-u-Dola is at Nishapur, and recently 27th May. telegraphed to the Chief Astrologer to inquire what day would be especially auspi cious for his arrival at Meshed. The Astrologer, having heard that the 3rd of June was the King's birthday, replied that this day was especially auspicious, and the Governor-General arranged to take advantage of the fact. However, I pointed out that this date was only auspicious for Emperors and Kings, and that if he ar rived on this date, I could not send out to meet him. I added that the following day was also unsuitable. The Chief Astrologer has kindly laid down that the 5th June is still more auspicious, and His Highness will accordingly make his state entry on that day. Intrigues with the Achakzai. —The Afghan Agent informs me that the Amir 28 intends to invite all the Achakzai, who inhabit British Baluchistan to leave and take up a district on the Afghan-Russian frontier. I give this for what it is worth. .h May. Political Summary. State of the Province. —I hear that Muhammad is being besieged by the Go vernor of Turbat. My colleague has apparently recovered most of the compromising letters, which he wrote to Yusuf, but two are missing. It is thought that I may have secured them. I hear that Yusuf received three letters from my colleague, after his flight from the Shrine. This information, which was given by a member of his band, has been confirmed from other sources. My veracious colleague is still assuring the Karguzar that he will insist on his remaining at Meshed. Even after what the Legation said to the British Minis ter, this is possible. State of the roads. —The Turkomen hold the road in force, and are robbing free ly. The post is waiting for their departure before being despatched. It is stated that they are armed with the latest kind of rifle. They are probably sent by the Russians. Robberies are reported from the Karez road. It appears that all the nomads are now looting, as they see that there is no government. Afghan Encroachments—The Afghan Agent states that the Afghans intend to take up a slice of Khorasan, before it is occupied by the Russians. The Head of the Mosque of Gauhar Shad has left Meshed for Odessa. It appears that he will carry messages from the party of the ex-Shah. My colleague is aiding the intrigue. Many complaints are received of villagers, who have had their crops eaten, and trampled down by the Russians. They also take supplies without payment. However, no serious outrages are reported. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty*s Consul-General.CONFIDENTIAL. Cartoon of the Bombardment. —A cartoon of the bombardment has appeared. 2 nd Juno. It consists of a plan of half of the “ Old Court ” on which the horses, the dogs, the prisoners, the corpses, the machine-gun firing into the scared chamber, etc., are all depicted. The Russians have had the stone seized, and the artist thrown into i prison. The King’s Birthday.—The birthday of His Majesty the King-Emperor was 3rd June, celebrated by two receptions and garden parties. On the first day, the Russian officials and the leading Persians were invited, and, on the second dav&gt; the lesser officials and the leading merchants. Afghan Claims on Khorasan. The Minister recently asked me for information 4 ti| June, about the Afghan encroachments. He stated that the Afghans claimed all territory east of.Siah Kuh and Pul-i-Abrisham. He added that this place could not be found. In reply, I explained that after the assassination of Nadir Shah, Ahmad Shah Durani held Khorasan, and that the 4 bridge ” was some twenty miles west of Sabzawar, and constituted their western boundary. It reminded me of the Persian claim to Delhi, when the question of demarcating the boundary between British and Persian Baluchistan was first discussed. Persian Lessons for the Russian Troops. —A man has been engaged to give r lessons in Persian to the troops. Arrival of the Neiir-u-Dola. — The new Governor-General reached Meshed at 5 th June, 42 minutes before noon. The astrologer had insisted on this exact minute. He kissed the ground at the threshold of tlie Shrine, and would not allow the band to play as a sign that he was mourning for the bombardment. Russian Bomb Practice. — Some days ago two boxes of bombs were received, eth June, and the General gave orders for one of them to be exploded. This was done at night, and awoke almost everyone in the city. In the morning the Russians, to conceal the matter, made inquiries as to what the explosion had been. Russian Review. — The Russian troops had a review, which was preceded by 7 th June, long prayers. The whole of the men were standing motionless in the burning sun, between 9 and 10 a.m., wearing their thick uniforms. Such things show how back ward the Russians remain. 2. Call on the New Governor-General. —I paid an official call, with the members of my staff, on the Neiir-u-Dola. He is a Persian of the very old school. Arrival of the New Karguzar. — The new Karguzar, the Motamin-u-Saltana 8th June, arrived at Meshed. He was a great friend of Major Watson at Turbat, but is particularly lazy. At the same time he is most obliging. POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province. —The Salar Hamayun, Governor of Nishapur, reached Meshed yesterday, and was visited by the Russian officer, who had commanded the Nishapur detachment. The former complained that he was being threatened by my colleague for not having seized the actual leaders of the villagers, who fired on the Russians {vide summary of Diary No. 18). The Russian officer laughed, and said that it was all a plot to extort money, but that he need not be afraid, as he had just heard that my^ colleague was dismissed. The Salar Hamayun speedily, informed his grandfather, the Governor-General, who had brought diamonds to the value of 3,000 tomans, so I hear, to present to my colleague’s daughter. I have just heard that my colleague, like a Persian would do, is organising a petition, thanking him for his services, and stating that it is hoped that he will not leave Meshed, t2 c . . j ^. Tp nor 7 pj za Beg, the postal sowar, has again been fired at in the same Ltlt Ee addressel'a sJng letter to the local authontres. Muhammad, the brigand, is stated to have escaped on foot, but seven of his men have been captured. rn i i Four Persian mirzas-belonging to the Meshed Revenue Office, have been murdered by Turkomen near Abbasabad. I hear from various sources that the Russian Agent is trying to create distur- ! bances at Shahrud, and will then beg for troops to protect Russian subjects. I hear from more than one source that, as previously stated by me, most of the Turkomen are armed with Russian Magazine rifles. The Karez Agent, who has recently reached Meshed? gives a deplorable account of the condition of the road. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty’s Consul-General. G, M. Press, Simla.—No, C« 260-F, D,—8-7*12.—26.—'J.N.B. fSECRET. Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 23, for the week ending the 8th June 1912. 250. Central Asian Line. Passing-places section Cherniayevo-Tashkend. —In 1909 a certain number of passing-places (razyezdi) were constructed on this sec tion to deal with heavy freight traffic with the idea of closing them down subse quently but as it has been found that they are necessary for the normal traffic of the line they are to be retained. 251. Rumoured construction. —A person despatched to enquire into the rumoured construction near Dushakh station detailed in paragraph 191 reports that no foundation for the statement exists. 252. Reservist employes.—It is considered that the intention of the military authorities of calling up simultaneously this autumn a large number of reserv ists whose service commenced in several consecutive years, is likely to disorganise considerably the traffic and permanent way departments of the line, on which in particular a large proportion of reservists are employed. 253. Bezmen-Piryusa branch. — K special commission, presided over by the Governor of Trans-Caspia, has decided to place at the disposal of the Central Asian Railway authorities sufficient land in the Firyusa valley for the construction of a broad-gauge branch from Bezmen. The question of a site in the Firyusa valley for a railway^ hospital and sanatorium is also under consideration. 254. Relief measures in Mangishlak District. —A sum of 40,000 rubles has been assigned the Red Cross society to combat the epidemic of typhus in the Mangish lak peninsula. A sum of 1,500 rubles has also been granted from district funds to deal with the incipient typhus epidemic in the Merv District. 255. Scarcity in Khiva .— According to Musuhnan papers the Khan has granted a sum of 500,000 rubles to purchase wheat for his famine-stricken sub jects. 256. Bokhara .— The Amir has left Kermine on a tour of his dominions. 257. Cattle epidemic .— The papers report the commencement of an outbreak of ‘ ‘ yasschur '' among cattle in the Tashkend District. { 258. Tejen water-supply.—Great shortage of water for agricultural purposes is experienced in the Tejen District. This is probably the result of the recent bursting of the dam. 259. Osh-Kashgar road.—Owing to recent attacks on mails, it is reported that the Kashgar road is being patrolled by Cossacks. 260. Russo-Afghan frontier .— Rumours are prevalent at Kushk that an unusually large number of Afghan troops are present on the frontier, and at Herat that the Russian garrison of Kushk is abnormally large. Neither of these rumours, however, appears to be founded on fact. GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways. History.L ■Stan ndafe ts ia le to &gt;n to link- ibs oi r, ck iml'v SECRET. Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 19, 'or the week ending 11th May 1912. GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways. 190. Central Asian Line. —Petersburg papers state that Chief Inspector Gorchakof has reported that structural defects exist on this line on the sections Samarkand-Chorniayevo, and Golodnaya Step-Tashkend. It is said that a special grant will be issued to make good the defects. Employes at the workshops of the line complain that the shops are closed fitfully for a few days at a time and that their earnings are thereby considerably reduced. 191. Rumoured Construction. —An informant notes that at Dushakh station on the Central Asian line about 150 workmen are employed on earth-work, which had extended some 2 miles to the south of the line. On his enquiring the reason he w T as informed that a line was being commenced to Meshed. The workmen were supervised by employes of the Central Asian Line. No further confirmation of this report has yet been received. Waterways. 192. Rumoured administration for Turkestan. —Prince Shakofski, the Chief oi the Department of Water Communications, has arrived at Tashkend from Peters burg with the object, it is understood, of forming a head-quarters administration of Turkestan waterways. (Reference paragraph 48.) 193. Amu Darya Flotilla. —A mechanical engineer, in an article in the Novoye Vremya, once more call attention to the many shortcomings of the flotilla, mainly as regards the transport or commercial commodities, and to the disproportionate expense of its upkeep. Among the data cited are:—• The establishment.—16 officers, 1 doctor, 3 officials, nearly 400 sailors and 200 paid workmen. The total cost of upkeep for a navigation season of 9 months.—400,000 roubles. Average number of passengers carried during the 9 months.— 20,000. Goods.—under 10,000 tons. Expended on the flotilla during last 10 years.—4,126,000 roubles. Takings by flotilla during the same period.—1,140,000 roubles. Deficit on period.—2,986,000 roubles. He places the total yearly freight traffic on the Amu Darya at 64,300 tons, of which amount 48,200 tons about are carried by the native boats at a slow rate and high freight. The want of efficient river transport discourages the growth of cotton and the development of trade generally. As the flotilla does not work during the winter, the cost of land transport for the yearly reliefs of the Kerki and Termes garrisons must in addition be reckoned with. Roads. 194. Andijan-Osh pos^-road.—According to the Turkistan News, automobile service will be instituted on this road in May of the current year. Passenger cars are being obtained from Russia. History. 1 195. Accidents to dams.—A dam has burst on the Tejen river. As no repairs are possible while the water is high, it is expected that a shortage of irrigation water in the lower reaches will be experienced during the summer.2 The bursting of one dam or another on this river seems to be a yearly occurrtmce. The Tashkend water-supply has also been interfered with by the burstin, of a '“m. Distress in 3 1'Tcl^traWe dlS prevails among the Khivans. The trade in tea has apparently been affected by the universal want of means. _ 197. The Russians at -cond fh^ kS B“rGaIden3fe foot of the hills on the west and as far as the Kuh- tsang” to the north with the object of determining building sites. A spring the Chashma-i-Shaikh Baha—beyond Kuh-i-Sangi has also formed thetbfect of Russian attention, and it is apparently intended to utilise it as a water-supply. At a ceremonial parade, held on the anniversary of the birth-day of the Empress, two Russian soldiers wounded during the bombardment of the Shnne, were pre- sTted by the General with 60 roubles each the sum having been apparent y subscribed by Armenian tradesmen at Meshed In the course of a speech to t e troops the General assured the men that their blood had not been shed in vain, that Meshed was now theirs and that they must consider it as their own country as it would not again be abondoned. This view of the conquest of the capital of Khorasan from the adventurer and agent provocateur Yusuf Herati is not without humour. In this connection the 1st Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General, in discussing the question of the foundation of an officer s club, remarked to me that they might just as well set it going as they were never likely to evacuate Meshed again. . . 198 Amu Darya Bridge. —Materials are reported as passing along the Central Asian Railway, and as having been despatched up-stream from Charjm. From report received they appear to be of two kinds—pontoons and wooden materials for the roadway of a pontoon bridge, etc., iron cylinders, girders, etc., and materials for a permanent structure. ' 199 Tashkend garrison.— mounted scouts of the Rifle Regiments of the Tashkend garrison left for Troitskoye camp towards the end of April. Two Rifle , Regiments and the 1st Turkestan Sapper Battalion are expected to move into camp in mid-May. 200. Staff Ride. —A staff ride or field tour for the 1 st Turkestan Army Corps is to take place in the Samarkand district from the 5th to 14th May. Brigadiers and commanders of units of all arms are taking part in it, and, in addition, mounted scouts, telephonists, and signallers will be employed. Preparatory instruction to the lower ranks was arranged for at Troitskoye camp. 201. Officers' Mess.—A mess for the officers of the 5th Orenburg Cossacks has been completed at Tashkend, the expense being borne by the Amir of Bokhara, the Honorary Commander of the regiment. 202. Nishapur detachment. —Epidemic illness is reported to have broken out among the Russian force detached to Nishapur. A medical officer has been des patched from Meshed to take what measures are necessary. 203. Russian troops in Persia. —Officers of the Taman Cossack Regiment at Meshed have received letters stating that the two sotnnas of their regiment at Astrabad have been ordered to proceed, to Barfarush.

Hunter, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 24, for the week ending 15th (received 28th) June 1912. Return of the Deputy Governor and the Sarhaddar,—liLh.Q Hashmat-ul-Mulk 14th June, and Haj ji Nasir-es-Sultaneh arrived this morning from Lutak. GENERAL. Baluchi Roads. —No fresh news during the week. Sistani Lashhar. —Sirdar Khudadad Khan and his men are reported to have left Duzdab on the fourteenth for Sirdar Jehind's place. The lashkar has been joined by Sirdars Jehil, Ismailzai, with about sixty men, and Ali Shah Narui with about 30 men. Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh informs me that Sirdar Khudadad Khan has recovered about 2,500 sheep and 14 camels, and taken prisoners some 8 or 10 raiders, who were on their way back from the Kainat with loot. There does not appear, however, to have been any fighting. I hear Sirdar Khudadad Khan is endeavouring to obtain the letters, which the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and he wrote to Sirdar Jehind and others, asking them to go to loot in the Kainat, but the owners are unwilling to part with them. It is expected that the lashkar will return after 10 or 15 days. Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh told me that he had written to Sirdars Jehind and Muhammad Reza Khan Reki saying if they would return all the camels, sheep, etc., looted each will be given a village in Sistan to settle down in, and no harm will come to them. Should they refuse, the Haji said to me then it would mean another expedition later on, and he would have to go himself. The Deputy Governor and the Customs. —Relations between the Hashmat-ul- Mulk and the Customs are much strained over the revenue collection question, and from what one hears the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is not likely to accept the new arrange- ^ ment of the Customs collecting the revenue without giving trouble in some way. I have heard a rumour that his agents will loot the Customs house, and make an attempt on the lives of the Director, M. deWeerdt, and of Mirza Sadiq Khan. The Director has told me that he and Mirza Sadiq Khan are afraid of their lives, and are taking whatever precautions are possible, but these are few and unsatisfactory. Petition from the people of the Neh district. —The Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh told me the day after he arrived here from Lutak, that he had received a petition from the people of Neh district, asking that measures be taken to protect thern from further Baluchi raids, otherwise they would be forced to ask for protection in the British Consulate. Whether this is the same petition referred to in my last week s diary I cannot tell. The Haji said he had wired to Tehran, regarding this petition# Roads. —No improvement. r,CONFIDENTIAL. r M &gt; c [&gt; ■*% w w tSi Sistan Consular Diary oi Captain J. B. D. Hunter, His Britannic Majesty’s _ Acting Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 25, for the week ending 22nd June (received 5th July) 1912. General. Baluchi Raids. I have heard that some Baluchis are now on their way to Kainat, but of the large band of about 1,000 men reported in diary No. 20, week ending 18th May, to be starting from Sarhad, and in the following week’s diary as having left Dehaneh Baghi en route for Birjand, nothing more has been heard. Probably some of this party returned with Sirdar Muhammad Reza Khan Reki from Dehaneh Baghi, while the others may be the party of about 500 men recently looting to the north-west of Neh (vide diary No. 21 for week ending 25th May 1912). Sistan Lashkar.—Sirdai Khudadad Khan is said r to be at Dumagh with Sir dar Jehil, who, with some of his men, has joined the lashkar. Some presents have been given to Sirdar Jehil on behalf of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk by Sirdar Khuda dad Khan, and a pension was promised him for his loyalty. Sirdars Jehind and Muhammad Reza Khan Reki are reported to have asked Sirdar Khudadad Khan to meet them at Mirjawa to talk things over. Sirdar Khudadad Khan is said to have recovered about 11,000 sheep and 170 camels, and to have taken 26 prisoners (some of these prisoners, I hear, have never been in Kainat). Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh. —It is interesting to note that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh, since they accompanied the Sistan lashkar to Lutak, and remained there about a fortnight together, have become great friends * the Hashmat, however, is said to be able to twist the Haji round his little finger,' which is perhaps unfortunate for us, as the Haji has not yet settled any of our claims. Deputy Governor and the Customs. —There does not seem to be any improve ment in the relations between the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Customs. The Deputy Governor continues his obstructions. The Director of Customs, I hear, asked the Haji Nasir-es-Sultaneh for extra guards for the Customs, but they were refused ; the Director has now engaged men on his own account. Governorship of Kainat. —Mr. Howson informs me that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, two or three days ago, telegraphed to the Vali that if the Persian Government does not agree to the proposals, which he made to Government last month regarding the reorganisation of troops in Kainat, supply of arms, etc., etc., (estimated annual cost about Tomans 35,000), then his resignation of the Governorship should be accepted. This is his third time of asking to be relieved during the past two months. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk is very anxious to go to Birjand, and I saw from a letter of his, addressed to me by mistake, that he hopes to go there soon, and it is presumed he has the Governorship in his mind’s eye. Shela. —Running strong. Roads. —Unsafe.Communications. 'Railways, 238. Tashkend Line Accident. —In an accident to a goods train on the 12th April, near Ber Chogur station, 17 wagons were smashed, and three of the train staff injured. Roadsi 239. AsTchabad-Firyusa Communication. —An auto-bus has been despatched from Petersburg to Askhabad for the company organising automobile communi cation with Firyusa. The initiators are taking steps to render the road safe for this traffic. History. 240. Frontier Incidents. —On the 23rd May, a collision occurred between the Russian frontier guards near Aksu on the Trans-Caspian frontier and a party of smugglers. One of the guards was severely wounded and one smuggler—a Persian —killed. An officer of the Frontier Guard, several men and some Turkoman ' djigits ” have been in Meshed, during the past week, in connection with a robbery of sheep from Dushakh by Persian subjects. 241. Epidemic. —Typhus is stated by the “ Trans-Caspian Review ” to have assumed an epidemic form in Trans-Caspia near Merv. 242. Turbulent Turkomans.—Thirty-three Turkomans have 1 been lodged in Askhabad prison accused of resisting the authorities. The section under which they will be charged provides for the capital punishment. 243. Inspection of Governor-General—General Samsonof left Tashkend on the 21st May to inspect the garrisons at Kerki and Termez. 244. Deputation of Native Citizens of Tashkend.—A representative deputation of the leading native citizens of Tashkend recently waited on the Governor- General with a petition bearing upwards of 2,000 signatures. Their object was to point out forcibly but respectfully that, although the native city with its 200,000 in habitants provided the major part of the Tashkend revenue, a most inconsiderable portion of these funds is expended on it. Special stress was laid on the necessity for the establishment of schools and popular education. Our city, they declared, x. is sinking in the mud. We have; neither pavements, lighting, hospitals, nor schools/’ 245. Tashkend Pasteur Institute—Ydty-six persons completed treatment during April. 246. Reported Arms for Salar-ed-Dola.—lniormation from several sources has been received that arms and ammunition from Russia have reached Astrabad and have been distributed to partisans of the Pretender. Turkomans operating on the Meshed-Tehran road are stated to be armed with magazine rifles, and it is also re ported that the assassins of Yeprim, dressed as Kurds, were armed with rifles of the latest pattern.

The Hazara Refugees. Muhammad Ibrahim, the Chief of the Hazara refugees, 20 th May. has been well received at Kabul. He has been given a service of eighty sowars, some land, and a personal allowance of 5,000 Kabuli rupees. The Governor of ffmK -The Agent reports that the Governor has resigned, 2i,t May as he cannot put up with the constant interference of the General. A Persian tfe/wpee.—Reference entry of 14th May. As was to be expected the 22 nd May. Governor of Herat, who hates the new spirit in Persia, has treated Shaikh Hasan Kashi with scant civility, and has ordered him to be expelled. The Russians and P 0 Z 0 .—The Russian officers were invited to witness our last 23rd May game of polo. After the game they tried knocking about the ball. They ride with only a snaffle, and one officer was run away with, and charged not once, but twice, through the spectators. Fortunately nobody was hurt. State of the Province.—Yusui was being brought into Meshed when, according to orders, he was shot from behind and killed. On 24th May, he was brought in fastened to a chair covered with red cloth, the Mamur driving in a carriage full of xoses. The band played, and the triumphal procession past through the city to the square, where Yusufs corpse was hung up for all the world to see. I can not ascertain for certain whether my .colleague arranged this ending to the career of his chief agent provocateur. He was undoubtedly much afraid of an inquiry being held, and had arranged to seize Yusuf, if he was brought in alive. The Per sians knew that he would do this, and may, therefore, have desired to anticipate him. The result is that everyone says that the Russians do not protect even their chief agents. I hear that my visit to the Shrine was the cause of much loot being taken back from various officers, including the Military Attache. Consequently, there is some feeling on the subject. On the other hand, I hear on good authority that many officers have cleared off all their debts, and are in funds. The Russian detachment at Nishapur handed over four maxims, and 20,000 rounds of ammunition to the agents of the Salar-u-Dola. It appears that it is intended to organise risings in favour of this pretender in various parts of the j country. I also heard that 280 rifles, which had been seized at Meshed, had been sent off: but the destination is unknown. Major Redl and I consider that this information is reliable. In any case, it fits in with the intrigue of the General on behalf of the ex-Shah. If the Russian officers were not misinformed, the ex-Shah had made a secret treaty with the Russian Government by the terms of which the province of Khorasan, or something similar, was to have been handed over. The Russians were constantly saying, after his departure, that had he succeeded, Meshed would have been theirs. It is very difficult to believe that there was no double dealing in high quarters. The very able Karguzar, the Nabil-ul-Mulk, w&amp;s dismissed a few days ago, and the Motamin-u-Saltana was appointed. He is a relation of the new Governor- General. The dismissed Karguzar appealed to my colleague, who said that he would telegraph, and try to have him reinstated. I was approached by the Kar guzar, and, as he is a really good man, I asked my colleague for his views. In reply, he wrote me a eulogy of the Nabil-ul-Mulk, and stated that he was applying to Tehran. Subsequently, he told me that he was determined to keep such a good man as he was. I, therefore, telegraphed to the Legation, and was informed that the Karguzar had been dismissed on the initiative of my colleague, and that he POLITICAL SUMMARY. had approved of the new man.

Death of Yusuf Herati.— During the past week intrigues have been busy near Fariman and Kalanderabad, the locality of the capture of Yusuf Khan, and some desultory fighting also took place. The prisoner was brought in on the 23rd instant to Turuk, some 8 miles from Meshed, where, to make assurance doubly sure, he was shot dead. His body, seated on a rough catafalque, was brought into the town in triumphal procession headed by the ineffable Persian band on the following day, and, after being exhibited to the populace, was hoisted on a high pole in the Ark square where it still remains to serve as an awful warning to all intending catspaws. Military.' 233. Movements of Troops. —Three hundred of the 14th Turkistan Rifles, 100 Sappers,'and 2 batteries of artillery left Merv by train on the 6th May. Their destination is still uncertain.

Owing to the absence of the Chief Persian officials, no reception was held. 4th June. Departure of Russian Consul for Birjand.—B^on Tchercassov and his wife left m the evening for Kain. They should have gone about the middle of May, and had actually sent on their kit ahead, but owing to the sudden serious illness ot the .Baroness their departure had to be postponed. General. Baluchi Raids .—No fresh raids have been reported during the week, but a num- ber of raiders have returned to the Sarhad, with a arge quantity of loot. This is probably the party of 500 Baluchis referred to in last week’s diary. Sistani Lashkar.—This is said to have arrived at Duzdab, but as far as I can hear, it has done nothing so far, except rob Baluchi nomads on the way. Most of the camels in the place have been commandeered for this expedition and much merchandise has had to be kept back at Kohi Malik Siah and here’ owing to the lack of transport. The Deputy Governor and the Customs .—The revenue has been given to the Customs to collect, and this, naturally, is much resented by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who, besides not being allowed to touch the revenue, cannot now change the Katkhu- das of villages, when he wishes to, as he used to do, a practice, which was a profit able source of income to him. I hear that his agents are placing difficulties in the way of the Customs collecting the revenue in the villages, and the Director of Customs, although not admitting it, is evidently afraid an attack may be made any time on himself. His second in command, Mirza Sadiq Khan, who is the man who actually does the revenue collecting, and without whom the Director could do nothing, is afraid of his life and he has received warnings from several people, who know of the danger he is in. Petition to Deputy Governor and Karguzar.—I hear that these officials have received a petition from the people in Neh District, stating that they have lost all their property through these raids, and that, if they do not receive assistance from the Deputy-Governor and the Karguzar, they will go to the British Consulate to ask for help. Afghan Frontier .—The Afghans are reported to have stationed 15 men under a non-commissioned officer at each of the following places :—Joroki, Deh Ali Mar- dan, Deh Nur Muhammad, Deh Sikhsar, Killa Fatha, and some three or four other places. Their duties are believed to be in connection with the supervision of passports. Russian Military Attache.—(Vide diary No. 16, week ending 20th April 1912).&lt; Baron Tchercassov received a letter recently from Captain Twzetkofi, late mili tary attache here, who said he had had an interview with the Minister of War to whom he showed how unnecessary it was to have military attache here, and that the Minister seemed to agree with him. Colonel Vigornitsky has been detained, and Baron Tchercassov says it is not unlikely that the post will be abolished. Roads. —Unsafe. G. M.

The priest sprinkled the soldiers, and also their horses with holy water The three wounded men were then addressed, and were each given 50 roubles The troops then marched past the General and the wounded men. This latter ustom seems to be a particularly good one. Russian Arbitrary Action.—The, Russians have constructed a range, which closes three roads. One of these is used by the stone-cutters. A New Afghan Post.—The Afghan Agent informs me that the Afghans have built a new post on the Kain frontier. He could not tell me the exact locality. Afghan Frontier Rumours. —I hear both from Karez and also from the Afghan Agent that the late Governor of Herat and some British officers are coming to Herat to visit and repair the frontier posts. I cannot account for this rumour. The New Commander-in-Chief.—The Sirdar Muaziz, a young deputy, has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of Khorasan. He has no military training : but was educated in Russia. I have known him and his father for many years. 6th May. 7th May. 1 8th May. 9th May. 10th May. Political Summary. State of Province.—The Shrine, or rather the bast area, is still curtailed. I informed the Minister, in reply to a telegram, that categorical orders had again been sent to my colleague, that he obeyed no orders of any sort whether emanating from Tehran or from St. Petersburg or from both. After all if the Russian Govern ment keep a man, who is suffering from senile decay at this post, they cannot be surprised if things go wrong. I notice that in the question put by Mr. Morrel in the House of Commons, a point was made of horses being stabled in the Sacred Buildings. This actually occurred, as there were Cossacks on duty, and also there were ammunition and supply carts. What was even worse was that dogs followed the troops into the Sacred Precincts. The Indian Press contains a strong article on the bombardment in the Paisa Akhbar. _ There is also a description given of a meeting at Calcutta to protest against the action of Itlay and of Russia. _ It has been ascertained that the Russians killed five Kurds, and arrested a similar number, when they attacked the village in the Nishapur district. A week ago I heard from Sarakhs that the Russians were collecting camel J transport near Sarakhs. Similar rumours have reached me from other centres, but the well-informed Agent at Herat has not mentioned the matter. Yusuf and Muhammad are now to the west of Turshiz, and to the south of Sabzawar, The Governor of Turbat has been raising money, and collecting troops. Turkoman are in force between Meiomei and Abbasabad. The new Governor-, General is apparently unable to proceed. Even if he reaches Meshed safely, he will be unable to do anything, unless my colleague be removed. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C-197 F.

POLITICAL SUMMARY. State of Province.-—The news of the week is the capture of Yusuf. It will be interesting to watch developments. I have heard more than one rumour as to the part that is being played by the Russians. A report reached Meshed early in the week to the effect that the Russian priest had been captured by robbers. It appears that he was attacked, but that the robbers were beaten off by his Cossacks. The General sent 40 Cossacks with orders to pursue the gang, and it is reported that this detachment has already looted one village, killed some villagers, and raped some women as an enemy of its landlord informed them that it was the home of the robbers. The Bank recently sent a large sum of specie to Askabad. The men in charge of it report that they exchanged shots with one body of robbers: they also met two other bands. This is most unusual, as the Askabad road has hitherto been quite safe. Probably it is all part of the Russian policy, or the results of that policy. The area of the bast is still curtailed. My colleague stated to the Karguzar that he has received no instructions on the subject, but that his opinion has been asked. All this tends to prove that there is double dealing. In this connexion M. deKlemme, who is in charge of Persian affairs at the Russian Foreign Office, had an evil reputation when at Bombay, and is no more reliable than my colleague! so far as my experience of him goes. In the Habl-u Matin of 8th April, there is a good article on the bombardment. It shows very clearly how my colleague has played his sinister role, and is written with much bitterness. The Russian troops have been ordered to return from Nishapur. It appears that typhus broke out among them. Most unfortunately they cannot find a good place for a summer camp, and will remain to menace the health of Meshed. This may seem to be an exaggeration, but their filthy habits, and the plague of flies, which they breed, justify my expreg! sion. .■ a tj ii iBniift. — ^ as tpa^. ^ Wij, ' r ‘faerali3 1 son-in, eneral, &gt; Major, ^wfeerul, “1 jr SECRET. 4 i' :• ', v ft' ^:c w t I c i o i ’w.* 4 Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 20, for the week ending the 18th May 1912. general summary. Communications. Hallways. Askhabad-Firyusa Branch 'project. —The Governor of Trans-Caspia and the thief of the Central Asian line are in communication with respect to a branch of normal gauge, which the latter has been requested to construct from Bezmen station on the Central Asian line to Firyusa. Owing to technical difficulties for a line of this gauge in the Firyusa valley, and its probable non-productiveness, it seems at present unlikely that the project will be given effect to. On the other hand, the company for (instituting automobile communication seems to be taking definite shape. 205. Kushk-Mery Branch.—A short extension of the normal gauge line from Kushk Railway station to a Russian fortification on the bank of the Kushk river is reported. The field railway already runs to this point. Waterways. 206. Amu Darya navigation. — The cargo steamer “ General Samsonof ”, belong ing to the Aral Sea Navigation Company “ Khiva ”, reached Charjui from Urgani on the 5th May,_ towing 2 barges with a general cargo of 282 tons weight. 14 days were occupied on the trip. The steamer is expected to ply regularly 3 on the Urganj-Charjui run during the summer. 207. Amu Darya flotilla. The papers announce the forthcoming auction of a quantity of unserviceable machinery, boilers, and hull material belonging to the Government flotilla. In this connection a correspondent states that a number of extra workmen have been entertained and that work proceeds by night as well as by day to com plete two of the steamers, the hulls of which are being reconstructed afresh. Roads. 208. Projected automobile service. —According to the Turkistan News certain well-to-do Khivans, domiciled at Moscow, are arranging to place a service of automobiles on the Charjui-Khiva road. Telegraphs. 209. Kushk-Merv line. —The poles on this line from Kushk towards Merv are being repaired by military labour. Telephones. 210. Tashkend telephone system. —The sum estimated for the upkeep for the current year—40,000—rubles has been confirmed by a Commission. This sum re presents an economy of 21,000 rubles on the expenses incurred last year. History. 211. Frontier incidents. —Six men of the Frontier Guard—apparently belong ing to the non-combatant portion—are reported to have been found killed on the Afghan frontier in the neighbourhood of Kushk. 9A sentry on the field railway stores in Kushk fort was attacked and wounded by a native assailant on the night of the 15th April, the motive of the assault being the theft of the sentry’s rifle. . . , . 212 Irriaation specialists.-A. party of Swiss engineers, for employment on irrigation works in Ferghana, have reached Moscow ■ 013 Distressed pe«s«irf.s.-Unskilled labour is abnormally cheap at Tashkend, owing to the presence in the town of several thousand peasants from famme- stricken districts in Russia, attracted by the hope of employment on the long- delayed Arys-Vyerm line. . . , , , 214. Locust destruction. —The sum of Jts. 4,800 rubles, originally granted for locust destruction in Trans-Caspia, having proved insufficient, an extra credit of 13 000 rubles from district funds has been asked for. A number of spraying machines, Paris green, etc., are being despatched to Trans-Uspia. 215. Temporary remission of MangisUdktaxes. Owing to the loss of live stock and failure of crops in recent years, the population of the Mangishlak district have incurred arrears of unpaid taxes to the amount of upwards of 88,000 rubles. The Governor of Trans-Caspia has requested a respite of four years from the Governor-General for their payment. 216 Capture of ayent provocateur. —Yussuf Herati has been captured by Persians near Fariman, about 40 miles to the south of Meshed. It was announced that he would be brought into Meshed yesterday, but, as this action has been deferred, it is not improbable that a miraculous escape may prove the solution of an inconvenient situation. _ y • 217 . Attach on Russian priest. —The Russian priest on duty with the Russian troops in Khorasan was attacked near Shirin Su, between Kuchan and Chinaran, by a band of 40 robbers. The small escort of Cossacks, which accompanied him, took cover with the priest by the side of the road, and, on the robbers advancing to loot the carriage, opened fire on them, killing or wounding three, and putting the remainder to flight, at the same time summoning assistance from the Cossack post of Chinaran. On news of the outrage reaching Meshed, General Redko ordered the Cossack Battery to be ready to march and at once despatced an officer and 40 men of the Kavkaz Sotnya to follow up the robbers. The priest arriving at Meshed unharmed on the following evening, the artillery was countermanded, but the Cossack commander, who reported that he had killed 14, wounded 15, and captured several others of the robbers, was ordered not to return till he had accounted for the whole band. From the report of a relieved detachment from Chinaran, the robbers had joined another ^and about 100 strong in the direction of Nishapur, and the Kavkaz Cossacks were following them up. General Redko has further directed that the standing posts on the road should be increased from 10 to 15 men, and that the road between posts should be pat rolled. It is noteworthy that, with substantial Russian garrisons at Meshed and Ku chan. and with men distributed at posts along the road, the Meshed- Bajgiran Road has never been so unsafe as it is at the present moment. Ethnography. 218. Popular education at Tashke'nd .—From the statement of the Mayor of Tashkend, there appears little probability of any effective measures to provide for popular education in the native town being taken for some years to come. Military. 219. Tashhend Garrison .—The 1st and 3rd Turkistan Rifle regiments moved into camp at Troitzkoye at the beginning of May, and units, apparently from other garrisons, have arrived there to carry out their musketry course. The 1st Tur kistan Sappers were expected to move into camp in mid-May. 220. Ordnance .—4 field, 2 mountain guns, and 4 maxims were received at Kuskh at the end of April. 221. Reservists .—Reservists domiciled at Kushk have been warned to rejoin the colours by the middle of Russian May. No satisfactory explanation of this procedure at Kushk, and as noted last week at Merv, has yet come to hand.222 - Army orders of February and March provide for the following reduction in the number of attendants at military hospitals : — Samarkand • • • • or • Skobeleof .. Kushk • • • • Merv * • • • • • Termez • • Resources. 223. Estimate of live-stock in Syr Darya.-An article in the Turkistan News quotes an estimate of the live-stock for the Syr Darya province in 1910, compiled through the rural district administration. The writer considers that, in view of the unwillingness of the population to confess to the full numbers owned by them the totals are m all probability understated.

The Hasbmat-ul-Mulk and wmmmakTt LutTk ’ commander-in-chief, accompanied the force, but General Summary. ^ Saids.—A band of Baluchis, said to number about S00, is at present operating m the district to the north-west of Neh. Some fighting between them and some Sistani sowars sent out from Neh seems to have occurred, but details not yet received. The krge band, reported in last week’s diary, under Sirdars Muhammad Reza Khan Reki and Taj Muhammad, halted near Dehaneh Baghi for a few days, but left again about the 19th instant, and is said to be going direct to Birjand. It is reported from Koh-i-Malik Siah that the head men of this band received written orders from the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to raid Kainat, and that they say openly they are acting under his orders. J In the recent raid at Neh (vide diary No. 16, week ending 20th April) the Ba luchis carried off :— (Figures are approximate only). Value, Krans. (1) 400 camels 120,000 (2) 28,000 sheep .. .. .. .. .. 420,000 (3) Cattle, donkeys, and moveable property .. .. 39,000 (4) 200 camels belonging to some Lowani carriers .. 120,000 (5) Merchandise. (A considerable part of this was property 180,000 of British subjects). Two of the Lowanis, whose camels were looted, were killed by Baluchis. One is said to have been a British subject, and two others claim to be. Necessary enqui ries are being made. Of the Baluchis, who were killed, one is said to have been the son-in-law of Sirdar Alum Khan. Petition for protection from Baluchi raiders .-—On the 22nd instant the traders and principal people of Birjand assembled in the Telegraph Office there, and tele graphed the Tehran authorities petitioning that something should be done to pro tect the province from Baluch raiders. Should the authorities not give a satisfactory reply the intention is, I believe, for representatives of all classes in Kainat to ask foi British protection. Governorship of Kainat .—The Shaukat-ul-Mulk recently telegraphed Tehran resigning the Governorship, giving as his reason inability to govern the province, owing to the control of the departments of revenue, the army and justice being taken from him, and placed under officials, who were not under his orders, but directly under Tehran or Meshed. He also pleaded bad health. The Persian Government refused to accept his resignation. Afghan Frontier. —The Afghans are reported to have stationed the following additional troops at the places mentioned :— 200 infantry at Killa Kung. 100 sowars at Deh Ali Mardan, to the north of Burj Sikhsar, 80 infantry at Kobat-i-Pain. 100 infantry at Dakka Dela.

Departure of Mr. Tanner, Indo-Euro , pean Telegraph Department and party 29th May. from Bir'jand. —Mr. Tanner, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Mrs. Tanner and child, and Mr. Nash, Indo-European Telegraph Department, left Birjand in the evening en route for Kerman. All four, on arrival in Birjand on 29th April, were suffering from “ Persian ” fever contracted, in all probability, on the road between Meshed and Birjand. They were the guests of Mr. Howson, while in Birjand. GENEBAL SUMMARY. Baluchi Raids. —The band of some 500 raiders, under the son of Sirdar Muham mad Reza Khan Reki, reported in last week’s diary to be operating to the north west of Neh, tried to raid the village of Chaharfarsakh, but its inhabitants, with the help of some Sistani sowars from Neh. put up fight, and the raiders had to retire. A few were lost on both sides, two Kainis and eight (?) Baluchis being killed. The Baluchis, however, raided three other villages in the neighbourhood. The whereabouts of these Baluchis is not known, but they are believed to be on their way back, with their loot, to the Sarhad. Of the large band reported in last week’s diary, no fresh news has been received. Sistani Lashkar. —Sirdar Khudadad Khan with about 600 men left Lutak, in the evening of 30th May, for Sarhad. They are said to be going via Garagheh. A party of some 200 men, under Sirdar Hyder Ali Khan, was sent on a little ahead to try to intercept a band of Baluchis believed to be returning from Kainat with loot. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Nasir-es-Saltaneh have moved their quarters to Yarmal, where they intend to stay until the return of the lashkar. They have some two or three hundred men with them. Kainat. —In reply to the telegram sent by the merchants and others in Birjand, asking for protection against Baluchi raiders, the authorities have wired sanction ing the payment to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk of Tomans 3,000 with which to raise a force to oppose the Baluchis. This has, for the moment, reassured the people to a certain extent. The Shaukat is now raising a force of 200 men which he intends sending to Neh, under the command of his Baluch brother-in-law, Sirdar Khan Agha, a confirmed 6/zaw^-eater, and alcoholic. He has already stationed about 200 men near Sarbesha and 100 at Neh. As there are, I hear, only about 450 breech-loading rifles of sorts in Kainat, and but very little ammunition, it is scarcely likely that this force will be able to do much to protect the province from Baluchi inroads. Salassa officials. —The Rais recently told Mr. Howson he was unable to collect the opium taxes, and consequently he had recalled his district assistants, one of whom, a short time ago, was beaten by the people of Khusf, and another, only with great difficulty, just escaped similar treatment in Kain city. Perso-Afghan Frontier. —No fresh news. Roads .—All unsafe. - -«Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 19, for the week ending 11th May 1912. GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways. 190. Central Asian Line. —Petersburg papers state that Chief Inspector Gorchakof has reported that structural defects exist on this line on the sections Samarkand-Chorniayevo, and Golodnaya Step-Tashkend. It is said that a special grant will be issued to make good the defects. Employes at the workshops of the line complain that the shops are closed fitfully for a few days at a time and that their earnings are thereby considerably reduced. 191. Rumoured Construction. —An informant notes that at Dushakh station on the Central Asian line about 150 workmen are employed on earth-work, which had extended some 2 miles to the south of the line. On his enquiring the reason he was informed that a line was being commenced to Meshed. The workmen were supervised bv employes of the Central Asian Line. No further confirmation of this report has yet been received. Waterways. 192. Rumoured administration for Turkestan.—Prince Shakofski, the Chief ot the Department of Water Communications, has arrived at Tashkend from Peters burg with the object, it is understood, of forming a head-quarters administration of Turkestan waterways. (Reference paragraph 48.) 193. Amu Darya Flotilla. —A mechanical engineer, in an article in the Novoye Vremya, once more call attention to the many shortcomings of the flotilla, mainly as regards the transport or commercial commodities, and to the disproportionate expense of its upkeep. Among the data cited are:— The establishment.—16 officers, 1 doctor, 3 officials, nearly 400 sailors and 200 paid workmen. The total cost of upkeep for a navigation season of 9 months.—400,000 roubles. Average number of passengers carried during the 9 months.— 20,000. Goods.— under 10,000 tons. Expended on the flotilla during last 10 years.—4,126,000 roubles. Takings by flotilla during the same period.—1,140,000 roubles. Deficit on period.— 2,986,000 roubles. He places the total yearly freight traffic on the Amu Darya at 64,300 tons, of which amount 48,200 tons about are carried by the native boats at a slow rate and high freight. The want of efficient river transport discourages the growth ot cotton and the development of trade generally. As the flotilla does not work during the winter, the cost of land transport for the yearly reliefs of the Kerki and Termes garrisons must m addition be reckoned with. Roads. 194. Andijan-Osh pos&lt;-roo&lt;f.— According to the TurUstan News, an automobile service will be instituted on this road in May of the current year. Passenge cars are being obtained from Russia. ^ I History* 195. Accidents to dams.-k dam has burst on the Tejen river As no repays are possible while the water is high, it is expected that a shortage of irrigation water in the lower reaches will be experienced during the summer. L.2 The bursting of one dam or another on this river seems to be a yearly occurrence. The Tashkend water-supply has also been interfered with by the burstine of a dam. 100. Distress in Khivan Khanate.—The TurHstan News states that owing to loss of live-stock during the winter, and to the failure of cotton and wheat crons considerable distress prevails among the Khivans. ihe trade m tea has apparently been affected by the universal want of &gt; means. 197. The Russians at Meshed. —A second engineer or architect has arrived from Ashkabad and has been engaged in surveying the tract outside the city walls from the Russian Bank Garden to the foot of the hills on the west and as far as the Kuh- i-Sangi road to the north with the object of determining building sites. . A spring—the Chashma-i-Shaikh Baha—beyond Kuh-i-Sangi has also formed the object of Russian attention, and it is apparently intended to utilise it as a water-supply. At a ceremonial parade, held on the anniversary of the birth-day of the Empress, two Russian soldiers wounded during the bombardment of the Shrine, were pre sented by the General with 00 roubles each, the sum having been apparently subscribed by Armenian tradesmen at Meshed. In the course of a speech to the troops, the General assured the men that their blood had not been shed in vain, \ t p at Meshed was now theirs and that they must consider it as their own country as it would not again be abondoned. This view of the conquest of the capital of Khorasan from the adventurer and agent provocateur Yusuf Herati is not without humour. * In this connection the 1st Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General, in discussing the question of the foundation of an officer’s club, remarked to me that they might just as well set it going as they were never likely to evacuate Meshed again. 198. Amu Darya Bridge. —Materials are reported as passing along the Central Asian Railway, and as having been despatched up-stream from Charjui. From * report received they appear to be of two kinds—pontoons and wooden materials • for the roadway of a pontoon bridge, etc., iron cylinders, girders, etc., and materials for a permanent structure. Military. . ■ 199. TashTcend garrison. —The mounted scouts of the Rifle Regiments of the Tashkend garrison left for Troitskoye camp towards the end of April. Two Rifle Regiments and the 1st Turkestan Sapper Battalion are expected to move into camp in mid-May. 200. Staff Ride. —A staff ride or field tour for the 1 st Turkestan Army Corps is to take place in the Samarkand district from the 5th to 14th May. Brigadiers and commanders of units of all arms are taking part in it, and, in addition, mounted scouts, telephonists, and signallers will be employed. Preparatory instruction to the lower ranks was arranged for at Troitskoye camp. 201. Officers' Mess. —A mess for the officers of the 5th Orenburg Cossacks has been completed at Tashkend, the expense being borne by the Amir of Bokhara, the Honorary Commander of the regiment. 202. Nishapur detachment. —Epidemic illness is reported to have broken out among the Russian force detached to Nishapur. A medical officer has been des patched from Meshed to take what measures are necessary. 203. Russian troops in Persia. —Officers of the Taman Cossack Regiment at Meshed have received letters stating that the two sotnnas of their regiment at Astrabad have been ordered to proceed, to Barfarush.

Abdul Baku in America. —The Meshed Vabis have received a telegram from 24 th April, their spiritual leader, who is now in America. They have also heard that the Persian flag was hoisted on the steamer on which Abdul Baha travelled. Influenza epidemic^ —Mr, Tanner has reported that his entire party is pros- 2 5th April, trate with influenza, which is raging in Eastern Persia. The Governor-General. —The Neiir-u-Dola left Tehran about a week ago: but 26th April, he is travelling slowly with artillery and other arms. Political Summary. State of Province. —My colleague is busy collecting evidence to the effect that he is a public benefactor, and that the bombardment was an undisguised blessing. It is, however, doubtful whether he will persuade even the Russian Government that it was necessary in their interests to bombard the Golden Dome on which pigeons alone can sit in order to expel a handful of men, who Were their own paid agents provocateurs. Many Persians have been asked to seal papers drawn up by Mirza Abdul Hamid, the dme damnee of my colleague. In some cases they have refused: but, generally speaking, they have not dared to decline. The Shrine officials are still afraid to check the lists of Shrine property: but I hope for accurate information in time. It is rumoured that some of the fine car- ! pets were not returned, in which connexion my colleague is a keen collector of carpets. The legends about the bombardment reach me daily. It is universally believed that mv colleague was forced to leave his carriage and to walk in the bast by me: that he was forced to restore the Shrine property by my claiming that much of it had been given by an Indian princess; and that I forced him to restore the Shrine to the Persians. From Herat I hear that the Governor upon hearing the news, shut up all the offices, and was much upset. He has also heard the same reports. If the letters, which have undoubtedly been sent to India also state that this Consulate did every thing to help the Persians in their trouble, there will, at any rate, be less feeling against Government. The Area of the Sanctuary .—On 14th April, the Legation telegraphed to the effect that the Russian Legation had ordered my colleague not to change the area of the bast. It concluded by stating that St. Petersburg had given strict orders that my colleague was to obey these orders. On 20th April, a notice was posted up by the Russians in Russian and in Per sian to the effect that as no orders had been received on the subject, non-Moslims were not to enter the Shrine. This means that all the bazaars, which are situated in the sanctuary, are now open. Thus once again there is proof that my colleague cares nothing for any orders that he may receive. The evidence appears to be valuable. State of the roads.— Huseinzada, a brigand by profession is, on behalf of the Persian Government, pursuing Yusuf, who is the chief Russian agent provocateur. The situation is delightful, as is shown by the following instance. The Amir of Kain was sending bales of carpets and saffron to his supporters at Tehran. YusufG. U. Press, Simla.—fto. C.-165 F.

Last week it was reported that Yusuf had been killed by Muhammad My in- formant states that much regret was expressed m certain c.reles at the loss of so useful a man. A Bank specie caravan with 50,000 tomans was recently sent to Askabad. As the route is in the hands of the Russians, I informed my colleague, who gave the man in Charge a letter. He reported from Kuchan that there were robbers on the Xd: but subsequently proceeded with a strong escort. I am making inquiries as to these robbers. I have iust heard from Nishapur that the Russians sent parties in every direc tion to ascertain the exact boundaries of the district. One of these parties was refused entrance into a village, termed Kalata Assad Ulla Khan on the Sabzawar road. The villagers in alarm closed their gates, whereupon the Russians fired and killed a few men. They have since made prisoners of the headmen of the village. P. M.

Baliai Predictions. —Abdul Baha has issued the following predictions:— (a) 29th April, that England and France will take the Caucasus, and (6) that there will be univers al peace. These two predictions are apparently mutually destructive. The Meshed-Tehran Post. —The contractor for the post who is a Russian sub- 30th A P riL ject, has given it up, and pack animals will now be hired from stage to stage.

This again corroborates the view that the troops will remain until the Greek Kalends. Russian Looting.— There was a band of ancient tiles around the tomb cham- 3rd Ma y- her. Of these the Russians have stolen 150 small tiles, and 30 large tiles. So far as I can learn, these tiles are not being sold in the Bazar. They will possibly be sent to the Tsar. Political Summary. State of the Province. —The sanctuary bazaars still remain open in spite of strong orders to my colleague. It is difficult to believe that the Russian Govern ment cannot secure the obedience of their officials. General Redko considers this consulate, so I hear, friendly and polite, but he is hostile to it officially, as he considers that the British Government prevented the return of the ex-Shah. He considers the bombardment the reply of Russia, and is very pleased that he arranged that it should be concluded at night, as that allow ed him to send off all his agents without my knowledge. As a matter ot tact it was obvious that this was the reason, and I made inquiries and obtained evidence by following up this line. Major Redl was informed from an entirely new source that while the General was intriguing with the ex-Shah, he showed a certain individual a list of all the leaders in favour of the movement, and asked many questions about them. Ibis entirely corroborates my report on this question. Last week the Karez Agent reported that there was a gathering of several thousand fanatics, who intended to march on Meshed from Kuhsan. As the Herat Aeent had reported nothing about such a movement, 1 decided to wait for confir- inltion. I now hear from another source that there was a gathering of fanatics to avenge the bombardment of the Shrine : but that it was dispersed by the Gov- ernor of Kuhsan. The Afghan Commander-in-Chief recently met the Herat Agent, and informed , . ,, , f it UpoTi made to the Amir of the bombardment, and of the stops taken by this consulate to help Muhammadans He added that he had heard tha P t the Russian General had committed suicide. This is, of course, the result the suicide of a Russian captain. Migration into Afghan territory on a large scale is reported. The Russian troops have killed a number of ^Vhfl^moTGeneial who s i.. sent 1,000 tomans to Mirza Abdul Hamid. On 28th April, I received a letter from Yusuf, who was at Gunabad. He. K G. M. Press, Simla«*-*No. C. 179 F* D.—&amp;-6.12.-~26.-H.C.S.L. thanked me for obtaining the release of his family. As a matter of fact I had nothing to do with their release: but it happened on the day after my visit to the Shrine and the Oriental habitually confuses yost hoc and proper hoc. Yusuf again stated that all the trouble was caused by my colleague, and said that the bombardment to turn out men, who had no idea of opposing, could only have been in tended to wipe out the defeat by Japan, State of roads .—Some Russians recently came to the rescue of a caravan, which was attacked in the vicinity of Nishapur. They drove off the robbers, recovered the loot, and then kept it, at least that is what I hear. Yusuf and Muhammad are in the neighbourhood of Gunabad. P. M.

Proposed Oxus bridge .— Fourteen large and exceedingly heavy cases, stated to contain bridging material, were despatched on two barges up-stream from Charjui on the 20th April. Bridging material is also reported to be passing along the Central Asian Railway between Krasnovodsk and Charjui. 185. Caspian gale .— Severe weather prevailed in Trans-Caspia towards the end of April. Caspian steamers were detained by a gale, snow fell at Rrasnovodsk, and frost occurred at Khiva, an exceptional manifestation at this time of year. 186. High water in Trans-Caspian rivers .— The Tejen and Murghab rivers are reported to be rising. 187. Reservists .— Reservists at Merv are reported to have been ordered to re join the colours during May. No reason is at present given for this step, nor has similar action been reported from other garrisons. 188. Transport .— Fifty transport carts have been despatched from Askhabad to Merv for the use of the 13th and 14th Turkistan Rifle Regiments, and 10 carts to Kushk also from the Askhahad Store. Turkomans in the neighbourhood of Sarakhs have been warned to keep 700 camels and 500 horses with their saddles in readiness. 189. Meshed garrison .—The Officer Commanding, Taman Cossacks, with 2 other officers have arrived at Meshed. It is reported that their presence is due to the peculation of the commander of the Taman sotnya. A veterinary officer also arrived; who inspected all horses and isolated 10. Ge neral Redko has ordered the shopping of the so’diers in the bazar to be limited to 2 days per week when 2 officers will be on duty in the bazar. The Semiryechia Cossacks at Nishapur last week fired on the inhabitants of a Kurdish village, near Nishapur, who objected to their entering the village. Nine Kurds are said to have been killed or wounded, and, according to one account. 4 Cossacks were wound ed by return fire. The headmen are stated to have been captured. Detachments of this force are reported to have been ordered to Turbat-i-Haidan, Gunabad, and Birjand, but this statement so far lacks confirmation.

GENERAL SUMMARY. i* State of Provinces .—No fresh news regarding Baluchi raiders has been received during the past week. The local authorities are doing nothing to recover the loot carried off in the last raid. Some men (about 100) of the Shebaki tribe, who lost 14 flocks, and had 2 men and 2 or 3 women wounded in the recent raid at Neh, are preparing to go to Sarhad to try to recover their property. These Shebakis are all armed and are said to intend leaving for Sarhad shortly.

I warned them of the inadvisability of entering into disputed territory, and of crossing our frontier. General. State of Provinces .—A party of Baluchi raiders is reported to be operating in the vicinity of Neh; this is probably the party of 200 men mentioned in diary No. 18, week ending 4th May. Another party, said to be over 1,000 strong, under Sirdar Muhammad Reza Khan Reki, is reported to be leaving Sarhad for Kainat. From reports I have heard, this raiding party has been arranged in communication with the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The force, which the Deputy Governor told me he was despatching to Sarhad has not left here yet; the date of its departure is uncertain. Assembling of Afghans on frontier. —The Afghan Subadur has left for Afghanis tan ; affairs between Sirdar Khudadad Khan and the Afghans having been settled ; and I understand the Afghans have left the frontier.

Looting during the Bombardment—The Karguzar informed me that my 15th April, -colleague had sent in a claim by a Bussian subject for property looted during the bombardment. My colleauge, without specifying by whom the looting was actually done, stated that as the Shrine authorities were responsible for the disturbances, they should be called on to pay up all such claims. I have sent in claims by British subjects to the Legation, as I do not wish to discuss them with my colleague. Arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Stevens.- —Mr. and Mrs. Stevens and family have 16th A£)ril . reached Meshed from Kerman by the Lut. It appears that they were most fortunate to have escaped attack, as the whole country swarmed with robbers. They had an escort, and were joined by 400 pilgrims and travellers. He is employed by Castelli Brothers, a Levantine-Itahan firm, which manufactures carpets. One result of the Bombardment. —I hear on good authority that more than 1 4 th Apri | one merchant is selling his property in Khorasan, and intends to settle at Kerman. This is being done in order to live within the British zone. The continued violation of the Shrine. —Orders have been issued by the 1 g th April&gt; General that the Shrine is not to be entered, and that the bast is to be observed. However, this order is only very partially obeyed. The General himself con tinues to go everywhere. Political Summary. State of ProvinceWhen the new Deputy Governor, the Khazin-ul-Mulk, called on my colleague he asked him to send Cossacks to Nishapur, as he was anxious for the safety of his favourite son, whom he had sent to pursue Muhammad. My colleague asked to have the request on paper and this, of course, gives him a strengthened position. The Deputy Governor, hearing that the Russians were bullying his son, asked to have the Cossacks withdrawn : but my colleague refused, unless he was given a document in which the Deputy-Governor accepted all respon sibility for all losses suffered by Russian subjects. I hear that ten men have been posted at every stage, and that they seize all arms, etc. The damage to the Shrine—k committee of Persian architects has examined f the Shrine buildings for damage. They estimate the cost of repairs at 46,000 tomans or £ 9 ,Q 0 a My colleague has reported that 10,000 tomans will cover all the damage. Theystate that 19 shells struck the Golden Dome, and 11 shells the blue dome. The photographs show rather less : but the committee saw everything at close quarters. It win be impossible to replace the tiles; which cannot be manu factured to-day. Bussian Barracks.—Two months ago the Russians made inquiries as to cost of building materials and labour. A Russian architect has now reached Meshed, and I understand that it is intended to constitfct barracks on a piece of land inside the Ark Gate. This land is the property of the Persian Government, and a store for petroleum was being erected by the Customs. Yusuf and Muhammad.—The latest report is that Yusuf has left Muhammad, but it is not confirmed, Muhammad speedily quitted Nishapur when he heard ot the arrival of the troops, and made southwards. He has been attacked near Turbat, and is now making east. The departure of Yusuf from the Bussian Consulate* General.—Both the Rukn- u-Dola and the Karguzar have informed me that my colleague did not inform tb ei T of the fact that he was expelling Yusuf from the Consulate’-General until he had had ample time to reach the Shrine. He left my colleague’s residence with a body of twelve men armed to the teeth.' The RukiMi-Dola states that when he visited the Russian Consulate on the day on which martial law was proclaimed, a servant informed my colleague that Yusuf Khan asked his permission by telephone to attack the police, who had bred at their sangars. The Rukn-u-Dola overheard this. The State of Roads ,—Almost complete anarchy prevails as was only to be ex pected, P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General, G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C 148 P.

Projected Line.—At the 11th meeting of the Eastern Railways Rayon Committee, held at Samara in March of the current year, the advisability of link ing the Amu Darya Division and the Khivan Khanate by a new line with the gene ral railway system was discussed. Having regard to the fertility and cotton-grow ing capacities of the above regions, the proposal was generally approved, but it was decided to await a detailed report before coming to a definite decision. A railway engineer has been engaged in investigation and survey work between Charjui and Khiva for the last year and was recently summoned to Petersburg by telegraph. It is not improbable that his work has been connected with this project. 159. Kokand -Namangan Branch — It is expected that this line will be opened for through traffic during the current month. Waterways* 160. Amu Darya Navigation—The two first steamers of the flotilla to complete the trip from Charjui to Termez and back occupied about 20 days each on the journey. Early in April, a sudden impetus was imparted to the reconstruction of two of the steamers of the flotilla and to the strengthening of the river banks up stream of the Charjui Railway bridge, a number of extra workmen being employ ed. It is not improbable that this sudden recrudescence of activity was motived by the somewhat unexpected advent on the scene of the Minister for War. The strengthening of the river banks was recommended at the end of 1910 by an expert commission to obviate the danger of the washing out of the end piers of the railway bridge by a change in the current which had declared itself, at an estimated cost of 3J million rubles. The work, which has been in progress for about a year, is far from completed, audit seems probable that the sum estimated for will be fully spent if not exceeded. History. 161.

A Russian engineer, deputed from Askhabad for the purpose, arrived a few days ago. The question of the erection of barracks for the Russian troops at Meshed on a site near the ’Ark gate, recent- n! 'Lied ofi by the Customs Department as a petroleum store and now used for piquetting Cossack horses on, formed the subject of discussion between the Rus han Consul-General, General Redko, and this engineer. Estimates of the cost of timber and building materials at Meshed were called for from Askhabad some two months ago. It would thus appear that considerable foresight has been exer cised in the matter and that the course of events was predicted with commendable General Redko recently informed me that he was searching for a suitable site for a full-length rifle range for his troops. On the 17th instant a party of Russian officers making their way through the Bast, or sanctuary, were informed by minor Shrine officials that the Mutawah Bashi of the Shrine had instructed them that on the Consul-General s orders the Bas was to be respected. They were roughly ordered aside, and the officers proceeded on their way General Bedko has since instructed his police officer Kharanof to inform all and sundry that final orders on this subject by the Russian authorities at Tehran are awaited, and that till their receipt the Bast will continue to be tra versed by Russian troops. 164. Aqents Provocateurs —ks far as is known at present, Yusuf Herati and Muhammad the brigand are still gravitating between Nishapur and T urb at-i- Haidari. The former is in a singularly unpleasant position, being placed between the alternatives of incurring serious Russian displeasure if he remains with mad and fails to make for the Russian frontier as instructed, and being killed by the latter if he attempts to cut himself adrift. Several circumstantial reports reached Meshed during the week that this event had actually occurred, and, al though apparently unfounded, they are interesting inasmuch as they evoked em phatic expressions of regret from the Russian officers at losing so valuable an agent. The latest report received by the Russians is that Yusuf has succeeded in separating from Muhammad and is making for Rui Khaf. The wives of both Yusuf Herati and Talib-ul-Haq have received a pecuniary allowance from the Russian Consulate-General for their temporary needs. Military. 165. Movements of Russian Troops to Persia and in Khorasan. —About 50 in fantry and Cossacks embarked at Krasnovodsk for Persian soil during the first week of April. The Semiryechia Cossacks and Machine-gun detachments (paragraph 154) reached Nishapur on the 14th instant. Parties of ten men each were left at the post-stations along the road. 166. Ordnance. —27 guns (description unspecified) were reported to have passed along the Central Asian line from West for Kushk at the beginning of April. The receipt of both artillery and rifle ammunition is reported at most stations. As far as can be ascertained, it appears that the extraordinary despatch of am munition recently reported from Tashkend was motived by the necessity of com pleting local stocks. 167. Transport. —30 4-wheeled and 30 2-wheeled (horse) transport carts have been received at Merv. 60 donkey transport carts have been received at Merv and 50 at Kushk. There has been a steady increase in this class of transport lately. Resources. 168. Irrigation. —The Governor-General has sanctioned the expenditure of 26,000 rubles on irrigation measures in the Tashkend district, chiefly involving the reinforcement of the left bank of the Chirchik river.

GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways, 169. Central Asian Railway. Speed of trains. —The Chief Inspector for Gov ernment Railways, Gorchakof, has recently tested the limit of speed capacity of the line, and considers that a maximum rate of 50 miles per hour may be developed. The speed actually attained on the sections Kazandjik-Askhabad, and Dushakh- Merv, is upwards of 40 miles per hour. In this connection a correspondent has reported that the laying of a rail of heavier type—80 to 90 lbs. per yard according to the data given—has been com pleted between Tashkend and Charjui. 170. Arys-Vyerni Railway Project. —The Turkistan News states that at the end of March a concession for the construction of this line was granted by the Duma to State Councillor Putilof and Engineer Bunge, who propose to organise a joint-stock company with a capital of 60 million rubles. Surveys for the line have been carried out by 2 alternative routes, that to the South having a length of 839 versts and the northern alignment a length of 806 versts. As investigations are not yet fully completed, the Ministries of Ways of Communication and Finance propose the division of the construction into 2 periods or sections, the first from Arys to Pishpek, and the second from Pishpek to Yyerni with a branch to Tok- mak. The first section must be completed within 5 years. A later issue of the paper, however, (13th April) announces that the earth work for the line is to be commenced in May. The headquarters of the construc tion control, including a staff of 70 to 80 persons, will be located at Tashkend, workmen employed will be mainly Russians and it is estimated that two to three years’ work will see the line completed. 171. KoJcand-Namangan Branch. —If festina lente is the maxim governing the inception of the Yyerni line, the departure from it in the construction of the Kokand-Namangan branch appears to have been attended with unfortunate results. Inspector Gorchakof, after travelling on it for a distance of 16 versts, refused to proceed any further as he did not consider it safely laid. Although only a portion of the line is provisionally open, an accident involving the destruc tion of 16 platform trucks has already occurred. History. 172. Proposed Oxus bridge. —The Trcms-Caspian Review states that by mid- April materials for a pontoon bridge across the Amu Darya at Termez were arriving at Krasnovodsk. It is estimated that in transporting them by rail upwards of 200 platform trucks will be required. 173. Financial assistance for the population of MangishlaJc Peninsula. The Minister of the Interior has sanctioned a loan from the Imperial Reserve Capital of 32,000 rubles to distressed Kirghiz of the Mangishlak District. In addition to the above, a sum of 120,000 rubles from the same fund has been placed at the disposal of the Red Cross Society for the medical and other measures necessary for the relief of the famine-stricken population. 174. Tour of Minister for Far.—General Sukhomolinof returned to Tashkend on the 17th April and subsequently left for Petersburgh, having inspected Kushkpost and the Andijan branch of the Central Asian Railway. No visit was paid to Termez. 175. Tashkent Pasteur Thirty-one persons completed treatment dnring March. A small subsidy has been sanctioned by the Governor-General on behalf of Semiryechia and Trans-Caspia. 176. Reported affray on Afghan frontier. —An unconfirmed report has reached Meshed of a collision between Russians and Afghans on the Pan]deh frontier over the return of some looted camels. Casualties are said to have occurred on both .'Bides. 177. Echos of the Meshed Shrine bombardment —Arrivals at Meshed from the Caucasus report prevalent indignation among Caucasian Mussulmans at the desecrationof the Meshed Shrine by the Russians. ^ Work was stopped m some cases as a token of sympathy, and at Kuba shops are said to have been closed and some rioting to have occurred. Confirmation is so far lacking. The Merv police iiave arrested one passportless agitator from Meshed and are in search of his companions. The actual offence probably consists in the neglect to take out the necessary papers. Military. 178. Aviation.—The aviator Syedof has been making experiments in bomb dropping and photography from an aeroplane in conjunction with the Tashkend garrison, officers of which were carried as passengers. 179. Transport and Ordnance—The receipt and despatch of transport vehicles, and of ammunition, both artifiery and small arms, is reported from several stations. 38 transport carts of various sorts have been despatched to Kushk from /Askhabad. 180. Promotion. —Colonel Repiere, the Chief of the Turkistan Military Topo- &lt;graphical Department, is promoted to Major-General. 181. Russian garrison at Meshed.—kn officer and 20 Semiryechia Cossacks left for Nishapur on the 25th April. The officer was the bearer of orders for one of the Semiryechia sotnyas at Nishapur to move to Askhabad on the Nishapur- Sharifabad road. It is expected that the two Nishapur sotnyas will shortly rejoin headquarters at Meshed. An officer of the Taman sotnyas has left for Askhabad to bring recruits, range ammunition and summer clothing. The engineer (architect) left for Askhabad early in the week taking with him a rough plan of the proposed barracks and an estimate of their cost. 15,000 rounds of rifle ammunition have been telegraphed for from Askhabad for the musketry of the troops at Meshed. A range is under construction at the foot of the hills to the west of the town. The officer in charge of the working party informed me that it would be completed shortly and that it would give them a total range of about 3,000 metres. He also stated that the site for the summer camp of the troops has not yet been decided on, suitable localities being without water sup ply, and those provided with water being unsuitable in other respects. Resources. 182. Horse-breeding. —The Trans-Caspian Rural Stud comprises at present 18 stallions and 4 brood mares. 183. Irrigation in Bokhara. —The Amir has leased a considerable tract in the Shirabad Begship (72,000 desyatin) for 99 years to a private Russian company, who propose to irrigate it for the cultivation of cotton.

Afghan Opium for Meshed. —The Amir has sent the enormous quantity of 7th April. 15 kharvars or 9,750 pounds of opium to Meshed for sale. The result has been that the price of opium will be reduced. The consignment is at Karez, as the Customs have not been paid. Departure of Mr. Tanner. —Mr. Tanner left for Kerman with a Persian 8 th April, escort. He has been instructed to travel by Khaf, and to look at the state of the line. The Azim-u-Dola.—A younger brother of the Governor-General was collect ing revenue near Chinaran when he was seized by some Cossacks, and sent into Meshed under escort. The Karguzar of Birjand. —The Ajutant Huzur, the new Karguzar of Birjand 9th April, came to see me. He was formerly Karguzar of Darragaz, and has not been to i Birjand before. I mention this fact as his name is the same as that of a former Karguzar, who was not desirable for the post. Robbery of the Tehran Pos£.— Muhammad robbed the post from Tehran: but April, did not touch the letters. He robbed all pilgrims, and killed a Bussian subject ^ in revenge for the bombardment of the Shrine. Russian Intrigues. —I hear from two independent sources that my colleague nth April, tried to induce a leading Shrine official to seal a document to the effect that I encouraged Muhammad to remain in the Shrine. In this case he failed : but, no doubt, he has succeeded with someone else. A new Russian Consul for Turbat.—A new Bussian consul has been sent to 12 th April. Turbat. M. Lutkine has returned to Meshed. The Musabad Question.—The Amir has ordered Sadik Khan, the owner of 13th April. Musabad, who recently left Khaf for Herat to proceed to Kabul, where a pension will be given to him. Political Summary. State of Province. —Meshed has not yet recovered from the bombardment. The universal opinion is that the Bussians wished to strike a severe blow, and that the General did not wish to return without doing something to distinguish himself. I am inclined to accept these views. I have sent in special reports regarding the experiences of the Mutawah- bashi who was treated with little humanity by the Bussians, and also regarding the dealings of Yusuf with the Bussians after the bombardment. I have sem photographs to Tehran, and also to India, showing the.damage done I hear that they are being bought up very fast, and sent to every corner of the Muhamma dan world. 'State of roads.— Ahmad Ali Shah, who was employed with thirty of his Berberis at Sabza war, and was afterwards sent to attack Muhammad, is now looting near Karez. The Sa lar Humayun has been sent to attack Muhammad who is now said to be od the Meshed-Turbat road. Movements of Russian troops. —A small body of Cossacks has reached Meshed with a consignment of ammunition. A body of tw-o sotnias has been sent to Nishapur with orders not to inter fere with the robbers. They will presumably protect Bussian interests and dis play the power of Bussia. nr • * J 1 P. M.

Refairing Perso-Afghan Boundary Pillars. — The party sent out from this Con- 25 th April 191 2 - sulate to repair pillars No.77 to 90 returned yesterday on completion of the ne cessary repairs. General Summary. State of Provinces .—This does not improve. Most of Sirdar Jehind’s raiders are said to be back in their own country again, but some small bands of Baluchis are believed to be still at large in the Kainat. Some of the men, who accompanied Jehind, were Sistani Baluchi and some Afghan. Information as to the amount of loot carried off in the big raid last week is far from definite, but it is said that over 20,000 camels and sheep were carried off. Owing to the unsafe condition of the roads, and the consequent difficulty of commu nication, definite information regarding the losses sustained by British subjects has not yet been obtained. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Nasir-es-Sultaneh have received instructions to go in pursuit of the raiders, and the Customs, I understand, have been authoris ed to finance the expedition upto a certain figure. Neither the Hashmat-ul- Mulk nor the Nasir-es-Sultaneh, however, appears as if he were going to carry out the instructions received, at least at present. During the past week, near the Shela several flocks of sheep were looted by Baluchis and some people hiked. Roads ,—Are highly unsafe. Floods .—These have caused considerable damage in several places; the places chiefly affected so far are Doulatabad, Muhammadabad, Kosha, Tuti, Varmal, and several smaller places. In some places the crops are practically all destroyed. / The Shela is expected to flow again this year. The road between here and Lutak is blocked through floods, and caravans have to make long detours. A il G, M. Press, S im 1a .— No, CM25 F, D,-—16-5-12,—26.— PG. M.

His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 18, for the week ending 4th (received 18th) May 1912. State of Provinces.—No further looting in the Kainat has been reported during the past week. I hear from Koh-i-Malik Siah that many Baluchis have returned from Kain to the Sarhad with large quantities of loot. A party of about 200 Baluchis is reported to have left Duzdab about the end of April to loot in Kainat, and a party of Sistani Baluchi raiders is also reported to be en route for the same place. Beyond sending a party of about 40 or 50 sowars to Neh, the authorities have done nothing to check further raiding nor have they done anything to try to recover the loot from the last raid. The Baluch Sirdars refuse to do anything to help the authorities, which is to be expected, as they, along with the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, in all probability share in the loot. Assembling of some Afghans on Frontier. —Recently a dispute arose between Sirdar Khudadad Khan and an Afghan named Mahmud, through the Sirdar refus ing to pay for a rifle bought from Mahmud. Mahmud thereupon stole a valuable jambaz of the Sirdar’s. He, in return, sent a party of his men across the frontier who looted Mahmud’s house and carried off two of his women folk. The Sistan Deputy Governor sent over a man to the Afghan authorities to try to arrange matters, but the Afghans have detained him. They have now sent over a Subadar, with a small escort, to interview the Sistan authorities. He has a num ber of cases to go into with the Sistan authorities, the chief case being this one. Meanwhile, a number of armed Afghans have assembled on the frontier, and it is reported that Sirdar Ata Muhammad with some 300 Afghans is on his way there. The Afghans are reported to have said that they are acting in accordance with orders received from Kabul. Reported visit of Afghans to Asperan.— It is reported that a small party of Afghans visited Asperan recently. They, however, stayed only one day there. Further enquiries are being made regarding this visit. Floods in Sistan—These are still considerable. The Shela is now fl° od * The contractors for the supplies for the Robat Column, Muhammad Ah an Brothers, with the consent of the Deputy Governor, are having a steel hawser and pulley arrangement slung across for the conveyance of their supplies for the Column, traders’ goods, Consulate post, etcetera.

The Agent does not say what the distance was. Political Summary. The State of the Province. —My Russian colleague has filled the cup of his iniquity by bombarding the Shrine, the glory of the Shia world. The pilgrims col lected in its courts in the pathetic belief that the Imam would protect them, and were massacred to the number of one hundred killed and wounded.

Aviation. —A proposal is on foot for the establishment of a School of Aviation at Askhabad, [stress being laid on climatic facilities. Recent visits of r viators, more especially the passenger-carrying flights of the aviator Syedof, have tended to popularise the science, but it is not improbable that, as in the case ^)f the proposal of a School of Aviation at Tashkend, nothing will come of the pro ject. 150. Proposed extension at Merv, — The Turkomans at Merv have been ordered to remove their encampments to some distance from the town to admit of build ing extension. 151 Attack on Takhta Bazar-Tashkepri Mail, —Investigation has proved that the reported attack on the mail cart (reference paragraph 73) was entirely due to a misunderstanding. The personnel of the mail, mistaking some Afghan camel-men restine by the road for robbers, fired on them, The latter in self defence returned the fire but no one was hurt. The unfortunate Afghans have, however, been arrested. Military. 152 Frontier Guard Inspection.—The Chief of the Corps of Frontier Guards, General Pykhachef, has arrived in Trans-Caspia to carry out his inspection of th» 30th and 31st Brigades of the Corps. 153 Movements of troops between Persia and Trans-Caspia, Small parties of Infantry and Cossacks, in some cases with materiel, passed through Krasnovo sk dX for Persia during the last week of March, but the total is mconsiderab e, T^ins and 45 artillerymen of the 4th Bifle Artillery Division and 30 Cossacks of the Kuban Battery returned to Merv and Kahka respectively, both from he direction of Astrabad, 154 Troops in Khorasan.—Two hundred of the gemiryechia Cossack Regi ment and 2 infantry machine-gun detachments comprising 48 men and 8 maxims left Meshed on the 12 th April for Nishapur, in response to an appeal from the Russian subjects at that place for protection. A total of 12 officers accompanied the detachment. They were particularly instructed by General Redko not to interfere with the band of the notorious Muhammad at present operating in the hills near Nishapur, unless the latter first attacked them.

Flood in Seistan. —The water is rising, and floods have occurred in several places. Genebal Summary. State of Province. —During the past week Baluch raiders from the Sarhad have been busy in the Kainat, A force made up from various tribes, estimated at over 2,000 men, under Sirdar Jehind, and divided up into two or three bands, pillaged the town of Neh, the village of Kaimabad (5 miles from Shusp) and the environs of Shusp about the 16th instant. Other villages have also been looted, several people have been killed, and some prisoners, including two or three women, have been carried off. The raiders have now left the vicinity of Neh, and the last news received was that they were at Deh-i-Salm, about 50 miles to the west of Neh. As to the amount of loot carried off, it is impossible to give figures, as reports vary, but there seems no doubt that it is considerable. A large quantity of wheat lying at Kaimabad, belonging to a British subject, was looted, and 100 camel-loads of merchandise were carried off from near Neh. Full particulars of property belonging to British subjects have not yet been received. The N a sir- es-Sultaneh is busy getting ready a force to send out to intercept the raiders on their return, but he is having difficulty in getting enough men, and those he has got are indifferently armed. The Baluch Sirdars are not assisting him. In the Kainat things are no better, as the Shaukat-ul-Mulk has got very few men, the Nasir-es-Sultaneh having disbanded most of the old troops in Birjand, and, although having recruited a number of men since, most of them have returned to their homes owing to their pay having been stopped. State of 2?oads.—Unsafe in all directions.SECRET. Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 14, for the week ending the 6th April 1912. GENERAL SUMMARY. Communications. Railways. 137. TasJikerd Line. Snowdrifts. —Considerable delay to traffic of all sorts was caused on the northern portion of the line by snowdrifts in the latter half of March. The express train of the 20 th March reached Tashkend 21 hours behind time. 138. Rersonnet.—your guards employed on the line have been committed to prison for complicity in the robbery of a quantity of tea carried by a train in their charge. 139. Arys-Yyerni Line Project. —The “Turkistan News” states that delay in the commencement of the construction of this line has been caused by the fact, that estimates for construction work were prepared on the basis of the payment of 1 J rubles per square sazhen of earthwork, whereas the prevailing cost of wage for the task has risen to 3 or 3j rubles. Revision is thereby necessitated, but the paper reiterates its statement that work will begin towards the end of July. Waterways. 140. Opening of North CaspianNavigation. —News has been received from As- trachan that cargo vessels came out into the roads on the 17th March and were expected to leave the port a few days later. Roads. 141. Kabidsai-Vyerni post-road. —The condition of this road has recently been so bad as to be almost impassable. Post-horses are deficient in number, and dead animals are to be seen along the road. An official travellirg on government busi ness occupied eleven days in covering a distance of 250 versts between Kubulsai and Aulieata. History. 142. Frontier Guard captures. —The Sarakhs detachment of the 30th Brigade of Frontier Guard recently seized a caravan, conveying contraband goods to the value of 1,500 rubles near Karabend on the Perso-Transcaspian frontier. A consignment of Indian muslin worth 600 rubles has been seized in Bokharan territory at Kulyab, the owner, an Afghan, having succeeded in smuggling it across the frontier. 143. Visit of German Staff Officer. —The papers state that the Chief of the Bavarian General Staff—Fiiner—has been granted permission to visit Tashkend, Samarkand, Bokhara, Merv and Krasnovodsk. 144. Earthquake shocks. —Shocks continue to be felt at Vyerni. A slight shock was experienced at Tashkend on the 22 nd March. 145. Bombardment of Meshed Shrine by Russian troops. —With the avowed object of dispersing or capturing the gang of agitators headed by Yusuf Khan Herati, who have been for some weeks in possession of the shrine, the Russian troops under the command of Major-General Redko subjected the sacred buildings to a severe bombardment from the 3-inch quick-firing guns of the Kuban Cossack2 ttoHprv nn the 30th March. The bombardment, in the course of which nearly 200 shell both common and shrapnel, were fired, commenced soon after 4-30 p. M. and was continued till dusk when the Russian troops entered the Shrine Prac i- calty'no resistance was offered by the agitators. R^sian casua ms were 3 Cossacks emDloved in maintaining commumcation wounded. 74 Persians were killed and 3 “ wounded. Most, if not all, of these were pilgrims or worshippers at the shrine, and women were among both the dead and wounded. The sacred buildings show considerable superficial damage to the beiutiful mosaic and go d-plated work though on account of the solidity of the buildings, little structural damage could be produced by the field artillery. Many of the treasures of the shrine were taken away, but have apparently since been replaced The shops with which the courts of the shrine were lined, and many shops in the adjacent bazars, have, however, been subjected to wholesale loot. The leaders of the agitation Yusuf Herati, Naib Ali Akbar Hassani, and it is beleived also Muhammad the robber, were, after the bombardment, escorted out of the city by the Russian troops till clear of the Russian cordon, when they were permitted to depart. Some of the minor leaders were, however/captured and remain' in Russian hands On the occasion of our official visit to the shrine on the 1st instant, I asked the Chief Staff Jfhcer, w received us there, whether they had any intelligence of the whereabouts of Yusuf and the other leaders. He replied that no trace of them had been discovered in the Shrine when they entered it nor had they since been found, and that it was believed that they were still in hiding in the city. The effect produced by this drastic action on the inhabitants of all classes is, as might be expected, deplorable—all the more so as, on the day on which the bombardment was carried out, an amelioration of the local situation was apparent which it was hoped, not without some justification, would terminate in a peace ful solution of the question.

Reforms in TurJcistan Administration. —According to the Press, the special pleted its task, and the result has been presented to the Council of Ministers. Its recommendations include changes in the system of existing administration, changes in police organisation, land taxation, the emigration question, the distribution of water, popular education and other points. llh. Tashkent Line. Personnel— Several changes among the heads of depart ments and higher officials of this line are said to be imminent. From the fact that these officials have themselves applied for transfer to other lines, it would appear that the stricter measures, lately inaugurated on the railway, are not to their taste. 120 . Accumulation of freight. —Owing to the dislocation of traffic on the line by snow-drifts, large quantities of freight have accumulated at way-side stations. Stringent instructions have been received from Petersburg to deal with these with out delay. 121. Losses by /tre.—Damage to the amount of 34;000 rubles was caused during the last 4 months of 1911 by fires on this line arising from various causes. 122 . Arys-Vyerni project. —The only fact which appears to be certain regarding the construction of the Semiryechia railway is that the work will not begin in the spring as hitherto announced. The “ Turkistan News ” announces the commence ment of construction for July and states that by working simultaneously from Arys and Pishpek, and employing American methods of construction, the rails will be laid by the end of 1913. The “ Trans-Caspian Review,” on the other hand, controverts this statement and asserts that the only work which will take place in the current year will be a Government verification of the existing survey, as the alignment to be followed has not yet been definitely decided on. 123. Amu Darya Navigation. —The first steamer of the season was despatched up-stream from Charjui on the 12 th of March, a barge only being sent to Petro- Alexandrovsk. 124. Caspian Navigation.—The steamship company “ Russ ” is opening an office at Krasnovodsk and despatching steamers to call at that port. 125. TU Semiryechia post-road.—The condition of this road was described as deplorable at the end of February and beginning of March. Postal vehicles were unable to traverse several of the stages and passengers were obliged to ride the post- horses and, in some cases, camels. Heavy freight traffic on the road was at a com plete standstill for two weeks and recommenced during the first week in March. March 1912. GENERAL SUMMARY. Administration.

Askhabad-Firyusacommunication .—The “Trans-Caspian Review” states that a company is being formed at Askhabad to inaugurate automobile traffic for the ensuing summer season.

Histoey. 127. The ex-Shah and his 'partisans. —A correspondent reports that the Shua- es-Sultaneh reached .Krasnovodsk on the 21st March in the postal steamer from Chikishliyar, re-embarking for Baku in the post-boat without landing. The newspaper “ Caspian ” contributes some details of the Shah’s departure from Persia. He embarked on the 29th February on the gun-boat “ Kars ” on which he remained till the arrival on the 10 th March of the “ Geok Tepe ” and “ Araks ” when he transferred to the first-named and left for Russia escorted by the “ Araks ”. The long delay, it is explained, was caused not by the ex-Shah’s waiting on the trend of events in the capital, but by his disinclination to travel in the “ Kars ” and the necessity of awaiting the arrival of the other vessels from Baku. As the “ Kars ” is the latest gun-boat and is fitted with all modern improvements and as 10 days is rather over the usual time necessary between Baku and the sou thern shore of the Caspian, it is permissible to doubt the correctness of this plau sible and ingenuous explanation. 128.

The Governor-General has assigned a sum of 1,46,000 rubles from the reserve capital for the alleviation of distress among the famine-stricken population of the Amu Darya Division.

He is said to have made about 10,000 tomans in this manner. General Redko.—Thv Russian General tells me that he is going to Kuchan to inspect, and he has asked me, when he returns, to teach some of the officers to play polo. As it all makes for friendly feeling, I have of course agreed. The No Ruz. —The usual calls were paid. . The Chief Justice,—With, truly Persian folly, the Rais-i-Istinaf visited the Shrine, and has been seized and ill-treated by Yusuf, and his gang. He is being kept as a hostage. Russian accounts. —I hear on good authority that the Russians are charging double prices for all supplies in their accounts. It is understood that the Persian Government will be called upon to pay. POLITICAL SUMMARY. • Stale of the Province. —The situation is less hopeless than before. I asked M. Grigoriefi to visit me, and he informed me that my colleague had at last realised* that it was impossible for him to employ Russian troops against the royalists, as, once fighting started, the Russians would inevitably follow up the enemy into the Shrine. I said that as we were now in full agreement, it seemed desirable for us to' act together to make peace. I am glad to say that my proposals were adopted, and the two representatives have # been working to end the trouble, and there are some hopes of success. It was first arranged that a paper containing various de mands, some reasonable and some childish, should be sealed by all parties, and then be signed by both Consuls-General. However, the royalists went back on their agreement, and added such clauses as that all murderers should be held to be inno cent, as soon as they had entered the Shrine ! After taking an istakhara on the beads, it has been agreed that there should be a meeting at which the two represent atives should draw up a fresh agreement. This is to take place this afternoon, and there is some hope that terms will be arranged. On the other hand, the robbers may not agree to leave the Shrine. The most hopeful sign is that my colleague has made a complete volte face and is now most ready to co-operate. He has told me that he fully realises that to employ Russian troops would inevitably lead to the violation of the Shrine, and that this would produce a wave of fanaticism even in the Caucasus. Meanwhile murders and outrages continue, and there is incessant shooting at night. There is food in the Shrine for many months, and plenty of wells. Thus a blockade is out of the question. Personally, I consider that if we are successful in arranging this matter, we shall have to let loose all the murderers to prey on the district, and that there will be another disturbance in a few months’ time, as the Persian Government has no power or authority.

On some days as many as 200 cart-loads of ammumtwn were taken to the railway station and guns are also reputed to have been sent off.

After consultation with the Russian Consul regarding the news that the Russian troops had attacked and captured the shrine in Meshed, I called on the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to tell him what we had heard, and asked him to be prepared to take steps to prevent any anti-European demonstrations here should such occur. He assured me he would do all he could to maintain order, but con sidered such an outbreak most unlikely. I asked Mr. Forkgen to make similar representations to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Baron Tcherkassov was very nervous when we first heard the news, espe- cially about Birjand, but is not so now as the reception of the news here and in Birjand does not seem to have given rise to any particular excitement.

Yusuf has been joined by Muhammad, the well-known robber, from the Nishapur district as already stated, and they are now threatening to attack the police. Already one police man has been shot, and several have had their rifles seized. My colleague, in spite of repeated orders from St. Petersburg and from Tehran is still working in the cause of the ex-Shah with the utmost zeal. I have reported to the Legation that in the opinion of the Agency Surgeon, who has attended him, he is suffering from incipient senile decay. For some time I have found him unable to discuss questions, and now deal with the first secretary, who laments the attitude of his chief, or by letter. I am writing a report on the whole situation. State of the roads .—Mr. Tanner, who has reached Mazinan, near Sabzawar, reports that he has not been molested. I hope that he will repair the line quickly, as I feel anxious about him^ although I have arranged for an escort to be provided for him. Numerous robberies as usual. Russian Troops. —M. Grigorieff tells me that the Governor-General of Turkis- tan is urging that the troops return, as General Redko has reported that there is no necessity for them to remain. My colleague is naturally opposing this point of view. As previously reported, the number sent was excessive: but it would be a mistake for them to be withdrawn just now, and the departure of the general, who is a sane man, would be most regrettable. P.

Murder by a Russian Subject. —A Russian subject quarrelled with a man for 7 th March, shouting out ‘ ‘ Long live Muhammad Ali Shah '' and shot him. He has been arrested by my colleague. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 10 of 1912. State of the Province.— situation is even more serious than last week. Early on Sunday morning, according to my Russian colleague, a Russian officer was returning from the house of the Manager of the Bank, which is situated a mile outside the walls, when he was fired at. He returned the shots, as also did the two Cossacks with him, and no one was hit. It would be thought that this incident was of slight importance, if true : but, on the strength of it, my colleague applied to his Legation for permission to declare martial law, and to administer the city. Being asked to give my views by the Legation, I explained that the attack had not been corroborated, and that it could not be construed into a delibe rate attack on a Russian officer. I pointed out that the incident was being used by my colleague to carry out his plan of first creating a disturbance, and then of seizing the city because it was disturbed. Early on 6 th i March, Yusuf attacked the Police post in the Pain Khiaban, and seized four policem en, one of whom he subsequently murdered. In the evening my colleague sent troops to three points in the city with the nominal object of protecting Russian subjects : but also, it appears, m the hope that some thing might occur which would strengthen his hands. One of my agents is with Yusuf and he states that that worthy was much upset by this action : but that he received a message from the Russian Consulate that he need not be afraid. On the 8 th March, Yusuf again sallied out. A Russian officer was with the Police Commissary and induced him to fight, whereupon Yusuf retired. There ensued much firing from the Shrine, during which a relief of Russian troops appeared between the two forces having apparently lost its way. Fortunately the firing ceased until the Russians were undercover. There were about ten casualties. Yusuf preaches that the ex-Shah is marching on Meshed. I hope that as suggested by me, we may be instructed to inform the Karguzar jointly that he has left Persia. This might end the struggle. Muhammad, the Nishapur robber, has heard from Haji Ah Aga (Russian subject) and from Hassanzada that they are coming to Meshed with two hundred sowars to join the royalists. This would be the proverbial last straw. On 8 rd March the Karguzar received a telegram from the Foreign Minister . ^ that the Russian Legation was inquiring about Prince _ Dabija, who has stated that throughout he had done all he could to calm the agitation. The Karguzar in his reply referred to the case of Yusu , who started the agitation while ffiS at the Russian Consulate : he also gave the instance of the telegram from the iL Shua-u Skltana. Finally, he said that during the last four or five days my colleague had written letters to discourage the agitation. Unfortunate y for my col ealgue the proofs exist that he started and encouraged the disturbances, and Morally speaking, the blood of the men, who have been killed was shed by him. i 4 MAY191 9 J&lt;?.

The Karguzar and the Sitmtum—lhe Karguzar, who really deserves well ot his Goveriment, came to tell me that he had been asked from Tehran to give his opinion.

I also added that it was equally important to inform Tehran that unless the police and troops were paid, it was useless to expect them to do anything. Finally that they should be promised a good reward for ending the disturbance. As I expected, the Foreign Minister sent the whole of the first part of my suggestions, but said nothing about money. The Governor-General sent for the Attache to ask his advice m view of this strong order, and was advised to insist upon some money being paid to the police and troops, and there the question remains for the time being. , T'wsw/ and the Bdbis. Yusuf seized some Babis, and threatened to hang 12th March, tnem . but, as 1 expected, released them, after receiving some money. Mr. Tanner.—Mi.

He is apparently instructed to travel along the Meshed- oistan line to Birjand, from which town he will proceed across the Lut to Kerman, where he is to be stationed. The Afghan Agent and Yusuf Herati. —Abdulla Khan came to me in great 14 th March, trouble, as his servant had been seized by Yusuf, who demanded lansom for him. He told me that Yusuf was orginally kept for immoral purposes, and that he could not enter Afghanistan, as he was known to be a Russian spy. I advised him to use his influence to detach the numerous Afghans, who are with Yusuf, and told him that I could not enter into correspondence with Yusuf. The Mutawalibashi. —As I expected, the new Mutwalibashi has proved to be isth March, quite useless. I am suggesting to the Karguzar that he should press for the Sadr-ul- Mamalik to be reappointed. This worthy individual was always on the side of law and order, and was on good terms with both Consulates. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. M of 1912. State of the Province .—My colleague’s plot of seizing Meshed has apparently been foiled by the Legation. The Russian troops have been withdrawn from the city, and my colleague now talks plaintively to me of the serious losses to Russian trade. He has sown the wind, and does not enjoy reaping the whirlwind. The Legation telegraphed to me on 13th March that the ez-Shah had left Ashurada, the Russian naval station in Astrabad Bay, for Baku. The Russian Minister also informed Prince Dabija of the fact the same day, which promptness contracts somewhat curiously with their former neglect. The publication of this news produced a good effect. The position is, however, still difficult, as the Governor-General and the Com- mander-in-Chief are exceptionally cowardly even for Persians. The Government troops also decline to fire on the Shrine. Consequently, Yusuf is still increasing his forces, and talks about imitating Nadir Shah. If, however, Russian troops attack and enter the Shrine, a flame of fanaticism would be kindled which would lead to attacks on Russians all over Persia, and would surely produce “la fin des fins ” of which my colleague is always talking. This is exactly what we wish to avoid, and so I am stimulating the officials and constitu tionalists, who were formerly lions, to work together, and end this unprofitable agitation, which has now lost any reason it may have had.

O’Connor, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 13, for the week ending 30th March (receiv» ed 15th April) 1912. State of Provinces .—The Hajji Nasir-es-Sultaneh seems a sensible man, and inclined to do his best to settle outstanding cases, and to adjust differences. He appears to understand thoroughly the raiscn d’etre of the Baluch raids in the Kainat during the last twelve months, and has recommended (so he tells me) the dismissal of the present hereditary Governor of both Seistan and the Kainat, and their replacement by a fresh man from elsewhere to be in charge of both pro vinces. For the rest he is occupied in arranging some kind of armed forces, and in securing the safety of the trade routes. State of Roads .—Nothing fresh to report. Russian Consul .*—Before proceeding on leave, I should like to leave upon record my appreciation of the friendly co-operation with me of my Bussian colleague, Baron Ch^kassoff. The Baron is an ideal colleague to work with both socially and officially, and during the last two and a half years we had no sort of difference or friction. He abstains entirely from intrigue, and has always acted strictly in accordance with the spirit of the Anglo-Bussian convention. Imperial Bank of Persia .—The Seistan branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia has been doing a very good business lately under its able manager, Mr. Wilkinson, and for the first time since its inception has made a considerable net profit on the transactions of the half year to which the Agency afc Birjand contributed a fair share. This is the more satisfactory, as although the Seistan branch of the Russian Bank was closed during last winter the new Birjand branch is working very hard to secure customers and to do business.

Muhammad the Brigand. —Muhammad, the Nishapur brigand, who had seized 20 th February, the Ismaili village of Dizbad, left it and came with twenty men to Zakkaria, a village only five miles from Meshed. He was attacked by a few sowars, six of whom he killed. At night he joined Yusuf Herati in the Shrine. The State of Affairs in the Herat Province. —The Herat Agent reports that since j 2 ist February, the arrival of the new general, the state of affairs has grown steadily worse. For merly the Governor was all powerful and maintained some kind of order : but now that the authority ih divided and more corruption than usual prevails, every official is able to act as he pleases. The Russians and Turkoman Women. —The Herat again reports that several ^ 23rd February, tribes of Turkoman are thinking of crossing into Afghanistan to avoid having to give their girls to be made prostitutes. The Revenue of Khorasan. —M. Leleux has been appointed to collect the 24 th February, revenue and the Vizier has been dismissed. The latter came to see me and stated that he was very glad to be relieved of his onerous task : but that he resented being accused of having incited the pensioners to agitate. He added that he was asking for an inquiry on the subject at which representatives of both consulates would be represented. As I know that he has intrigued, it was hard to be sympathetic. State of the Province .—The situation is still acute. Yu^uf Herati has been joined by Muhammad the Nishapur brigand who has for sometime been in com munication with Prince Dabija. On 20th February my colleague acknowdedged that he had received instructions to change his attitude: but he refused to act con jointly with me. The Minister informs me that he has received instructions so to do, direct from St. Petersburg. However this miy be he has only written a letter to the Talib-ul-Hak to the effect that the Hussian Government would not allow the return of the ex-Shah. To prove how h.3 is-still aiding the royalists I have the copy of a telegram which was sent through him to Yusuf Herati from the Shua-u-Saltana which states that the ex-Shah will leave for Meshed on 14th March. This was delivered after he had acknowledged receiving instructions to change his attitude. On the evening of 23rd February the Minister gave me permission to write to the Karguzar that the ex-Shah had agreed to leave Persia. This will, I anticipate, help to improve the situation. Yusuf and his band shoot freely at night to keep up their courage: and the Persian authorities fear to take any action both because of the sanctity of the Shrine and also because they realize that my colleague is only waiting for a chance to take over the administration of the city. State of the roads. —^Numerous robberies are reported by all my agents. One took place within four miles of Meshed. Movements of Russian troops. —A body of seventy recruits has reached Meshed and some time-expired men have left. A party has gone towards Pujnurd. The general continues to be most friendly and obliging. The visit of the English repre- ; sentatives to Russia is certainly producing a good effect. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 8 of 1912.

Malaria in Turkistan.—The sanitary authorities at Tashkend have been turning their attention of recent years to the prevention of malaria in the Tashkend district, apparently without great success as 40,000 cases were registered in 1911 against 46,000 in 1909. 89 Bokhara.— M. Somof, appointed Political Agent at Bokhara some time ago, was recently expected to arrive there to take over his duties from M. Ryeshetof who has been acting for him for about a year.

Diary No. 10, for the week ending 9th March 1912, not printed, as it contained nothing of interest.] Mr. W. R. Howson arrived at Lntak on Lis way back from leave to resume his duties as Vice-Consul at Birjand. He travelled the whole way from Nushki in a motor car, which was being brought up for the Consul, without encountering serious difficulties anywhere on the road. State of Provinces.—The Nasir-es-Saltaneh has at last left Birjand and is making a leisurely progress towards Seistan. 1 hear that a large band of Sarhaddi Baluchis (Ismailzais and Yar Muhammadzais) is preparing to start for theKainat, to loot, and to avenge the death of some of their tribesmen who have been killed at various times by the Kainies. State of Roads .—Robberies continue in the neighbourhood of Seistan. Some donkeys carrying bhusa for the troops at Kacha were recently carried off together with their loads from near Hauzdar. The Persian post, which left Kuh Malek Siah for Seistan on the 12th March, is said to have been looted near Chah Muhammad Reza. The robbers returned the letter bags to the sowar, but carried off all the parcels. General Summary.I q | r' Seistan Consular Diary o! Major W. F. O’Connor, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul lor Seistan and Kain, No. 12, lor the week ending 23rd March (received 6th April) 1912. 21st March .—Persian New Year. I paid the usual calls. 23rd March .—The Hajji Nasir-es-Saltaneh has arrived in Seistan, but does not make his state entry into the town until tomorrow. It is just over a year now (on the 9th March 1911 to be exact) that I heard from His Britannic Majesty^ Minister at Teheran that this individual had been appointed Sarhaddar of Seistan with instruc tions to enquire into the subject of the Baluch raids into the Kainat, and also of the robberies of caravans carrying British merchandise committed by Afghan gun runners during the summer months of 1910. The Nasir-es-Saltaneh reached Birjand in July last, and has remained there ever since, endeavouring to organise some kind of an elective force of Kainis to oppose the Baluch robbers ; and although he has certainly worked very hard with this object in view, the results have hitherto been most unsatisfactory—partly owing no doubt to the wretched material he has had to deal with. Now that he has arrived at Seistan, I hope to be able to make some pro gress with the Afghan robbery cases. GENERAL SUMMARY. State of Provinces .—There has been a riot at Birjand directed against the Opium department, during the course of which the employes of the department fired on the crowd, killing three persons and wounding several others. One of the emploves was killed by the crowd, and the remainder, with their Chief, took refuge” with the Governor. The whole thing was due to faulty methods of adminis tration conducted by incompetent persons. State of Roads .—No fresh robberies reported during the last week. Arms Traffic .—A small party of Afghans is said to have passed through Daki Dela, a few days ago, bound for the Gulf with some 30,000 Krans for the purchase of arms! They are said to be accompanied by one Mirak of the Kubdani tribe.[Confidential.] Meshed Consular Diary No. 7 for the week ending 17th February [received 21st March) 1912. , F ? b ™*ry The Pensioners.—An order has been received from Tehran to the ettect that all pensioners alike should be given 100 tomans and that noth ing more will be paid. As most of the pensioners are powerful and rich the result will be to increase the feeling against the present regime. The pensioners intend to demonstrate. , An emissar y from the ex-Shah. —Sheikh Ismail Kainihas reached Meshed with letters for the Governor-General, the Shuja-ul-Mulk (the Hazara Chief), Aga Mirza Ibrahim and others. He states that the ex-Shah will reach Meshed by No Kuz. 13th February. The Salar-u-Dola. —The Foreign Minister has informed the Karguzar of the defeat of the Salar-u-Dola at Kermanshah with heavy loss. lith February. Reported appointment of Russian judges.—It is reported that a Russian Court is to be formed at Meshed. If true, it probably means that the Consulate cannot deal with the cases which occur. 15th February. The Amir on the situation. —The Afghan Agent, who sent a report on the action of the Russians to Kabul, has received a reply from the Amir to the effect that the English were being deceived by the Russians and that they would soon lose India on this account. 16th February. Movements of Mr. Tanner. —The Telegraph Inspector has left Damghan and is now moving towards Meshed repairing the line. I shall have special arrangements made for his protection when he enters Khorasan, as the whole country is disturbed. 17th February. The American Dental Syndicate. —Dr. Esselstyn tells me that it is possible that an American dentist will settle at Meshed in the spring. After the capital there is no towm in Persia where a dentist would make more money than Meshed and the boon to the place would be very great. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 7 of 1912. In a special report (No. 8 to the Legation and No. 8-C. to the Govern ment of India) I have given an account of the situation of affairs up to 10th February. On 14th February Yusuf Herati, with Shaikh Ali Akbar ^a Russian student), the Talib-ul-Hak and Seiid Mobamed Ali began a fresh demonstra tion. They threatened this Consulate-General and its servants as well as the Constitutional party. The latter I have restrained with much difficulty from retaliating. The Attache found out that they had subscribed 900 tomans and engaged some Caucasians to murder Yusuf and the other leaders. Fortunately he was able to stop this Persian counterstroke by pointing out that it would create the exact situation that was to be feared. On the evening of 14th February a telegram was received by me from the Legation to the effect that the ex-Shah had agreed to leave Persia. The next day I suggested to my colleague that this should be communicated to the Karguzar conjointly. His reply was that he had heard no such information and this is his attitude still. On 16th February I suggested to the Legation that joint instructions in the sense desired should be sent to the two Consulates. I am convinced that my colleague is still the soul of the agitation and I hear that he is being paid by the party of the ex-Shah. Yusuf communicates with him through Akbar Buland and last night received six bank notes from him with a message to retire from the fray for two or three days. My colleague has sent copies of petitions in favour of the ex-Shah to his Legation, to the Tsar and to the ex-Shah. Whether or no there is double dealing in high quarters I cannot tell: but the fact that my colleague continues to work for the ex-Shah and also denies rbavins heard anything of the arrangement for the departure of the ex-Shah k to say the least of it, suspicious. At the same time I imagine that other is, ro . , actios in favour of the ex-Shah and as my colleague is so ea” und ^ when he quits the straight path, it would be a pity if he left Khorasan. T , , State of the roads .—The head of the Ismaiks has written to me from Dwabad to the effect that Mohamed the well-known thief in the Nishapur district had fled to Dizahad pursued by Berberi sowars who had killed two of his sang He said that Mohamed was living with him and that the villagers could not sleep at night for fear. He also mentioned incidentally that Mohamed had sent a letter to my colleague asking him for some cartridges. Just at this time it was reported to me that the brother of Akbar Buland had bought 700 cartridges and it will be interesting to see whether they reach Mohamed. Russian Troops.— Tatties of Russian troops have gone to Khaf: to Turk Oba, apparently in connection with a summer camp : to Chmaran and also to Nishapur. It will be interesting to see what this last party does. Much military sketching is being carried on. The ex-Shah.— Two hundred men have left Meshed to welcome and aid the ex-Shah, who is believed to be marching on Meshed via Ramian. The report was to the effect that the Shua-u-Saltana with 2,000 men was marching ahead and the ex-Shah was, as usual, well in the rear. I imagine that the action of the two Legations will have stopped this new development, and if so, it is most fortunate as with my colleague his open partisan, it would have been an extremely difficult position.

If this proves correct, it means a gain of some 3 million rubles on the previous year. 60. Mono-rail.—A. “ suspended railway ” privately constructed at the Verbef coal mines in the Khojent District is approaching completion and will shortly be opened. Waterways. 61. Dredgers for the Caspian.—OWmg to the want of dredgers on the Caspian Sea—2 only being in existence there—and the necessity for clearing the harbours of slit, the Minister of Trade and Industry proposes to order a dredging outfit to the sum of 550,000 rubles, which will comprise a dredger, machinery, a tug, barges, etc. History. 62.

This line has, to economise rolling-stock, taken to conveying cotton from the Andijan Branch to Krasnovodsk on platform trucks instead of in covered waggons at its own risk. A platform truck will take 12 tons of cotton and two such trucks will carry as much cotton as three covered waggons. Six thousand waggons of cotton left the Andijan Branch in December, the total doubtless being divided between the Tashkent and Central Asia lines. Waterways. 38. Rrojected Steam Navigation on the Syr T)aiya .—The Minister of ways of communication has signified his consent to a private enterprise for providing service of steam tugs on the Syr Darya between Khojent and Namangan, and on the Naryn Biver as far as Uch-Kurghan. 39. Amu Darya Navigation .—Steamer navigation, including the towing of loaded barges, was still in progress on the Amu Darya between Charjui and Kerki up to the end of January. Both barges and steamers have, however, met with difficulties and frequently run aground. Boads. 40. Task Kepri Chaussee.— r FaQ Governor-General has now asked the Minister of War for a grant of 109,000 roubles for the conversion of the Takhta Bazar-Tash Kepri road into a chaussee.

Besources. 44. Mineral resources in Turkistan.—A. series of articles in the Turkistan News supplies the following data regarding mineral resources in Turkistan for 1910 :■zz 2 I Naphtha. Mine companies exist in Ferghana forthe exploitation of naphtha. The three principahare : (1) The Chimion Company. Output for the year, 22,765 tons. (2) The Sel Hokho Company “ Santo.” Output for the year, 4,152 tons. (3) The Maili Sai Company. Output for the year, 783 tons. Combined output for the remaining 6 concerns, 224 tons. Total output for Ferghana in 1910, 27,924 tons. This figure exceeds the output for 1909 hy over 14,000 tons, the large increase beiSg accounted for hy the fact that in 1909 the Chimion Company was compelled to undertake extensive repairs of its boring machinery and that its borings were much damaged hy flood water. It is considered that the naphtha industry suffers from : (a) Want of funds. {h) Lack of geological knowledge, prospecting being without system. (c) Lack of suflicient precautions against flood water. r The introduction of foreign capital would remedy the first defect and alleviate the others. Copper.- The total output in Turkistan for 1910 was 9,230 tons, from 3 mines in Ferghana and one in Samarkand Province. At the end of 1910 two of the Ferghana mines were obliged to cease work owing to lack of funds, and no work was done during the year at 2 mines in Syr Darya from the same cause. Salt. —7,790 tons were obtained in 1910 from salt lakes and springs in Samarkand, Syr Darya, and Ferghana. This amount was less than half the total obtained in the preceding year, but statistics on the subject are not complete and no reliable conclusions can be drawn. E. A. F.

O'Connw, C.I.F., Bis Britannic Majesty s Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 5, tor the week ending 3rd {received 22nd) February 1912. General Summary. State of Frovinces. —Various minor robberies are reported on the roads round about Seistan, but no foreign subjects have hitherto been molested. The Sarhaddi and Seistani Baluchis continue to loot the Kainat, and the Governor seems powerless to stop them. The Police force at Birjand has been abolished by order from Meshed and the city has reverted to the old fashioned system of a “ Darogha ” who makes his own arrangements and is responsible for order being maintained. The “ Beis-i-Adliyya ” has long since been discredited and has left the place after having been convicted of constant extortion. In fact the last remnants of the new Constitutionalism have now dis appeared, and we have reverted in these parts to primitive methods—much to the general relief. State of roads. —As above. Arms Traffic. — Sixty camels belonging to Sardar Khodadad Khan have returned from Mekran bringing amongst other merchandise 100 rifles ; and another caravan of 80 camels all carrying rifles is reported to have crossed into Afghanistan via Trakun. These latter rifles all seem to have been despatched by Khalifa Khair Mohammed who is now living near Bampur. W. P.

Troops in According to information received from the Russian Consulate-General, the garrison of Kuchan consists of 1 battalion (600 men, presumably 18th Turkistan Regiment) with 4 machme-guns, and 1 sotnya of the Turkoman Division. A correspondent states that the 13th Turkistan Rifles have left Merv for Meshed via Sarakhs. There is, so far, no difinite confirmation of this but colour is given to the report by the fact that on the 26th December and 2nd January, 500 men of the 16th Turkistan Regiment, with 4 machine-guns, and 500 of the 15th Turkistan Regiment, with 5 machine-guns, left Kushk for Merv. ,, , , - The Commandant of Kushk also left for Mery, presumably to act for Manor-General Kedko, commanding the troops in Khorasan, as Officer Commanding the 4th Turkistan Rifle Brigade. 23.

Appointments.— QenwdX Pokotile, Assistant-Governor of Turkistan is expected to receive an appointment in Russia shortly, and it is surmised that General Galkin, at present Military Governor of Syr Darya, will succeed him. History. v ^ he ex ' Shah — A correspondent states that, in spite of the prohibition by the Russian ^ authorities, Lesghian recruits for the ex-Shah’s forces have succeeded m leaving Krasnovodsk by country boats. A Persian lady of hioR rank, thought to be a relative of the ex-Shah, arrived at the latter place from visiting Muhammad Ali, to whom she was supposed to have conveyed a lar^-e sum of money from Europe. _ Three officers of the ex-Shah recently passed through Krasnovodsk in disguise. They were reported to be bearers of a letter to the Governor of Tabriz. 27. Earthquake shock.—A sh&amp;rip shock was experienced at Namangan on the 10th January. , Military. 28. Move of troops — A company of the 12th Turkistan Rifle Regiment left Samarkand on the 3rd January towards Katta Kurghan. They were reputed to be destined for Meshed, but were more probably bound for 'Katta Kurghan to replace the 1st Regiment of Semiryechia Cossacks there. 29. Courts Martial.—Coverts Martial have lately been busy with officers of the Turkistan Military District at various stations. Two officers have been dismissed the service and sentenced-to imprisonment, and two others have been sentenced to short terms of confinement in the Quarter Guard. E. A. E.

Among them are Haji Mohamed Jafar and Sheikh Hassan Kashi. The Persian Government have instructed the Governor-General to comply with the Russian demands. 1st February. The Governorship of Sabzawar. —The Adil-u-Dola, brother of the Governor-General, has been appointed to Sabzawar, in place of the Timuri Chief who has apparently “ squeezed ” the district with much success. 2nd February. The New Commander-in-Chief. —The Sirdar Munazzam has been appointed Commander-in-Chief. He is, after the Karguzar, the most capable man in Khorasan and did well when holding the post some years ago. Folitical Summary to Meshed Diary No. 5 of 1912. State of Province—My colleague and the Russian General are apparently upset!, at the complete tranquillity which obtains in Meshed. At any rate whether or no the general is concerned or not, the Russians are organising a movement in favour of the ex-Shah. Its leader is the notorious Yusuf Herati whom the Persian authorities wish to deport and to whom 100 tomans have been given by the Governor-General for his expenses. This individual, who agitated in favour of the ex-Shah from the safety of the Shrine, is now under Russian protection and is demonstrating in a mosque with a flag on which is written ci Let us pray the Russian Consul-General to restore to us our Shah. He is also taking signatures to a petition in the same sense. Each quarter as a similar focus of intrigue and so far as I can learn, my colleague is supporting some if not all. Furthermore a demonstration is being organised against the police and in favour of the Russians patrolling the city. The Persian authori ties are in much perplexity and appealed to me. A sit appeared to be use ess to approach my colleague, who is once more pursuing Ins only sport ot hsbin in troubled waters, I telegraphed the whole matter to the Legation. I have since heard that at the request of the Persian Minister, my coileague has b^n warned to moderate his sinister activity : and I only hope that this may be true. The state of roads. —A large body of Yamut and Goklan Turkoman is raiding and murdering on the section of the mam road between Sabzawar and Shahrud. The Kurds of Bujnurd are also out. Many murders and heavy looting of flocks is reported. The postal sowars report numerous bands of robbers. There is little doubt that tl e state of anarchy is growing worse. P. M.

State of Frovinces. —The Shaukat-ul-Mulk has renewed his overtures to the Chief of one of the “ Khels of the Seistani Brahui Baluchis to migrate with his whole Khel to the Bainat, when the Shaukat promises to pay Tomans 12 per mensem to each able-bodied man. The Baluchis in question are said to be anxious to accept this offer and are only restrained by fear of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. A party of 8 Seistani Baluchis has left for the Kainat for looting pur poses. The Nasir-es-Saltaneh shows no signs of leaving Birjand although he has received orders from the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tehran to leave for Seistan at once. State of roads. —As usual. Arms traffic. —One hundred camels laden with rifles are said to have passed into Afghanistan via Budbar about a fortnight ago. It is probable that this caravan is the same as that reported in my diary No. 5 for the week ending 3rd February as consisting of 80 camels. Eight Afghans (Nasirs) are reported to have left for Mekran to bring rifles. TV. F.

The Governor of Kuchan. —With reference to entry of 13th May 1911, my colleague is now demanding the dismissal of the Governor, whose appointment he arranged. The Shuja-u-Dola is a hopeless degenerate. 15th January. A Robbery Case settled. —The Karguzar has paid up 500 tomans on account of the robbery of Mir Aftab. I have been pressing the Governor-General lately and hope to settle most of my few outstanding cases. 16th January. Russian Papers of Protection. —I hear that my colleague has issued some 700 Taminnamehs or papers of protection to Persians. I have been pressed to issue similar documents : but have declined after referring to the Legation. 17th January. The departure of the Persian Commander-in~ Chief .— The Sirdar Said came to say goodbye. He was in tears as a regiment had taken sanctuary with my colleague and demanded their pay. My colleague had written to the Karguzar to the effect that this matter must be settled before the departure of the Commander-in-Chief. The matter was subsequently settled. This is the last of the five “ Young Persians j’* and he has made a lot of money in various ways. 18th January. Proposed Change of the Trade Route from Herat to the Russian frontier. —The only authorized route from Herat to the Kussian frontier runs N. E. via Karokh, Kala Nau, and Bala Murghab to Panjdeh. The Russian frontier officials have recently proposed that the direct route via Khush Rob at and Chahel Dukhteran to the railway at Kushk should he used. This route is better in every way and has old caravanserais along it. The Herat Agent states that the late Amir ordered the roundabout route to be used in order to discourage trade with Turkistan. The matter has been referred to Kabul for orders. 19th January, Review of Russian Yroojos.—General Redko held a review of the Russian troops in a snowstorm. I was particularly struck by the bad horses of the Semirechia Cossacks. Some of their mounts were like New Forest ponies and were under 14 hands. 20th January. The Case of Khan Aga. —With reference to entry of 14th October and subsequent references, I have arranged this case and the man is free to return home. I am writing a special report as the case is so very typical. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 3 of 1912. State of Province. —A Persian Cossack on duty outside the Russian Bank abused the Constitution and then fired his revolver at the Police and drew his dagger. He was finally shot. At my suggestion, the Police are no longer carrying rifles. This will help to prevent incidents. The people of Meshed are behaving very well, being thoroughly cowed by 1 what has happened at Tabriz. The editor of the Taza Behar and other H disturbers of the peace have left Meshed. The Russian troops are marching round the Shrine in force. This appears to be c&lt; trailing their coats ” as a single shot fired by a fanatic, a lunatic or a drunken man, might start a conflagration. Perhaps this is what they desire. State of the roads.—Both the Herat and Kariz Agents report that the postal sowars are afraid to carry the post alone and propose an increase in their number. I am replying that this is out of the question owing to lack of funds.i S. G. P. 1.-2197 F. D.—29-2-12—27. 2 Numerous robberies are reported by all my agents. Russian troops. —M. Grigorieff has given me a return which corroborates that given in the summary of last week. Major-General Redko called with his staff. None of the party talks English or French : the general was most friendly and interesting to talk to. He° told me that he was stationed at Merv, where the climate was most feverish. He was much pleased to hear that the Meshed climate was so good. At the same time, the Russian disregard of sanitation and of the removal of rubbish, etc., makes for bad health. The general who served in the Japanese war, is said to detest drinking and does not smoke. He is also young and energetic : so we are mo st fortunate. P. M.

He has headed the list with about 5,500 pounds sterling. 23rd January —The Treasurer General.—It appears that M. Mornard is acting as Treasurer General as he has issued orders that all revenue should be paid in through the Customs and that no pensions should be paid without his permission. 24th January. —The departure of the Sadr-ul-Uluma.—The ex-Mutawali- bashi came to say good-bye. He has been most friendly and useful to my colleague and myself and we hope that he may return to Khorasan. 2oth January. —The Governor-General and Prince Dabija.—I hear that my colleague has complained very strongly against the Rukn-u-Dola, who is, of course, very weak. He is especially angry that he cannot get the Governor of Kuchan out of his post. In this matter, as previously reported, my colleague is reaping as he has sown. 26th January.—'Yhv Bussian Military Attache in Seistan.—Captain Svetkoff has passed through Meshed on his way to Russia. He was nearly lost in the snow between Turbat and Meshed. 27th January. —The new Mutawalibashi.—Murtaza Kuli Khan, the new Mutawalibashi called. He comes from Nain and has been a deputy. He strikes me as a sensible man : but is already on had terms with the great Shrine officials. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 4 of 1912. State of Province. —The Russian Troops have now been at Meshed for a fortnight and the people are becoming accustomed to them. General Redko is most careful to maintain discipline, and a heavy fall of snow followed by a severe cold snap has kept the Persians at home. My colleague demanded Ts. 250, the punishment of the policeman and an apology from the Chief of Police on account of the Persian Cossack who was shot. The Persian authorities thought of refusing : but I insisted on their complying. The Agazada, the son of the late Aga Mohamed Kazim, Khorasani, was terrified at hearing of the execution of the Sakat-ul-Islam at Tabriz and applied to me for British protection. This having been refused, he has left Meshed with his brother. It is said that he has made £40,000! The State of the roads. —Numerous robberies are reported and the postal sowars report that they are shot at. The Karguzar told the Attach^ that the Russian Legation had informed the Persian Poreign Minister that only 800 Russian troops were being sent to Khorasan, whereas more than 2,000 have been sent. The explanation appears to be that the Russian Legation recommended the smaller force: but the Governor-General of Turkistan insisted that it was too small: and the Russian Legation was not informed.

Frontier incident. —A patrol of 2 men of the Frontier Guard leaving the post at Maruchak on the Murghab Fiver, and not returning on the same day (9th January), search was made for them and their dead bodies were discovered. It was surmised that they had been killed by a band of Afghan smugglers. 31. Capture of spy. —An Afghan, in possession of incriminating papers proving him to be an Afghan secret agent, was recently captured at Kushk and sent to Tashkent. Strictness at Kushk has redoubled in consequence. 32. Relief for Kirghiz.—N Fed Cross Detachment has left Tashkent for the Mangishlak peninsula to undertake relief measures for the local Kirghiz. 33. Tashkent Fasteur Institute. —46 persons completed treatment during December 1911. 34. The ex-Shah. —Fecruits are still being engaged for the ex-Shah at Krasnovodsk. It is stated that local “ ne’er-do-weels ” and men out of work are beingtaken. 130 persons, including 20 Lesghians, are reported to have left Krasnovodsk for his camp in mid-January. Attempts on the ex-Shah’s life, several of which are said to have been foiled recently, are the theme of common talk at Krasnovodsk. Military. 35. Moves of troops.—The detachments of 500 men each, with machine guns, of the 15th and 16th Turkistan Fifles whose move to Merv from Kushk on the 26th December and 2nd January was reported, returned to the latter place on the 17th January. No explanation has come to light. It would seem possible that an intention to send further reinforcements to Persia has thus been abandoned. 36.

The balance will be embezzled by the Governor-General and the Yizier. 10th January. Russian troops on the Road. —Two British subjects state that they met the Russian troops at Chinaran and that their rifles were seized. They were, however, restored upon their stating that they were British subjects and the Russian officer asked whether English troops had reached Meshed or not. I have heard from more than one source that a British force is expected to march in any day ! 11th January. The Day of the Dersian troops. —The Persian troops are much discontented as they have received no pay for a long time. They have beaten the Accountant-General and are hostile to the Governor-General. 12th January.

The American Missionary .—Dr. Esselstyn is making friends with the Afghan Agent, Abdulla Khan. He is talking of making a journey to the Afghan frontier. I am doing my best to dissuade him : but it seems evident that he has not given up the idea of a mission to the Afghans. State of Drovince. —The news that fidais and also a mulla had been hanged at Tabriz has frightened the turbulent spirits of Meshed. There has been some trouble about the notes of the Bank. It appears that a large number of notes which had not been issued were robbed near Isfahan. These are now being passed into circulation and the Manager has received orders to pay any which may be presented: but to trace where they^ come from. Recently some of these notes were presented and money was paid for them: but details were demanded by the Manager. This started a rumour to the effect that the notes of the Bank were not being paid: and so there was a r ^ s h of people who demanded payment. About 15,000 tomans worth were presented and paid, after which the run ceased. State of the roads. —The Governor of Shahrud was returning to his post, when he was waylaid near Nishapur by a band of robbers under Mohame , nephew of the late Hidayat. Although he had a number of armed P^ en with him, they all ran away including the Governor himself. Two or three were captured and many rifles and some money. Three men were recently murdered near Meshed: and a Russian ( i r j ver was recently shot at outside the town and wounded. At the same time robbers are occasionally captured. The ex-Shah. —The adherents of the ex-Shah to the number of about two hundred entrenched themselves in a caravanserai at Deh Mulla near Damg an. Dolitical Summary to Meshed Diary No. B of 1912.There they were attacked by a mixed force of fidais and Armenians and, after ten hours fighting, surrendered. A second force which was stationed close by, fled to Shahrud and thence to Astrabad. The victors reached Shahrud on 11th January and the line was opened on 12th for a few hours. Mr. Tanner, the inspector, is believed to be at Damghan. Russian troops. —Grigorieff informed me that two battalions, one battery, one sotnia of Cossacks and one of Turkoman would be distributed between Meshed and Kuchan. The Agent at Karez also reports that the force there is being increased. Yesterday a force of 400 infantry reached Meshed and marched through the city. They are being quartered in the barracks of the Persian troops which were practically empty. The Persian authorities wished to refuse to lend the barracks : but I pointed out the folly of any such action, after which they offered the barracks. The Russian General is due to-day or to-morrow.

Luilding and repairs. —'From a credit of 1,446,700 rubles allowed for the extension of Tashkent station, a sum of 265,762 rubles was expended in 1910. The principal works carried out were the relaying of the line, the building of the goods station, stores and quarters and the improve ment of the liquid fuel distribution. Warehouses at a number of stations were completed in the same year and the building of others was commenced. Repairs to the line during the year 1910 totalled 2,458,678 rubles/ an expendi ture less by 113,000 rubles than the sum estimated for. Telegraphs. 9. Wireless stations on the Caspian. —The building of radio-telegraphic stations at Petrovsk and Port Alexandrovsk is completed, and they will shortly be opened for work. History. 10 Relief for sufferers by earthquake. —The Pinancial Committee of the Duma has reported favourably on the grant of a sum of one million rubles for the relief of the sufferers by the earthquake in Semiryechia. As over a year has elapsed since the catastrophe, the principle of bis dat qui cito dat appears to have been somewhat lost sight of. 11. The ex-Shah. —An informant states that at the end of December the Pristav of Krasnovodsk laid an embargo on the departure for Hassan Kuli of about 100 Lesghian and Caucasian recruits for the ex-Shah. The same measures are stated to be in progress on the Persian frontier. Agents of Muhammad Ali Shah are said to have been stationed at Krasnovodsk lately, where they have supplied intending recruits with the necessary steamer fares. In connection with the turning back from Baku, noted last week, of Caucasians proceeding to join the ex-Shah’s force, the “ Transcaspian Review ” somewhat naively remarks : “ the policy of our Government seems to be under going a change in this respect.” The procedure is certainly comparable to closing the stable door after a portion of the stud has been stolen. 12. Moharram.— The Moharram celebrations passed off quietly in the principal towns of Russian Central Asia, special police precautions having been taken to obviate disorders. ¥ Military. 13. Russian reinforcements for Khorasan. —According to information supplied by the Russian Consulate-General earlier in the week, the following is the total of Russian troops en route for Khorasan :— The 18th Turkistan Rifle Regiment (two battalions) with a machine gun. The Kuban Cossack battery. One sotnya of the Turkoman Mounted Division. iOf this force, 1 battalion of the 18th Turkistan Regiment with 4 machine guns and 4 guns of the Cossack battery will proceed to Meshed, the remainder being stationed at Kuchan or at such places as may he considered necessary. In addition to these troops, 4 sotnyas of the 1st Semiryechia Cossack Regiment have since started for Khorasan and will probably be quartered, at any rate provisionally, at Meshed. Major General Redko, Commanding the 4th Turkistan Rifle Brigade, whose arrival at Meshed is expected shortly, will command the force. Half a battalion of the 18th Turkistan Rifles reached Meshed yesterday. 14. Reliefs. —In mid-December, 800 time-expired men left the infantry units at Kushk and were replaced by a like number of recruits. 700 recruits were despatched by route march from Charjui to Kerki at the end of December. 3,000 time-expired men from units in Semiryechia are reported to have passed through Tashkent on their way to their homes. Of 4,000 recruits destined to replace them 3,000 have already been despatched through Tashkent by cart convoy in three parties. 15. Buildings. —Barracks for a regiment are reported to have been completed at Kushk at the South-East angle outside the fort enceinte. Tenders are called for for the building at Kushk of a shed to accommodate 27 2-wheeled carts for the maxim detachment of the 15th Turkistan Rifles, and for the enlargement at Merv of the existing shed of the maxim detach ment of the 14th Turkistan Rifles to accommodate the same number of carts. 16. Retirement. —Major-General Glushanovski, Chief of the Amu Darya Division, retires. 17. Inspections. —The inspection of provision stores at all stations is to be undertaken by locally composed committees. Colonel Sazonof commences his inspection of guns, machine-guns and ammunition in charge of units in Semiryechia, and of machine-guns with troops in Syr Darya. E. A. E.

The Sirdar Said. —The local Commander-in-Chief has leit Meshed and is apparently shooting in the neighbourhood. It is quite possible that he will not return to Meshed as he has made much money and wishes to go home. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 1 of 1912. State of Province. —The Muharram processions passed off safely. The only incident was a scuffle near the Russian Bank. It was believed that an attack was intended and reinforcements were sent for. Meanwhile, however, the Chief of Police had fired two or three shots in the air and a stampede had ensued, with the result that the Cossacks found the place deserted. This was fortunate as they might have fired on the mob. Most fortunately I was able to prevent the news about Tabriz reaching the people ot Meshed until the processions were over. A mixed force of 800 troops crossed the Persian frontier on 4th January and is due at Kuchan to-night. They are coming to Meshed owing to recent events at Tabriz, so far as I can judge. No opposition will be offered : but there is always the fear that some Caucasian or Tabrizi desperadoes may fire on them when passing through the city. It is reported that a force of 800 Yomut Turkoman are raiding towards Kuchan : but they will hardly advance when they hear of the arrival of Russian troops. State of roads. —Naib Husein Kashi has again appeared at Anarak in the Lut. He is said to have 400 men and a gun with him. Other robberies as usual. The Persian post from Askabad has been detained by the Russians, probably to prevent their movements being generally known. The Tehran post and telegraph li ne is still closed. The ex-Shah. —It is reported from Persian sources that Government troops have reached Shahrud and defeated the followers of the ex-Shah. I hear from Astrabad that the ex-Shah has informed the Turkoman that he will not require their services until the spring.[Secret.'] P P 78 19 i 2 Diary of the Military Attach^ Meshed, No. 1, for the^eek ending the 6th January 1912.

Great difficulty was experienced in procuring the necessary camel transport locally, and eventually a portion of the supplies for the men had to be loaded on country boats. 100 recruits were also despatched to Petro Alexandrovsk from Charjui by road, 10 country carts being hired. 7.

The passage of the troops through Bajgiran prevented the taking over of the Ashkabad mail at that place which should have arrived at Meshed two days ago, and accurate information is unobtainable. Infantry and Turkomans are reported, the presence of guns being doubtful. It would appear most probable that the force consists of the battalion of the 18th Turkistan rifles and the detachment of the Turkoman Mounted Division the countermanding of whose departure was reported in last week’s Diary.

News of the fighting at Tabriz has not, as yet, reached the Meshed officials. I hope that it will not be known until after the 10th Muharram (1st January). The “ Taza Behar ” publishes attacks on both the British and Russian Crovernments. My colleague demanded its suppression: but apparently in vain. Personally, I do not think that its influence is great. State of the roads. —Pour men have been murdered near the city. A caravan belonging to a British subject has been robbed on the Sarakhs road. On the other hand, thirteen robbers have been captured near Sarakhs. Three of the band were killed. The Karguzar is really an excellent man, as most of my cases are being settled, in spite of the abnormal situation. ex-Shah. —The followers of the ex-Shah are still at Mian Dasht although they have been invited to Abbasabad. A force of seventy Persian soldiers and sixty Berberis was recently sent to garrison Sabzawar. The latter force deserted on the way, making off with some 600 tomans which had been given to them as an advance of pay. The ex-Shah is living on a small steamer on the Caspian and is said to be weary of the contest and also to be in perpetual fear of assassination. Xc S. G, P. I.—1980 F. D.—2-1-12—28. P. M.

The Tehran Post. - The Tehran route is now closed and as the post is being sent via Askabad, I am keeping all confidential corre spondence for Tehran. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 51 of 1911. State of Province. —The mourning in connexion with the decease of the leading Najaf Mujtahid has diverted the minds of the populace from the political situation. A sotnia of Cossacks with a Machine gun detachment crossed the Persian frontier a week ago and will reach Meshed in a day or two. The fact that negotiations are still proceeding at Tehran has been telegraphed to the Karguzar with the information that, owing to Russian reports that Mesne , Kuchan and the Akhal oasis had armed against Russia, troops would be sent to Meshed: but would be withdrawn when matters had been settled. I thin ia the dangerous time is past: but that it was touch and go at one time. e Russians behaved in a panic-stricken manner which was calculated to encourage the bad characters and any patriots there may happen to be. State of roads. —Sub-Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahman was travelling with the post to Meshed: but as it was delayed, he pushed on with only a charvadar and was robbed by four armed men of about 90 tomans. As he was being stripped, a large caravan of seventy pilgrims came up and they too were robbed to the extent of 2,000 tomans. He escaped with only the loss of his money and reports that many were the prayers for Russia to take ovei t country and stop this state of affairs. The ex-Shah. —The Askabad Agent of the Military Attache reported that a large number of Government rifles had been sent from the Arsenal for the use of the ex-Shah. He also reported that two agents of the ex-Shah were recruiting in Askabad. This latter piece of information is confirme by my own agents. In the Turkoman country I hear that men are being paid zb tomans per mounted man and half that sum for a foot man. It is stated tha the ex-Shah has now collected a force of 2,000 men. &amp; \ V - D2 The followers of the ex-Shah are moving east and have now reached Miandasht. They will reach Abbasabad in a day or two. They will then be close to Sabzawar. f J he refugee Governor of Shahrud has reached Meshed. It appears that the villagers rose on him because in trying to collect revenue, his sowars killed more than fifty men, women and children. This brought back the followers of the ex-Shah. With him have come twenty-five mujahids who are penniless. This advance of the ex-Shah may lead to much trouble as my colleague is probably in communication with him through certain of his party at Meshed. I P. M.

Arys-Vyerni project. —Thz intention, mentioned by a correspondent, to begin construction work in December has been frustrated by severe weather, and it is unlikely that a definite commencement will be made till the spring. Telegraphs: Communication with Cheleken.—The papers state that Cheleken has been brought into telegraphic communication with Baku, and that a telegraph office has been opened on the island. In the absence of details it would seem probable that the installation must be a wireless one. Waterways : Postal communication on the Caspian. —An article in the “ Astrakhanski Distok” noting the fact that the present Government contract for mails with the Kavkaz Merkuri Company expires in 1913, and discussing the probability or otherwise of the continuance of the subsidy to that company, throws interesting light on the flotilla owned by the company. Of 28 steamers, 2 only are under ten years old, the age of the remainder ranging from 15 to 52 years. Of the 11 steamers specially employed in inter port communication, the Grand Duke Constantine, Prince Bariatinski, and Tamara were constructed 51 years ago ; the Turkoman 50 years ago; the Grand Duke Michael and Prince Gorchakoff til years ago; and the Alexander Jandre and Tsarevich Nikolai 32 years ago. The Tamara is the sole means of maintaining communication between Eort Alexandrovsk and Astrachan, and the Turkoman is frequently put on the Baku-Krasnovodsk run where its employment is a constant subject of complaint. The main postal runs are:— Astrachan-Fort Alexandrovsk . . . Weekly. In addition steamers run from Baku to the southern ports and from Astrachan to Briansk. It is contended that not only should postal communication be more frequent, but that the scope of the runs should be considerably extended. GENERAL SUMMARY. Administration. Communications.

The ex-Shah. —A Trans-Caspian correspondent reports the presence at Ashkabad of two agents of Muhammad Ali Shah who have secured a consider able number of recruits for him—apparently Caucasians and Persians—by the payment of 100 roubles apiece. A correspondent who recently visited ^ Chikishliyar and Hassan Kuli states that the ex-Shah is busily engaged at Khoja Nafas in collecting recruits and supplies, and that it was commonly | stated that ammunition was being secretly supplied to the Turkomans by I Russians. Certain of the Hassan Kuli Turkomans took part in the Bandar Gaz fight whence they returned ladan with loot. They are, in consequence, staunch supporters of the ex-Shah. Despatch of arms. —The despatch of several large consignments of rifles according to information received about 13,000 in number—from Ashkabad to Krasnovodsk is circumstantially reported. These are, not unnaturally, popularly reputed to be destined for the ex-Shah. On any hypothesis the despatch of so large a number is difficult of explanation. Remoured construction of Oxus bridge.—A. rumour is current that a bridge is to be built next year across the Oxus at Kerki. Colour is given to the story by the fact that engineers are busy surveying a site on the bank and measuring depths close to the shore. Possibly the construction of a landing stage is in contemplation ; at the same time a growing commercial centre like Kerki would derive but little benefit from the projected railway if a ferry is to remain the only means of reaching it. The collection of iron bridging material at Charjui was mentioned earlier in the year though no information as to its final disposition has come to hand. Frontier Guard captures.—'DuFmg September, the 30th and 31st Brigades of i rentier Guards detained 48 smugglers and 55 persons secretly crossing the frontier. The value of contraband goods seized amounted to 1,400 roubles. Official misdemeanours. —A former Pristav of Merv has been condemned to 3 year s imprisonment for extortion whilst in office, being acquitted on other even more serious counts. Closing of printing press. The press at which the Tashkent paper RussU Turkistan was printed has been closed by the authorities.

Communications. Bailway s. Kokand-Namangan branch. —General Gippius, Militarj Goyernor, recently passed along this line from Kokand to the Syr Darya bridge. He reports that, in spite of the rails haying been laid temporarily without ballast, the train passed evenly and without obstruction, at low speed. Special rails for the bridge (wooden) which was built in October have been reported as passing along the Central Asian line from Krasnovodsk. Waterways. Amu Darya navigation. —Steamer navigation in the northern reaches of the Amu Darya has ceased in consequence of the severe weather, communication with Khiva being maintained with difficulty by pack camel. A steamer leaving Charjui up-stream on the 13th December was obliged to abandon a barge and to return to lighten up, owing to low water. It is probable, therefore, that steamer communication will shortly be at an end for the winter. Telegraphs. Lowering of rates. —The final lowering of rates of telegraphic communication between European Russia and her Central Asian possessions comes into force on the 1st January 1912, when 5 kopeks per word will be charged. History. The ex-Shah. —The Chikishliyar correspondent of the Trans-Caspian Review states that two bands of Caucasian recruits for the Shah arrived by steamer and proceeded to Khoja Nafas by sailing-boat. These adventurers, who numbered 380, were armed with daggers only and were to receive rifles on arrival. In the issue of the 24th December of this paper, the correspondent de scribes a recent visit to Khoja Nafas in the hopes of learning something o the ex-Shah’s intentions. Although the wildest rumours abounded, no reliabl' information was available. He describes the place as converted into an armed camp, the ex-Shah, who lives in continual fear of assassination, being surrounded by a string of Caucasian piquets. 600 Caucasians have already arrived and it is intended to increase the number up to 1,000: The only persons having free access to him are “ Prince ’* Amiraji, the head of the Caucasian band and the ex-Pristav of Krasnovodsk Borof * who performs func tions analogous to those of a Chief of Police with the Shah. The ex-Shah is credited with the intention of dispensing altogether with the assistance of the Turkomans in future and of relying entirely on the Caucasians, a report which has aroused considerable discontent among the Turkomans. 15,000 rifles, with a large quantity of cartridges, are stated to have reached Meshed-i-Sar hy steamer for the ex-Shah. He is further credited with the intention of leaving Khoja * Note.— To the best of my recollection this indi vidual was one of the officials tried and dismissed in consequence of the revelations of Count Palen’s Commission. E. A. F. Redl.2 Nafas for Enzeli when the formation of his Caucasian body-guard is completed, in order to be in touch with the Russian troops with whom he hopes to pene trate to Tehran. Rumoured Turkoman unrest.—The rumour prevails at Herat that the Turkomans of the Panjdeh district have been discovered by the Russian authori ties in the act of intriguing with frontier Afghans with the object of creating a rising or disturbance. A report from Kushk that the elders of the neighbouring Turkomans had been summoned to that place and that their sections had been disarmed gives some colour to the report. Bokhara. —The Amir left Yalta for Bokhara on the 21st December. Caspian gale. —A severe storm has been raging on the Caspian, in conse quence of which the Russian mails failed to reach Ashkabad on the 22nd December. Taskend Pasteur Institute. —51 persons completed treatment during November. Two deaths occurred. Military. Reliefs. —Between loth and 20th December, 525 recruits arrived at Ashkabad, and between the 6th and 13th December, 850 recruits, the majority for Upper Oxus posts (probably Kerki), reached Charjui. During the same period 450 time-expired men passed the latter place by rail from East to West, and 450 time-expired men passed through from Upper Oxus garrisons. A further 3,500 recruits are reported to have passed through Tashkend from Orenburg and 1,300 in addition to have joined the Tashkend garrison. A pro portion of these are probably intended for Semiryechia garrisons. An informant states that 18,( 00 men of the Turkistan Military District in all will go to the reserve this year, and that 21,000 recruits will join the colours, the intention of keeping the 1st and 2nd Turkistan Army Corps up to strength being the explanation of the excess of recruits over time-expired men. Troops for Khorasan. —A sotnya of Kavhaz Cossacks with an infantry machine gun detachment of 20 men with 4 Maxims reached Meshed from Ashkabad on the 24th December. The departure of the battalion of the 18th Turkistan Rille Regiment from Ashkabad for Meshed has-been countermanded till further notice. Presumably also that of the Rifle Regiment for Kuchan from Merv. A correspondent states that 100 men of the Turkoman Mounted Division actually left Koshi for Persian territory, but is at present unable to say whether they were directed to return to their lines or not. partie ® C0me and is di fficult to be certain of the exact strength of the Russian detachment at Meshed, but from careful enquiries the total appears to be :— Officers • • . .

O'Connor, C.I.E., Mis Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. l,for the week ending 6th {received 22nd) January 1912. General Summary. State of Provinces .—After consultation with my Russian colleague I decided to call on the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to communicate to him the news received in Reuter’s telegrams regarding the recent events in Tabriz, etc., as it appeared to us better that he should be in possession of authentic information rather than at the mercy of any chance bazaar rumours. Accordingly I saw him on 2nd January and told him of the serious nature of the situation both in the North and at Shiraz, and begged him to keep the news to himself for the present hut to be prepared to take steps to prevent disorders should such at any time appear imminent. He assured me that he would do everything in his power to maintain order in Seistan, and said that he considered any disturb ances improbable. I instructed Mr. Eorkgen to make similar representations to the Governor of Birjand, and he received a similar reply. I consider any disturbances in Seistan most improbable, but it is not impossible that some anti-Russian demonstrations may take place at Birjand when the news of the fighting at Tabriz and Resht becomes public property. But the Shaukat-ul-Mulk will, I think, in his own interests, do his best to prevent anything of the kind. My Russian colleague, however, is somewhat nervous (especially about Birjand) and I have done my best to reassure him and to meet his wishes.

Durbar Day. —The durbar was celebrated in beautifal weather, and although there is certainly a very strong feeling against British policy many warm congratulations were received. The durbar was crowded and after a few remarks by me on the significance of the great assembly at Delhi, the Boyal Proclamation was read in Eno-lish and Persian. The bestowal of titles by His Excellency the Viceroy was then announced and a poem concluded the formal proceedings. The children were drawn up on the lawn and, after a second ode had been recited, boxes of chocolate with the portrait of Their Majesties were distri buted. In the evening the Consulate was illuminated and forty leading Indians were entertained to dinner, as also were the sowars, the servants, etc. There vas a dinner party at the main building. The night was still and the illuminations were much admired. 13th December. — Ali Madad, Ismaili, has been robbed bv the Shuja-u-Lashkar, a military officer. He states that the Governor o*f Nishapur is helping him : but that the orders of the Meshed Commander-in- Chief are needed to make his subordinate disgorge. This I hope to arrange. 14th December. The New Director of Telegraphs. —The Mubashir-ul- Mulk, the new director, has arrived. He was appointed some three years ago : but was hunted out by revolutionaries and fled. loth December. The Persian Press. —The No Bahar had ceased to appear : but we have a new paper termed Taza Bahar. It has started under the same management and contains strong attacks on the Mussians. 16th December. Busso-Jfghan Amenities. —T\\&amp; Prisfav of Sheikh Juneid (Kushk) accompanied by a police officer recently visited Yar Mohamed Bessaldar, at Chehel Dukhteran. Many subjects were discussed, among them the question of surrendering deserters and the prevention of frontier raids. Among other things, the Pristav offered to sell rifles and revolvers at a cheap rate to the Afghans. This probably means that Government property will be stolen. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 50 of 1911. State of Province. —It is now almost a fortnight since any authentic news reached Meshed, from which I conclude that nothing has been settled at Tehran. Meanwhile the Bussian colony is in a state of panic. They sleep in their clothes with their jewelry sewn up in the lining. 'Jhey have transferred their funds and also their dispensary to their garden outside the city, where the clerks keep sentry day and night. They are especially afraid of their guard of Persian Cossacks, and until my colleague sent them ten Bussian Cossacks, their state was one of wild alarm. Personally I do not consider that the situation was such as to justify this panic which extended to the Bussian official colony. At the same time our Bank Manager tells me that for the first time some of the Meshed brokers ceased to come to the Bank and, undoubtedly, there is a very strong hatred of the Bussians and a strong feeling against us for not protecting Persia. The present state of affairs is that every one has got his arms ready : but that news of the events which are taking place at Tehran will be awaited before taking any action. i n ltd ioio JLU i i-D i 'O i L.The Attache is in the closest touch with every one of any importance and warns them that their own future is at stake. This is the best way of appeal ing to a Persian. State of roads .—A large caravan with silk, etc., has been robbed between Turbat and Meshed. Goods to the value of 20,000 tomans were stolen and the only road guard was killed. Other robberies as usual. The-ex-Shah .—The Muntasir-u-Dola and a certain Husein Ali with a force of mujahids or Volunteers attacked the Intesar-u-Saltana, who was entrenched at Damghan in a caravanserai. The latter, who is a brother of the ex-Shah’s chief eunuch, beat off the attack, killed 80 mujahids and captured two guns. The ex-Shah’s forces have cut the line to the east of Meiomei, a village some thirty miles to the east of Shahrud. P. M. SYKES, Major, His Majesty's Consul-General. I 17 H i II ( s. G, P. 1.— 1801 F.

Each consists of a Superintendent with an Assistant, several officials (chvnovniks) of the 14th class, styled police superintendents, and some policemen. The discovery of criminal offences is now expressly stated to be the object of the department, although it is probable that political offences will in reality form the chief preoccupation of the new establishments. (Ref Diary 30.) v ‘ Finance. Agricultural loan offices.—The institution of these offices, designed to obviate the borrowing at usurious rates by agriculturalists, is not proceeding as well as was expected. Out of a proposed total of 650 for the whole of Turkistan, the authorities have succeeded in opening 64 only. Education.~T\\Q deficiency of educational facilities for all classes in Turkistan and Trans-Caspia is still acutely felt, the number of children of the middle classes still being in excess of the vacancies at the schools. The opening of a second girls’ school (gymnasia) at Tashkent next year will to some extent mitigate the evil at that town. Relief season. —The passage of time-expired men to their homes is still reported. 700 recruits have arrived at Kushk.

The Commander-in-Chief on the Sirdar Arshad .—The was carried away to have his wound tended. An unworthy brother thereupon mounted the Sirdar’s horse and fled. This was the final cause of the flight of the Turkoman. 5th December. Fresh Troops at Gunbad-i-Kabus .—The Chief of Bujnurd telegraphs that fresh Russian troops have reached Gunbad-i-Kabus. 6th December. The First Afghan Newspaper .—The Afghan Agent has sent me the first copy of the Siraj-ul-Akbar, which is printed at the Govern ment press at Kabul. The printing and matter appear to be good. The language is Afghan Persian. 7th December. The Vizier .—The Vizier, who has been ordered not to pay any pensions, is inciting pensioners to demonstrate. He has bought up a lot of pension bills at 60 per cent, discount and hopes to make much money. 8th December. Mr. Fsselstyn. —Mr. Esselstyn has reached Meshed safely. He tells me that he will be very careful not to excite the opposition of the Persians or of Prince Dabija. At the same time, as I imagined, the State of Province .—Upon news reaching Meshed that a Russian ultimatum had been delivered and that the capital was in a bellicose mood, X was afraid that the situation would get out of hand. The Attache warned the leading mujtahid and other notables that they must calm public opinion or else they would themselves finally suffer : and, as a result of this, the Agazada did not at first appear to preside at the great meeting which was held at the mosque. The people, after waiting for a long time, persuaded the Agazada to preside and when he came the ultimatum or the Tehran version of it was read and everyone wept. Then came a procession of schoolboys, who exclaimed that they bore their heads on their palms as a sacrifice to their country and what were the men going to do ? Telegrams were also read from Tabriz, Ispahan and Kerman to the effect that everyone should arm and die for his country. There were a few wild proposals to appeal to the Emperor of Germany and to boycott Russian and British goods : but, upon the whole, the meeting passed off quietly. The following day, however, some of the many bad characters began to persuade people to arm and for a time I anticipated trouble : but there was little response. My colleague did not apparently wish to co-operate with me: but M. Grigorieff, who had heard that I had visited him, pointed out that he must work in with me. He finally consulted me and said, that he was sending for a second sotnia of Cossacks and proposed to warn 400 infantry to be prepared to march at a day’s notice. I concurred in these proposals, and at his reques telegraphed the fact to Tehran. To resume, there was a second meeting on 8 th November when it was decided to elect ten of the leading notables who should discuss the situation daily. This has been done and money is also being cofiected. I hope that no outbreak may occur: at the same time, we are entirely without news from Tehran, and if this be unfavourable when received, the situation will again become serious. State of Hoads .—A gang of eight robbers has been captured in the Nishapur district. — Commander-in-Chief told me that when the Sirdar Arshad was wounded, he mission has been fired with the idea of attacking Islam in one of its holy cities. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 49 of 1911.The Askabad post was held up: but only the passengers were robbed. The postal sowars report many robberies and a few murders. So far they have been respected by the brigands. The ex-Shah .—The forces of the ex-Shah are still at Shahrud. They allowed the line to work on the 4th November : but now decline to allow it to be joined through. They also stop the posts and search for official letters. My colleague, who is a perfervid partisan of the ex-Shah, declares that he will come to Meshed where he will be welcomed. In this connexion the party of the ex-Shah at Meshed has received a reply to the effect that he will shortly come to Meshed : but is waiting for two or three things. The Bujnurd Chief is alarmed and has been sent a mountain gun. P. M. SYKES, Major, Sis Majesty's Consul-General' S. G. P. I.—171.5 P.

KoJcand-Namangan branch. —Granted favourable weather, this branch will probably be ready for through traffic in April next year. The necessary rolling-stock has been received. Roads. Electric tramway proj ect .—X egotiations have been entered into with the Belgian company laying the electric tramway line at Tashkent for the con struction of a similar tram-line at Kokand. Telegraphs .—A sum of 101,100 roubles has been included in the estimate for the Tashkent Railway for the extension of the telegraph system along the line. History. Movements of Saiyid Ahmad Beg, Jamshedi .—According to reports received, Saiyid Ahmad Beg spent some time at Kashk, leaving that place for Kerki or Termez in mid-November. He is reputed to have been making himself useful to the Russian authorities by producing secret agents for employment in Afghanistan. Severe weather.—Snow fell in Ferghana early in November, the second fall on the 8 th of the month attaining a depth of 1 foot. Over half the young crops in the Projevalsk district of Semiryechia have been mined by severe frost. Much damage has been caused to apiculture, of which industry this district is the centre in Turkistan, by the cold. Earthquake Frequent earthquake shocks of varying continue to cause anxiety in Semiryechia. severity Cheleken water-supply.—A condenser, initiated by Isa Beg Gadiinski the Cheleken WIler ° f naphtha borin S s on the island &gt; is now in working 3 order on Attempted train-wrecking.—keepers placed across the rails near Bra cm an^’cidcnt A ‘ ^ ^ n0tiCed ty thC driver ° f a train in to prevent Imprisonment of newspaper editor. —The editor of the Tashkent remm- undergoing one month’s imprisonment in default of P nav- thePress* regulations. t0 ^ he WaS SenteUCed for 00 “travention of T„ in Seminjechia.-The Chief Inspector of Schools for urkistan states that he has been empowered to give immediate eflWt in following important educational measures ediate ettect to the (a) the institution of a “ gymnasia ” at Pishpek ^ “ b ° yS ’ Md S irk ’ (c) the institution of a teachers’ college of 100 candidates. (rf) the foundation of a technical school for 100 pupils. Both of the last-named establishments will be built at Vyerni. Military.s strength, the number of time-expired soldiers who have left the country being far m excess of the recruits who have arrived. In addition to those noted last week the following numbers have gone to the reserve : — Kushk 1 , 100 , Charjui 100, Kerki 230, Termez 4,50, Tashkent 1,400. Against this the arrival of an insignificant number of recruits is noted, and none at all, according to latest information received, had reached Samarkand, Tashkent, or Kushk. Troops for Persia. According to the Trans-Caspian Review, 3 sotnyas of Cossacks, presumably of the Taman Regiment, were to leave Ashkahad for Gumesh Tapa. No definite intelligence of their departure, however, has been received. In view of the political situation the strengthening of the Meshed garrison and the occupation of Kuchan will in all probability shortly occur. Resoubces. Uevenue from minerals in Turkistan .—During the first 10 months of the current year, the Crown received a sum of 28,000 roubles on account of mining royalties. The following figures shew the comparative importance of the various branches :— Roubles.

There have of course been rumours regarding what has been taking place at Tehran and in the North, hut with the exception of the Karguzar and one or two “ Young Persian” officials no one here has concerned himself very seriously with the matter. All the poor Seistani wants in fact is to be let alone to cultivate his fields in peace and to be robbed as little as possible by his superiors. Neither monarchial nor constitutional questions interest him in the smallest degree. The Karguzar would make trouble if he could, but as the principal mullahs here are sensible men, and well enough disposed towards us (besides keeping a careful eye upon their own interests) he cannot do very much harm. Whilst as for the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, so long as he makes a good tffing out of brigandage and such minor oppressions as he can practise locally, he is quite indifferent to any outside considerations. Brigandage is still rife. The Sarhaddis keep despatching a series of large and small parties to loot in the Kainat (although it is difficult to imagine that there can be much left worth the taking), and I have just heard that they have again looted Deh Salm. The Nasir-es-Saltaneh remains tranquilly at Biriand. His presence there and his efforts to reorganise the Kainat troops have had no effect whatever upon the raiders, and he shows no signs of coming to Seistan. , State of Hoads. —There has been no interference with foreign goods or travellers. There is still water in the Hamun between heie and Lab-i-Bar ng and goods have to cross on tutins. At Lutak I have had a nice little rest-house built fostensibly in the name of a Persian subject of course), which is useful for trav“ It only remains now to dig a good well between Lutak and Girdi to make the road from Seistan to Koh-Malik-Siah quite practicable for travellers or, if necessary, small bodies of troops.

Trince Dabija and the Police. —I am informed that a Russian subject was taken to task for abusing the Persian Government by a Police Commissary. My colleague has taken up the matter and threatens to apply for the dismissal of the Chief of Police unless the Commissary be punished. The Karguzar feels this and similar acts of injustice very keenly : but I advise him to submit to the inevitable. 29th November. A New Committee. —The Agazada and the Muavin-u- Tujjar have founded a new Majlis termed the Majlis-i-Islam to oppose the democrats. 30th November. Proposed Meshed-Seistan Chaussee. —Haji Abdul Husein Zavvar, one of the leading Tabriz merchants, said that there was an idea of starting a company for making a road to Seistan, and that my advice was desired. I pointed out that such an undertaking could not possibly pay. 1st December. The Persians of Calcutta. —The Persians of Calcutta have telegraphed to the Meshed Assembly to the effect that all Persians should be united in face of the common danger. This is the very last thing that Persians are capable of. Political Summary to Meshed Diary No. 48 of 1911. State of Province. —We are again cut off from Tehran which fact makes for anarchy. At Sabzawar, the ex-Governor-General (the Sahib Ikhtiar) and the refugees from Shahrud have taken 5,000 tomans of the revenue in order to defend the town against invasion. At Meshed the heads of departments supported by the Agazada who now joins their deliberations have demanded 50,000 tomans from the Nejd-u- Sultana in order to pay a new force of 1,500 sowars. The Vizier at first declined to pay ; but the Agazada threatened to forbid the payment of revenue, whereupon he yielded. Another cause of trouble is that the recipients of allowances have threatened strong action unless they are paid ; so the Nejd-u-Saltana has telegraphed to Mr. Shuster that he awill resign unless he be allowed to pay them. State of roads. — The robberies and murders have become so numerous that I cannot detail them. Every road has one or more gangs working on it. The ex-Shah.— Shahrud is occupied by Astrabadis and Mazanderanis under Mohamed Kuli Khan, who is the deputy of the Salar Mukarram. The latter was Governor of Shahrud during the summer. Their force is said to have been increased to 600. The Chief of Bujnurd reports that the Turkoman are going to have a great meeting on the Id-i-Zoha (2nd December) and will then decide whether to march on Shahrud in force or on Bujnurd. In the latter case we may expect much trouble this winter. P. M. SYKES) Major, Bis Britannic Majesty's Consul-General. r. G. P. I —1650 F.

New Chief . — Trans-Gasman Review denies the rumoured appointment of Engineer Lissinski. The new Chief of the Line is Engineer Kholmogorof from the Perm Line whose arrival at Ashkabad is expected early m December. Railway Rroject. The Turkistan News states that investigations ^° r .' e WlU contm 1 ue throughout the winter and that it has definitely been decided to commence the actual construction next spring. Engineers are of opinion that the line may be completed in 2 years. New Railway Hospital. Owing to the inconvenience and expense occasioned by the building at Tashkent, rented by the Tashkent line as a hospital, it has been decided to build a Kailway Hospital at Tashkent next year to accom modate 50 patients, half from the Tashkent and half from the Central Asian Lines. The cost of the building is estimated at 120,000 roubles. Tashkent station—T \\q frequency of accidents to passengers crossing the line at this station has caused the immediate construction of an overhead'foot bridge for passengers to be decided on. History. Postal parcels transit to Persia.—An enquiry is being held at the Ministry for Commerce and Industry, presided over by the Under Secretary of State of the Department, into the whole question of postal parcels passin 0 * through Eussia for Persia. 91,856 parcels of a total value of 9 million roubles passed during the course of last year, nearly all from countries other than Eussia. No decision has yet been arrived at, but, from the fact that the Com mittee of Enquiry are said to be ascertaining how far Eussia is bound by the Washington Postal Convention, it would seem that the possibility of restricting this traffic to the benefit of the Eussian market is in contemplation. Russian Press on their diplomatic dissensions at Tehran. —Eussian papers are much exercised at the strained relations between their diplomatic represent atives and a rumour is abroad that M. Poklevski-Kozel, the Eussian Minister, is to be appointed to Lisbon, the change being partly motived by the report on his conduct made by the Consul-General, Pokhitonof, according to which the Minister had become a mere echo of the British representative. The Novoye Vremya glosses over the whole situation, stating that although the Consul-General was technically wrong in acting without reference to his superior, his desire for the interests of his country must be his justification. The Minister also undoubtedly has the interests of Eussia at heart and all dis agreements between the two officials have now happily passed. Petersburg papers also state that M. Klemm, the Director of the Asiatic Department, was opposed to the Eussian ultimatum to Persia, and that advantage was taken of his absence for its presentation. An interesting item of information gleaned from the Eussian Press is that by agreement with Eussia, England will introduce 4,000 “ Bengal Eifles”— equal to the number of Eussian troops—into Persia. Tashkent Pasteur Institute. —54 persons completed treatment during October. !Ethnography. Distressed peasantry. —Numbers of famine-stricken Sujiks continue to arrive at Tashkent from Russia in search of work. Distress prevails among the Kirghiz of the Mangishlak peninsular in consequence of the loss of their live-stock. Measures taken for their relief during the winter promise to be insufficient and additional assistance is contemplated. Primary education. —Eour mixed schools (Russian and native) are to be opened in the Tashkent District this year, in addition to those already existing. Military. Recruiting season. —A daily influx of recruits through Krasnovodsk in small batches is reported. They are either brought or met at Krasnovodsk by N. C. O.’s of the regiments for which they are destined. A number of the recruits hail from the Lublin Government. Time-expired men are apparently being released punctually. 750 have left Ashkabad, 350 Kerki, and 700 Samarkand. The Turkistan News reports that time-expired men of the 2nd Turkistan Rifle Regiment have left Tashkent and that another 500 men of this regiment, due for discharge, are shortly expected from Prjevalsk. Remounts. —A number of remounts are stated to have been purchased this year in the Hissar Begship of Bokhara. Hitherto the horses of this district, though considered by experts to be of a suitable stamp for military purposes, have been little exported owing to the distance to be traversed. This year, however, the general high prices prevailing for horses have caused the experiment to be tried. Resources. Export of cotton from Russian Central Asia. —Erom statistics furnished by the Central Asian Kailway, a total of 78,400 tons of cotton was exported from Russian Central Asia between the 1 st September 1910 and the 1 st September 1911. More than half of this quantity was carried by the Central Asian Line through Krasnovodsk. Russian sugar export to Persia and Afghanistan. —Considerable increase is shewn in the quantity of sugar exported to Persia this year on the previous year. During the year 1909-10, 56,627 tons were exported as against 77 } ld5 tons in 1910-11. The latter figure represents 25 per cent, of Russia’s total export of sugar to foreign countries and Finland. 1,759 tons were exported to Afghanistan in 1910-11, more than double the quantity for the preceding year. Russian trade with Khorasan. —Complaints are made by Russian exporters of the falling-off of trade with Khorasan during the last year in spite of the fact that the province is less disturbed than other parts of Persia.

General Summary. State of Provinces. —There is talk of a boycott of Russian and British goods here and at Birjand, but hitherto no decisive action has been taken in the matter either by the leading mullahs or by the local officials. State of Hoads. —As last week. Telegraph Line. —The line between Meshed and Tehran has been inter' rupted almost continually for nearly a month—a state of affairs which bring 8 strongly home to us here the inconveniences caused by the want of a line con necting us with Kuh-i- M alik-Siah and so with the Indo-European and Indian telegraph systems. This question, I am aware, has long been outstanding, but as no advance towards a solution seems to have been made for some years past I have ventured again to invite consideration to it. W. E.

He has written to his tribesmen to send back all their loot or else pay the money. The E,ukn-u-Dola was very jealous about the “ profit ” of the Shaukat-u-Dola. 22nd November — Time-expired Cossacks. —Some ninety Cossacks includ ing the gun detachment and two Machine guns left Meshed for Russia on 17th November. 23rd November—Said Ahmad Beg Jamshidi. —The Military Attach^ recently reported that the Jamshidi Chief was back at Kushk. The 'Herat Agent after making enquiries, denies this. 24th November—The Governorship of Nishapur. —The two Legations have agreed to allow Nishapur to be again separated from Khorasan. 25th November — Mr. Nsselstyn.—T\\Q American Missionary has reached Sabzawar in safety. He is due to reach Meshed next week. The Rukn-u- Dola tells me that he had heard nothing about his coming to Meshed until I informed him. Bolitical Summary to Meshed Diary No. 47 of 1911. State of Province. —The Rukn-u-Dola tells me that he can do nothing. This was only to he expected. The Commander-in-Chief talks of a shooting trip : but apparently intends to leave Meshed suddenly. The elections are causing some excitement. State of roads. —The Geisur gang has been reformed ■ under a Seiid. The postal sowars report robberies on the Herat road. Robberies are reported from the Turbat road and also close to Meshed. An Amnia sowar has been shot on the Sarakhs road. The Tehran road is held by a nephew of the late Rashid-u-Sultan. This worthy operates near Damghan. He will now join the forces of the ex-Shah, I expect. The ex-Shah.—On 22nd November, it was reported from Shahrud that a force of men was close to the town. On 23rd November to the number of 100 they took possession of it for the ex-Shah. The Governor and 70 men ^ ec . also the Chief Telegraph clerk, who left his junior to act for him. Curiously enough, the line which had been interrupted for a week, was restored, and messages were allowed to pass. The ex-Shah has written a letter to the Chief of Bujnurd to the effect that when he reascends the throne he will punish him for seizing Hidayat and for sending him to be executed at Meshed. This shows how well and quick y informed the ex-Shah must be as Hidayat was only shot on 3rd November. The Chief of Bujnurd has asked for two guns and other munitions. The general opinion is that if the ex-Shah plays a waiting game, he will defeat the Government which has no funds for a distant expedition. R. M.

Treatment of Jews. —According to the Trans-Caspian Review, considerable severity is being shewn to Jews in Trans-Caspia at the present time, the slightest infraction of the regulations governing their residence in the country being punished with deportation. Strict enforcement of Arms Act.— new regulations regarding the possession of fire-arms are being enforced with such strictness that all sportsmen taking the train at Tashkent are required by the police on the spot to produce their permission to carry guns. Stoi'm on the Amu Darya. —A violent storm which raged for some days on the Amu Darya in mid-October is stated to have disintegrated for the time being the carrying trade by local boats. Loss of life due to it is reported. New Frontier Guard Post. —A new post for the Frontier Guard is in course of construction at Khatar, near Kizil Ayak on the Amu Darya. Military. Movements of troops. —Two hundred Cossacks, presumably belonging to the Taman Regiment, are reported to have left Ashkabad on the 13th November for Enzeli. Commencement of recruiting season. —The arrival of recruits and the exodus of time-expired men through Krasnovodsk has begun. , '. A C- * Vj- &amp; ,The TurJcistan News states that time-expired men of the Tashkent garrison will leave for their homes commencing from the 1 st of Kussian November. An unusual feature is the arrival in Trans-Caspia for Samarkand of 100 The procedure may possibly be due to the desire to transfer men affected by revolutionary propaganda from their former surroundings. Reservist training .—The training of reservists at Ashkabad and Charjui has ended, and the men have left for their homes. Meshed reliefs .—The Taman Cossack Sotnya and infantry machine-gun detachment relieved by the troops noted last week have left Meshed for Ashkabad.

Statyf Provinces.—Vae crisis Tehran has reflected itself only faintly here and at Birjand. Telegrams for the Democrats and others have been received nrgmg measures of retaliation against Russia, but they have not been published, and with the exception of the Karguzar it is not likely that anyone here wil! take them very seriously. Both the Shaukat-ul-Mulk am/the Hashmat-ul-MuJk are behaving very well in the matter, and have assured my Russian colleague that they will not permit any anti-foreign demonstrations At Birjand, it is true, meetings have been held at the Mosque and a boycott of Russian goods has been decided upon; but with this single exception there is no sign of unrest in these parts.

It is not known what he wanted to see them about.[Confidential.] Meshed Consular Diary No. 46 for the week ending 18th November [received 20th December) 1911. 12th November. Russian Reliefs. —Sixty-eight Cossacks and 24 men with two Machine guns reached Meshed. They are apparently meant to relieve the present sotnia : hut both bodies will possibly be kept during the j present crisis. / 13th November. A Cossack Officer. —The Officer in charge of the Cossack garrison is being tried at Askabad for embezzlement. The general opinion is that had he taken up to 4,000 roubles, there would have been nothing said : but he went too far. A story is told of a second Cossack officer, who said that it was mere affectation of the English to speak their own language in public, as everyone knew that they only spoke Russian, the universal language, in their homes ! This story seems to be incredible but is apparently true. 14th November. The New Mujtahid. —The brother of the Agazada, see entry of 8 th instant, reached Meshed and was accorded a great reception. He will now prey on all classes and speedily become rich. 15th November. Arrival of the Rukn-u-Dola. —The new Governor- | General was given a very good reception by all classes. He is undoubtedly popular. 16th November. Mur dor of Pilgrims o? the Afghan frontier. —The Kariz Agent reports that seven Berber! pilgrims were murdered on the Afghan side of the frontier. 17th November. The Elections. —Orders have been received for new members to be elected. Many new 7 candidates have come forward. 18th November. Rrince Dabija and the Rukn-u-Dola. —My colleague refused to pay the usual call in uniform and finally went alone. As he is always accompanied by four or five members of his staff, the Governor-General is much offended, as Persians feel such slights most keenly. 2. The Trice of Bread.—T \\q Vizier has received orders to sell 6,000 kharvars of Government wheat to the bakers to cheapen the price of bread. S. Tersian Justice. —With reference to entry of 14th October, I hear that the opponents of the half-hanged man have appealed to lehran. In case of the Legation being referred to, I would state that I have kept the man, who is apparently innocent, at the request of the Karguzar until the new Governor- General could settle his case. Tolitical Summary to Meshed Diary No. 46 of 1911. State of Trovince. —The Rukn-u-Hola reahed Meshed on the 15th and I visited him tw r o days later. He informed me that the country between Tehran and Shahrud had been swept clear of food and that he could not even buy bread. He has promised to turn his attention to the state of the roads and to the question of the scarcity of supplies. Although he is not a strong man, I have always found him most sensible and reasonable. State q/rotfcZs. —Nishapur is being harried by the remnants of the band of Hidayat under a certain Mohamed. The Rukn-u-Dola is trying to open up the roads to the east. If he succeeds, charcoal will then come in. The gan' w T orking on the Chaacha road attacked the Commander-in-Ctiiff who retired veiy hastily. L* 13 JAN 1 SI 2The Nishapur Governorship .—The Persian Government has shown its utter contempt for its promises by repealing the order about Nishapur, which has again been separated from Khorasan. As this is a direct affront to both Legations, my colleague and I have reported the matter to Tehran. The Local Assembly and the Karguzar have also protested strongly. At this juncture the only hope of keeping any sort of order is to press for each band of robbers to be hunted. I continue to do this : but if they cannot be pursued into Nishapur territory, it will be very difficult to keep things going. My Russian colleague is delighted at the trend of events and thinks that the end is very near. If it be true, as he states, that Mr. Shuster is a Jew, there was never any chance of his being successful. The ex-Shah .—It appears that the ex-Shah has appointed a Governor to Bandar Gaz : but no ships touch there at present. The Karguzar of Bujnurd is much afraid that Bujnurd may he invaded and indeed this is quite possible. I; P. M.

The portion most affected was between Kabul Sai and Aktiubinsk. Central Asian Line. Change of Chief. —According to the Turkistan News, Engineer Eorisof, Chief of the line, has been appointed Chief of the Exploita tion Section in the Ministry of Ways of Communication. No mention is made of his successor. Construction of bridges.—Three new bridges are reported to be in course of construction between Giaurs and Baba Durmaz, their object being to prevent inundation of the line by flood-water. Provision of sleepers. —The management of the line has placed an order for the supply of 532,000 sleepers for 1912. Arys-Vyerni project. —Engineer Salmine has reached Vyerni with the object of carrying out investigations for the line between that place and Kurdai, and for a branch line from Yyerni to Ilitsk. Kokand-Namangan line. —Passenger and goods traffic on this branch has been commenced provisionally between Kokand and the Syr Darya. Passenger carriages for the purpose have been rented from the Central Asian Line pending the arrival of the rolling-stock of the new branch. Waterways. Transfer to Ministry of Ways of Communication. —This Department is considering the question of taking over all waterways in Turkistan and of assisting in the development of steamship navigation on the principal rivers of the country. The decision to transfer the Amu Darya Flotilla to the Ministry of Way# of Communication has been definitely arrived at and effect will be given to it next spring. Motor navigation on the Amu Darya. —The Trans-Caspian Review states that, in addition to the motor boats which have been used this year on the upper waters of the river by hydrometrical parties, the supply of boats of this type both to the Frontier Guard and to private firms at Termez and Sarai is contemplated next year. History. Bokhara. —The Turkistan News states that all reactionary Mullas, opposed to the initiation of the Amir’s reforms, have been deported from Bokhara. This is given as fresh intelligence, but it may quite possibly refer to the previous deportations. Outrage on Samarkand-Termez post road. —The murder, about a month ago, of two servants of the Beg of Hissar conveying 40,000 roubles of Bokharan government money between Derbent and Ak Bobat, and the robbery of the specie is reported. Several Afghans, supposed to be the perpetrators, were executed by the Bokharan authorities. Cessation of plague in Semiryechia. —Semiryechia being now considered free of plague, orders have been issued for the removal of quarantine and for the withdrawal of the extra sanitary personnel.2 Influx of famine-stricken peasantry .—A number of destitute Mujiks, mostly from the Orenburg Government, have reached Tashkent in the hope of obtaining work on the Arys-Vyerni line. Charitable measures are being taken to provide for their immediate necessities. f Military. Disaffection among Tashkent garrison .—The unrest among the Troops caused by the rumour that time-expired men would be retained beyond their time has been allayed by the promulgation of an official denial of the truth of the report. Belief for Meshed Detachment .—Seventy Taman Cossacks and a machine- gun detachment of 25 men of the 18th Turkistan Kifle Regiment have reached Meshed from Ashkabad. ■ Resources. Proposed taxation of live-stock from Afghanistan .—A proposal to impose a tax on live-stock entering &lt;$S| Bokhara and Turkistan from Afghanistan is combated by the Russian customs authorities w r ho consider that the amount gained will not be a set-off against the probable decrease of numbers imported and consequent increase in price. A comparatively heavy export duty is charged by the Afghan authorities. E. A. F. REDL, Major, Military Attache. %. G. P. I. —1570 F.

Progress of proposed reforms for ZWtasfcm.—State Controller Kharitonof s Commission has terminated its revision of Count Palen’s Commission and agrees generally with the conclusions of the latter and in particular with L ^ n l t , ralens views on the emigrant question—the source of the dissensions which have created so long a delay. One of the main recommendations of the Kharitonof Commission is the increase of the powers of the Governor- General. The report has now been referred to the Council of Ministers after which steps will be taken to draft and promulgate the new laws. No very speedy conclusion can, therefore, be looked for. (Reference Diaries 7 and 23.) J Communications. Railways.—Tashkent Line. Accident. —An accident to a train with loss of life to the train-staff occurred near Bogatoye station. Central Asian Line.—Passing places. —Two new passing places {razyezdi) numbered 35 and 37, are being opened between Bami and Archman, and Archman and Bakharden, respectively. The Razyezd “ Chinaz,” near Tashkent, having recently assumed increased importance, is to be opened as a station for receipt and despatch of freight and for the issue of passenger tickets. Financial position for 1910. —The working of the line during 1910 shewed a surplus of 2,369,891 roubles. Oxus Railway project. —A third and last party of engineers has left Tashkent for investisration work on the proposed Termez line. The party will be employed between Kaghan (New Bokhara) and Karshi. Firyusa branch. —The relaying of this branch from Ashkabad still forms the subject of inter-departmental discussion. Waterways.—Amu Darya Flotilla. —Tenders for the supply of 4,820 tons of naphtha fuel for the steamers and workshops of the flotilla are called for. History. Death of Provincial Governor. —The sudden death, on the 29th October, of the Military Governor of Samarkand—General Grigorof—is reported. Bokhara. —Two officials of the Amir, who were collecting recruits for the army in the districts, are stated to have been killed by the people. The ex-Shah. —The Trans-Caspian Review, up to the 3 rd November, states that the ex-Shah is at Khoja Nafas. A correspondent from Trans-Caspia reports that the rumour is current at Ashkabad that the ex-Shah remained there 3 days with the Governor and that he was sent back to Persia via Bezmen. As the man did not see the ex-Shah himself, he declines to vouch for the truth of the rumour. Aviation. —The aviator, Syedof, has carried out successful flights at Tashkent on a Earman machine, passengers being taken.2 Newspapers. —The Tashkent paper Na Rubezhye has ceased to appear. A new paper, the Russki Turkestan, having no connection with the former, is to be issued. Russian justice. —A soldier has been condemned to death by Court- Martial at Tashkent for an assault on an officer in the street. Medical evidence was adduced proving that the man was of unsound mind and not responsible for his actions owing to a previous injury to the head, and the Governor-General commuted the death sentence to one of penal servitude for life. Military. General. —The troops having recently returned to their stations on the termination of the manoeuvres, few moves are reported. One hundred Kavkaz Cossacks have left Merv, it is presumed for Pul-i- Khatun. A correspondent reports that considerable disaffection prevails among the garrison of Tashkent owing to a rumour that men whose colour service expires this year will be retained beyond their time. E.

General Summary. State of Provinces .—There are the usual rumours afloat regarding the looting of the Kainat by the Sarhad Baluchis. Two parties recently returned from those parts have brought with them considerable booty—estimated at 3,000 and 500 sheep respectively—of which the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is to retain a share. A party of 30 Brahuis started for the Kainat about the middle of November and it is said that Taj Muhammad Khan, son of Muhammad Beza Khan, Beki, has collected a large force and intends to start off also early in December. State of Roads.— This state of affairs naturally gives rise to a feeling of insecurity regarding the roads between Seistan and the Kainat. Arms Traffic .—A certain Maasur Khan Kharoti is said to have left for Bampur with ten men to purchase rifles. Seistan Canals .—I visited the “bund ” at Kuhak on the 21 st November (or rather what was left of it) and found that after it had been constructed with considerable difficulty under the eye of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, it had been bodily washed away a few days later, owing solely (so it appeared) to the fact that no one had been left to look after it. Only a few yards at each end remained, and at the time of my visit the laborious process of fetching “ gaz ” was beginning again and some 200 or 300 Seistanis were hard at work. The river is unusually full for the time of year and where I crossed the Pariun on the way to Milak there is 12 to 11 feet of water in the middle. W. E.

They are in good condition with one or two exceptions and the usual annual repairs will now be put in progress. At I) eh Say ad I exchanged visits with the Afghan officials of Chukansur whom I found as usual very friendly and polite. The canal system appears unchanged since the report made by Mr. McManus last year (see Major McConaghey’s letter No. 276c, dated 12 th November 1910) but the Pariun seems to be shifting its course gradually westward and a large quantity of water now flows close along the Eastern side of the high-lying ground which contains the ruins of Zahidan, the Mil of Kosimabad, etc. Hospital figures for November.
