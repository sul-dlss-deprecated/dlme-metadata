There is no local objection to the frequencies 217, 219 and 223 lic/s. In confirming that there is no local naval objection, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, has pointed out that the Admiralty is responsible for the frequency allocations of the Royal Navy, and therefore any queries on the subject should be referred to Admiralty direct, especially when major decisions are required as in this case. He is of the opinion, however, that it is almost certain that this has already been done in this instance in view of the close co-operation that nor mally exists between the various services and Govern ment Departments over matter of this kind. 3. The matter was referred to the R.A.F. station, Sharjah, but they were unable to confirm and referred it in turn to Air Headquarters, Iraq. Air Headquarters, Iraq, have been reminded but have not yet sent them a reply. In view of the delay that this has occasioned we asked Mr. Hemelik of International Aeradio Limited whether there would be any objection to these frequencies and he has confirmed that it is in order to use the frequencies at Bahrain and Gharjah.
