My wishes and aims are limited to what is neoeeeary for the public welfare* aappinese and complete independence. The actual l*¥ler«hip i* of eaall importance to me provided thee# ends be attained. Mow they have appointed my t»on Ali on condition that the affaire and influence of the Hejaz Government be restricted tc ite own territory .aid that a mrnmmm constivUwional form of government; ba adopted* notwithstanding that the Arab revolt was based* firstly* on the principle of the complete independence of all Arab countries whose boundaries were defined and* secondly* on the desire to put Into force in these sacred lands the laws of the Quran and the traditions of the proj&gt;het. To any limitation of the Hejas I make the following objections. At the present moment the Hej&amp;s is still in negotiations for the inaepemeenee ux Ax«w* Jaeig oountrlee. Moreover even without the limitation it can be seen what dangers abound: as witness Bin Baud 1 * ambition in occupying Hail* the capital of the Amirate of Bin Rashid* and Jauf* the country of the Bha'lan family* and hie attempt to eelae Kowelt* hie attack on Asir the princedom of Al A'idh * not to mention hie attackattack on the city of Mecca; the atteapl* of tbe I« Aja of Ean*a to eel&amp;e the territory of Ha* id and Tabgna belonging to the Sbaf&amp;'ie; the (attack of the) Idries! on Hodeida and ite vicinity and hie (sic) institution of a constitutional governaent whereby the precepts of the Quran and the traditions of the prophet are set at nought even in the holy placet and replaced by a secular code. 1 contend that thi*» restrict ion of influence is contrary to the laws of Isl&amp;a, the precepts of religion and the illustrious traditions both material and moral. Moreover it is contrary to the principles of our revolt in which the Hejas in particular and the Arabs in general poured out their blood and treasure in their effort to attain these two honourable and sacred ends. You are therefore requested to convey to the above ooomittee and everyone else whoa it way ooncoro ay strong protest, firstly, against the limitation of the influence of the Hejas as explained above, for it will assuredly result in the Arabs being divided snu deprived of their vital and fundamental rights; secondly, against what la contrary to ths rules of the Quran.

His Excellency the British Agent, Jeddah. After respects. We find it necessary tc coomunicate to you a copy of the above protest aade to *hs Acting Prlae MinisterENCLOSURE B. Summary of a proclamation T5y Bin Saxid, dated 32.2.1343 (September 20th,1924), idiioh was received in Jeddah on October 16th, 1924. The moGive prompting the issue of the proclamation i&amp; sympathy for the Uoaleme and a desire for their welfare both temporal and spiritual. Every effort had been made to induce Hussein ibn Ali to unite the Arab?:, but his character wa£ not to be changed. Evidence of his thought* is to be found in hi* aote which are repugnant not merely to Mo 3 le*ns but to non- Moslems too. Instead of following in the steps of hie noble ancestors this man neglected the rights of the Holy Place. He has shown the greatest zeal in intriguing against Nejd and its people. In hie rashness he even debarred Nejdis from fulfilling one of the five Moslem tetfles viz* +hat of performing’ the pilgrimage - apart from the brutality with which he treated pilgrims in general. Out of reverence for the House of God we refrained from interfering in Hajaz affairs. Unhappily we did not find similar forb aranos in him. When he was in Tran -Jordania recently his aims became clear to ihe Moslems, for he d manded the partition of Nejd and thereby mad# ua despair of attaining Arab unity. Bin Baud ie unaware of having done anything to provoke this rancour: he ha* no desire for the vanities of Hussein or of his people, whether in regard to the kingdom or to the Caliphate: his sole object is that the word of God may be supreme and his religion exalted, and that the honour of the Arab world may be safeguarded. Islamic zeal and Arab patriotism therefore led Bin Baud and his people to endeavour, at the risk of loss of life and property, to make the religion of God supreme( 2 ) supreme and to dtfand tha saorad plaoa. Bin Saud haa sent a force of Mosleae to oooupy Taif in order to be near &lt;*nd to uaYe an opportunity to oome to an underetanding with hia brethren. He wiehed hi a readers to know hie riewe: if they agree, well; if they reject the», he ie excused in the eight of God and of the Moslem. He sweare by God that he will do nothing contrary to Moslem law, particularly in ihe holy place. Hie message to the people of Mecca and its dependencies, the notables, the townsmen in general, the res idents, and the refugees (i.e. wiai .ors) fro® all countries, is this: he promiess them that thsir lives and property will be safe and that they will be respected as the sanctity of the holy place requires. He will not treat them in a manner displeasing to thsm, and nothing shall be done to Lh*tu, either now or in the future, except in accordance with law. He will do his best to make the holy place safe, as also its inhabitants, ite roads and its pilgrims. He will not appoint as governor anyone whom they dislike. He does not propose to treat them as vassals, but with advice, security and comfort. The question of the holy places will be left to the consultation of the Moslems. Nothing will be done in thsm which might injurs them or their honour or thsir people but only that wnioh is agreed upon by the Moslems and accepted by Moslem law. The present letter is his bond before God and the Moslems, and he gives his promise before God in regard to all that is written above. Indeed, he hopes to perform even more than he nas written. God guide us all, etc. (Seal of Bln Saud)ENCLOSURE C. From Klialid ibn Mansur to Muhaiwaad Tawil, Sulaiman Q&amp;bil, Ibdullaci Zainai, Muhajoitaad Nasif, and all the people of Jeddah.

I am sure that this is known to your officials and I repeat that I shall endeavour to the utmost to maintain the freedom of the roads to the Haj to all British subjects who may wish to visit the Holy Places and t0 Pr ° teCt aU Pil * riffiS ' P^icularly British subjects, but alsc the subjects Of other powers, from any interference by my subjects and to ensure the safety of their lives and property whether they be pilgrims or settlers in Hecca. I shall be obliged to so maintain peace for three reasons: firstly, I uphold the agreement for it is founded on religion and the dictates of honour; secondly, because I am bound „o it by the official agreement which I have signed; thirdly, 1 am desirous to fulfill the wishes of my friend the British Government, who will always find me willing to follow the advice and directions they may offer. I find it necessary to point out sone of the agres sions of the Hedjaz and to explain the intentions of Hussain at this juncture and what led the people of liajd to their action. Sver^ V ' 3r Glno ° his retu rn from the Turkish capital, Hussain has wished to cocoass ~~v u ~ J ' ass ‘V -o./niall. He joiiied with the Turks and himself case to ITajtt to capture it, thereby planting the seeds of omrity acon r the tribes. ^Then he had reached a Place three days fro* Riyadh, he returned, after capturing a ** d holdln&lt; t in ransora, sy brother the Amir Sadd. Wh ® n th0 C ' reat ' 7ar trolce o«t and he turned against the -arks, I sa-.7 that, for ry honour, in obedience to the wishes cf the British Government and in support of its policy, I should be one of his greatest supporters to help him to success. I ^ave thousands of men to fi^ht for him and permitted my subjects to enlist m his army and all this in addition to material assis tance in camels, horses, sheep, etc. I was his createst helper during the war and his pro tector from Bin Rashid and the Turks. The reward which I had from Hussain after he had settled in -ledineh was the despatch by him of a strong force towards my country; but God helped us and defeated his force at Torteh. Our forces have only r,frain.d from rovence on the Hodjaz on the advice of the British r.overn- nent. Hussain was not satisfied with all this, but continually despatched forces to Asir, attacking the tribes and urcinc them to reoel and cause me inconvenience. Further, he continued to i..tri,~ue by sending letters and presents to my Amirs and tribal chiefs in Hajd endeavouring to seduce them from obedience. How many times have I protested to the British Government against theso actions ? Still mere. He has demolished one of the pillars our .icith - “'matter in which liajadis cannot continue to cive way as they have in the past, nevertheless, owinc to the intervention of H.IT. Government limited numbers of ITajdis received permission to co on the Haj; but the conduct of Hussain in Mecca and the fact that he prohibited then from performin'?■■M performing soniG of the religious ohservanoes v/ith froedom - which is proved by the documents he sent my Amir A1 Haj at Mecca and which I have retained, and the robber;/' of their money to which they were subjected - compelled iTajdis to give up the Haj through fear that some disturbance might occur in Mecca during the pilgrimage, which would be disasterous. '.Then the people of 1'ajd found that this state of affairs continued and the man (meaning Hussain) 'remained in pride' and supplies became difficult to obtain and the roads in the Hedjaz unsafe, they realised and I with them, that Hussain had evil intentions towards l-ajd and increasing ill-feeling and enmity and 'the darkness became more intense' (i.e., relations became mere and more strained). His speeches in public and private meetings when he was in Trans-Jordan prove this - for example, he said : 'I cannot rest until I see ITajd cut off on the 'North, the South and the West, and under new Rulers 'who will follow my directions. This policy is to me ! as my religion. I will achieve it at the expense 'of myself, ry property and my children.' This is in addition to the line adopted by the Trans jordan delegates at the Kuwait Conference who were inspired by Hussain. All these matters caused me to take steps to ensure the future safety of my Government and to frustrate the achievenept of his evil designs./''N Translation of a letter ITo.lCl, dated 4th Rabia A; 7 al ' ?rd Ccto ^Or) , from H.H. the Sultan of ITajd, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

The only condition he laid down wae that the Aair An chould either be eeieed or forced to leave the country? if that condition wae complied eith Jeddah had nothing to fear: all the official* would be maintained in their poet*, and not only would no aarm be done to the people, but Khalid would not even eend Wahabi / troops to Jeddah but would leave the town to govern itself: but If they failed to eeiae Ali or to force him to leave, the Wahabi* would take Jeddah by foroe and would treat the town as they treated T&amp;if, This message was only what wae to be expected: Enalld would naturally wieh to secure Jeddah, a* he secured Mecca, without fighting. The threat of fright fulness was very likely bluff, but it was taken at its f*ee value at Jeddah, where the population fell into a state of abject fright. This feeling was intsnsified when Ali finally announced hie determination to fight. The leading men, stimulated by Kh&amp;lid 1 * message and by a telegram from Bin Baud'* secretary at Bahrain, saying that Bln Baud would never make peace so long a* Hussein or his eons ruled in tae Hejax, pointed out to Au that hie pr*«#ao* alone stood in the way of peace and he promised to abdicate and leave the country if they would make the demand in writing; but when the demand, signed by everyone of importance, wae presented, he went back on hie premie*. In his decisionto roiplot he ha* been enoouraged, »• wa® otated in the last report, by the Baghdadi and Syrian officer* end by the arrival of reinforoeaente from Trane-dordania and the Drua* country* Other faotore which have contributed to the decision are the oonetant enoovurageaent he receivee from the ex-King Huseeln and the Amir AbduiXah, the hope tnat something will ooae of Mr Philby ! e vielt, the arrival of a stock of ammunition from Europe, and the dieoovery of a Turkish officer who ie believed to poeeeee the secret of making tranchea* S. Acting on inetructions from His Majesty'e Oovenment I informed the Hejaa Government that Mr Phiiby’s visit wae not authorised by them and that he has no authority to negotiate in their ngme. They replied that they quite understood this: Mr Phllby had **ked if he might oome as a friend and they could not refuse* This doee not prevent their representing the visit, privately, as authorised by His Majesty 1 # Government and aa offering in .consequence high hopes of a euccee ful issus. Ic one in Jeddah, except perhaps the Amir All and his entourage, bellevee that Mr Philby ocmee a# a private person, and one cannot blame them for their euspioions. Mr Philby arrived on Ootober 2&amp;th* He just miesed the mail i steamer at Sues and to avoid a delay of ten days he came down on a cargo boat, and the Hejax Government eeni, a launch some mile# out to sea to take him off* This unusual method of travelling and landing only increased the suspicion attaoning to .he visit* 3* On Ootober 3Ut the Khedivlal Mail boat landed 156 oases of ammunition which they had brought over from Port Sudar*. The instruct ions received by the agents were to hand the documents to Mosers Laxsarini as reprseentat Ives, itit appear®, of the Banco di Roaa, The oa^e® were for the Hejax Government. They appear to have paeeed through the hands of Ueeere Thoe.Cook and Son at Port Said, where they wore disembarked from the 8*$. 'Architect •, a Harrieon boat. The origin of the ooneignaent is not known. The Amir Ali aeeuree hi® eupporter® that armoured car®, aeroplanes and munitions will reach Jeddah on a (? Butch) steamer arriving about November 5th. Under the direction of the Turkish officer referred to above a system of trenches hae been made all round Jeddah, at a diet?*aoe varying from a mile to a fee hundred yards. A Hashiaite steamer brought aboui $00 'volunteere' from Akaba on October 58th. 4. For the native of the Hejax tteooa ie now considered much safer than Jeddah. Host of the well-to-do people who had fled to Jeddah nave returned to Ueooa. The rest, and many inhabitante of Jeddah, would also have gone, but during the last few day® the road has become unsafe. Several oaravane have been robbed and the people composing them have had to return. These robberies seem to have been instigated, ox at least allowed, by the Sharif Muhsln, who act® as intermediary between the HeJ%* Government and the tribe®. One of rhe objects eeeme to have been to secure the letter® in which the people of Mecca have poured out their treasonable souls to the Wahabis; another, to reward tribe# who have promised to help Ali against the Wahabis. The M&lt;soq&amp; road being closed the population are seeking other way# of eaoape. Flfpt and Eritrea refuse to take refugeebut many have gone to 3u&amp;kin. Some inmoredeof wosttn, ohildron and pervaats b&amp;ire b««n *ant to the Jeddah quarantine island*;, and all the dhow* have been retained by the menfolk of these people to take thea to the ielande at a aotaent'e notice if Jediah ie attacked* 5* The departure of all the Indian pilgrias, and also the cutting of the road, which resaowes the possibility (already greatly diminished by the reassuring attitude of the Wahabis) of our being flooded by Indiana from Meooa, elaplifis* the evapuation problem very greatly* The $paoial measuree which had been taken at JL&amp;aaran by the Resident at Aden to provide for the possible arrival of 8,500 British refugees have been o*no«lled, the quarantine station being able to provide without expansion for soma 500 persons: that ie about as many as we should have to send there. 6. The Wahabi a have coatiitted no offences against life or property in Mecca, but they have prohibited as unnecessary the delivery of theological lectures and the use of* all religious book* other taan the Quran and the Traditions* This policy ha* had the effect of braving a oon^lderable number of Malay and Javanese theological students away to Jeddah where they are waiting for eleaaer* to call to take them home* evidence obtained from thee# students and from other sources goes to show that the W&amp; &amp;bi*? have also desecrated various? tombs at Mecca which the Sunni regards with veneration. 7* The Amir An hae stated to various people that when Bln Baud reache• Mecca he will go there * alone if necessary * md try to come to an arrangement with him, but that he will make no further attempt to negotiate with Kh&amp;lid. It is unlikely that any attack will be made on Jeddah before Bin S&amp;ud arrives* The Wahabis have met with no serious opposition hitherto, and will hardly attack2 &gt;7 attack an •nur^noiUed position if (.hay can solve Uit prohloB in votae other w&amp;y.

I have submitted numerous protests against these raids after they had been committed, but these protests did not achieve the desired m results; they were mot vita a long silence. For this reason my tribesmen could not but retaliate against those who had transgressed against thorn at the very place from where raids hove boon connittod. But what has caused surprise is the interference of a friendly Government in these tribal disputes, •ihereas, if the Government had intervened at tho beginning to ' prevent tho Trans-Jordanian and other tribesmen raiding upon cur tribesmen, the matter would have boon settled and would not have rccchod tho present stage, and the partiqpstion of British troops in such a dispute is a thing I never anticipated or expected from our friend Great Britain.

Tentative appreciation of various shades of Muslim opinion in India, which has not however yet Crystallised, rec-ardincr WaheOoi threat to Holy Places, is as follows - Sober Muhammadans imaard present developments as likely to lead to further disintegration of Islam. Khilafatists, however, welcome success of Wahabis openly and hope to succeed in securing satisfactory assurances' from Bin Gaud in recard to safety of Holy Places and Haj routes. They are raising outcry at prospect of British renderin'- assistance to iflnc Hussein or otherwise inter fering in Civil V/ar in Holy Land. Mussulmans generally would welcome Kiny Hussein’s removal from overlordship of Hejaz, as they feel towards him deep-seated hostility which has been recently strengthened by exaggerated reports of pilgrims suffering this season and for the moment this is dominant consideration amcnc them. On other hand there is no cenuine likinc here for V/ahabis cwinc to their past record and religious differences and it is expected that larce body of Sunni ©pinion would definitely assert itself acainst them if an advance on Mecca and Medina were accompanied by usual process of destruction and desecration.

In Reuters cf 29th September there is summary of an interview with Naji to effect that draft of Treaty brought by him met views of British Government whose signature was . expected shortly and that employment cf British armoured cars and aeroplanes was only deterrent to V/ahabis.

Reuters adds 'It is stated authoritatively that if pilgrim routes are jeopardised British Government might interfere'. Unless to some correction is published forthwith this is almost bound to have serious effect on Muslim India and we trust cfiicial statement making it clear that no interference in the Hedjaz itself is contemplated by His Majesty's Govern ment will be issued at once.

Forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, with the compliments of His Britannic Majesty’s Agent and Consul, Jeddah. From His Britannic Majesty’s Agent and Consul, Jeddah, to His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London, S. W., No. 95—11-1, dated Jeddah, the 21st September 1924. I have the honour to enclose a rather hastily compiled report on the Taif incident. 2. Copies of this despatch are being or will shortly be sent to India, Singa pore, Egypt, Khartoum (through Port Sudan), Jerusalem, Bairut (for Damascus), Baghdad, Bushire, Koweit, Bahrain and Aden. 3. The refugee question will be dealt with in a separate despatch, copies of which will be sent to India and Singapore only. THE CAPTURE OF TAIF. Bushire had news on August 8th that a force had left Riyadh on August 1st to attack Taif. On August 17th when I commented on this report by te'egraph, there was still no news of a projected attack here. It was on August 31st that I first heard of a “ Wahabi ” concentration near TaiL Shaikh Fuad, the Foreign Secretary, mentioned it when he*passed through on that date on his way to Tehran, but not as being more serious than usual. Had the King known how serious it was he would have retained Shaikh Fuad, who would have been invaluable to him in such a crisis. The Acting Foreign Secretary mentioned the report the next day on the telephone, and said that the Amir Ali had gone out to tranquillise the people. There was still nothing to show that the threat was more serious than in May (see my report for that month) when the Russian airmen were sent out several times to report and we! e asked—but refused—to drop bombs on the supposedly hostile en campment. On September 4th the Hashimite Government informed me by letter (not by telephone or telegraph) that the Wahabis had taken and burned the palace of Suwaihit, situated to the north-east of Taif. This was reported to His Majesty’s Government and to the Government of India with the comment that the outer defences of the Hejaz must have been penetrated. On the evening of Friday Sep tember 5th,Taif was taken, the Hejaz forces under the Amir Ali withdrawing first to Hadah, and later to Arafat. 2. The Hejaz Government at once telegraphed to me to ask His Majesty’s Government what steps should betaken “ in view of such open hostility ”. They were quite unable to explain what kind of reply they thought His Majesty’s Govern ment could give. They wrote give later attributing their troubles to alleged assurances by His Majesty’s Government that Bin Sand would not attack and to His Majesty’s Government’s refusal to provide them with munitions of war. When the consular corps telephoned to Mecca to inquire as to the safety of British subjects, we received the assurance that foreigners would be protected as if they were Hejaz subjects and would we let the Hejaz Government have four aeroplanes on payment. 3. All the reports received in Jeddah, particularly one from the Sudan notable the Sharif Yusuf al Hindi, who made a special journey to Jeddah with the King's consent, and the King’s demands for advice, aeroplanes, munitions, etc., made it clear that Mecca was in danger if the Wahabis in Tail cared to advance or another hostile force attacked from another direction. The regular army—such as it is— began to melt away. Mecca was known to be disaffected to King Hussein, and the tribes to have been long tired of his blockade policy, which kept them on very short rations in the hope of keeping Nejd short of supplies, and particularly angry MC643FD2 at his greed, amounting this year to swindling, over the division of the money ob tained from pilgrims for the journey to Medina. If Mecca fell the administration of Jeddah would probably break down, and in that case, the tribes might possibly attack the town for the foodstuffs they so badly need. The only way of escape for British and other foreign subjects fleeing from Mecca would then be closed. A preconcerted signal was therefore sent to the Sudan asking for the nearest sloop to come over. H. M. S. “Clematis” arrived on September 10th. The French armed yacht “ Diana ” was already in port. She had come in the pre vious day to take on board a French Sudanese accused of slave trading and order ed to be taken to Jibuti for trial, and was detained by the Acting French Consul until instructions for her to remain until further orders could be received from Paris. Both ships are here still. 4. The first feeling in Jeddah was of hardly concealed delight. The Hejazi townsman is a mean-spirited and cowardly creature, whose most doughty deed is the swindling of a live pilgrim or the robbing of a dead one. His hatred of King Hussein had hitherto been concealed under an effusive servility, but at the sight of the Wahabis about, as he thought, to set him free from King Hussein he began to talk treason boldly. The early rumours of the behaviour of the Wahabis at Taif were uniformly favourable to them : they had committed no excesses of any kind ; there had not even been any looting; and when, on September 11th, the foreign consuls and the leading officials in Jeddah received a telegram from Mecca, signed by a large number of Hejazis and foreigners, but in reality, as was well known, composed by the King, accusing the Wahabis of desecration of the tomb of the Prophet ! s cousin, Abdullah ihn Abbas, and of looting, murder and other excesses, not a soul was prepared to believe the story. It is a necessary rule with all the foreign representatives here to believe no statement of King Hussein’s until it is corroborated from some independent source. The inhabitants of Jeddah observe the same rule, and in addition they were animated by a most determined will to believe nothing but good of the Wahabis. Mecca was a little excited by the news and a few people fled to Jeddah, but even there the anti- Hussein feeling was too strong and the behef in the possibility that excesses had been committed died away. 5. The first reliable evidence in support of the story of pillage and murder was brought to Jeddah on September 10th by the Javanese Muhammadan, Shaikh Pravira, who is at present Acting Netherlands Consul. He had the evidence of Javanese pilgrims that some of their people had been killed while they themselves had been robbed of all they possessed except their underclothes. Arabs could have given clearer evidence, but no refugees other than these few Javanese arrived for some little time. Now the Javanese are notoriously ignorant of local affairs, and they had clearly fled very soon after the evacuation of Taif by the Hejaz forces. It was therefore thought that the assailants were poss bly local ruffians who had profited by the interregnum and not the invaders at all. Moreover, these refugees were brought in from the front line by the King, in his car, and the suspicion could not be avoided that, in the state of alarm and distress in which they arrived they might have been unwillingly inspired with the King’s views. Nevertheless the information was reported to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were asked whether in case of need refugees could be taken to Kamaran. The British, French and Netherlands representatives suggested to their respective governments that they should send to the leader of the occupy'ng forces a letter expressing the hope that the interests of foreigners would be safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government approved the proposal that a letter should be sent but directed that it should be in the form of a warning. A letter in the sense prescribed was sent off by secret messenger on September 13th. It was signed by me and by my Netherlands colleague ; instructions authorising the Acting French Consul to sign w^ere not received until September 15th. With the letter I sent one signed by myself alone, saying that news had been received that a certain British Indian w r as being held to ransom and protesting—subject to the truth of the report—against such conduct. 6 6. My greatest difficulty arose from the fact that, being debarred from going to Mecca, I could not personally advise the large number of British subjects in permanent or temporary residence there. This was discussed with Mr. M. Yasin MC643FD » ^ .3 Khan, the Indian Pilgrimage Officer, and he volunteered to go to Mecca to look after the interests of British subjects in general. He arrived there on September 14th. His instructions were (1) to endeavour to despatch, with the cognisance of King Hussein, duplicates of the two letters already sent to Taif by secret messen ger ; (2) to investigate the reports of pillage and massacre, and (3) to get into touch with the various British communities in Mecca, not only with the Indians, but with the Malays, Nigerians, and others as well. Pilgrims who had performed the Haj were to be told that they would be well advised to go home in view of the economic difficulties incident to the situation ; merchants and other residents who asked for advice must decide for themselves: if, in case of need, they applied to the British Agency at Jeddah, they would be given such assistance as was possible and as the circumstances warranted. 7. When Mr. Yasin Khan and Shaikh Pravira showed King Hussein the two letters which it was desired to send to the leader of the invaders the King said that the one signed by the British and Dutch representatives could not be allowed to pass out of the Hejaz lines : the protest against the holding of a British Indian to ransom might go if the form of address (“To the Leader of the Force which has occupied Taif ”) were changed and the name of the Wahabi leader inserted. It was necessary to telephone to the King personally, and to say that he would be held jointly responsible for any further harm suffered by British subjects at the hands of the invaders, before he would consent to our despatching the joint letter. As to the other letter I was compelled to insist on the retention of the form of address I had used, since I had no official information as to the identity of the attacking force or of their leader. As it turned out the discussion was academic, since Mr. Yasin Khan was unable to find a messenger who would agree to go to Taif, and in any case the King would probably have had him waylaid ; but the discus sion was useful in revealing King Hussein’s views. He told me in so many wordr. that he objected to the letter because it confined its representations to British subjects and said nothing about the Hejaz. From this and from other remarks it was quite clear that he was still expecting that His Majesty’s Government would pull him out of the pit he had helped so strenously to dig for himself. 8. Taif has three functions very valuable to Mecca : it is a strong natural posi tion ; it supplies the capital with the bulk of its fruit and vegetables ; and it serves as a health resort. As a health resort it had been neglected for some years, owing to the Wahabi menace, but gradually more and more of the wealthy Meccans resumed their old custom and this summer a very large number of families had installed themselves in their Taif houses, among them two or three Indian families. I here were also many pilgrims of various races. Most of these were Javanese. 9. Apart from the information obtained by Mr. Yasin Khan in Mecca we have now the evidence of many refugees from Taif who have come to Jeddah. The outlines of the story are clear. When the Wahabi attack was threatening during the three or four days preceding the capture of the town many of the Mecca people asked for permission to leave. This was refused by the Qaimmaqam, the Sharif Sharaf, on the ground that there was no danger, and that their return to Mecca would cause a panic there. Many again wished to leave when the Amir Ali eva cuated the town, but they were told that he was only going to bring up reinforce ments. After the evacuation some of the people invited the Wahabis into the town and into their houses. In spite of this, p llage and shooting began at once. Every thing of value was taken, even to the outer garments : men and women were left with nothing but their underclothes. The Mecca people had with them many fine carpets, much money (in this country money is hidden in the house rather than deposited in a bank), and enormous quantities of jewellery. Everything was taken. If a man hesitated to produce his money and valuables, or was suspected of trying to conceal any, he was shot at once. Some families have lost five or s'x men. Most of the people who survived the massacre were sent to the palace of Shubrah, an enormous building standing in a very large garden just outside the town walls. There they remained for four days, living on fruit. When the corpses were already swollen and putrifying about thirty of the survivors were compelled to remove them : they were given mules and ropes by which to drag the bodies away. Four days after the capture of the town the Mecca refugees collected in the Shubrah garden were ordered to return to Mecca, seven men only be’ng kept until a sum of £l,000 should be paid for each. They were ordered to convey a4 message to the people of Mecca, to the effect that the Wahabis were coming would treat them as Taif had been treated unless they got rid of the Sharif (King Hussein), who was referred to as Abu Khishah, t.e., “ The Chap in the Gunny Bag ” or “ Him in the Sack.” They left on foot, in their underclothes and barefooted. A small quantity of grain was given them by the W ahabis but not enough to go round. One, an Indian, had managed to conceal two pounds and was able to buy food on the way. A few died of exhaustion on the journey. 10. There is evidence that the invaders showed religious fanaticism. They constantly addressed their victims as Kuffar (infidels) and Mushrikin (those who join others with God, i.e., polytheists), and made many repeat the \\ ahabi formula. It appears that instead of “ There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the pro phet of Allah ” the Wahabis say “ There is no God but Allah alone : he has no companion.” To this they sometimes add : “ and Muhammad is his slave and his prophet.” They consider that the reverence shown by the Sunni for Muhammad savours of idolatry. It is alleged that the Wahabis demolished the tomb of Abdullah ibn Abbas cousin of the Prophet, but this, though widely believed and quite pro bable, is not well authenticated. It is believed now that most of the invaders belong to the Buqum and Ataibah tribes. The military success and the enormous booty won by these fairly recent converts are likely to win other tribes to the \\ ahabi tenets. 11. The local estimate of non-combatants killed by the Wahabis is from five to eight hundred. It is probable that Some two hundred were killed. To casual ties among the British Indians who happened to be in Taif ate these :— (1) Muhammad Sadiq son of Muhammad Nadim .. Held to ransom. (2) Muhammad Ismail son of Abdullah .. Do. (3) Mian Jamal (Baroda) .. .. .. Missing, believed killed. (4) Mian Ahmad (Baroda) .. .. .. Do. Nos. (1), (3) and (4) were registered at this Agency. No. (2) was registered until 1914. The three persons mentioned below viz. :— (5) Mirza Abdul Rahman .. . . Killed. (6) Ahmad, son of No. (5) .. .. Do. (7) Anma, daughter of No. (5) .. Do. were at first believed to be British Indians, but none was registered, Nos. (6) and (7) were certainly born in Mecca, and it is probable that not even the father, No. (5), was bom in India. It is said that there were also some Sindhis in Taif, and there is a story that the bodies of some of them were seen by the men who were made to bury the dead ; but I can get no certain evidence of this. The total number of Ind ans n Taif who were certainly or very probably entitled to be considered as British subjects was about twenty. A certain Ali Johar ibn Hasan Johar who was killed was a .web-known Calcutta merchant, but I am not sure about his nationality. He is said to have been bom in the Hejaz. 12. A Syrian general who was with the Hashimite forces in Taif states that the Amir Ali decided to evacuate the town before he had lost a single man. There may be some jealousy in this, but it is certain that the Hashimite army did not make a very desperate resistance. At the moment of writing the Amir Ali is advancing on Taif in the hope of retaking it, and one of the factors against him must be the case with which he was driven out a fortnight ago. His force consists of perhaps 500 men which he brought from Medina, of whom most aie West Africans ; per haps as many men of the Mecca troops, consisting of Yemenis of the worst kind (the lowlanders), “ Hejazis ” (notorious for deserting with their rifles even in peace time) from the agricultural country towards Taif, and Takrunis v r ho are nearly all unwilbng recruits. The Mecca people were at first unwilling to furnish any recruits, but the higher rates of pay which the Amir Ali seems to have compelled his father to(^) - . = promise, or the realisation of the truth of the news of pillage and massacre, or some other cause, has secured a few hundred recruits from the two best fighting elements in Mecca : the men of Hadhramaut origin and the men of the Havas Quarter. But everything depends upon the tribes, and so far no considerable body of tribal support seems°to have been even promised. That the tribes are on bad terms with King Hussein must be very well known to the Wahabis : indeed, it is reason able to suppose that Taif would hardly have been attacked if resistance from the tribes as well as from the Hashimite army had been anticipated. News received at the last moment before the typing of this despatch states that the Amir AH has now with him about 2,000 tribesmen. These are however not from the bigger tribes, e.g., Harb, but Bani Sufyan (a sub-tribe of the Bani Thaqif living near Taif), and odds and ends scraped together by the Sharifs, who fear that the family will be wiped out if the Wahabis take Mecca, from their personal following among the small local tribes, c.g., Bishah and Hudhail. As to the defence the Wahabis can make it is impossible to make a forecast of any serious value. Their numbers are still unknown. The force which captured the town was probab.y not much over a thousand, and the e is no reliable news of the arrival of reinforcements. And probably they are not too well supplied with cartridges. Artillery is not likely to play a large part in the struggle. The road to Taif is steep and bad, and moreover the guns are being kept, it is stated, for the defence of Mecca. 13. That the Hejaz is not yet animated by a sp ; rit of patriotism has been fully proved by the events of this fortnight. If a very few of the senior officials be ex cepted it may be said that the capture of Taif roused universal enthusiasm. The u war ” wa s regarded as a personal struggle between Bin Saud and King Hussein, and as a happy occasion by which the latter might be got rid of. The inhabitants of Mecca and Jeddah now say that but for the news of the massacres they would have deposed King Hussein. I much doubt whether their courage would have risen to this, but at least they were confident that, if Hussein could somehow cease to be king, either they could have come to terms with Bin Saud or, at the worst, they could fight the Wahabis with easy minds, knowing that their victory would not fix King'Hussein's yoke more firmly on their shoulders: and this conviction is not dead°yet. Both Mecca and Jeddah showed a spirit of independence which was completely lacking before. Jeddah town had hitheito been administered b\ the King, by telephone, down to the most trivial detail, but it now runs itself. No man had ever dared to question the wisdom of an order, but when the public re fused to accept the King’s new coinage, believing that the Wahibis would come and render it worthless, and the King wished to force it on them, the leading officials and merchants secured the Withdrawal of the order, and the Director General of Customs on his own responsibility issued gold and Turkish s Iver in ex change for the King’s copper. Mecca is said to have decided at least that the slow wretchedness of the rule of King Hussein is preferable to that of the Wahabis, but this seems to apply almost exclusively to the richer class, v hich ost so man\ men and so much property at Taif: the poorer people have no property to lose in a raid and little fear of be ng killed, whereas the^ suffer dail\ hardships from King Hussein’s greed and from his foolish economic policy. Jeddah is at a loss, fearing about equally the arrival of the Wahabis, the success of King Hussein, and an interval of disorder when the local tribes might come in and loot the town. They have therefore worked themselves into the belief that the foreign powers must protect Jeddah, and the wildest rumours—most of them based on the supposition that His Majesty’s Government would intervene—have been afloat. I believe, however, that the attitude of complete neutrality adopted by the consular corps is beginning to convince them that His Majesty s Government and the othei foreign powers are interested in the struggle only in so far as it affects the rights and in terests of their nationals. 14. When the crisis came, King Hussein’s first step was to clamour for advice from His Majesty’s Government and to make the false statement that they had promised him he should not be attacked. He clearly expected more than advice, for when I reminded the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs how, accord ing to the local press (written by the King), the Trans-Jordanian tribes had recently beaten off a Wahabi attack, King Husse n wrote to say ^ that the attack was only repulsed by means of British aeroplanes and tanks. Yet only a6 J month or so earlier he had informed His Majesty’s Government that the Am'r of Trans-Jordania was administering that territory on behalf of the Mecca Govern ment. How little he has done to conciliate Bin Sand is we 1 known. He has endeavoured to starve the Nejd tribes by limiting to a quantity quite inadequate even for his own people the amount of foodstuffs and other necessaries which might be taken out of the towns of he Hejaz, and although this measure was rescinded when he took the title of Caliph it has been applied in practice with litt'e if any modification. For several years he refused to allow Nejdis to come o Mecca on the pilgrim ige. L e wa; personally discourteous to Bin Sand : he always refers to h m as His Fxcellency instead of as His Highness, and on receiving from him a letter couched in very friendly language and bearing the full title of King of the Hejaz, he sent a curt reply beginning “ 0 Excellency ’’!—a form of addfess which he would embroider if he were writing, e.g., to his own Director of Customs. He openly claimed that the first step towards peace in Arabia was the restoration of pre-war boundaries. This war to apply to all Arab rulers in the peninsula except himself: he by no means desired to be limited, as before the war, to the town of Mecca, but B n Sand was to give up his conquests, and the houses of Bin Rashid at Hail, and of A1 Aidh, at Ibha, were to be re-established (this programme he published in his own newspaper only a few months ago). He constant y des cribed himself as ‘ k King of the Arab Lands,” as though he were the only King. And finally he took the title of Caliph. This last step gave Bin Saud an oppor tunity, which he quickly seized, to win the support of some of the Indian Caliphate leaders. The “ Bombay Chronicle ” has been printing letters from him for some months, and describing him in articles as the man who really has Arab unity, the liberation of Arabia from European domination, and Muslim interests in general, at heart. On the other hand by his Caliphate policy and his treatment of pilgrims King Hussein has alienated all the important Muhammadan communities except those of Syria, Palestine and Iraq, whose adherence is due partly to racial but mainly to political considerations. Being disappointed in his hope that His Majesty's Government would intervene to save him from Bin Saud, he would have been in a desperate situation if the Wahabis had not put themselves in the wrong by the excesses committed at Taif. The King at once telegraphed a protest all over the world, obtaining afterwards the signatures of the people whose names he had affixed to the telegrams. Copies of the telegrams were sent to the foreign consuls in Jeddah, and we thought it necessary to send a reply saying that although our governments must naturally be greatly distressed to hear of hostilities in the holy land of Islam, any foreign intervention was absolutely precluded by their well known principles and would moreover be displeasing to the Muhammadan world. The telegram also gave us a useful opportunity to discourage people who have long lost their foreign nationality—sometimes for generations—but were expecting us to help them, by saying flatly that the figure of 20,000 foreigners mentioned in their telegram was grossly exaggerated, and to inform rea. nationals of our respective governments in Mecca that if they applied to us they would be afforded such protection as was possible and as the circum stances warranted. The reply to this, couched in King Hussein’s well known style, was to this effect: Heaven forbid that European powers should establish anything in the nature of a protectorate over the Hejaz ; but what about the Koweit Conference, which was held under the presidency of a British official \ This naive appeal having had no effect King Hussein was thrown on his own resources. He recovered a little from the panic of the first moment, when a few Wahabis could have walked into Mecca to the applause of the population, and began to try to win support for a policy of resistance—a policy which the Wahabis’ conduct did some thing to advance. Two of his steamers are under orders to be ready to leave at 12 hours’ notice, and a quantity of specie has been put on board one of them (the yacht), but he remains at his post in Mecca, and at the present moment his army, such as it is, is moving towards Taif. 15. Whatever happens the prospect is gloomy. If King Hussein retakes Taif he will be even more obstinate and vainglorious than before. His people, who ventured to show their hostility to him when Taif was first captured, will feel the weight of his anger, and both they and the pilgrims will be bled even more than before to produce money for defence ; and he is likely to be particularly hostile to British interests, in revenge for the disappointment of his hopes that they would7 support him against Bin Baud. And all the time there will be the menace of another attack from the desert. Jf the Wahabis should take Mecca there would be the immediate difficu ties resulting from the flight of large numbers of refugees of all kinds to the coast and from the t3mporary paralysis of administration in Jeddah, and the longer-lived complications arising from the difference between the tenets of the Wahabis and those of the bulk of the pilgrims. If things remain as they are, with Taif part of Hejd and Mecca part of the Hejaz, the present state of ins tability may be prolonged indefinitely. The Wahabis would be within sinking distance of the place of pilgrimage at Arafat, and of the source of the famous Ain Zubaidah, near by, which is essential to Mecca when the town is full of pilgrims.

As well as correspondence, the file contains a number of detailed accounts of these events that were written by the British Agent in Jeddah, Reader William Bullard.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials, but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence from Ibn Sa'ud and officials of the Government of Hejaz.
