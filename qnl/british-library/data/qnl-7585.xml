The following has been prepared to serve as an index to sheets 2.C., 2.D., 2.G., 2.H., 2.K., 2 L., 2.0., 2.P., 3.A., 3 E., 3.1., 3.J., 3.M., 3.N. 10.A., 10.B. and 10.0., of the 1 inch to 4 miles degree sheets prepared by the Survey of India. As issued, degree sheets, with the exception of No. 2.O., are divided into 15 minute rectangles, which are lettered A, B, 0 and I) from left to right, and numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 from top to bottom. (a) To describe the position of a place marked on a degree sheet, the number and letter of the sheet (as given on the right hand top corner of the map) are first given, then the letter of the 15 minute rectangle (read on the top or bottom edge of the map) and then the number of the 15 minute rectangle (read on the left or right edge of the map). (b) To describe the position of a point marked on the degree sheet, it is assumed that each 15 minute rectangle is furthei divided into ten decimal divisions of latitude and ten of longitude and, after describing the 15 minute rectangle as above, the decimal rectangle containing the point is described in a similar manner, namely by first giving the number counting from the left edge of the 15 minute rectangle, and then number counting from the top edge of the 15 minute rectangle. 2° In this index the spelling of names given on the degree sheets has been retained whenever possible, and in those cases in which it has been found necessary to depart from it, the degree sheet spelling is given m brackets after the name. The stances. (a) decree sheet spelling has been departed from in the following in' When more than one spelling is given on degree sheets for the same Arabn? word, in which case all such names are arranged alpha betically under one spelling, and cross references given under the others, e.g., the word is severally represented on the degree sheets under no less than nine different spel i-ngs ^^., Cal at “ Kaalat,” “ Kali.” “ Kalaat,” K^at,’ “ Ka eh Met ' Qal’at ” and “ Qaleh, ” and the spelling Kala (or Kalat before the artiele) has been adopted for the alphabetical list, not as bein*- the most correct, but as that most commonly employed and as giving the pronunciation sufficiently clearly for practical purposes. (6) When the spelling given on the degree sheet is calculated to lead to wrong pronunciation, e.g., “ Nahr al-Rubat, foi i ahi-ar- Itubat, ’* of which the former would almost certainly be mis pronounced by anyone not knowing Arabic. 3. The methods of transliteration employed on the degree sheets are so varied that it is impossible to lay down any clear guide to the correct pronuncia tion, but the following points may he of assistance : (a) The L ” of the Arabic article fixed to a word beginning with i al ” (“ el ” or “ ul ”) when pre- &lt; D,” “ DH,” “ N,” “ R, ” “ S,” *‘811 ” “ T ” “ TH ” or “ Z ” assimilates the sound of the initial letter of the word to which it is prefixed. “ Dll ” represents three different letters in Arabic, but the sound of the English “ TH,” as in “ mother ” is sufficiently near for practical purposes. (c) “ TH ” is pronounced like “ TH ” in the English word “ thin. ” (d) The letter Q (Q or K) is commonly pronounced as “ bv the local Arabs, but sometimes as J, and the letter (K) is often given the sound «• CH. ” as m ' church, consequently variations in the spelling of names in reports may be expected, according to the idiosyncrasy of the particular informer. 7UGSBGLOSSARY OF TERMS: BY MAJOR C.
