At the Court at Buckingham Palace the 27 th day of November, 1939- Present, The King’s Most Excellent Majesty in Council. Whereas His Majesty has been compelled to take up arms against Germany in defence of the fundamental right of nations to a free and peaceful existence: And whereas German forces have in numerous cases sunk merchant vessels, British, Allied and neutral, in violation of the rules contained in the Submarine Protocol, 1936 , to which Germany is a party: And whereas merchant vessels, British, Allied and neutral, have been sunk by mines laid by German forces indiscriminately and without notification, in contravention of the obligations of humanity and the provisions of the Hague Convention No. VIII of 1907 to which Germany is a party: And whereas the sinking of these vessels has been effected without regard to their nationality or destination or to the nature, ownership or destination of their cargoes: And whereas these acts have already resulted in grave loss of non-combatant life, British, Allied and neutral: And whereas it is manifest that the German Government have deliberately embarked on a policy of endeavouring to destroy all seaborne trade between the Allied and other countries by a ruthless use of the forces at their disposal, contrary to the laws and customs of war, the rights of neutrals and the obliga tions of humanity: And whereas this action on the part of the German Govern ment gives to His Majesty an unquestionable right of retaliation: And whereas the Allies of His Majesty are associated with Him in the steps now to be announced for restricting further the commerce of Germany: ccr £f DEC of H AIL' J iu i ^ .

Sir 7 I an directed by the Secretary of State to refer to the correspondence resting with the Governor- General’s telegram No. 1853 P. of 7th September regarding prize jurisdiction in Indian States and to say that, after consultation with other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, the Secretary of State has decided not to take any steps, at any rate for the present, to confer upon High Courts in British India jurisdiction in matters of prise in respect of the Indian States. 2. The Secretary of State would therefore be glad if, in the case of any prise captured in an Indian State or brought into a port in an Indian State, the following procedure could be adopted. (it will be noted that this procedure is substantially the same as that suggested in paragraph 6 of Mr. atrick's demi-official letter to Sir C. Latimer, No. P.Y.1785/39 of 11th July, with such modifications as are now permissible under the amendment of the Prize Rules, the contemplation of which was mentioned in that letter. ) As soon as a capture of a prize is made, the captor will report by telegram direct to the Admiralty The Secretary to His Excellency the Crown Representative, Political Department. Marshal/4./ Marshal (telegraphic address - ^dnarsh London) the fact that the prize has 'been captured, particulars thereof, and that the prize is being held subject to his instructions. At the same time a telegram should be sent direct to the Procurator-General (telegraphic address - Proctorex nondon), seating that the prize has been captured, giving particulars thereof, and requesting that proceedings be immediately begun in London and remitted to the Court in British India (stating the Court). Thereupon the Procurator-General will apply for the necessary order and notify the captor by telegram v/hen this has been obtained. T he affidavit as to ship papers should be sworn as provided in Order IV, Pule 1, of the new Prize Court Pules, but the filing of the affidavit should be delayed until notification has been received from the Procurator-General that the proceedings have been remitted. Ghen making application for the order for remission, the Procurator-General will apply for an extension of time, for ten days from the date of the order, for the filing of the affidavit as to ship papers, and will state in his telegram whether, and for how long, the time has been extended. Upon the receipt of the Procurator—General T s notification, the affidavit will be filed in the Begistry of the Court to which the proceedings have been remitted. Thereafter the prize will be held to the order of the Marshal of the C 'urt to which the proceedings have been remitted, and the captor will proceed in all respects as if the proceedings had been commenced in that Court.4. As regards the appointment of Detaining Officers, there is no objection to these being State officers appointed by the States themselves, provided that the officers thus appointed understand their duties and are prepared and are in a position to act on the instructions laid down, and to obey the orders of the High Court of Admiralty in London, or of any Prize Court in India to which proceedings in any case might be remitted under the Prize Courts Act, 191C.

For convenience of reference I enclose a copy of Political Department letter of the 15th December 1938, and of India Office letter No. P.Y. 1785/39, of the 11th July (excluding the draft Bill). 2. As regards the Persian Gulf States it may be that in time of war there would seldom be any occasion in these territories for seeking the condemnation as prize of captured enemy aircraft or shipping, but in case any such occasion should arise it may be worth while to give some consideration to the twofold question (a) whether the Grown has the right to exercise prize jurisdiction in the Gulf States, and (b) if so, what procedure would govern its Major W.Hay, C.I.E., exercise/ External Affairs Department. Government of India.i V *\ exercise. 3. If the right to exercise prize jurisdiction were dependent on the formal cession of such jurisdiction hy the Rulers of the Gulf States it is doubtful whether a claim to such a right could he sustained. But from the examination referred to above of the case of the Indian States it appears that formal cession of prize jurisdiction is not the only criterion, and that an important consideration must be the relationship between His Majesty's Government and the non-British territory in which it might be desired to exercise the jurisdiction. The position of the Gulf States in time of war was discussed in paragraph 5 of the Political Resident’s express letter of the 28th April, N0.419-S ( on the subject of special measures in the Persian Gulf on the outbreak of war) in which he referred to the view expressed by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office that in the event of war Koweit, Bahrein, the Trucial States (and Qatar) would automatically be at war on the side of Great Britain. Assuming that this is the position, there would seem, in the light of paragraph 4 of India Office letter of the 11th July, to be no doubt that in time of war the Crov/n could exercise prize jurisdiction in relation to those States. Muscat is, however, in any case in a different position and, whatever the arrangements that/ v3 . ( VOOi’n alneo** ' 11 ’ .) ft. ?££*« t.iat might ho mado v/ith the Sultan later on, there would appear, if war should occur now, to he no justification ior claiming the right to exercise prize jurisdiction in relation to Muscat. 4. On the assumption that prize jurisdiction could he exercised in relation to the Gulf States (not including Muscat) it is presumed that Detaining Officers (who would prohahly he the Political Agents) would, if it should seem necessary, he appointed hy some authority in India at Koweit and Bahrein, and that, pending any action that might he taken oy legislation or Order in Council for the extension of the jurisdiction of an Indian Prize Court to the Persian Gulf, the procedure to he followed hy them would he on the lines indicated in paragraph 6 of India Office letter of the 11th July. 3. i/e should ho glad if the Government of India T s views on the matter generally and on the fore-going paragraphs could do corvid, icuusd to us as soon f s possible. 6.

Reference India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.1698/39, dated the 30th March 1939? with enclosures, on the subject of special measures ■which it ’would b© desirable for His Majesty's Government to take on the outbreak of war with a u-reat Power, in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Turkey and Iran. I am of course only interested in so far as these special measures affect the Gulf. 2. Turkey;. No measures in that country will affect the Gulf and I have no comments to offer. 3* (1) Saudi ^rabia . (a) Hasa oil field (paragraphs 3 , 5 and 15(5) of Minister Jedda’s letter of 7th July 1938? No. 141 to the Foreign Office, and paragraph 8 of Foreign Office reply No. 75 of K 17th March 1939). This oil field is of course outside my sphere but it lies on the shores of the Persian Gulf, so I venture to give some comments. while it is true, as the Foreign Office point out, that it is unlikely that the working 01 the Kasa oil field would be disturbed fey/ X M.H.(O) 294 appendix E.4 2 . by military operations? X supuoso that it is possible that some of the present markets for oil produced in that field will be rendered inaccessible. In this case the California Arabian Standard Oil Company would be only too anxious to sell to His Majesty's Government. Every ton of oil will of course be of importance to us during war, and the supplies from this part of the world may be considerably lessened if they are stopped or reduced in cuantity from Persia (abadan) or Iraq, (see paragraph 3 of Minister Tehran's letter No. 305 of 31st August 1938 to the Foreign Office, and paragraph 3 of Foreign Office despatch No. 150 of 1?th March 1939 to Bagdad). Please see also my letters No. 562-3 of 5 th November 1938 and No. 214-3 of 20th xuarch 1939 to the India Office asking whether it would be worth while considering the possibility of His Majesty's Government obtaining some sort of pre-emption over Hasa oil in case of emergency. (b) political Officer for Riyadh (paragraph 14 of Jedda letter of 7 th July 1938 , No. 141, to the Foreign On ice, and paragraph 6 of Foreign Office reply No. 75 of 1 7 th March 1939?. It would be important from the Resident's point of view as well as that of Minister, Jedda, to be kept in touch with what is going on in caudi Arabia, and this suggestion for a British officer to be sent to Riyadh seems to me an excellent one. 'Jith regard to who this officer should be, I suggest that if war should come during tns next 8 months or so, it might well be de Gaury. He/ K.E.(c) 294 Appendix E.3 . (2)/ He is leaving Kuwait on long leave in the middle of May and will he replaced by Galloway. S£&gt; he would he free for tris purpose. He knows Arabic extremely well, was attached to the Legation at Jedda in 1935, accompanied Sir Andrew Ryan on his mission to Ibn Saud at Riyadh in November 1935, and is I believe persona ^ith the King. \Vhile at Riyadh de Gaury would of course work under the orders of the Minister at Jedda. ilv-ij-.*- ihis town in Northern Saudi territory is not mentioned by Minister, Jedda, and indeed so long as Ibn oaud. is alive and retains his grip on his country it is not of much importance. In the case, however, of his death or his decline in power then this area, which is the old centre of the ^1 Rashid dynasty, should be of importance. A glance at the map will snow that if Hail is held strongly no force can raid irom Southern Nejd either towards Iraq or Trans-Jordan. In the prewar days the Turks were fully aware of this and kept their territories in Mesopotamia, as Iraq was chen, and in Palestine, safe from the Y/ahabi raids by allying themselves with the *1 Rashid, who were inveterate ermies of the I/ahabis. Circumstances might arise in which it might be of advantage to us to assist the Rashid and to keep in touch with them by sending an officer to Hail. I do not think that it is likely that this contingency will arise, but I take this opportunity of mentioning it as contingencies are better envisaged before war breaks out than afterwards.4 . (2) .Iraq. The establishment of an Iraqi port in the bay of Kuwait (vide paragraph 6(1) of Ambassador Bagdad's letter No. 329 of 18th July 1938 to the Foreign Office, and paragraph 6(1) of Foreign Office reply No. 130 of 1?th March 1939^* This proposal if carried out would have an important effect on Kuwait, and His Majesty's G-overnment could not cf course implement this undertaking without the consent of the Shaikh of Kuwait. Provided sufficient safeguards could be arranged, I was not prima facie some time ago against this proposal (see my letter No. 278-3 of 24th May 1938 ). Since then however the Iraqis have shown increasing hostility to Kuwait and whether at any time we assisted the Iraqi G-overnment in this project would depend on their attitude at that time and on what safeguards they agree to with regard to its establishment. (3) Iran. (a) Persian grievances against us in the Gulf, 1 (paragraph 5 of Minister, Tehran's letter of 31 st august 1^38, No. 305 to the Foreign Office, and paragraph 3 of Foreign Office reply No. 81 of 17 th March 1939). I agree with Minister, Tehran, that we should avoid taking any steps which the Persian Government might consider inimical to their nationals m Bahrain. I do not think that this will offer any difficulties.. The last complaint of the Persian Government was in regard to the expulsion of Persian indigents from Bahrain (vide Tehran telegram No. 87 , dated the 2nd July 1938, to the Foreign Office, and connected correspondence). The majority of the indigents have now been removed and in case of war the King’s Regulation under which such action is taken need not be enforced. xM.E.(o) 29-4 Appendix C / M.E. (0) 294 Appendix B.4 4 4 C. 5 . (b) Transfer of the Residency (paragraph 3 of Foreign Office letter No. 81 of 17th March)'. It is not the transfer of the Residency which is required but the transfer of the Resident This point was fully dealt with in my letter No. 566-3 of 7th November 1938 and my proposal has since been approved of by higher authorities - vide correspondence ending with India Office letter No. 1239/39 of 3rd March 1939 to the Foreign Office. (c) I quite agree with the views of Minister, Tehran, as expressed in paragraph 6 of his letter as to the importance of our control of the Persian Gulf in its effect on Iranian neutrality. 4. Special measures in .-ersian G u lf ,-irab States . The special measures suggested in the countries dealt with above fall under the following general heads: (a) Subsidies. (b) ^revision of arms. (c) Publicity. (d) Compensation for losses consequent on war and other forms of commercial assistance. (e) Officers on special duty. I propose to make my suggestions under the same general heads. 5* In.regard to (a) . (1) The States of Kuwait, Bahrain and those on the Trucial Coast will automatically be at war on the side of Great Britain (vide paragraph 3 of Mr. hgcxett’s minute enclosed with Foreign Office letter No. E .6367 G, dated the 10th November 1537? to the India Office) and these states’'will not rebpiire subsidies to be won over to our side. The Resident’s M- £ (0) 294 Appendix B. financial/6 • financial requirements for Special Intelligence and other payments have been met by the provision of a sum of £ 4000 /- to be supplemented as necessary (vide correspondence ending with India Office letter No. P. 1.1132/39? dated the 28 th February 1939? to the Government of India). (2) Muscat, however, vide paragraph 4 of Beckett’s minute quoted above, as a sovereign State is in a different category. In regard to its position in war please see my letter No. C/122 of the 1st March 1939 (sent to you and the Government of India under Printed Letter No. 0/123 of same date). Prom paragraph 3 of this letter it will be seen that the Saltan before engaging himself on our side would require from His Majesty’s Government a definite guarantee of defence. Although, as explained in my letter quoted dbove, we could use the Sultan’s territory even though he remained neutral it would nevertheless be an advantage if he were formally on our side, for example? in dealing 'With enemy Agents (and in this connection it must be remembered that all foreigners except British subjects and British protected persons are under the jurisdiction of the Sultan), and in seizing enemy merchant shipping, if any such took refuge in Muscat waters, especially in the harbours of Muscat and Mattrah. There may be objections against giving the Sultan the guarantee he asks for. In this case an alternative inducement to declare himself formally on our side might take the form of a monthly subsidy for the duration of the war 1 I would suggest a sum of Rs. 10,000 (about £&amp;~J0/-) a month. In arriving at this/( 4 )/ this sura I have had in mind that the Sultan has 'been accustomed until lately to receiving an Arms Traffic subsidy of Rs. 100,000 a year. In regard to (b) . (1) The Defence Scheme for Kuwait prepared by the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, does not provide for the supply of arms to the Shaikh. (The store of arms mentioned in paragraph 28 of the Scheme is not for the Shaikh but for the use of the British and American personnel of the Kuwait Oil Company. These arms will presumably be provided by Kis Majesty’s Government.) (2) Paragraph 16 of the Defence Scheme for Bahrain recommends that the Bahrain police be equipped with 12 Bren Guns and that the reserve of small arms ammunition should be increased from 400,000 to 1,000,000 rounds. It is understood however that the Bahrain Government is quite willing to pay for these. (The arms mentioned in paragraph 14 of the Defence Scheme are for the proposed Local Defence Force of personnel of the Oil Company, and will presumably be supplied by His Majesty’s Government.) No question therefore arises of His Majesty’s Government presenting the Shaikh with arms but I strongly recommend that the Bren Guns and the ammunition be supplied to the Bahrain Government on as easy terms as possible. (3) Paragraph 18 of the Defence Scheme for Qatar suggests that the Shaikh should be encouraged to buy certain arms and Ford trucks. Here again I recommend strongly that the arms required be provided on easy terms.8 (4) The Defence Scheme for Shari not recommend that the Shaikhs of the any arms. further I do not think it as can be judged at present, that any Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast need be or ammunition. ah and Dibai does se States be given necessary, so far of the other provided 'ith arms (5) Paragraph 19 of the Defence Scheme for duscat recommends that certain arms and ammunition be presented nov T to the Sultan. In vie'.' of the comparative poverty of the State I endorse this recommendation irrespective of vhat his formal attitude may be in the event of uar (see my ps_ a graph 5 (2) a i'Ove) . The the r he is an ally or neutral it is to our advantage for the Sultan to be in a position to preserve order and suppress enemy activities. 7. I n regard to (c) . There mill be no necessity for a special Press Attache as st Tehran, and the I.b.C.Arabic broadcast service is already functioning most satisfactorily. it will however be necessary in time of mar to supplement these broadcasts by the distribution of news sheets and so forth. In re g ard to (d) . It is impossiole to foresee what the losses to the Arab States might be under this head, or what form their requests for special assistance may take, but in case of necessity I trust that His majesty's Government and the Government of India will be able to give a sympathetic hearing to requests which are made. 9. I n regard to (e) . (l) Though in time of peace I am not of opinion that a Political Officer is required for theTrucial Coast, in time of v/ar I think that one v/ill certainly he required there, and it v/ill he impossible under war conditions to spare for this purpose the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, who will he fully employed locally. I suggest that liov/es, v/ho knows Arabic well, and v/ho has had previous experience of that part of the Gulf should he detailed for this post with allowances similar to that of the Assistant Political ~gent, Bahrain, He is proceeding on long leave Home in June and so would he available for some 8 months after that. (2) In connection with the publicity measures suggested in paragraph 7 above the Resident will require an increase in his vernacular staff since the existing staff will have as much work as they can cope with. I am of opinion that up to three extra interpreters will he needed for the duration of the war. They would have to he well qualified men, and as they can be offered only temporary employment the terms would have to he attractive. I suggest that their pay and allowances he that of the Special Grade of the vernacular section of the Residency establishment, i.e. Pay Rs.250-10-800 per mensem. Special Pay w 50 u House Rent w 40 (3) In addition to strengthening the Resident’s vernacular staff an increase in the English section of his staff would probably he necessary as a temporary measure for the duration of the war. for this purpose I suggest the employment of two Upper Division and one Lower Division clerk, pay and allowances respectively as follows:U pper Division . Lov/.cr Divi a j-Ofi . Pay per mensem Rs•120-6-150-10-250 Rs.100-4-120-200 Special pay t; 35 ' 30 House Rent tf 30 ' 20 (4) To save valuable time on the outbreak of war, should this occur, I would be grateful if the Government of India would accord their sanction now to the employment of the additional staff mentioned in (l), (2) and (3) above. It is needless to say that due economy v/ill be exercised and that the additional staff will not be employed unless this is found essential. To sum up. In paragraphs 1 to 3 I have made my comments on the effect in the Persian Gulf of the special measures proposed to be taken in other countries adjoining it. In paragraph 3 (l) (a) I made certain suggestions as to the Hasa oil field and in paragraph 3 (l) (b) I have suggested Captain de Gaury for special duty at Riyadh. In paragraph 3 (l)(c) I touched on the possible importance of Hail in certain contingencies. In paragraph 3 (2) I have given my views as to the possible promise by His Majesty’s Government to Iraq of an Iraqi port in Kuwait, and in paragraph 3 (3) I have made certain comments on suggestions made by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. In paragraphs 4 to 9 I have dealt with special measures required in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. In paragraph 5 I dealt with the question of subsidies and indicated that only in one case, i.e. that of Muscat, need a subsidy be considered. My paragraph 6 dealt with the provision of arms. Ho arms are required for Kuwait; at Bahrain the arms which are required, which the Shaikh is4 11 . prepared to purchase himself should, I recommend, he provided on easy terms; and at muscat the Sultan, I suggest, should he presented with certain arms hy Kis Majesty’s Government. My paragraph 7 covered Publicity, and my pa: agraph 8 compensation to Rulers for losses occasioned hy war. finally in my paragraph 9 I made certain suggestions as to an increase in the Resident’s staff and suggested that in order to save time in case the emergency arose, sanction should now he given for this increase. sd. T.G.Powle. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Attested, sd. J. ^roning. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, P.Y. 1785/39 SECKET LONDON, S.W.l. 11th July, 1939 Prize Jurisdiction in Indian States. Will you please refer to the Political Department official letter No.D.7(C)-I.3./38 of 15th December 1938 on the above subject and to the correspondence between the India Office and the Admiralty a copy of which was forwarded to the Political Department under India Office No. P.Y. 642/39 by the mails of 7th and 9th March. It has been decided to introduce in Parliament, when Parliamentary time permits, a Bill amending the law of prize in certain particulars. A copy of the draft of this Bill is enclosed herewith. One of its objects is to ex bend the law relating to prize so as to cover aircraft as well as ships. Consequently the difficulties referred to in your letter under reference would apply not only to maritime States but also to inland States, particularly those through whose territories trans-India air routes run. A further object of the Bill is to extend/ ir C.Latimer, KCIE.,CSI.,ICS., Political Department, Simla.®&gt; 2 . extend the power to issue dormant warrants in peace time to Prize Courts (at present exercisable only in relation to British possessions) so as to apply to British protectorates, mandated territories and 'any other country or territory in v/hich for the time being His Majesty has jurisdiction in matters of prize'. with reference to this last phrase (which is intended to include Indian States) and in connection more particularly with a suggestion made here that instead of commissioning prize Courts in the territories of the Indian States, the prize jurisdiction of British Indian Courts might be extended by Order in Council under Section 9 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act so as to include those territories, the Foreign Office have raised a point which they rightly regard as of fundamental importance. They ask whether it can properly be said that his Majesty now possesses jurisdiction in matters of prize in Indian States, pointing out that the only jurisdiction which His Majesty can exercise in non- British territory is that which He has received by treaty, grant, usage, sufferance or other lav/ful means and that he cannot acquire jurisdiction either by the issue of Orders in Council or by Acts of Parliament. His Majesty, it/4. ■belligerent power over the territory in question. Applying this principle to the case of the Indian States? there would appear to he no question that, whatever varying degrees of internal sovereignty Rulers of Indian States may possess, they are, as far as their external relations and all matters of peace and war are concerned, entirely under the control of the Paramount Power. It is assumed therefore that the Indian States would automatically he committed to any war in v/hich the Paramount Power might hecome engaged, and that their territory could? and if necessary would, he used hy the Paramount Pov/er for the purposes of any such war. If that is in fact the position? it seems doubtful whether anything further is required for the purpose of enabling the Paramount Power to exercise prize jurisdiction in the territory of the States; to commit, in other words? against the common enemy the further hostile act consisting of the judicial confirmation of the validity of captures made de jure belli If so, any permission or authority sought to he obtained from the States would in the circumstances he unnecessary and would tend to suggest that the States would in case of war occupy a position of independence that is far from/5 . from the truth* 5. The Secretary of State is disposed to accept this advice, but, before informing other departments of His Majesty’s Government that this is held to be the position in regard to Indian States, he would be glad to know whether the Grown Representative is satisfied that there would be no difficulty in maintaining the position and, if so, and indeed in any event, whether he would deem it advisable that any communication in the matter should be addressed to the States* It will, of course, be appreciated in this connection that there may arise cases of enemy vessels or aircraft being seized in or brought to the sea or air ports of an Indian State by the officers and forces of the State concerned. iue Secretary of State is, however, advised that, having regard to the position of the Indian States, the vessels and aircraft so captured would stand on no different footing from those seized by His Majesty’s Forces and officers, and that the British prize Courts would be fully competent to assume jurisdiction and condemn them as droits of the Crown or of Admiralty according to the circumstances. 6./6 c. 6. As regards the specific questions raised in your letter under reference, it is suggested that, subject to the disposal of the point discussed in paragraphs 3 to 5 above and to any legislation passed or Order in Council made on the basis of the view therein expressed as to the true position of the States, any prizes seized in or brought to the port of an Indian State should be reported by telegram by the Detaining Officer direct to the Admiralty Marshal of the High Court in London, v/hose telegraphic address is 'Admarsh, London”. Such prizes should not be moved except under instructions from the Marshal of the Court. Pending an amendment of the Prize Court Rules 1914 which it is proposed to make w ith a view to simplifying the subsequent procedure in such cases, the affidavit as to ships* papers should be sworn in accordance with Order IV of the Prize Court Rules and forwarded, together with the ships 1 papers if any, direct to the Procurator-General, Storey*s Gate, London, S.W.l, with a request that he will commence proceedings in London and apply for an Order remitting them to the required Prize Court in India, under the Prize Courts Act, ISlo. In this connection the Secretary of State is advised that/7. thc ' lt 30ct i° n 1(2) of that Act does not require, as seems oo he implied in the last sentence of paragraph 2 of your letter, that if this procedure is adopted the prize should he brought physically within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court to which proceedings are remitted. If it is apprehended that the procedure suggested in paragraph 6 above would for any reason he likely to prove inconvenient, as to which the views of His Excellency the Crown Representative are desired, the oecretary of State would he prepared to examine further the possibility of conferring upon the British Indian High Courts which are prize Courts in India jurisdiction in matters of prize in respect of Indian States, and will he glad to know as soon as possible if this course is considered preferable. It is in view of the complicated nature of prize law and the difficulty of the legal points which might arise that it seems appropriate to extend the prize jurisdiction already conferred upon British Indian High Courts rather than to confer jurisdiction upon Residents. Y/hether legislation will he necessary for this purpose or an Order in Council of the nature suggested in the beginning of paragraph 3 above will be sufficient, is a question/I 8 . question which would require further consideration and the answer to which depends to a great extent on the correct appreciation of the position of the Indian States. 8. The Secretary of State would also he glad to know what general arrangements the Crown Representative suggests for the appointment of Detaining Officers in States. There v/ould seem to he advantage in such officers being, wherever possible, political officers or persons directly responsible to political officers. , fSd.) P. J.
