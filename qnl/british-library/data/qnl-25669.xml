A 'tf. ^ | Secret. Bushire Shiraz trade route. In continuation of my telegram of to-day. Following are our views. We agree with Cox that Bushire situation is most unsatisfactory. We have artrrady considered conclusive military operations best solution if practicable. But apart from landing difficulties which would hang up tonnage unduly prolonged, and transport difficulties, force required is not available or likely id be available in the near future and we take it that His Majesty’s Government would hesitate in view of general war weariness to authorise a south Persian expedition when the war is ending or ended. Thus there is no practical prospect either now or in the future of dealing ourselves with idle situation by conclusive military operations. ( Alternative proposed by Cox that Darya Begi should be assisted to take action against hostile Khans does not inspire confidence in view of his recent operations assisted by South Persia Rifles at Minafa. We might however assist with some guns and machine guns with necessary personnel from Bushire garrison. But we would urge that a condition precedent to any such action should be a definite request from Persian Government for our aid. Even so we should acquiesce with utmost reluctance in view of risk of loss of equipment and men and of still further ji u disturbing hinterland be| a reverse. As regards proposed subventions through Farman Farma we understand from Foreign Office telegram dated 15th November that His Majesty's Government are now awerafifrom this proposal. This scheme appears to us an inconclusive half measure little calculated to improve situation but it seems better than j, assisting Darya Begi with material. In the circumstances unless His Majesty’s Governmentgeneral settlement with hostile Khans conveyedpn ycmr telegram of the 8th December 1916, there would appear nothing for it but to continue our present inactivity fraught though it is with inconvenience and discredit to ourselves and difficulty to friendly Governor Darya Begi« Trevor has unfortunately been invalided home and a new officer, probably Bill, will replace him* Should His Majesty’s Government therefore be prepared to reconsider matter there will be no,personal difficulty in the way of inaugurating of a change of policy* Addressed to Secretary of State repeated to Tehran*TELEGRAM PROM VICEROY 21st November 1917 j- Received 22nd November 10*30 a.m. I Secret.

I think the letter to Wassmuss was probably instigated by Soulet, who, as I have reported previously, has never entirely ceased correspondence with the Germans and who helped Bruggmann and the other two Germans to reach Ahram. In view of Wassmuss’ behaviour during the past 21 years, I think that we ought to oppose any proposal by the Persian Government to grant him a safe conduct back to Germany. The other three individuals, Bruggmann, Oertel and Dettmar, are not of much consequence as they are comparatively harmless.

Acting Governor-General tells me that he and Soulet have sent a messenger on behalf of both of them to Zair Khidkar and also one to Wassmuss. To the former they say “We are now one, come over to our side and give as assurances that caravans and posts going through your district will not be molested” His Highness says if Zair Khidhar gives his (word) (it may be) relied on (this is part of scheme which Governor-General and Soulet are concocting to make the main thoroughfare to Bushire ma Firuzabad, Earrashband and Ahram).

Nothing short of severe punishment will eradicate this habit now in my opinion. I do not think assurances from Zair Khidhar of the slightest^ value. The prisoners who were in his charge at Abram said one of their principal difficulties was his instability : they never knew what his attitude would be from one moment to another. We know here the value of his promises. If overtures are really preliminary to a recommendation for forgiveness to Zair Khidhar, I venture to observe (without recapitulating his offences which are well-known) that— (1) his punishment was one of the conditions for which we occupied Bush ire, and as far as I know we have never withdrawn our demand ; (2) he has been technically removed from his Khanate and outlawed by Persian Government at our request. (When Barman Parma was Prime Minister and M inister of Interior) ; (3) he is so tyrannical that he has alienated a large portion of Tangistan which is now actively hostile to him and would I think, join the Government forces if Darya Begi made a moVe against him. Por the above reasons I strongly deprecate any overtures to Zair Khidhar whose removal and punishment should, in my opinion, be a preliminary to the opening of any route to Shiraz. ^ In view of Wassmuss’ history for past 2} years, it would sepm hardly a friendly net on the part of the Governor-General and Soulet to offer him safe conduct back to Germany. The other three Germans are comparatively harmless. 1 J Addressed Tehram ; repeated Shiraz. Enclosure No. 7. Telegram R,, No. 925, dated the 10th (received 11th) August 1917.

Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Shiraz, has not had time to report the result of his interview with the Governor-General2. Sir Charles Marling has given his views on the subject clearly in his telegram, and I have replied in detail, so it is unnecessary to make any further comment. I need only add that the Governor-General’s move seems to me to be a preliminary to a suggestion for pardon to Zair Khidhar. Sir Charles Marling is evidently loath to grant this, and personally I strongly deprecate doing so. Zair Khidhar is not only one of the ringleaders in the attacks on Eushire, but detained the Shiraz Colony for 10 months at Ahram, and since the prisoners were exchanged, has openly flouted, insulted and thwarted the Governor of the Gulf Ports in every possible way. If we can forgive his conduct, the Khans of these parts will naturally assume that we can forgive anything, and will think that they can do what they like with impunity. In addition if all the rebellious Khans are forgiven and reinstated, the Khans who have remained loyal to the Persian Government and friendly to us will naturally be alienated. Enclosure No. 1.

Your recent telegrams. I do not quite appreciate object of Governor-General’s proposals. ^ At present I understand caravans are using both routes though neither is officially open or can be used as a line of communication for South Persia Kifles. . Governor-General seems to propose official opening of both which in my opinion is unnecessary as involving double expense and pardon to all hostile Khans. I think we should concentrate on one or the other. His Highness appears to have a preference for the Piruzabad route presumably °to please Soulet; does he suggest this should be permanently, adopted and other route definitely abandoned. There are very obvious objections to this, e.g., telegraph line will not he restored that it gives Soulet too much power and that when eventually South Persia Rifles are^ahle to take it over there may be friction with him and that it involves making terms with Zair Khidhar who of all hostile Khans is the most difficult to pardon. In its favour is that it is easier than Kazerun proposition (opening off which is, it seems for the present, delayed by unexpected inability of South Persia Rifles to take over road even as far as Kazerun. Still I dislike abandoning scheme for which agreement with Soulet was chiefly made. Please talk his proposals over with Governor-General and Sykes hearing also in mind observations from Bushire and let me know result.

Ibis means that 1’iruzabad route is taking roughly about | ot traffic.Owing to dearth of mules on Kazerun road number of which has dwindled to barely 1,000 (and of these many are often under contract to South Persia Bifles), whole traffic cannot go by that route. Similarly transport on Piruzabad route is not sufficient for entire traffic to go that way all the year round. This economic factor will probably necessitate use of both roads. In circumstances until South Persia Bifles are in position to take over one or other road it seems to me inadvisable to declare either road officially open. In my opinion it would be better to let traffic go on as at present. Soulet and Parman Parma must know that there is large amount of traffic on Piruzabad route already and that Zair Khidhar encourages it for the sake of the resulting profits from rahdari, except in cases when he wishes to get even with the Governor here. Agreement with him about road is therefore superflous unless it is forerunner of request for pardon or unless Soulet sees in official opening of the road opportunities for levying rahdari himself. If Parman Parma were reminded that regular payment of revenue of Tangistan 10,000 tomans yearly by Zair Khidhar must be one condition of any official arrangement with him about road and would write Zair Khidhar to this effect, latter would probably allow agreement to drop. In my opinion if and when the South Persia Bifles take over a road between Bushire and Shiraz, that road should be the “ Shahi ” road via Kazerun : this has always been considered the main route and has caravan serais and rest-houses. Later on if the survey which Government of India propose to make when conditions improve shows that Piruzabad or any other route is better for motor road or railway, everything—i. e., South Persia Bities, Telegraph line, rest-houses and caravanserais, &amp;c.—could be transferred to new route.

It will be seen that Mr. Bristow thinks that the proposals are the result of an arrangement made between the Parman Parma and Soulet at their recent meeting whereby the latter hopes to get as much profit out of us as possible. This, in my opinion, is highly probable, the attitude of all these Chiefs vis_-a-vis the British authorities being one of “ It’s your money we want 3.

I think there can be little doubt that Governor-General’s suggestions re opening Buskire road vid Eiruzabad and also up to Kazerun are part of a plan arranged at his meeting with Soulet whereby latter hopes to get as much profit out of us as possible. It seems to me (and Sykes agrees) that from our point of view there can be no question at present of opening either road officially : that vid Kazerun because South Persia Rifles are not yet prepared to take over Kazerun and even if they were it is only cul de sac until Bushire are able to open their end, and vid Eiruzabad owing to our relations with Zair Khidhar and presence of Wassmuss in those parts. On the other hand, is there any reason why Governor-General should not come to some arrangement with Zair Khidhar (leaving us out of the question altogether) if this would increase safety of caravans passing through ? Governor-General has not had any answer from Zair Khidhar yet and I have informed His Highness distinctly that any arrangement His Highness may make with him must be on the strict understanding that His Majesty’s Government is in no way involved. Sykes hopes to be able to have a survey made of Bushire roads in coming winter.

Commandant complains that this and similar attacks are alarming Persian officers of the South Persia Rifles and producing (bad! effect in general and asks whether any form of official statement recognizing status of force could be obtained from Persian Government with which he could meet (these) news paper attacks if it is not possible to prevent their publication. I suppose it is impossible to obtain anything from Persian Government as I gather it is little more friendly than the Press. I presume you have also seen newspaper “ Watan” of 27th Ramazan in which it is announced that British have been driven out of Baghdad by the Turks and also that a large British force has arrived at Kermanshah.

He said movement here was initiated by a telegram from Kaikhosro and that firms mentioned then obtained signature under pressure. All others alleged that there is actual cause for discontent in Ardeshirji’a want of effort on behalf of community, some complaining that it was due to this that Indian funds for Kerman were only 900 odd rupees against 10,000 obtained for ¥ezd. All alleged failure to take action on recommendation of local complaints emanating from Kerman. There were however no very definite complaints and no accusation of dishonesty. Sur(ush) and Kayanian are (among the) most influential and active members of the community here and I think tnere is probably some truth in accusation against them. Local Parsees are afraid to go counter to them so that it is impossible to ascertain real feeling of community unless it happens to coincide with theirs. Since they paid up their fine I have had no grounds of complaint against them and they are ostensibly friendly and have been useful to the Consulate.

(2) Translations of four documents comprised in item 12 of the same list. 2. As regards the latter, the list shows item 12 as comprising 5 docu ments’ but I have only four translations. To the best of my recollection however one of the five documents was an incomplete duplicate of another one. Thus of the report on the road from Ispahan to Tabbas, there was, I believe, one complete manuscript copy, and one incomplete typewritten copy. This would account for there being only four translations corresponding to five original documents. 3. I would take the opportunity of remarking that the translations of Osutora's’s Commission and of Bruggmann’s letter to Csutoras, dated 2Qtn April 1916, were made by myself, and that 1 do not profess to know German and hence cannot guarantee their accuracy. The remaining translations were made by Mr. A. E. Weth of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, and I had not time to check them completely before they were sent off. 4.

From Sagzi to Kupaych. —Road good in one straight line through plain. Distance supposed to be 7 farsakhs. The mules did it in hours, 0 therefore only 5 farsakhs. Lots of robbers in the district. Lately several attacks on post garis. We encountered no body. The town of K. is surrounded by a wall. Gates shut at night. Good caravanserai just before the town, supplies plentiful, water good.

We here get into touch with the important merchant Muhammed Reza Salek (for telegrams the last name is sufficient). His partner in Ispahan is Haji Muhamed Hussein, and the firm’s name is “ Compagnie Mazudieh . The man makes a- very good impression and is absolutely friendly to us. He will send our letters to his partner, who will himself carry them to tlm Consulate.

For 7 hours road leads through plain up to mountains, then along the latter. After 7 hours a hauz with drinkable rain water is reached, where we watered our horses. At an advanced time of the year water might dry up. From here another 2 farsakhs through the mountains to Anarek: rather big place, good caravanserai, supplies and fodder abundant. Barley cost here 14-15 tumans per 100 man ; we bought two more s&lt; mashks” here, as those bought from Ispahan are leaking and give a very bad taste to the water. 8th day. Anarek to Meshed D/mm.—Eight farsakhs = 8 hours. Road leads through mountains for 4 farsakhs, when it reaches a hauz with good water; a ruined house is near by. Being rain water, the place might get dry towards end of summer. Then road leads into plain which on its other side is again bordered by a chain of mountains. Shortly ahead of the mountain is the caravanserai of Meshed Djerim, uninhabited. There is good stonebuilt caravanserai with several water holes in vicinity, one of which still containing good drinking water in abundance. Neither supplies nor fodder, but mules can graze. 9th dav.

He himself lives in another village 2 farsakhs distant, but has a lot of property here, and sowars put 2 mules at our disposal, which previously were sent ahead with Mirza Ali Akbar Khan and had fallen into the hands of robbers, near Shah Mejid, but managed to get away. Travellers, who themselves had been looted, told us that 5 armed robbers were there who relieved Ali Akbar of all his money and clothes. He gave us hopes that we should get at the brigands. He himself is now supposed to be in Tabbas. In Ab-i-Garm some supplies and a little fodder. Good drinking water, hot sulphur spring. 11th day. Ab-i-Garm-Mehrizan. —Five farsakhs=5 hours. Road by many turns through hilly country and later on into the plain where the place of Mehrizan is situated. The inhabitants had all run away, as a rumour of the coming of 800 gendarmes had been circulated, for whom our sowars had been taken. Mahsud Lashkar had sent some of his people with us, who made manzil in a village belonging to him, just behind the gate. M. is a rather big place. Supplies and fodder abundant^ Good drinking wa er. From here one has to carry supplies for 4-5 days, as in the next stage nothing can be Water may still be got 5 farsakhs from here in Hauz-i-Mirza; from there road leads through Kevir and water-supply has to be carried.

Description of road from Mehrizan to Tabbas, 12th day. Mive farsakhs to Hauz Mirza, —Five caravan hours. Road leads through plain to the mountains to the north, then alongside those hills up to H. Mirza. Here there is a hauz with good (rain) water, good for man and beast. Shelter under roof for 20 people; horses and mules in the open. Not inhabited, therefore no supplies. As already mentioned in the previous report supplies for 3-4 days have to be carried from M. In Hauz Mirza waterbags to be refilled for march through Kevir. 13th day. From Hauz Mirza to Chah Mejid. —Ten farsakhs=10 caravan hours. The desert is reached at once and road passes for 3 farsakhs shifting dunes where no road is visible, there two stone signposts are erected for orienta tion. Afterwards again good road; the last farsakh again through sandhills, which owing to vegetation are stationary and road visible. In Chah Mejid there is a fairly well preserved small caravanserai, uninhabited and several very deep “ hauz, ” containing brackish water: mules take it but horses not. 14th day. Chah Mejid-Darin. —Four farsakhs = 4 caravan hours. For 3 farsakhs road again leads through dunes and then, over stony ground, turns towards the hill in the south. At the foot of the mountain the water place Darin with the mud huts of some shepherds where we rested ; supplies such as milk, mast and butter can be got, also some chicken and mutton. No bread. The water in the well is sli ghtly brackish, but drinkable. 15th day. Darin- Yefarn. —Four farsakhs = 4 caravan hou^s. Road leads through low hills on stony ground. In Yefarn houses to stay in ; stables for the horses—supplies and fodder in small quantity. The water in the -village h brackish; good drinking water has to be fetched from J farsakh away from a hauz. 16th march day. From Yefarn to caravanserai Mobakh Khur (?).—Four farsakhs = 3J caravan hours. Good road across plain. Spacious caravanserai with good water. Fodder available. Supplies are brought from the village of Shurab, 1 farsakh distant. Another good road is said to lead direct from Drain (?) to this place without touching Yefarn, and which cannot be more than 6 farsakhs, so the distance would be equal to an easy one day’s march.17 17th day of march. Prom Hob Khur to Chahar deh .—Pive and-a-balf farsakbs = 5^ caravan hours. Hoad across plain. Big caravanserai with fodder and supplies ; good water. 18th day of march. Chahar deh to Tabbas .—Pour farsakbs = 3J caravan hours. Hoad leads southwards across plain. Tabbas is rather big town: 12 to 14,000 inhabitants. Here also some days prior to our arrival the most nonsensical rumours had been spread. Some had heard Naib Hussain was approaching with several hundred savars to ransack the town, and to avenge the death of a son, who 2 years ago, in a raid on the town, had been shot here. Others again told that the Tehran Gendarmerie was coming to imprison robbers. In any case many people had already left town with their belong ings and gone to a place of safety. The Director of Taxation, Soka-es-Sultan, sent in a letter of such content, addressed to “the leader of the Persian savars ”, asking for what purpose we were coming, and offering to get everything ready in town for us. He seems to be the only one here with a clean conscience, all the other noblemen have something to be afraid of and therefore are in a mortal fright of Tehran. The Rais-e-Malieh has only just arrived from Tehran 1^ months ago. The greatest power here is in the hands of the former Governor Emad-ul-Mulk with his son who is generally known here as “ Emir Pansh ”. They have the greatest number of savars, and many of the robbers who infest the neighbourhood, looting travellers, are said to be in their pay. Also Ali Akbar from Ispahan, who by-the-by is supposed to have proceeded on his journey to Birjand some days ago, has been looted by their people. Both father and son make otherwise a favourable impression, hate in any case the Bussians and pretend to be in favour of the German cause. The headmen of the police, who in company with the Hais-e-Malieh had come out to meet us, is an elderly man of but small influence having only 12 people at his disposal and is the bad books of Emad-ul-Mulk. He told us that the robbers of the district were not in the pay of the former, but in the pay of the present Vice-Governor of this place. This however we do not believe, as the latter, Seid Muhammed Takr Khan, is foolish old grumbler; his master the real Governor lives in Tun at present. We are living in a big house with garden, which two years ago was partially destroyed by Naib Hussain, and which since has been uninhabited. Our arrival took place at 9 a.m. We are obliged to stay here 5 days, as the horses of our savars, to a great extent, were not up to the fatigues of the journey, and are wanting a rest, some of them are in such a state that they have to be changed here altogether. Our horses stood the journey well, the mules did splendidly being all well and fat. They had also often been relieved by the camels when there had been no supplies to carry and were then mounted by the riders of the sick horses. I am forwarding the present letter by our guide Hassan, who has rendered us good services from Nain to the merchant Salik to Nain, with orders to hand over one letter to any German gentleman whom he might meet on the road, and the other to be despatched to Ispahan. We shall leave here in 2-3 days. We appointed Emad-ul-Mulk here as our representative (homme de confiance). To him we shall address letters later on, if any, for further despatch. He had just been here again, and expressed his readiness for any sort of service and to help us in every way. Tabbas; 1 Ede and Hathat (?). The Uth July 1915. ) 'Enclosure No. 2.

The point is that Persia must not be fomented into revolution originating in the pro vinces, hut that the provinces must be kept warm, hut not at boiling point so ^ as to play their part promptly on the proclamation by the Government. This is not indeed a simple matter, because the sentiments of the people can not be controlled at pleasure. Here in Ispahan the application of the brake is required rather than stoking up. Sergam-es-Sultaneh wanted immediately following our remittance and the news of the departure of the gendarmes (in your honour !), to march in at the head of a force and enquired of me as to a suitable day for his entry ; I have now written to him again that he should hold himself in readiness but should not on any account whatever undertake anything without orders from the embassy ; I told him his time would surely come, that in the meantime our friendship and support are assured to him, but that we want to avoid a civil war in which he might come to grief— and other sound advice. Another Bukhtiara, Salar Masud, who is an officer of the gendarmerie, wants to resign his rank, and march against the Russians independently with 500 horsemen. I told him that he had better place his horsemen at the disposal of the gendarmes as auxiliary troops in case of an outbreak ; in that way he would best serve his glorious troop and the fatherland. The only question is whether this praiseworthy zeal will still be there when it is wanted. In Kerman the ground is nearly certain not to be so favourable. The Governor there is a tool of the Russians and moreover the English Consul there will not have let his time slip through his fingers to no purpose; but there is such a lively sympathy for the Germans among the people that one can count on success even in the most difficult places. I gather that you are counting on a gradual training of the Persian tribes for war with the help of German instructors; if only universal peace does not supervene before this work is begun or in the middle of it! Por certainly several months must elapse before the instructors arrive, are distributed and get beyond the preliminary stages. I recently requested by telegram that W. Paschen should be allotted to my group; at that time I did not know that Wagner was going alone. Now I would far rather that Paschen should be attached to Wagner; for to advance alone into these smouldering border lands seems to me, not only for Wagner, but for everyone, much too difficult a task. (Your reply has abready come.) That Griesinger should have developed such unexpected capabilities surprised me too, although I have watched the progress of the affair • the faultless technical execution especially merits praise and is solely due to Griesinger. I will not now enter into matters which, before the arrival of this letter may be discussed and decided by telegram. I want to touch upon one point in the general programme of advance to the east, because your work and mine exhibit a difference of principle with regard to it. The country of your destination is an. indepen dent state with a ruler and some sort of an armv anyhow an organised entity which, like Persia, can declare war or remain neutral. In other words ; if Afghanistan goes against India or Russia or both, this must happen at the behest of the Amir or of other persons in authority ; if they do not wish it, only two other cases can occur : either you will not be allowed into the country at all (and 1 do not know how you propose to act then). Or you will be allowed in and then there commences a propaganda campaign as in Persia. The case is different with regard to Baluchistan; there is no unitv, but only a few scattered princes, who are all, in one way or another vassals of the English. Baluchistan is then a purely hostile country, and what wa can produce there is not a declaration of war but a rebellion • that is of course feasible. But one point has to be considered. In Afghanistan you will certainly not meet with either Russian or English troops; whereas in Baluchistan I must expect to find at the outset the frontiers strongly occupied by trained troops; God knows whether a battalion of Japanese^* is19 not already posted at the Kuh-i-Malik-Siah. For this reason, in order to be successful in Baluchistan, I require beyond any question a belligerent Persia; or ot erwise I shall never have at my disposal a body which can so much as overpower a frontier post of 120 men and two machine guns. It must be taken for granted that the English not only have not withdrawn their frontier posts, but have appreciably strengthend them ; and our possible lines ot invasion of Baluchistan are so few that it is easy to occupy any particular one of them with far superior forces, since it must indeed very soon become known which road we with our small force have taken. Also on account of the lack of water and the inhospitality of the country in other ways it is not possible to move by side tracks, since neither food nor drink is to be had even for camels. Thus for Baluchistan I see only two possibilities of success. Either after a declaration of war by Persia simply to invade the country as an enemy with the largest force possible. Or incitement and the raising of a Bevolutionary army, which, however, is only possible if the frontier is insufficiently guarded. There is no doubt a third possibility, but it would require a very long time; vizto sow rebellion by means of individual messengers sent from Eastern Persia to the various men in power, until it attains such proportions that the English are obliged to withdraw their frontier posts. I reject a propaganda by letter as useless. About these considerations I should very much like to hear your views once more; we have really scarcely ever discussed Baluchistan in person. It is only with considerable resignation that I have accepted it as a matter of oourse that I am not to go to Afghanistan. In the order which you gave me on leaving Baghdad it says “ not to leave Kerman before * * * certain prospects of personal work in Baluchistan As to what I am to do if no such prospects offer I have not yet received any order. There is no hurry about your reply to these discussions. Events may supervene to make them superfluous. But once I am in Kerman and have set my face eastwards I would ask you at your convenience to give me special and conditional instructions. We shall move on as soon as possible. Whether, if at all, we shall meet again in Asia or not until we get home only Allah knows. Anyhow I am glad and proud to have done a bit of life’s journey and work in common with you. Always your truly devoted, ZtJGMAYEE. QJhe 17.h April 1917. G- B. Sanfokd. Enclosure No. 3. [Translation.] (Vide item 13 in enclosure to Serial No. 34 in Part XIIL) Ispahan; 5th September 1915. Dear Huber, Laban is going to-morrow to Chardeh with the 15 Austrians who are being sent on, and he takes these lines for you. Besides the letter contains as usual private correspondence, war news, and copies of the telegrams. Your news (reports) appear to have arrived complete; those up to the 28th July (Chardeh) I have already transmitted to Dr. Becker in a communi cation. Since then there have arrived : a letter from Isbek of the 2nd August, from Busruj of the 3rd and 7th August together witn a report. Your wishes regarding money and machine guns and the advance of the Turkish troops have, with your report, been forwarded at once to the legation. Captain Sarre and Count Kamtz have been made acquainted regarding them and asked for their support.Prince Reuss also informed me, that he had supported most warmly to A.* A. your request for money and machine guns, but that A. A. told him that it was impossible to send weapons to Z. And nothing can be expected from Germany, and I fear that our appeal for help will not be answered frorp Turkey either. Graf Kanitz told me that all his exertions had been in vain; hut he has not yet replied to my last telegram, in which I com municated to him your request that he should come to Ispahan to take charge of the military works, but I fear even that wire will be able to do little against the obstinacy of Reuf. We must therefore do without machine guns : even the establishment of a larger escort of Persian horse will be difficult, as no tribe can spare its men in the present uncertain conditions. We cannot reckon on the Bakhtiaris, nor on the Kashgais, we can reckon most on Mashallah Khan, but even he is at the moment at war with the Ardistan Bakhtiari Chiragh Ali. Nor could we scarcely expect a friendly welcome from the inhabitants, if we were to advance with these robbers who spread terror in all directions. The best plan would be to have a strong escort of Gendarmes up to the Afghan border. I will make enquiries as to this. Considering your writings, in which you pointed out the tracts to be chosen, and a telegram which announces that three Germans had got through to Sehdeh (?) with 100 horsemen. We may well hope that you have succeeded in breaking through. Perhaps you are already on Afghan territory. Our best wishes accompany you on your further journey. W r e all hope to be detailed to follow you. The legation and the A. A. have no conception, as Litton wrote in a letter to your brother, of the work which the expedition has accomplished in Persia; no conception, for you have nothing to seek here and should hurry on to your destination. The principal thing is that A. A. and the General Staff are going on at an increased rate of speed (speeding up ?) The situation in Persia is just as involved as ever. Everywhere things are moving, but whether anything will come of it, is another question. Tn Bushire things are going well. The Tangistanis have twice beaten tlie English (600 and 200 dead) and have received important reinforcements. Here also 50,000 Tomans have already been collected for their support. As the English in Bushire stupidly took extremely rigorous measures and even pulled down the Persian flag, there was the greatest bitterness against them. We ourselves are undergoing a very critical time, as the English and Russians have spent a lot of money and have sent a certain Bristof (Bristow ?) here to exploit the Bakhtiari. Naturally a number of Bakhtiari (and apparently also Sardar Jang) and Mullas have allowed themselves to be won over by English gold. Still opinion has become divided to a certain extent and the chief Mulla Agha Nurullah is preaching in inflammatory style against the English and the Persian traitors. Death to the English Consul and to Bristow was proclaimed in the mosque.'' Einally the day before yesterday an attempt was made on the life of the English Consul Graham, he himself was only slightly wounded, but an Indian was killed *[of course *[ ] is decypher and translation. an na^, as terror is the bmy means left]. • The English here are working feverishly against Killander and the local gendarmerie, very foolishly on their part, as the gendarmes are their only protection here. On this account also they have come into collision with the Russian Consul and Embassy; these probably see in the bold procedure of the English a serious menace to their precarious position in Persia. They naturally take ptrt in the scheming against the gendarmerie. In Kasvin they sent a robber brmd against the local gendarmerie, and a Swedish Captain Von Jerta has lost bis life in consequence; now 100 robbers are sitting safely under lock and key. In Brujird (?) also the gendarmerie has lost companies, a Swedish non-commissioned officer and two machine guns in a fight against the Luris, incited by the English and provided by them with all ^necessaries, even new gendarme uniforms.troopf “om^ateL'^rop^^i^Turks h ^ withdrawn a11 t^ir reconquered Tabriz On the otW ho ,i d now they say the latter have ~&gt;Turks 4 have suffered an ovemhewL Tf’ re ' ,0rts to - da y that the a coup de main against Tnlfa -u,,* , ? defeat m the Caucasus in attempting Reuter bas ir “n Sv^elf impaired ! ^ ^ ^ 8661 The of tuna t Ih t p da k r rh:'n ur \!r::t ur ;:fie f rTlr:n rifii T ns h { i Tjnfor - ago from Sandherr, that Paschen intended to leave ^ thTne^t 6 T 1 ' 3 ^whmrp^wTfhln TdTT^H^ TMbet ( Turbat? )- I asked by still in Tehran/' Thereupon I wired Zt P p 7 ast °“ sbmen * that he was was incomprehensible T^ d f * P ‘.

Also I must prXctmysdr^fnL the b tep^ that Sandhen-write on the 21st August: “that the one Eger, who lives in Tuibet (Turbat f), had been taken prisoner by the Russians, I telegraphed to you and his arrest appears to be attributable to his having been active on our behalf, even though only slightly so. Immediately on his arrest, his brother wrote to us from Meshed and begged us for Gods’ sake not to write or telegraph any more to him. Now I have no one up there in Khorasan.” , -A- 180 from Schunemann I got an unfriendly reply, on passing on your orders. He described it as «unjust and unfriendly” that I insisted on his sending on the goods forwarded by you. Now, I protect my own and your life, as well as it is possible to do so. Laban can himself tell you how matters stand on the Kermanshah line of communication. Fortunately he has secretly rescued £3,000 sterling from there besides the parting gift of Sch/s, otherwise that amount also would long ago have been consumed. Sch. at the present time is carrying on against the English and Bussian Consuls. The latter had the intention to reoccupy their posts in Kerman after the falling back of the Turks. Against this move Sch. raised a mobile force of 500 horse ; he justifies his ’ enormous expenditure of money by saying that he could not otherwise have held the Kerman line of communication. Just as if we were not working here in spite of the presence of the English and Bussians. Nothing new from Zugmeyer. He has not yet sent a single report. Yet he seems to have communication with you, for he sent on a packet for Wedig. Bohnstorff has not come to an understanding with Wassmuss, and has journeyed on to Kerman after a friendly parting arranged by Wustrow. Yesterday there arrived, by means of a former horsemau of Edes who came by Yezd, your letter of the(?) from Chardeh (the 10th August from Dr. Becker). I will report to Berlin the promotion of Jacob and Wedig. Your explanation that I belong to the A. A., as a member of your expedi tion, has helped me little, especially since the A. A. has wired to Prince Beuss that the expedition was placed under the legation. Fortunately the Prince, who appears not to be so unfavourably inclined towards me as Litten would like to make out, has not undertaken anything more against me.On the other hand, Litten has allowed himself to write: “ S. D. has c h a r^ed me to write to von and let yon know that he doesn’t understand why von consider it necessary, in spite of yonr oath of service, to work against the authority placed over you, namely, the legation, even m cases where the£ interests of the expedition are not affected.” On that I let him know that I was not aware of this proceeding and that I demanded that specific instances be brought up against me, so that I might undergo a disciplinary enquiry. Then the Prince wrote in his own hand a long eight-page letter, friendly in tone in spite of all reproaches, and at the close of which he wrote c In conclusion I will emphasize that I only asked Consul Litten to draw your attention to the fact that co-operation would be better worth while, and that the reference to your oath of service was not in accordance with my intentions or my orders.” Thus the Prince has let down Litten badly. Prom everything, even from a private letter from Litten to your brother, it is clear that he works against you and me in the most shameless way, and apparently has failed to put a great deal before the Prince, so that the latter was bound to form a wrong opinion. The calling away of Laban is not exactly pleasant for me, who had to wait H months for a similar discharge; the more so as Waldman has had severe tvphus for the last two weeks : fortunately your brother got him out of danger in time. In consequence I have kept here Yoss, who is liable for militarv service, and whom Sandherr had entrusted with the leadership of an Austrian transport corps, to run the accounting and office work, Voss is a merchant and a zealous, conscientious worker. I have allowed him a monthly remuneration of 50 Tomans on the suggestion of the legation. Fasting goes on doing his work as punctually as ever. Unfortunately recently the signals from Nauen have been very weak, so much so that wired to Berlin. Recently the legation has announced that it has no objection to the public ation of the war news (and never has had any ?), if only the reference to the receipt by wireless is not made! Versen exerts himself to support me. He has taken over charge of the horses and of the Austrians. Unfortunately with his violent manner he does not always adopt the right tone. But on the other hand this band of “ soldiers ” are altogether too bad a lot; slack, undisciplined, insubordinate, often drunken. Many of them are quite uneducated, and physically weak in addition, and some of them sick. The day before yesterday, three men, just the kind who have not yet done any duty on account of sickness, have absconded: the gendarmerie has been warned, but has not yet cought them. As a result I regard the despatch of anv more Austrians with mixed feelings At Z. we have 38 men, of whom Laban is taking away with him to-morrow the best fifteen. The chief difficulty is saddlery, European saddles cannot be procured and consequently I have mounted ‘six on horses and nine on mules. Our own people I will perhaps mount on saddle bags. Your brother has a lot to do. In the inner working he has supported me in the best manner. If the spare wireless operator brings enough instruments with him, we could perhaps leave the station working here and only take Ferting from time to time with spare apparatus. Do you agree ? Unfortunately, neither you nor the armourer have said whether he has remained in Chardeh as a result of an order from you. Yet it strikes me that he should have gone with Laban, I am sorry. _ Nothing could come of the Bakhtiari journey in the circumstances described, for to whom^could I have handed over the whole business for three weeks, in order to go without care on the questionable tour, as it turned out. Every day here there are other cares and excitements and of course you expect your orders to be conscientiously carried out. With many greetings from all and best wishes for further fortunate advances. I remain, dear Huber, your devoted Seiler.23 Enclosure No. 4. [Translation.] (Vide item 13 in Enclosure to Serial No. 34 in Part XIII.) Imperial German Legation, Tehran. Kerman, 6th September 1915. My reports on the events here up to the 27th July also on the Consulates and on the posts in Persia have been sent a long time ago, as well as the special report on the German doings in Kerman sent to the legation by post. In the meantime the situation here has become so serious that I see myself compelled to send Herr Wedig, without counting cost or time, to Ispahan, in order that the legation may form an idea of the situation in this place through personal interview with him. My nomination as representative of the Consulate in Kerman and the appointment of Herr Griesinger as my assistant have resulted from the correct acknowledgment by him that successful work on the lines of the expedition H. can only be accomplished in so important a place as Kerman by a person to whom an official position is granted. Mbre German private individuals could never have the necessary influence. The prospects of success were indeed extraordinarily good in the begin- nin 01 . We were greeted by the populace with demonstrative joy and every- one &amp; hoped to find in the new German advocacy a powerful counterpoise to the hated English and Kussian influence and particularly to the unlimited oppression of the local governor, who, together with the vice-governor, chief of police and the Keis-i-Koshun (?) is entirely in the pay of the English. They receive every month heavy sums of money as bribes from the English Consulate, in recompense for betraying the activities of the German group here. The party of the Persian patriots here is not small, but the people havo been completely cowed and suppressed through consistent oppression. Every one was hoping to attain their ends through the Germans. In the early days I daily expected, full of confidence, the news that the German representatives had been recognized by the Persian Government, and the German Consulate would be able openly to exert the same influence as the English and Russian ones. In particular was it a matter of the right to fly the flag. - . . As soon as our opponents observed that this recognition was lacking, and that for three weeks a number of my telegrams to Tehran on this subiect remained unanswered, their attitude of waiting changed to an onenlv hostile one. The governor began it with arrests and punishment of members of the patriots’ party, with the plundering of their property and the suunression of every expression of public opinion. When the persons affected, nraved for German protection, which I promised them in reliance on my office the governors shewed open hostility to us Germans, at lirst it is true with a certain amount of restraint, but later, when he perceived that his actions remained unpunished, with ever increasing liberty. It came to the events of the 27th July and the foregoing days when we were only able to save the German reputation by a reckless interposition of our own bodies, and thl evident consequence of which should have been the immediate dismissal and severe punishment of the governor, for having proceeded against tha representative of the German Empire with open force of arms. Since then nearly six weeks have passed and the governor is still here m his office, the German agency here still remains unrecognized and may not flv the German flag, and has to rely for communication with the legation and with Ispahan on the open Persian telegraph. As every telegram coming in and going out is laid before the governor, nn. pnemies are exactly informed of what I wire to the embassy, and of what the embassy replfes to me-and also of how little the embassy has up to the present responded to my telegrams.f ■ !i ■ fl SI 24 When at last after a long time a cypher telegram of eight pages (No 12) reached here from the legation, and when this event naturally became known in our ^ party and neighbourhood with lighting rapidity, we bad to endure that this telegram contained nothing beyond the communications from the Baghdad Indians* Committee to Daud AH. And when the said Baud Ali, at the instigation of the governor, was set upon, robbed and severely wounded to boot, the hope revived that this fresu affront to the Germans would be followed by a speedy dismissal of the governor. To-day 23 days have elapsed since I despatched my report (tele gram Noy 22) of the assault to Tehran, and I have not even received an acknowledgment of my telegram yet. Under these circumstances nearly all our partizans and friends have with drawn from us. The few, who adhere to us still, are doing so partly fr&lt;&gt;m a sense of honour, and partly because they still hope that* the powerf ul German Empire will not leave in the lurch the only two Germans in South-East Persia. Our opponents triumph openly, scoff at the impotence of the German legation, aud only await the day when the German agency in Kerman has to withdraw in shame and derision. That matters have not yet come to this pass is due to the fact that a little respect is felt for the personality of the Germans of this place, and that it is considered impossible that they have been completely disavowed by the legation. In conclusion I beg the legation to consider that the stirring up of revolt in British Baluchistan and the threat to India through an expedition despatched in the manner suggested by the Foreign Office and great general staff is to be carried out from Kerman. . ^ 01, purpose Kerman is indispensible as a strong German supportin ’’ point. The activities of the expedition on the Indian frontier regions coulcf and would, have the greatest effect on the general events of the world and could do great damage to the enemies of the Empire. I beg the legation to look at the case from this point of view and to treat it accordingly. ° (Given to the Embassy by Wedig.) Bu.

H C R E T MI DOLE EAST COHHTTiuE. spy • 0. 99 200654} GULHEK August 22. 1917 Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch from the Inspector General of the South Persia Rifles in which he forwards to me an appreciation prepared hy Colonel Orton, Chief of his Staff, on the military situation in South Persia. The most interesting part of this report is found in Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 when Colonel Orton examines the question of the opening of communication between Shiraz and Bushire and reaches the conclusion that for military reasons we must be content with endeavouring to keep open the Eastern or Firuzabad road between Shiraz and Bushire as the task of opening the more direct route through Kazerun and Eorasjun in the teeth of the opposi tion of the hostile Khans is an operation beyond the powers of the South Persia Rifles and would involve co operation on a large scale from Bushire. The Firuzabad route passes for a considerable dis- the tance through/territory of Soulet ed Bowleh, and, as It approaches the coast, through Ahram the Cuief village of Zair Khader, the rebel Khan who acted as the gaoler of Colonel 0*Connor and the British Colony of Shiraz in 1916. Both these chiefs desire considerable profit from caravan traffic along the Firuzabad road, and would be glad to see it adopted as the chief trade route from Bushire to Shiraz le Right Honourable A.J. Balfour, 0 .11., K.P. etc., etc., etc.% in preference to trie shorter but more difficult Kazerun road, and it is to this interest that the opening of the road is due, I do not understand that it is intended that the South Persia Rifles should make themselves responsible for the security of the road; Xndoed I believe an attempt to establish South Persia Rifles posts along it would be strongly resented by Soulet ed Dowleh, to say nothing of Zair Khader, and it will I fear be some little time before the South Persia Rifles can be considered strong enough to undertake the duty in disregard of the resentment of Soulet ed Dowleh and Zair Khader. Since Colonel Orton’s despatch was written the situation on the Kazerun route has improved and caravans are now passing with some little freedom. As in the case of the Easterly route this is due to the benefit which the local Khans, Ghazanfer es Sultaneh and Nasri Divan derive from the traffic and partly also to the influence which Soulet ed Dowleh has exercised as a result of our arrangement with him.

A.1.&amp; Q.F.G,, South Persia Rifles. Senior Staff Officer.In September 1917 , it is proposed to send about 200 rifles (I company) of the 1st Infantry, South Persia ® Rifles, from Bandar Abbas to Taruin, when the 2nd Squadron Burma Mounted Infantry would rejoin the Head Quarters, Burma Mounted Infantry, at Shiraz, General 3 . The situation in the Kirman Province is quiet , and 'situation . promises to improve constantly. The Q,avvam-ul-*Mulk at present has his Arab tribes well in hand, thanks to his operations during the spring of 1917 . The general situation in Pars is promising, and law and order is being restored along the main routes. The resumption of active operations in the war by the Russians has had a good effect . The recent minor operations near Abadeh and Deh Bid , against robber Illiat tribesmen, have had considerable effect, and caravans are moving freely between Shiraz and Ispahan . Practically the only unsatisfactory feature is the attitude of the chiefs end tribes who inhabit the districts along the Khan-i- Zinian - Kazerun - Borazjun - Bushire road The fanatical mullahs of Shiraz and a few Persian democrat emissaries from the north, are the main fomenters of anti-British doctrines in Pars, but their activities are of a political nature , and are not likely , as far as can be foreseen at present, to bring about any disturbance demanding military action . The Kazerun - Bushire roadT The Kazerun - Bushire road remains closed to ordinary , a considerable amount of Persian trade is passing along the route via Flruzabad . The Kazerun, Borazjun, etc., chiefs and people are the declareddeclared enemies of the British and are rebels, vis &amp; vis, the Persian Government, in that they disregard orders from Tehran and refuse to pay any taxes. Wassmuss, the Gormn ex-Consul, still finds a refuge among these tribesmen. Law and order is not likely to be established in this district until these chiefs and tribesmen have received severe punishment by means of active military operations. There is the chance, however, that the improvements in other parts of Pars will re~act there, and that the local land holders, cultivators and tradesmen will themselves bring about the re-oponing of the Kaaermi road, aa tho material interests of these classes suffer by tho closing of the road. A temporary agreement has been made by the Consul Shiraz with Soulai-ud-Lowleh, the Ilkhani of the Qashqais. This agreement is of value, as affording time and opportunity for organisation and training of the S.PvP* Soulat-ud-I)owleh appears to be a man of considerable ability, subtle and avaricious, but lacking in strength of character, and probably a coward at heart c Eis control over the unruly and semi independent branches of the Qashqai does not appear to be a strong one. It is not considered probable that the attitude of the chiefs and tribes along the Easerun - Bushire road will force any military operations on us, so long as this road is left entirely alone. lit ary 5. There are two main lines of military policy open to lioy. us in the near future:- A. To plan and undertake mjli'fa.ty o orations in the . . near future, against, the eldeie and tribes along the Eazeiui.-Ecrez jur-Bushire road*. 3. To avoid any military operations in this region, es far as pcssiVJe. end te leave tho Kazerun Bushire road closed, as at present, but with goods passing from Bushire to Shiraz via iiruz&amp;bad. Bis cuss ionI discussio n of Policy ” 4” 6. For military operations between Shiraz and Bushire (Alternative Tr A ,T ), the co-operation of a force from Bushire is essential, snd it should not be less than two Brigades, and should probably be one Division. For simultaneous operations from Shiraz, towards Kazerun, it would bo possible to concentrate at Shiraz - Indian Troops 1,500. S ft P*n.Persian Troops 1,500 3,000 It is estimated that these troops from Shiraz could fight thoir way to Kazerun, in the face of probable opposition which might be expected at this end, with simultaneous action being’ tanen from Bushire. The approximate dispositions would include:- At Shiraz 1,000 At Khan-i-Zinian 600 At Baeht Ar ,j an 300 At Ku tal - i - Dukh t ar 100 At Kazer im 1,000 3,000 The tribesmen profess a contempt for the British in general, and for Indian troops in par ticular. The theatre where fighting is to be ex pected, is mountainous and difficult. The tribesmen are well-armed with modern rifles, but are not good shots, and their supply of ammunition is somet'/hst limited. Thoy willingly bu;* ammunition at 2 krams per round. It is probable that the local chiefs would assemble their, men and fight, and this would be satisfactory, as tending to permit of casualties being inflicted and so avoid a prolongation of operations into guerrilla tactics. The most favourable date for the commencement cf operations lies between 15th October and 15th November« Ordinarily, with adequate Supply and Transport prepar ations, the whole operations should be over in six weeks. FromFrom Christmas to tho-end af^Fehruary', tho passes, near Pasht Arjaxi t arc liable to 'be 'bloclced by .snow. Six weeks notice of operations is required at Shiraz, to enable Supply ferid Transport preparations to be made* V.ithout previous and adequate stocking of Supplies at Khan-i-Zinian, and in the S.P.R, post near Dasht Arjan, (Burj-i-Timuri) suitable action from Shiraz would be almost impossible. On the conclusion of a successful campaign, 3.P*R. Garrisons would be placed at certain points, including approximately - At Boras yun 250 At Kazorun 7CO At Kutal-i-Pukhtar 50 1,000 The Indian division could be withdrawn and the bulk of the Indian troops now in the Pars and Kirman Provinces. 7. Regarded from a broad point of view, however, it would appear undesirable, during the war, to take any action which demands tho despatch of reinforcements for oporations in a mirior theatre. The adoption of alterna tive ’ T B', therefore, appears to be preferable, at the present juncture, from a military point of view. In the event of this latter policy boing adopted, to cover the period of next cold weather, it is consiueied that the Indian troops now in Southern Persia could be somewhat reduced during the autumn of 1917. (say in October). The Squadron 15th Lancers, Wing, 124th Baluchistan Infantry and Section Ho. 108 Indian Field Ambulancecould be withdrawn.

[ USU 1 have the honour to address you with regard to the future maintenance oi a road in Bushire island constructed by the military authorities as a war work. The road is a metalled one ten feet wide with earthen berms three feet wide on each side. It runs from the site oi the New Customs premises on the creek to the h telegraph station at Bes^ire where the troops are located, a ^ distance of about six miles. For about 4 /d of its length it lollows the line ot the road between Bushire and the Besidency at Subzabad. I enclose a map of a portion of the island with the road indicated by a line of red chalk. The line actually marked is the old unmetailed track. The new road departs irom this line in several places to secure a straighter and better alignment. The portion of the road from Bushire to the junction of the old Beshire and Subzabad roads, known as Nehdi (which I have marked with a blue line) was metalled during the Governorship of Mowaqqer- ud-Dowleh by the Municipality of Bushire. It was however ruined by heavy military traffic, but has now been repaired by the military authorities and is for the present maintained by them in common with the rest of the road. The Municipality are willing to resume the maintenance of this section when it is no longer used by heavy military traffic. This is the utmost extent of road which can be considered to come within the sphere of and to be maintainable by the Municipality. In fact it goes beyond not only thethe present limits of the Municipality hut heyond any limits to which the Municipality is likely to attain in future. The maintenance ox the remaining portion, roughly half, of the road remains to he considered. The Persian Government can not he expected to maintain it xor many years to come for their resources are inadequate to meet their expenses, and the Local Government, as the Government of India are aware, has to receive doles to keep it going. The residents of the island who own wheeled vehicles of any sort will he taxed as they were formerly for the maintenance of the Municipal portion of the road and cannot assist further. If the road is not regularly repaired it must speedily go to ruin owing to the inferior nature of the metalling procurable here and its broken surface will he virtually impassable and will remain blocking the alignment, wasting the land taxen up and necessitating the taking up of more land by a iresh tract, ihe European and well-to-do Persian inhabitants who all live outside the town, would then he worse off than they were before the new road was built, as previously there was a road of sorts, which though very bad was passable. Again, the absence oi reasonably good communications would add considerably to the difficulty and expense oi supplying the troops at Beshire, and to the disadvantages which already exist owing to the distance of the Besident f s house and confidential office at Subzabad from his ofiices in town, un the other hand, as has been proved since the new road was constructed, a good road greatly ameliorates these disadvantages, and the new xoad coupled with the military motor cars has made Subzabad quit© accessible to Naval and Military officers having business there. The new road and a motor car would in fact enable me to regard the indefinite postponement of the builiing of the new Residency (which seems probable as a result of the war) with equanimity. Lastly, the new road has been built by the British Government and the funds spent in its construction would in a great part be wasted if the road is allowed to go to ruin©In these circumstances I venture to solicit the Government of India to be so good as to come to the rescue, and provide xunds to maintain the Mehdi Heshire section oi the road so long as troops are stationed in Heshire, and the new Presidency remains unbuilt• The question oi the cost oi keeping the road in repair is rather a diiiicult one, as no one has any experience how long the friable sandstone, which is the only lorn oi road metal available here, will last. When the subdivisional oiiicer M.I.S. had made the new road and repaired the Bushire-hehdi section I asked him ii he could give me an estimate oi the cost ox keeping it in repair. He made an estimate based on the assumption that the road would have to be completely renewed every 6 years, and this worked out to Krans 16,161 lor the whole 6 miles. At the time this was ‘‘Hi ■ i n^ijnnwnpif iiiT*mijii done, the Assistant Engineer, Public Y/orks Department, was on Jrour. When he returned I asked him to check the estimate and at iirst he thought it was too small and should be i again as large. How ever since that time he has had actual experience in making a short piece oi road here, and has decided that the work can be done more cheaply and has iramed the estimate tor Krans 43H7 annually for repairing the Beshire-Nehdi section, which I enclose. It appears irom a xurther examination of the M. W. estimate that the maintenance of the a miles irom Nehdi to Bushire costs much more than that oi the 3 miles irom Reshire to Wehdi as the small stone xor road metalling is all iound between Heshire and Subzabad. But even allowing lor this, original M. W. estimate amounted to Krans 6196 lor the a miles between Heshire and hehdi, and I am inclined to think that the Assistant Engineer is rather too sanguine in estimating that the road can be satisfactorily repaired ior Krans per annum. However, I trust the Government oi India will be pleased to allot the equivalent of this sum, which at the present rate oi exchange (Krans BoQ = 100 rupees) amounts to Rs. 17b0/-, on the under- standing that it is experimental and that a report will be submitted ii the amount proves to be insuificient. I venture alsoalso to ask ii the Government oi India will be pleased to allot a small lump sum to 1 do petty repairs on the remaining If miles oi road between the end ot the new road and Subzabad and keep it passable, so that there may be a iairly good road all the way xrom Suhzabad to Bushire. I tentatively put this lump sum at twice the amount allowed xor petty repairs on the made road (Krans jGG/~ per mile), which would come to Krans 900 for the l-^- miles, or Bs. 360/-. This with the Bs. 1730/- required xor the metalled road totals Bs. 2090/-, but as I have only suggested a lump sum xor the Subzabad section, I venture to ask that the Government ox India will be pleased to allot Bs. 2000/- annually ior the repair ox tne road. If the Government ox India accord their sanction to this proposal, I would suggest tnat this amount should be added to the Office Allowance ox this Besidency. I have, etc., Sd. A. P. Trevor, Major, Deputy Political Besident, Persian Gull.Specilication lor road repairs- The whole suriace ot the road should be picked up and all the old shool, sand and small stones removed irom the road. The berms should thea* be made up with earth and iresh metal laid by hand to bring the road up to the original level, the proper camber being kept by using wooden templates. The size ot the metal should be roughly The metal should then be rolled while dry starting xrom the outsides 01 the road and rolling the centre last. It is found that each portion of the suriace should be gone over about a times beiore the metal is Hooded. The metal should now be well soaked and rolled till the metal no longer appears to move in front 01 the roller. The shool is now to be spread dry and rolled once all over, alter which it should be thoroughly soaked and about 01 sand spread over it and then rolled with as heavy a roller as is obtainable as often as is practicable. Note. - The roller must not be allowed on the wet shool till the sand has been spread. 3d. 0. E. Aitken, Assistant Engineer. 8/7/17.rnsmm MINUTE. &lt; Sir C. Marling’s telegram No. 319, to which this letter refers, is flagged on the file. Hie proposal A., which the Foreign Office support, has for its object the keeping open of the roads between Bushire and Shiraz. This, Sir C. Marling thinks, 'can probably be achieved by Farman Farma' 1 *{Governor-General of Farsj 'by means of subventions 'of about 5,000 tomans a month or less for each 'road'; and he suggests that we should supply the money through, the British Consul at Shiraz. In other words, the rebel Khans of the Bushire hinterland, against whom we have so heavy a count of unpunished outrages, are to be bribed instead of being chastised. The bribes will apparently involve pardon for past misdeeds - but only pardon by the Farman Farma, as representing the Persian Government against whom the K^lans have been so long in revolt; not pardon by His Majesty’s Government. It is open to grave doubt, however, whether this distinction can be effectively maintained in practice. Cur I relations with Farman Farma are perfectly well known^ and the Khans will probably have a shrewd suspicion of the source from which their stipends are derived. Any arrangement now made with them by Farman Farma, whatever formal reservations may be attached to it, will surely make it more difficult for us, if and when we find ourselves in a position to act', to inflict upon them the chastisement which they so richly deserve. For these reasons the Department regards the Foreign Office propose! with a good deal of misgiving end would prefer to adhere to the view expressed in 18695. 1.480. 1000.—4/1916. ourI DRAFT LE The Under Secretary of St&amp;te, Foreign Office, kn+ INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I., October, 1917.

Prom Sir Percy Cox. Dated 13th Septemner Received 14th September 11 a.m. 3742. Telegraphic correspondence referred to in opening sentence of Foreign telegram 945 S.C. of 6th September 1917 has not yet reached me but I can see no benefit in our now intervening as the honest amdeno. On the contrary^ It is doubtful if the present Persian G-overnment would welcome any such intervention. In any case it would be weakness and not to magnanimity, while at the same time it would disgust and estrange those powers who have remained loyal to : us. Unless the gendarmerie are prepared t© take ever Kazerun route there will be no great improvement in position. If we cannot assist Da^ra Begi with such guns and ammunition as he needs to enable him to take effective action himself it will be much better in my opinion to leave things to take their natural course and reserve our own freedom of action.

Received at 1.0. 7th. 7.30 a.m. Bushire Shiraz road. It appears from telegraphic correspondence between Shiraz Bushire and Minister, posted to us by Trevor that Farman Farma has joined Soulet in negotiating with hostile Khans for clearing up Bushire hinterland. Nasri (TJoponeno) has already begged pardon and Zair Khidr has been approached by letter. Trevor strongly deprecates negotiations as he still jo IWiUK'viW V' regards -( Zair in particular as essential. Minister while appreciating difficulties of pardoning him seems inclined to favour scheme generally though doubtful of need for clearing up both direct roads via Kazerun and that via Firozabad. Since proposal to resolve deadlock by negotiations ’’ 'cuA was vetoed in your telegram of 8 December last situation has undergone material change owing to Farman 1 s active intervention and also to change in Persian political situation generally by ^hich Farma 1 s change of attitude has seemingly been prompted. For us to baulk G-overnor-General in his ( ) resolve to ( ? group missing) deadlock according to Persian method would act as serious irritant on our relations with Persian Government and deepen suspicion ^ we desire continuance of present chaos to justify presence of our troops.( 2 ) Even witnout our support Farman.Farma will probably be able to come to some sort of terms with Khans provided we ^completely ( ? group missing) aloof. As prospect of our oemg able to 4 w4 t problem by conclusive operations is as remote as ever and as moreover insistence on eventual USe o1 troops clearl y be jcred' rb Ty^ itrpol itic in present state of political situation.we strongly urge this opportunity snoutd not be missed for us to interfere as peacemaker between Persian Government and her rebels Hmd. 1- will bei and tnus to earn merit with local people by magnanimity and witn Persian Government by practical proofs of since., ity of our desire to support her in her efforts to restore order.

Dear Shucfcburgh I notiee a reference to General Sykes’ forct in the report og the Mesopotamian Commission. f ihe following notes may be of interest to you: please make any use of them you may think fit. They represent my personal views and recollect ions.I have had a few private letters from Sir P.Sykes,but he did not in them make any reference to these sub£ jects. I joined Sir P S^kes at Delhi in February. I had just taken up the appointment of G.S.O in charge of the Afghan and Frontier section of the In telligence , located at Simla.Sir P.Sykes told me kksc that some opposition was offered to my transfer to him and tnat he had pointed out that he must have k the staff he asked for, if it was desired to give him all possible assi stance.Our field of select ion for other officers was very limited as Col.Scott, no doubt acting on the Instructions of the C-in-C, was unable to transfer any officer already serving in a field force.The war had already been in pro gress for 1,’ years and the great majority of offic ers suitable for employment in South Persia were, at that date,in one of the field forces.I recommended ‘•..'a t,Haugnton,3 .'th Sikhs, to Sir S. Sykes as most suit - * aole,out he replied that it was useless to apply for ais services,as the 36th Sikhs were already under or ders for Mesopotamia.After consultation with Col.Scott,Gapt.Durham and Lieut.Ruck were transferred from Arm# Dept to Foreign ano. Political i or service with the Soux.h Persia i'ilita force ary Police,as the was then called.Both officers had a good knowledge of Persian,but Lt Ruck had never been in Persia and Gant Durham only for a short per iod. They joined at Delhi before the end of February. A preliminary scheme was drawn up and sub mitted, after discussion with Mr Grant,the General otaf f,Adjutant-General,Quarter- -aster-General,Ordnance and Finance authorities.Sir P.Sykes was pressed to sub mit this scheme as soon as possible and it was,if I am not mistaken,drawn up in 4 days.It did not,of course, pretend to be exhaustive. The great difficultly®- ^ ^ the fact that the mission had two objects viz the elim ination O.L merman influence from South Persia and the organisation of a permanent force of 10,000 Persian / 71 - Gen Sarnies under British offleers,and/the constant(and unavoidable) changes in the instructions received as regards the first of these objects.This latter diffic- ulty persisted until/the date of my leaving the miss ion. Both General Kirkpatrick and Mr Grant gave us all information and assistance.A demand for machine guns Wets rex used, but tne demands ol the field forces were un doubtedly most urgent at the time.We were allotted two mountain guns,but no British Artillery offleer.Gapt.Dur ham had,however.served in the artillery before entering the Indian Cavalry. Early in -arch Capt Durham and I proceeded to Karachi.Capt Durham took over the Indian instructors,(3) who had, in some cases,'been despatched their* units without the proper documents and equipmsitt,and the esc ort of the Central India Horse,prepared for the emhark- of all personnel and animals of the mission,and made ar rangements K&amp;nggmtsxfor the mis.ion mess,an important point if &amp;h the health of the British officers were to be maintained. I checked / as far as I could,the delivery of the many thousand pounds'worth of arms,ammunition 'including tho se for the Qawani),uniform,ordnance stores,office equip ment,mountain ^.nd rations which were to ac- compan;/ the mission. I found the ordnance and staff auth orities at Karachi most willing to assist and arranged with the former iaKXKE that detailed vouchers should De competed at Bunder Abbas and posted back to Karaclii y and with the latter for the regular despatch of supplies. Sir P.Sykes and Lt Ruck arrived afew days lat er and the mission embarked for Bunder Abbas.Its strength in British Officers was four; — Sir P.Sykes.Inspector-General. Major Blair,Staff Officer. Captain Durham.(Cavalry) Lieutenant Ruck (Infantry) Major Thorourn I.: .S. was under orders to join the mission from Seistan.He had not arrived when I left Bunder Abbas towards the end of April.The assistant surgeon detailed for the mission joined it about the middle of April.Medical stores were embarked with the mission.Sir P.Sykes told me that,before leaving Delhi, he had been promised additional officers as they were required and as they could be spared.(3 On arrival Bunder Abbas the mission was joined by escort of 100 rifles of the 94th RIIIkx Infantry,a Persian Ma&amp;xxM political assistant,and an Indian clerk.Mr Hows son,consul,and Lieut.Withers R.I. ■,who was working un der the Chief of General Staff,India,as intelligence officer for the Persian Gulf, were also at Bunder Abbas power. and assisted us to the utmost of their xwe®.Headquart ers were established in the Consulate,but the difficul ty oObtaining a good Bubbly 0 f water compelled the siting fishing of the camp at Naiband,8 miles to the East. By arrangement with Mr Howson,the assistant surgeon r attached to the Consulate temperily took medical charge of the mission and carried out the medical exam ination og Persian recruits. Their enrolment and training commenced at once, the large supply of rifles and ammunition for the Qawam was handed over to the Persian authorities,and a small intelligence system established.Stores were checked to st and demands made for Additional articles. Sir P.Sykes carried out political and intelligence duties himself ; I the staff duties,and Capt Durham and # Lt Ruck the organisation and training of the recruits, with the staff of Indian instructors.A very large number /larnJiA ms* njj of telegrams came in; cod inland decoding took up an av erage of 4 hours a day.When ships with supplies for the mission came In,they lay F to 3 miles off shore and sm one full working day had to be devoted to ensuring safe disembarkation.Owing to Capt Durham’s and LtRuck’s lack of experience in dealing with Persians,Sir P Sykes was compel Led to give more of his time,at first,to superin- ;tending the organisation,training,and disciplining of the recruits than would otherwise have been necessary. It was obviously of the first importance that, nothing given a satisfactory start.Questions of pay, romotlon of Persian N.C.O’s and officers^fand of discipline xani could only be dealt with by an officer with a long experience of Persia,if the seeds of future tro- on Kerman,and (c) stay of force at under Abbas during the hot weather had to be roughed out and demands for the equipment required for these eventualities made on India.As a general rule,there was so much urgent cur rent work that it was difficult to obtain time for the deliberate consideration of the more extensive plans, of a, the. the preparation of &lt;rt budget, and/scheme for of the South ersia Military Police,regarded as a per- I manent force..ly own work, esi ecially as regards finance and supply,begari to fall into arrears. staff required at this period,exclusive of the Inspect or General,was 1 General Staff Officer,$ Assistant-Qu- arternaster-General, S junior political officer! who couli oT stores and disembarkation duties,and 2 officers for the Persian recruits,of whom 300 were enlisted by the ical officer was most necessary: serious loss of worki front, stc/rfifss (Brtfts?t J /ti Jt'onJ ing time^among the staff^/commenced almost at once.Fort- unately / the Consulate assistant surgeon was yggfqyx should be done to o ffend Persian feeling and^/the force s?iou?d, i-elations with Indian staff. uble were not to be sown.

Bussia which is having its effect here. Belief is being spread by hostile element here with whom Shah is in full sympathy that new regime in Bussia is closely sym pathetic with young Persian constitutionalist ideals and aims and will be ready to reverse former Bussian policy here, and withdraw Bussian troops, refrain from insisting on validity of August agreement, encourage meeting of Mejliss, &amp;c. ° Demands in the above sense should they insist be at once addressed to Bussia, and they are making every effort to wreck cabinet on the ground that Prime Minister being identified with old Bussian policy will not press these demands with vigour and sincerity. Miliukov is credited here with having in past expressed his personal opinion in favour of all these aspirations and great hopes are built on him. Bussian Charge d*Affaires who is entirely without news as to events in Bussia which would enable him to state authoritatively main line of future policy of Bussia here and it would he useful if instructions could be sent him. In absence of such knowledge position of Persian cabinet is extremely difficult. We are giving Prime Minister such support as we can, but it is quite possible he will have to resign. If he does, new cabinet will be strongly nationalist and would probably pave way to recall Mejliss with all its accompanying intrigues and anarchy.

On the facts before them, the Government of India consider that there are sufficient grounds to warrant the internment of Saiyid Mustapha, who appears to have been in close touch with the German and Turkish agents in Herat. There seems to be no object in sending him to Bombay or Peshawar, where he alleges he has acquaintances, and the Government ‘ of India have decided that he should be interned in Quetta for the present. 3. The evidence against him, however, is not very strong, while the facts that he went to Afghanistan before the war and is an elderly man are in his favour. I am to suggest, therefore, that he be further examined at leisure. Should his continued internment appear to you to be unnecessary, proposals for his disposal otherwise should be submitted. 21 No. 4433-67-6, dated Basrah, the 23rd March (received 2nd April) 1917.

Telegram P., No. 1, dated the 7th (received 12th) January 1917. From— Captain E. W. C. Noel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Deh Kurd, To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran (repeated Basrah, Ispahan). I found, on my return to Bakhtiari, that during my six weeks* absence Amir Mujahid had been busily intriguing with result that the whole of the, Illkhani family were unanimous in refusing to acknowledge Mohtasham as Illkhani. The latter, moreover, had been so intimidated that he insisted on resigning. In his intrigues Amir Mujahid was assisted by news of recent occupation of Oil Fields by onr troops and tightening of our control at Shushter and Dizful where Bakhtiaris claim special interests. Both these matters have raised considerable resentment which Mujahid cleverly turned against Mohtasham by representing that, with his supine attitude and friendli ness to the British, he was selling his country’s interests. Intrigue was further assisted by recent overtures made by Zill-es-Sultan and Russians to Bakhtiaris and also by fact that Sardar Zaffar is still sore at liis dismissal from Kerman and that he has not come in for any share of secret service payments. In view of Shiraz situation and our frequent use of Lynch road it seemed to me desirable to go to considerable lengths to break up hostile combina tion and persuade Mohtasham to carry on. This I succeeded in doing by buying over Sirdar Zaffar by the offer of assisting him in settlement of^ his claims against Persian Government, and promising him my support as next candidate for the Illkhauiship. Zaffar, in return, transferred his support to Mohtasham and agreed to go to India for eight months. H.e is one of strongest men in Bakhtiari, he is at heart friendly and is likely to prove useful to us in the future. For these reasons I trust that arrangements may be made to do him well during his visit. It is only natural that Mujahid should be annoyed at being worsted, but his resentment is now directed much more against Zaffar than Mohtasbam. He and Morteza Quli Khan threatened to go over to the Russians. Mujahid rook much to heart your order of expulsion from Bakhtiari. Finally, i consented to giving him a month’s grace on condition that he visited Mohtasham, apologized to him for his past conduct and swore loyalty to him for the future. It is impossible to feel any confidence in the individual, but6 for the moment I think his wings are clipped. I would, nevertheless, suggest that we should withhold his share of the Oil Company dividends and that Shaikh of Mohammerah shohld he asked to send him a strong letter insisting on his putting in an appearance at Mohammerah immediately. Bakhtiari situation is now much clearer. Addressed Tehran; repeated Ispahan, Basrah. 23 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 4691, dated the 31st March 1917.) Telegram P., No, 277-B.

Season for robberies is now opening and will soon be in full swing. Farman Farma wishes to raise force of irregulars to attach to his own mea for expedition against Lashanis, a well-known robber tribe living north of Lake Niriz, and later for internal Security. As you will have seen from Sykes’ telegram, No. 583, he proposes to divide his Indian troops between Dehbid, Shiraz and Sirjan in practically equal forces. They will do all escort duty and keep tribes in order in vicinity of these places. ’South Persia Rides are to be trained during next six months and are hardly available for any other work. Governor-General’s desire is to (?) organise force to strike at places off the road where Indians cannot go. This duty will devolve later on South Persia Rifles but for present separate force is required. Sykes and I both agree that it is highly advisable. Force to be enlisted consists of 200 footmen and 70 sowars. Total expend iture a month, Tomans 6,700. Force probably required for four months. Addressed Minister, 106; repeated Bushire. Jbnds.

Coalition would I should have thought tend to spur Soulet on to take some definite action on our behalf and that it would be wiser for this reason to have refrained from any specific patting of Soulet on tbe back and to have sent them rather vague reply merely counsel ling them to abstain from actions calculated to create disorders. liepeated to Basrah from Bushire, 16th March 1917. 30 No. 187-S., dated Bushire, the 19th (received 29th) March 1917.

Herr Wassmuss* Manifesto. 2. Letter from Zair Khiihar Khan, Tangistani, to His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, dated 19ih Jamadi I 1335 (—13th March 1917). Enclosure No. 1. Beply to the British Notice. The English in Bushire have issued a notice, which they have circulated among the Khans of Southeru Persia, to the effect that the German Govern ment has made a proposal for peace, and that the Allied Governments of Great Britain, Russia, France, Italy and Japan, have rejected it owing to their want of confidence in the German proposaf. The fact of this matter is that after the occupation of Bucharest, the Capital of Rumania, the Allied Governments of Germany, Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria sent a proposal to the enemy to make peace, in order to put an end to the terrible bloodshed in the world. The defeat and occupation of Rumania which had recently entered the war proved to the world that the enemy cannot be victorious over us, and this view made a deep impression in the minds of all the peoples of the Entente countries, and was even a subject of debate in their Parliaments, and their deputies said that it would be better for them to make peace. Tne President of the United States of America and other Neutral countries made proposals to this effect to the Entente countries, but the authorities in England, Erance, Italy and Russia, know that peace at present would prove their defeat, and they are afraid lest they be held responsible by their peoples. Therefore they had no thought lor this bloodshed and killing of men, and in the hope of bring successful later on sent a negative answer to the Allied and the Neutral countries. Tney sent this answer, not because they bad no confidence in the German proposals, but lest it should prove that they were defeated. Tne British officials in Bushire have published this notice only in order to disgrace the name of Germany. It is evident that the responsibility for the continuance of bloodshed rests on the shoulders of the English Ministers, and those who have become toys in their hands. Also the responsibility for the sinking of ships, which has been forced upon us, rests with them.Thev have written in tlieir notice that the German Government has hr- come so desperate that it is sinking ships. This shows the terrible results that are being inflicted on the English. They did their best to get the neu trals to object to the operations of our submarines, and particularly hoped that the United States of America would join in the war against us. But they did not succeed in this object. We know that this submarine campaign is difficult for neutraLs, and we were willing to stop it, provided the English did not stop the traffic of neutral ships with us. But the English claim ascendency in all the seas, search ever* ship, and take it to their ports. They even seize neutral mails too. One result of this common war will be that the ascendency of English Government at sea will be crushed, and the world will be freed. It is true that we and our Allies have taken Belgium, Serbia and Montenegro, and there would have been no harm if they had added Rumania in the Notice, and also a great part of Erance and as much of Russia as is greater than half of Germany. We did not make this war out of greed, but were forced to fight in self defence. We did not force any of small countries to join us in the war, as the English and French are now trying to force Greece to be sacrificed for their designs. If it, is a question of greed, the Persians need not go far to enquire. They need only think of the actions of Russia and England towards Persia before the war, and the policy of England in India, and towards Maskat, Bahrain, Kuwait, E^ypt, Sudan and the Boers in Transvaal, or the partition of Tripoli, Algeria and Morocco between France and Italy. If it is a question of humanity, the Persians and Mussalmans should remember the shelling of the dome and shrine of Imam Reza, and the hang ing of Lhiqat-ul-Islam in Tabriz by Russians on Ashura day, and the bombard ment by the English of unfortified villages and small ports of the Persian Coast and of Diiwar, and the burning of boats and setting fire to Ohoghadak, where there was only a single oid woman, all of which took place in peace time and on neutral soil. It is expected that no one will now be deceived by the fictitious laws of warfare and humanity made by the English. Such state ment at this time merely indicate their impotence. Wassmuss, The Imperial German Consul at Ahram* Enclosure No. 2. Dated the 19th Jamadi, I 1335 (13th March 1917). From —Zair Khidhar Khan, Tangistani, To—His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports, Bushire. May your shadow never become less upon my head (sarcastic) l I have seen the letters which you have written to the headmen of Khabidu and Bunju in Baraki. I know that Your Excellency knows the character of these people very well, and that you have been forced to write these letters, winch will have no result except the disturbing of peace, and that you have been actuated by others in doing so. In the first place, I will give an account of my visit to Baraki. I left for that place at the earnest request and entreaties of the Kadkhudas and men of Baraki. When I reached there, it seemtd as if they were in a boisterous sea and surrounded by ferocious wolves, who were about to prey upon them. On mv arrival at Karri, I called on all the mischievous mob of men from Dasht], whom both parties had collected around themselves, to disperse. I effected a reconciliation between Muhammad Haji (of Salimabadeh) and Zair Haji (of Karri) and obtained an undertaking trom both of them, that I might shed their blood, if they gave asylum to any mischief-making person, or were otherwise than friendly with each other. In order that the relations of thosemen wlm vvere rilled by Muhammad Haji might return, I deported Muham mad Hap s family to Abul Khair, and sent instructions to Rais Ghulam Ali that they should stay there for two or three months I sot the men to return to salimabadeh, and placed Haji Hasan, the brother of Muhammad Haji in tn al Fai t |‘ h ! s ’ ,a . rd iU 1 made the 8011 of Haji Ali temporarilr the Kaakhuda ot Sahraabadeh in the interests of peace and tranquillity I imprisoned the person, wiio killed a man some time ago at Sahmabadeh; and instructed Rais Ghulam Ah to take 500 tumans from the murderer and pay it to the son of the man who was killed, and also send me a letter of satisfaction irom the brother of the man who was killed. At Rustami a certain Zair Ali Muhammad Ewaz had done some mischief. I punished him fully and deposed him from the Kadkhudaship of the village. I recovered the claims of Muham mad Haji against Zair Haji and others, and paid them to him. 1 have made proper arrangements in the villages on the Baraki Coast. Apparently this was contrary to your wish, while you yourself say that you wish Bersia to continue in order. As your letters to the Kadkhudas of Bunju and Khabidu show, apparently you do not wish relations between two fishermen to continue inendlv You have written to them that they should send their revenue, or that vo*ii would destroy their boats. I on my part am well able to take and burn merchandise from Bushire on the road from Siiief as far as the pass of Gatch to the value of 500,000 tumans. I am even able to plunder your houses outside Bushire. I regret (ironically) your efforts have resulted in nothing, and all that you may do will be equally fruitless. You think that 1 have a country aud many villages, which you will occupy, or that my life is of much value to me or that I have received a promise from God that I shall live 2,000 years. I have worked for God and sacrifice my life in the protection of travellers and the poor. I have taken, and will continue to take, a small fee as protection fee Traffic by all roads is stopped, there is hut one narrow road for travellers open from Bushire to Shiraz. Apparently you do not wish this %oad to continue open. You should think of God, not act unjustly, observe justice and take care that starving poor men do not wish you evil. Firstly, change this policv, for the sake of God, write a letter to the inhabitants of Baraki warning them that if they act contrary to my orders, you will burn their boats, and bombard their homes ; and write a letter of approbation to myself so that I may bo enabled to protect travellers and punish those who worry me. &gt; I ask you to decide impartially—have we behaved badly towards the British, or the British Government since we made peace officially with the British ? I leave it to God to punish those who have disturbed the peace of the travellers or inhabitants. If you are displeased with me you can punish me in another way.

Your telegram No. 1080-S., December 29th last. About 150 tons of flour has arrived here from Bunder Abbas. Average cost landed here amounts to krans 5*55 per Shiraz maund of 7^ pounds. &amp; Present rate of local flour here is krans 6*^5. Meeting of heads of the town convened by liovernor-General requests me to sell flour at rate at which landed here. This will reduce price of wheat bread from krans 4*40 to krans 4 per maund without any loss. At the same time they beg me to continue to pay tomans 10,000 a month for April and May for cheap bread made of barley and maize which is sold at krans 2 a maund. J Their argument is that however much we reduce price of atta we cannot bring wheat bread withinr each of poor people. At the same time, without loss, we are reducing cost of bread for ordinary people. I recommend strongly that authority be given me to pay tomans 10,000 a month for two months as above suggested. In your telegram abovementioned you contemplated a loss of tomans 35 a ton for tons 750 equivalent to total loss of tomans 26,250, whereas arrange ment now suggested means loss of tomans 20,000 only.

To be decyphered by Sykes alone. The military situation in South Persia has recently been under discussion between the War Cabinet and the Government of India. The latter felt themselves compelled to represent that they considered you had not dis played the necessary military and administrative qualities required by your present position. The War Cabinet preferred, however, to retain you provisionally hoping that with recent additions to your stall you would be able to deal satisfactorily with the situation. But you must understand that your retention is dependent on the results of further experience and that you are required to take the advice of experts sent you who will now include a financial adviser. The reasons which influenced the Government of India unfavourably were as follows The Commander-in-Chief considered your distribution of troops on the occasion of the rising at &lt; Kazerun to have denoted a lack of military judgment and the tone of your telegrams when reporting this incident indicated a want of balance and calmness. He has also commented unfavourably on your failure to place the South Persian Bifles on a sound business platform or to furnish any detailed scheme of organisation though constantly asked to do so. Furthermore, it is considered that you have disregarded economy and that your estimates of cost have been excessive. You must realise that expenditure on present scale cannot be tolerate and that the South Persian Rifles must be launched on lines on which Persian Government can afford to maintain it. The Government of India have deemed it right to put the foregoing facts plainly before you in the hope that you will find yourself able to work on the lines indicated.Military Secret. 599 From Viceroy, Army Department, 7th June 1917.

SECRET. Sir Percy Sykes’s Position. Viceroy's Telegram of 28th February 1917. Note by Political Secretary, India Office. r i^e Political Department cannot very greatly mitigate the force of the Oovernrneiit of India’s indictment—in fact the main points in it had already been made here. But there are perhaps one or two things that may be said, lo take the counts seriatim :— (1) There is no doubt that Sir P. Sykes misjudged the situation at Kcinian and on the road, and it was a serious error of judgment to entrust 11- European prisoners to the keeping of 20 sowars (afterwards increased en route to 28 prisoners and 30 sowars). The facts are as follows : — The party consisted of 14 prisoners and three or four servants, escorted by 20 sowars under a “ reliable Persian,” and left Kerman on 15th July. In Snjan (probably at Saidabad) it was to be joined by nine more prisoners and the escort to be increased by 10. Prom Saidabad it was to proceed to Daidatabad (08 miles), where it was due on 2nd August, and was to be met by (1) 10 Persian sowars who had escorted Major Lorimer to Kerman and were to wait at Daidatabad on their way back to Bunder Abbas; (2) a regular escort brought over from Muscat, consisting of 40 Indian rank and file under one British and one Indian officer, and 13 Persian sowars under a Persian officer. They left Bunder Abbas on 22nd July and were due at Daidatabad one day before the prisoners, but the Chief of the General Staff, Simla, had directed (16th July) that they should relieve the Kerman escort as far up the line as possible—so apparently they were not to wait at Daulatabad. Chief of General Staff, Simla, had pointed out to Sir P. Sykes on 13th July that it was most important that the prisoners should have no chance of escape, and said that the escort should be under a British officer. Sir Ik Sykes replied that neither a British officer nor regular troops could be spared, and that, on the other hand, it was unsafe for the prisoners to remain at Kerman after he himself had left (which he did on 26th July). Again on 18th July, Chief of General Staff telegraphed :—“ It is presumed you realise “ great importance of ensuring that none of the prisoners escape, and that “ for this purpose you are satisfied that your orders and arrangements are “adequate.” Sir P. Sykes replied next day, “ I made best arrangement I “ could, realising importance of matter.” On 23rd August they were rescued from Saidabad by Husain Khan and 50 of the democratic party. (2) This is rather vague but not an unfair description. (3) In the five weeks that elapsed between 23rd November and 31st December, a great deal happened. But first as to his “optimism.” His telegram of 28rd November merely says “ Farman Farina confident can “ re-establish authority of Persian Government to Bushire which we might “ possibly visit,” His despatch of 25th November describes in rather glowing terms his arrival at Shiraz (where Farman Farma and Colonel Gough had arrived a month earlier), but concludes with this warning:—“ In conclusion, “ Sir, 1 consider that the situation justified some optimism, but it would be “ unwise to ignore the fact that hostility in Fars is stronger than at Kerman “ and that the presence of the column alone enables the restoration of order “ to make solid headway.” His despatch of 9th December does not deal wdth the political situation, but gives Ids impressions of the gendarmerie whom he had taken over at Shiraz, and ends thus:—“ In conclusion, I am favourably impressed with the force wdiich I have taken over. There will“ be many difficulties to overcome, but I am confident of ultimate success “ provided that the Indian column is kept at my disposal until the new “ force is ready to light the tribes,\ and that I am given, when available, the “ most modern instruments of war in the shape of. aeroplanes, armoured “ motor cars, and perhaps even a ‘ Tank.’ Farm an Farma and Colonel Gough had arrived at Shiraz on 15th October —(“reception accorded” (the latter telegraphed) “was enthusiastic and everything very satisfactory ”). On 23rd Colonel Gough reported “situation generally satisfactory,' and though there was a scarcity of foodstuffs, nothing in his telegrams suggests cause for anxiety before, Sir P. Sykes’s arrival on .12th November. But shortly after bis arrival the scarcity became acute, and was used by the hostile elements as a stick to beat Farman Farma and his British advisers. Moreover, Sir P. Sykes’s position was difficult, because, though he had taken over the gendarmerie, the Persian Government refused to instruct Farman Farma to recognise the fact officially. Soulet’s attitude, too, was doubtful. On 11th December, Colonel Gough telegraphed that the price of bread was rising daily and that ' we are threatened with serious disturbances.' On 17th December the Kalantar of Kazerun attacked the gendarmerie force of 100 men and captured them and their gun, and after seeing Farman Farma, with Colonel Gough, Sir P. Sykes decided to go out with the majority of his column to “ strike hard and at once ” (Colonel Gough, 18th December). Next day, however, Colonel Gough reported that “in view of somewhat unsettled conditions here he is not moving out yet.” In this attack Soulet was certainly implicated and the Qawam’s principal agent, a fact which threw some doubt on the loyalty of the Qawam. On 21st I lecember the rebels followed up their success by capturing the small gendarmerie post at Dashtar jin, and Sir 1 &gt; . Sykes sent out 200 regular infantry with 2 mountain guns and 100 gendarmerie with 3 mountain guns to recapture it (the rebels being reported to number 400). This force advanced to Dashtarjiu without opposition on 24th December, but next day was obliged to evacuate it, with considerable loss, to escape being surrounded. “ Effect of retirement on public opinion will be very bad indeed,” Sir P. Sykes telegraphed on 26th December. It was in these circumstances that he sent his “pessimistic” telegram of 31st December, which runs as follows: — “All information received strengthens view that we are opposed by tribes in Ears and strong party in Shiraz hostile to introduction law and order by ‘infidels,’ and especially hostile to Indian troops. It was expected that column would consist of at least one brigade, and its smallness is now known everywhere. “Farman Farma, Consul, and I hope that with reinforcements asked for in my telegram No. 12^2 C., we shall be able to maintain our position, and we urge most earnestly that they he despatched without delay to reach Shiraz by March.” I do not think that the Government of India have a good case on this point. It would have been a better charge if they had pointed out that the stagnation that has set in since proves that he was over-pessimistic. 5 \4) This is too vague to criticise effectively ; Sir P. Sykes is by tempera ment an optimist and has no sense of humour. (5) 4 his is a good point. As regards the particular incident—he sent Irom Bunder Abbas, on 16th May 1910, a “preliminary budget estimate of the regiment, South Persia Military Police.” The Government of India replied ad interim on 13th June that it would “require considerable revision,” and on 17th June they asked him 13 questions arising out of the estimate, to which he replied on the 19th:—“My letter of 16 th May was prepared under circumstances oi: sickness and constant change of staff, and in stress of organising move to Kerman. Kindly cancel it. It is 1 The experience of the next few weeks showed that even this qualified optimism was excessive, and on 20th January 1917 Lieutenant-Colonel Gough telegraphed “ S. P E. can be looked upon as a negligible quantity for the present- perhaps even as a danger, until l ' their British officers have arrived and have gained confidence of the men. ’ it*w/ t !f% v ' kSy f S . ias i;llle,] fc0 produce any adequate scheme. VV lietlier that is because he is incompetent or because he has had too much else to do, and has not a sufficiently experienced staff, is uncertain. (6) The reference is to the despatch of 9th December quoted above. 1 nave said, he has no sense of humour. As A) he reference is to the evacuation of Dashiarjin. If Sir I\ Sykes’s o^vii statement is correct, the force sent was as stated above—200 Indian infantry and 100 gendarmerie. The reason why he did not go out himself with a stronger force has been quoted from Colonel Gough above, but it would clearly have been better to do nothing than to send so small a force. Moicover. Sir i . Sykes is apparently responsible for the smallness of the gendarmerie force (100 men) originally stationed at Kazerun. (8) (a) This charge cannot be sustained in full. Note the dates :— 17tli December. Capture of Kazerun by rebels. 20th December. Sir P. Sykes asks for 200 infantry. - 21st December. Capture of Dashtarjiu. 22nd December. Sir P. Sykes (on recommendation of I anna, and with entire concurrence of Colonel Gon o h 600 infantry. ' 25th_ December. Evacuation of Dashtarjin (“effect opinion will be very bad indeed ”). 10th January. Sir P. Sykes asks for 1,000 infantry “ in view of serious political situation and large size caravan.” on Farman asks for public But this last remark does show that, as the Government of India say, when he was content to ask for 200 men he “ showed disregard of the danger of an inadequately guarded convoy.” (b) As regards his reiterated demand for immediate action, it may be said m Ins defence that he was familiar with Russian military methods, and that the Russians, when there is a serious emergenev such as he believed (wrongly, as it turned out) to exist, do not spend a great deal o!‘ time on f &gt;r fb2 ra ^ 0 2 8 ’ move quickly. What the Government of India mean by “ dispersion of force ” in this connection I do not understand. x 3rd March 1017. B.S. When the above was written, the Viceroy’s telegram of 1st March had not been seen in the Political Department. We were, indeed, aware from the Government of India’s telegram of 14th February (“ Ways and Means”), that^they had budgeted for 600,000b in the present year, and estimated for the same amount in 1917-18, and we were so alarmed that we telegraphed at once for details to be sent by mail. It seemed incredible that 600,000b could be spent in a year on a force which, on 1st April 1016, did not exist, and on 1st November numbered only 3,000, especially as we’had rejected a grandiose scheme of barrack construction, and the 'Secretary of State in July last, whilst saying that it would be a mistake to economise in British officers, had, generally enjoined “all possible economy.’’p' It is obvious that a force which is eventually to be paid for by the Persian Government must not be launched on extravagant lines. * The present telegram suggests that the 600,000b includes the whole cost of the regular force that is with Sir P. Sykes, and of its operations. If that is so, on the one hand it is not clear what basis he had for estimating 1,000,000b for next year, and on the other the Viceroy’s last remark about the strength and quality of the South Persian Rifles is a little misleading. It is clear, however, that a great deal too much money is being spent, and that Sir P. Sykes’s accounts ought to be audited.Military Secret.

The War Cabinet having again considered the question are not satisfied at. present either that a case has been made out for unifying all the forces in Persia under a single General Officer or that the local situation at Shiraz requires an officer of that rank. They think that unless and until a Turkish advance in force is seriously threatened present arrangement as regards Sykes should not be altered and that it will suffice if Sykes is left in command of the Indian troops in Fars and the Southern Persian Rifles provided that there is attached to him as adviser a military officer of field rank experienced in tribal warfare to whom in practice he would delegate military operations and executive command in the field. Sykes’ relations to Minister, Teheran, will not be changed. Bushire will remain as now under General Officer Commanding, Force “ I&gt;.” As regards organisation of Southern Persian Rifles they think that Sykes’ other pre-occupations may have prevented him from giving sufficient attention to this side of his task, but that relief now afforded will enable him to do so.

War Cabinet have again had question under consideration, especially with reierence to the two above-mentioned telegrams. I' mm such information as is in their possession they are not at present convinced that there is grave or imminent danger of any strono- Turkish advance into the interior of Persia whereby situation in Fars^would be seriously compromised m the near future. They realise, however, that it is desirable that the position of the South Persian Rifles at Shiraz should be lend ere a more secure, b or this purpose the Government of India have been instructed to send immediately the reinforcements mentioned in the last paragraph of Viceroy’s telegram, which will number approximately 1 000 men together with the 10 officers and 53 British instructors, provided that Sir I . Sykes desires and has asked for the latter for the training of the South Persian Rifles. As legaids the position of Sir P. Sykes, War Cabinet feel great hesitation m superseding him by a General of the active Army: in the first place he is an officer with very exceptional knowledge of Persia, he is persona gratissima to the Governor-General of Pars and to Persians generally, while such a change would, a fleet Sir P. Sykes’ personal position so injuriously that it is hardly likely that he would consent to remain as Chief Political Officer to the General in question ; and, secondly, such an appointment might, they feel, give to the South Persian Rifles, and, indeed, the whole situation, a military appearance, which might justly excite the suspicions of the Persian Government and constitute a perhaps inconvenient precedent for similar action elsewheie. 1 he above might perhaps hold good were we to insist on the appointment of a General even nominally under Persian control. I should be glad to know your views upon preceding considerations. Note.— Similar telegram addressed by Foreign Office to Sir C.

The circumstances of our capture and unfortunate betrayal into the hands of the Tangistanis are known ^ to you. The whole incident was as you know the outcome of German intrigue supported by the grossest treachery of the Persian Government Gendermene under their unfaithful Swedish officers and whose native officers handed us over to Zair Kader Khan of Tangistan. The British influence with the various Khans of the Bushire littoral apparently has been of very small^ account, in spite of the Kesidency’s reference to this as “ time onoured relations. Zair Kader Khan has, as far as I can gather, been almost entirely neglected, and the continual interference in local tribal aftairs, such as backing up one against another in their own petty quarrels m place of taking up the dignified and proper course of being if anything an arbitrator, has left British influence in these parts an almost negligible quantity. Much money and cartridges have been distributed in trying to get such Khans ^ as the British B.esidency do consider friendly to help them in this recent incident, disastrous alike to British prestige and influence, but none of these stirred a finger; on the contrary they often informed Zair Kader Khan of such overtures and bribes as the British offered. You will see that a riper soil and material for an active German intrigue could scarcely be found. And a very clever man is Wassmuss, who knows how to take every advantage of every incident, the Germans certainly had. It will be remem bered that Dr. Listemann, the German Consul in Bushire, had prepared the ground by insidious means his arrest and deportation in a neutral country may have been necessary but was carried out in an unfortunate manner, the subsequent occupation of Bushire and hauling down of the Persian flag set fuel to the fire, and many, who would not have been influenced by German promises otherwise, now joined, giving the whole movement a national charac ter. Everything we did seems to have assisted their cause. We tried to remedy the mistake by giving back Bushire, but this again was done without tact, the Resident refused to recognise the Governor appointed by the Persian Government, and moreover actually approved of by our Minister, unless he undertook to punish the troublesome Khans. They at first refused to allow him to enter Bushire thus nullifying our effort to correct the previous mistake2 Once a^ain Wassmuss had a handle to turn successfully. The Khans also felt that the British in no way desired their friendship and continued their flghti™ attitude The whole movement known as the “ Mill ” movement in which the* three Khans, Gazemfar-es-Sultaneh. Zair Kader Khan and Sheikh liussein took at once a prominent part was engineered by Germans and ) collapsed when the Russians drove these mischief makers out of Persia. Our whole effort and immediate policy in Persia should be primarily the suppres- sion and frustration of all German intrigues m the country Even Persian politics must be viewed from the only admirable policy at present, mz.,the attainment of our aim in the great cause and world wide struggle in which we are en^a^ed. No petty revenges or side issues bearing no relation to that should be allowed to influence our actions. Experience has shown us that in Southern Persia such side issues have been allowed to creep in which have materially helped the German cause. Now the three recalcitrant Khans really believed the so-called “ Mili” movement to be a national one (although they' knew the Germans had helped) against what they believed to be Russian and English aggression. They only heard the German views, our people treated them with contempt. It was only when they realised that their aspirations were not national but purely a fictitious and spasmodic attempt of a discontented and treacherous party almost entirely under tbe influence of German o'old that they bethought themselves of veering round. AH the promfses of troops, ammunition, money, which Wassmuss lavishly made them failed and they realised their mistake. The Gazemfar-es-Sultaneh beinf cleverer than the others and not having supplied fighting men at all quietly changed over and owned allegiance to the Government. Zair Kader Khan of Tangistan and Sheikh Hussein Khan took longer and it was only on 10th April that they offered to release us on conditions almost similar to those finally accepted on 10th August except that they asked for an assurance of friendsbip. That was categorically denied tbem another point for Wassmuss— and although they were told their offer had been refused by the Minister and the Indian Government, in tbe same breath, and ultimatum was given the in that, if we were not at once released, their villages would be bombarded and destroyed. W x assmuss persuaded tbem that come wbat might the bMsj 1 intended to destroy tbem, lock stock and barrel and our action looked like i. He urged on them to shoot us all and fight to tbe end. Just at the time ox this threat Zair Kader Khan bad decided to send us all in and after persuation from us prisoners be bad even decided to send Wassmuss off. On the April before there could have been time for a reply to tbe offer made, the military authorities made a raid on a place called Gbokadek and burn a ew palm roofs with a loss of one major and a sepoy killed by snipers, and re lie to Bushire. This was meant we presumed to be tbe fulfilment ot the threat made previously, but such a dismal failure was fatal and most ignominious, besides undoing all our efforts and helping Wassmuss once more. Eor a long time after that tbe Khans would have nothing to do with us and there seemea no prospect of a settlement. Wassmuss managed to recall a consideraoie number of rebel gendarmes under Sultan Ahmed Khan and the trenc es were again manned ready to meet a second threat from Busbire, ^ that if we were not delivered up in five days tbe “ military authorities would not undertake to refrain from taking action after However nothing followed this threat, and we were again able to Drinn the Khans to a better frame of mind. They made tentative ov ® r once more. It must be remembered that they bad bad no sign w a ev of any conciliatory attitude on our part nor any hope of forgiveness, a under tbe circumstances I think we did fairly well in persuading t ^ release us—their hostages—on tbe condition they finally agreed to. J continued to repeat their proposals, omitting the assurance of future n ship, trusting that England would be generous. Their tone was some inclined to be arrogant, but any knowledge of their characters, an as tion with tbem, which tbe Busbire people do not seem^ to have a , sufficient to show that that boastful attitude was only^ skin deep an very little. It was only a pity that tbe Resident intimated rha ^ received authority to treat with tbe Khans and started off by fixing a „ J our exchange, saying that all tbe Tangistani prisoners were 111 was Luckily a little delay took place because on tbe 2nd August the ^ obliged to admit that tbe principal prisoner was not in Busbire. Atdays however the exchange of all of ns except Colonel O’Connor took place. He was kept because the second principal Tangistani prisoner also was not produced and it turned out that he also was lost. It turned out that he had been sent in error to Bombay. He was Zair Rader’s nephew. On the 20th August Colonel O’Connor also was released. A few days before our release the news of the recapture by the Turks of Kermanshah reached Ahram, and, as a proof of what I say that the Khans are really anxious for friendship, Sheikh Hussein Khan wrote to Zair Kader to start us off at once as at any moment the message might reach them from their rebel friends not to release us and they wished to reply that our exchange was a fait accompli. They did not wish to be drawn into any more fighting on account of German Turks “ Mili ” or any other party. Now I find that the desire of vengeance and destruction of these people is the one idea of the Bushire authorities both military and political. If we had nothing else to do and they continued troublesome, of course by all means give them a lesson, but as I said at the beginning of this somewhat lengthy note as we must attend to the great cause first, and if by accepting the complete submis sion of these local Khans we attain by peaceful means, a result which avoids fighting and bloodshed between ourselves and them, who are the only tribe near Bushire or even on the way to Shiraz who really dare to put up fight, surely a very great deal will be gained. The very fact that the Tangis- tanis have made friends with the British will influence many of the tribes and parties further north, and tend largely to prevent any concerted movement such as has been described before. A binding friendship with these people is what we should have had in the past, and it is never too late to change a policy which has been proved to he disadvantageous. The military want to fight, as is their proper spirit, but Imperial interests, it served better other wise, should be paramount. Just at the moment when the Persian influence may gain another and let us hope temporary footing it is most important that we should give no cause for creating a similar movement as occurred last year. If a military expedition is really necessary let it he one to further the real aim of the great war and not occupy itself in little side issues. We have a comparatively small force in the heart of Persia now within 120 miles of Bushire, and to utilize the Tangistanis to keep the road open and he useful to us when they are willing to he friends is too important to he set aside for vengeance or any other reason of a like nature. Besides Wassmuss’ or any other German’s influence in these parts at once ceases. Common sense dictates such a policy yet I fear the Bushire authorities have other views, but I was able in some degree to convey to Major Trevor my views, although we had actually come from what might be termed the enemy’s country, neither the political nor the military made any attempt to get either views or information from us. The Intelligence Department never so much as asked me to tell them anything. I believe the same applies to Colonel O’Connor. However, I would wish my opinion to be on record somewhere, and I pass it on to you to make such use of it as you think fit or otherwise. Wlien I was at home last Sir Arthur Hirtzel of the India Office was good enough to see me. I was able to tell him that from my own knowledge of the Swedish officers the gendarmerie whom we w T ere supporting was doomed to failure. It was nice of any one of the India Office caring to take advantage of outside knowledge. In these days I don’t know how to communicate with these Departments but I feel I should do so and I thought the only right and legitimate channel for me to do that was through my own superiors. Hence my note to you, Sir. I must apologise for its length. I am very very grateful to the Board for granting me this leave to recuperate after our unpleasant experiences all of us prisoners suffered considerably in health. 80 Telegram ft., No. 2097, dated the 2nd (received 3rd) November 1916.

Sir K Sykes, however, objected to this name and proposed ^ushun Junub Iran, meaning 'South Persian Army**. Ihe Government of India in turn objected to this (telegram of 7th August) partly on the ground that it rives false impression of functions of force which will be mainly those of police or constabWry”. phe view taken in this Office was that the force would be 'an integral part of the Persian Array* and that it should be called in nglish *douth Persian Rifles', Sir P.Sykes oeing left to settle a Persian name with the 1 ersian Government (letter to Foreign Office, 16th August).

There does not seem to be any reason wh$ the Persian Government should object to this 'force militaire' being used for military purposes. It will also be seen that the objective of Gir P. dykes*s mission has constantly changed. At one time thethe hunting down of Germans taa uppermost; at another the raising of an organised force; at a third, the support of Persian authority with such force as waa imediately available* j^or the latter purpose he has been in the position of having to make bricks without straw, and until he took over the old gendarmerie at Shiraz the force on which he had to rely for supporting the Parman.Farraa was his own military escort and 130 newly raised South Persian Rifles who had accompanied him* He has thus been in fact more the Commander of a British force than a Persian Officer* fhe transition to regular military control would not tlierefore perhaps be very difficult from the Persian point of view. It should be added that from its initiation until now the Persian Government have not (so far as we know) shown the slightest interest in the South Persian Rifles., nor have they been consulted as to its constitution, pay, equipment, or other details, the expense is being entirely borne by the British and Indian Governments, with but a remote prospect of ultimate recovery. It is difficult to see how it can be otherwise during the war; and the one prospect of creating an efficient force is to present it as a ij&amp;tj accompli to the Persian Government. At the moment, indeed, it does not appear that Sir P. Sykes has any definite scheme in his head, and it is becoming very necessary that an organisation should be worked out in detail for the whole of southern Persia. It is partly because this is not forthaoming that it is desired to place the Commandant under the Array Department of the Government of India i.e. in the hope that that Department will insist on the production of a reasoned scheme.Military Secret. lit «• J C V J r ' y ' in '' brom Secretaryoj State lo Viceroy, Army Department, 2bth January J 917. propped &amp; tf't 'P^ 1 mstnictors mentioned were fnr I S r tri t at V offlcerR and and -.vill be required for that‘purpose whatever 1 our Mot ns Waf^bilt W T 4 d 6 ' 14 ° f Ge r Val raay be ' This question is reserved by u ai Cabinet toi further consideration after receiviim rndip^ tv .. } , Mailing to questions which will be sent m anoOer tefegmm 7 81,(1— ' A ,. x .

The concrete facts before us are 11 ) 1 rom all information it appears that Turks in vicinity of Baghdad will be materially strengthened at an early date, possibly by as much as four divisions ; ( 2 ) the unrest m Southern Persia may be ascribed to German and Lurkish influence among the local tribesmen. From these two facts it is probable that enemy have not lost sight of their aim to push bodies of troops towards Afghanistan with a view to induce Amir to take sides against ns lo accomplish their ambitions the Turks may intend ( 1 ) to endeavour to ovei whelm Maude at Kut-al-Amarah ; ( 2 ) to await advent of floods and the hot weather to pm mm to his present position with sufficient troops whilst utilising bulk of their forces for a movement through Persia, which in view °! a menace to their communications, should the Turks advance ma leheran, is^ likely to follow a south-eastern direction via Ispahan. Climatic conditions favour attack on Maude being undertaken durum- the cold weather; the movement through Persia is preferably a hot weather operation. Jhe _ development of Shiraz situation must therefore depend on success or failure of plan as above outlined. So loim- as we maintain our present position on the Tigris enemy’s plans in Pe?sia are impeded, their eastward move checked, and the arrival of organised enemy forces in South Persia improbable. The features of present situation at Shiraz appear to be: the attack on Kazerun was primarily directed against work of Governor Farman Farina who is known to be our friend ilhe tribal forces engaged were robber bands instigated by German agent Wasmuss and unchecked by Soulet, but they apparently permit caravans and individuals to move up and down Bushire-Shiraz road on payment of toils.In respect of best means of dealing with situation we consider it advisable- Firstly, to raise and organise Southern Persian Pifles efficiently on the same lines as units of Indian Army and to place control and maintenance of this force under the Commander-in-Chief in India who would nominate an experienced General Officer to exercise command and be the supreme British authority under Field Service Regulations, Part 2 , Chapter 3, Section 8 up to the borders of Baluchistan. His authority must be supreme in all matters subject to instructions received from Government of India. His instructions will be issued by Government of India under the orders of Home Government, and after reference when necessary to the Minister at Teheran who will thus have opportunity of guiding policy to be followed. He must be free to act according to need of situation in judging which he will have the advice of his local Political Officers, and in matters beyond their competence that of Minister at Teheran. But on general military policy governing mission strength and object(s) of his force from time to time, he will receive instructions from Government of India who will of course, frame these instructions according to general policy of His Majesty’s Government and after hearing the advice of Minister at Teheran Secondly to encourage trade on the Bushire-Shiraz road and for this purpose to permit rebellious Khans outside Bushire to quietly re-establish relations with us without promising them anything in the future. We have previously proposed this policy but hitherto it has not found favour at Teheran. .f° y° ur particular question and in view of foregoing, we advise (I) against occupation of plain country between Bushire and Daliki a 15 it might lead to complications with the hill tribes and involve an advance into the hills, re. a further commitment if it is to affect situation at Shiraz; also after April the climatic conditions would be very severe for the troops (-) there is no means for reinforcement of Lingah or Bunder Abbas Steps are in tram to send an escort with instructors and staff via Bunder Abbas to bm,'a/, which will be available to reinforce Sykes should the situation there deinano it.

Telegram P., No. T.-40, dated (and received) the 16th November 1916. ( '- From—The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. (Addressed Chief of the General Staff, Force “ D”) Just as a telegram communicating my own view to Army Commander was on the point of issuing I received copy of Army Commander’s telegram to India regarding escort of German prisoners to Bushire. IVTy views were based on hypothesis that it might now be considered expedient to settle hinterland question and in case that view may be taken by Government it seems as well to let my telegram issue and I trust that Army Commander will approve of my ha\mg lepeated to Foreign Department. Telegrawb begins. On arrival at Bushire November 15th I saw correspondence ending with Deputy Chief Political Officer’s telegram 5862, November 11th, asking for my views re^ardin^ proposed escort of Shiraz prisoners to Bushire. Sykes’ telegram 952, November 14th, to^ Chief of the General Staff, India, and Foreign suggesting that certain small reinforcements now under despatch to him should be sent by Bushire instead of via Ahwaz has also reached me. Both these Shiraz proposals ignore state (of) relation (s) existing between Persian and British Governments and Khans of Borasjun, Chahkuta and Tan- gistan. The following is the position :— (1) Vis-a-vis Persian Government. They are rebels and have been officially deposed from their posts. For years they have paid no revenue and they continue to write impertinent letters to Governor of Bushire. The pun ishment of these rebels was on the foremost condition in our announcement to the Persian Government in connection with occupation of Bushire on August 8th, 1915. It is still unfulfilled. Case of Daliki is practically the same as that of Borasjun with whom he is allied. (2) Vis-a-vis British Government. In our negotiations for release of O’Connor and party it was specifically ordered that we were to give Khans no sort of assurance of immunity from subsequent punishment at our hands and I understand attitude of Government to be that they have every intention of punishing them at the earliest convenient opportunity. Borasjun is now engaged in endeavouring to get Shief route closed against us; the other two are harbouring remainder of gang who murdered Besidency Agent, Lin 'ah and his brothers. My opinion therefore is that if it is contemplated to send any British troops through the limits of these Khans to bring prisoners from Kazeroon, their districts must be treated as enemy territory and our force must be sufficient to deal with them at the same time. What precise strength is necessary is a military question but having regard to large numbers of machine guns with General Officer Commanding, Bushire, three battalions should suffice. ^ I suggest, however, that two or four mountain guns would be desirable in addition. Such a force should be well able to deal with hostile Khans and keep road open up to Daliki. Section between Daliki and Kazeroon depends ^ attitude at the mome nt and also of Kashkulis j with strong posts at Dahki, Eahdar and Kazeroon and political energy oOarman Farma 0 ! should anticipate little difficulty however. According to latest information Chahkuta ana could not put up more than 600 men between them and Boras jun 800 at the outside. If slight reinforcements which military opinion considers requisite can be provided from any quarter I would strongly recom mend present occasion be taken to settle hinterland question and open road simultaneously. D will Raye most salutary effect on general situation in ^ Pm 6 .,. f ars - c0n( iifi 0 Ji of affairs will remain eminently unsatisfactory until it is done. J If, however, project not considered expedient at the moment that Governor- eneral with Sykes assistance should retain prisoners until action can be a en on above lines, or until they can be deported safely by another route.Immediate and Confidential.

Dear Mr. Oliphant:- You may like to see the enclosed copy of a report we have received from our Manager in bushire. As regards the Dhazunfer es Saltaneh and his Fixed Deposit of Ts.16,000 which was attached by the Bushire British Authorities you know, I think, all the circumstances, and that I have more than once suggested that, if possible, the attachment should be withdrawn. In view of the release of the prisoners, and the import ance of reopening the Bushire-Shiraz road, it seems more than ever desirable to try and effect a friendly settle ment with this Khan. Yfe shall shortly have £ 200,000 worth of silver at Bushire awaiting transit to Teheran, on account of our Joint Contract with the Russian Bank, and anything that can be done to smooth over matters with the Chief of Borasjoon will facilitate its onward despatch. Wood, I may mention, has just asked us by telegram to send the last lot of silver purchased to Mohammerah, which looks as if he regarded the Bushire route as hopeless. Yours sincerely, (Signed) H. S.

The road between Bushire and Kazeroon is still more or less in a state of turmoil, but from Kazeroon to Shiraz it is reported to be quite all right. Posts are coming through without much delay, and goods going up, but there is a risk of robbery at present, and I have just heard of a caravan being raided and some bales of piece goods being taken off. I sincerely hope that Colonel Cough and the Farman Farma will get a move on them and hasten things; we hear constant rumours of the Farman Farma coming down to personally put things right but the old gentleman always takes his time. I remember him in Kazvin a few years ago, while he was en route to the Kermanshah districts to punish some tribes; the matter was urgent, and he stayed a month in the place! On the other hand there is a lot of clearing up to do in Shiraz and the recruiting and arming of the new South Persia Rifles may take some time; I believe they are going ahead well. I notice that you have shipped £ 100,000 silver to Bushire; I suppose you referred the matter to the Foreign Office before shipping, as I fear it may be detained here for a bit until the state of tne country justifies me in forwarding it. Persian affairs are always kaleidoscopic and the road may be in proper order sooner than I anticipate. II have again seen the Resident regarding the aazunfer es Saltanehds fixed deposit; the (iazunfer as you know is the Chief of Borasjoon and there is no douht that his continued hostile attitude is due to his Fixed Deposit 'being attached hy the British Government. Until this money is returned I cannot convince myself that any Bank Caravan of specie or silver will he allowed hy the Gazunfer to pass through Borasjoon on their way to the North 0 The apparent British political attitude here is that the Gazunfer should approach them in the matter, hut as he does not do this, a state of laissez faire is created. I cannot agree with the present British policy on the subject under discussion; if the Gazunfer will not approach us surely we can approach him. However I got the Political Resident to authorise me to send a message out to the Gazunfer through a third party, viz. Mirza Javad of this office who knows the Gazunfer well, advising the latter to come to some terms with the British Authorities; for example he should not oppose the re-erection of the telegraph lines (these incidentally have been carried off in toto practically all the way from Bushire to Borasjoon (40 miles) that he should adopt a more friendly attitude to the British and assist us in any way we may desire, a few such hints as these are being given to him. It will he suggested to him that he writes to the Resident here bringing up the subject of the attached Fixed Deposit and if he can satisfy the Resident as regards his future attitude, I don’t think any difficulty will be raised as regards the refundment of his money. I am sending this messenger out to him in a day or two and I trust it will have some result.[This Document is the Property ol His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and shouiu be returns cl to the Foreign O ffic 6 when dons with unless required lor official use.] ^ i—&gt;, 9 _ sk.:m (917 PEiroiA.

It is evident from the course of events that the means on which we have relied to restore the situation in Persia have failed. In other words it has been proved that the mission under 3ir Percy Sykes is of insufficient strength fulfil the objects for which it was intended, and it is imperatively necessary to take immediate steps to furnish such requirements in officers, regular troops, machine guns or other material as may be adequate for the fulfilment of our purpose in South Persia. 5 * As earl y as the 12th February, 1916, a force consisting of:- 2 Indian Battalions. 2 Squadrons Imperial Service Cavalry, 1 fountain Battery, 1 . aclxine Bun Detachment, offered by the imperial Government for employment in Persia under the Indian Government. This force was refused by the Viceroy on the grounds that it might imperil the success of one scheme for raising the military police, ventually, however, although a force of:- 2 Indian Infantry Battalions with 4 machine rrons per Battalion, * y l Regiment Imperial Bervice Cavalry, were accepted, and ordered from ,rypi on the 17th April, it was diverted to 1 esopotamia by request of the '.C.C., and the present escort which has proved insufficient, namely:- 1 Section ountain Artillery, 1 Squadron Cavalry, i Battalion Indian Inf.antry, sent to &gt;ir 3 ercy Sykes, and has accompanied him through his lon^ march in i ersia. It should be noted that the Imperial * Government have providedprovided 16 i eraian epealcing officers for the South Persian Rifles and have a further reserve of 10 more who will po out within the next two months. In addition they have supplied material for, and initiated the undertaking of the telepraph line from Bunder 6. The above measures taken by the Imperial Government are quoted in order to point out that the failure noted in paragraph 4, has been due, not to lack of resources, but to the want of a suitable machinery for utilizing these Tlie Machinery hitherto employed has been that of the fQiedpyi yr'ient of the Grov^rnnaent of India* 7. La view of the fact that during the course of the war military operations in Persia must be regarded as of paramount importance, and political questions, though weighty, of secondary consideration, it is proposed that the control ot the South Persian Rifles and their necessary escort s : ould i rimediately be placed under the Commander-in- Chief in India. Sir Charles onro should be empowered to concert, in communication with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, such measures as may be advisable for the requirements of the forces above mentioned. 25.12.1916* %/b. itre-ui resources. ,gC. /c'CVU S' XK8t&gt; /Tne Secy, of state asks ue for a joint note on the Persian situation. Sir i. dykes at Shiraz is confronted by a risii tne tribes on the Buehire Head engineered by the pestilent tribes are really dependent on themselves. If the small force sent out from Shiraz, viz., cm disperse the gathering at Dasht-i-Arjun, tne rising may not become serious, demanding military assistance. xhe only troops ro&amp;dily available are those at Bushire, about one squadron Cavalry and two battalions Infantry. If a couple of funs and mother battalion were added to the force i have no doubt they could spare sufficient troops to form a Moveable Column to round up Borasjun and Daliki at the foot of t-ne hills, respectively 39 miles and 54 miles from Bushire. In any case if we hold^the plain country (Uaehtiatan) on the one ii,nd and dir Percy Sykee/tue c untry from Shiraz to the hills there is good reason to suppose that the movement will not make muen headway as the intervening country has no resources of/ It must og clearly understood that the force at Bushire equipped as it now is, even when reinforced as above, is in capable of a march through the snow-clad hills to nairas rand ' ! therefore we consider that its operations should be limited to the low country.

It is more th-m doubtful whether such reinforcements could in any circumstances penetrate throu^i the hills to the Shiras region. They would be confined to operations in Dashtistan which, while they might to some extent relieve the situation at Shiraz, would not avail to save Sir P. Sykes’ force in the event of it being attacked in overwhelming strength, rd E ar ds para* b, we would remark that though the Viceroy originally refused rhe offer of a force to move with Sykes from Bandar Abbas, the responsibility of diverting to Basra the small force ordered from Kgypt in April 1^16, rested wholly with the Imperial General btaff* Doubtless the diversion was necessary at the time owing to the highly critical state of affairs at Kut* 4) ‘With reference to para 6 , we would point out that, in view of the diversion above mentioned, it is not quite fair to say that the failure to deal with thm situation in Southern i ersia was due solely to want of suitable machinery, and in no degree to lack of resources, The lack of adequate resources was indeed acutely felt during the months when Major O’Connor and his fellow prisoners were detained at Ahram, and the military authoritiesi authorities* v *ith a garrison at Bushire, scarcely 25 miles away, did not feel strong enough to attempt their release. 6 ) *dth regard to para, 7 t we would point out that the ^ control of the Southern Persian Rifles does not rest with the Foreign Department of the Govt, of India but with H.M’b liinister at Tehran acting under th® orders of the Foreign Office in London, *v@ see strong objections to introducing into Persia an Ajl 4 .§P.Qil,d,ent military authority* who would act on instructions framed without reference either to the Viceroy or to the Minister at Tehran, The result might be to place the latter in an impossible position, . We recognise, however* the advantages of placing all military operations, in wnatever theatre of war, under the same general direction; and if arrangements can be made to ensure that military action in Persia will always be taken with due regard to political and diplomatic considerations, which are of the highest importance in dealing with the Persian the question, a d to/viewo of H.M , s diplomatic representatives, we see no objection to the General Staff’s proposal, ‘We also consider that the Gorsmumder-in^Jhief in India, in dealing with Persian questions, should invariably act in consultation with the Viceroy.

I respect fully beg following considerations be taken into account m dealing with subject of Foreign Department telegram, No. 900 S to Secretary of State :— fe ' ’ •&gt; (1) Khans are in rebellion against Persian Government and have been ollicially deposed Irom their posts. (2) In the announcement made by us to Persian Government in connection op'P'dion of Bushire, 8th August 1915, the punishment of o taese iviians was the foremost condition imposed. (0) 1 hey are at present harbouring remainder of gang who recently murdered Residency Agent Lingah and his brothers. (1) dm shire telegram, dated 18th November, reported that they had just ia( ( conference and had renewed oaths of mutual co-operation in resisting any attack upon them, and this is confirmed by telegram Irom Consul at Shiraz, dated 25th November, reporting arrival of a quantity of pamphlets in Shiraz, in which it was announced iat . P eo P , PDshti and Dashtistan were prepared to resist British to the end. In the above circumstances I fail to see how, if we wish to retain a shred ol prestige m lars, we can contemplate embarking on further humiliating overtures to these Khans who have committed acts of hostility against u? unpaialleled in the past. Moreover, there is every probability that terms suggested will be at once rejected at sight on principle of tribal tradition By making such overtures we should not only alienate friendly Khans who have consistently opposed rebels and lost many men in process, but in event ol rejection we should be left with the choice of whittling down terms or of taking military action which we do not wish to do. 1 need hardly say threats ol military action in the uncertain future are much at a discount. On the above grounds Trevor and I are strongly of opinion that if military action cannot be taken now we should allow Farm an farina and Sykes to open road in their own way as proposed by Sykes’ telegram, 1060 0 .”, dated 23rd November, and keep BrrMnkr hands free as regards rebel Khans cruw ‘V2oS ut !&lt;'rom Viceroy, 24th November 1916. [Repeated to Tehran and Bush ire and Basra.) Secret. Shiraz. Minister Tehran’s telegram No. 698 F., dated 1st November, in which he proposes European and Indian prisoners should be deported to Bushire, lias caused us to review whole situation. It is obviously undesirable to attempt to send a small force from Bushire up the Shiraz road. If we are to undertake operations on this side, it must be with an adequate force; no such force is at present available for operations either from India or from Force “ D.” Moreover, Chief of the Imperial General Staff asks us to bear in mind that at the present juncture commit ments in this direction are undesirable. In these circumstances we think European and Indian prisoners should be detained for the present at Shiraz under regular guard provided by Sykes. In view of. numerous escapes of prisoners we think it undesirable to attempt to send them to Basra via Ispahan and Ahwaz. This, however, leaves Bushire hinterland indefinitely in its present chaotic condition which is evidently undesirable, and Bushire- Shiraz route practically closed to us. It seems possible that hostile Khans of Borasjun, Chahkuta, Tangistan and others might be prepared now, if invited, to make such submission to us as might honourably lie accepted, and would result in opening of trade route peacefully and obviate necessity of military operations hereafter. Terms to be imposed might be surrender of Wassmuss and other German agents if within their limits, expression of regret for past behaviour, and guarantee of good behaviour and safeguarding of road for the future, but as regards details to come to consult local (officers ?). This policy may savour of weakness, but we think, taking into consideration strain put upon Khans by German intrigue and rebellion of gendarmerie under Swedes, and their ! friendly] wrangles over Shiraz prisoners, policy of clemency may go further to effect permanent peaceful settlement than isolated military operations in difficult country. Moreover, indefinite protraction of present situation of inert hostility is most unsatisfactory. In any announcement to Khans we should make it clear that in the event of their failing to tender their submission, we intend at our convenience to exact full reparation from them by military force, and that this is their last chance.

SIR HUGH BARRIES, K.C.S.I Chairman, ., K.C.V.Q., etc., etc,, etc.. The Imp.

The circumstances of our capture and unfortunate betrayal into the hands of the Tangistanis are known to you. The whole incident was as you know the outcome of German intrigue supported by the grossest treachery of the Persian Government Gendarmerie under their unfaithful Swedish officers, and whose native officers handed us over to Zaiir Kader Khan of ^angistan^ „ The British influence with the various Khans of the Bushire littoral apparently has been of very small account, in spite of the Residency*s reference to this as 'time honoured relations.' Zair Kader Khan has, as far as I can gather, been almost entirely neglected, and the continual interference in local tribal affairs, such as backing up one against another in their own petty quarrels in place of taking up the dignified and proper course of being if anything an arbitrator, has left British influence in these parts an almost V negligible quantity. Much money and cartridges have been distributed in trying to get such Khans as the British Residency do consider friendly to help them in this recent incident, disastrous alike to British prestige and influence, but none of these stirred a finger; on the contrary the;.^ often informed Zair Khader Khan of such overtures and bribes as the British offered. You will see that a riper soil and. material for an active German intrigue could scarcely be found. And a very clever man in Wassmuss, who knows how to take every advantage of every incident, the Germans certainly had. It will be remembered that Dr. Lister- man, the German Consul in Bushire, had prepared the ground by( 2 ) insidious means - his arrest and deportation in a neutral country may have been necessary but was carried out in an unfortunate manner, the subsequent occupation of Bushire and hauling down of the Persian flag set fuel to the fire, and many, who would not have been influenced by German promises otherwise, now joined, giving the whole movement a national character. Everything we did seems to nave assisted their cause. We tried to remedy the mistake by giving back Bushire, but this again was done without tact; the Resident refused to recognise the Governor appointed by the Persian Government, and moreover actually approved of by our Minister, unless he undertook to punish the troublesome Khans. They at first refused to allow him to enter Bushire thus nullifying our effort to correct the previous mistake. Once again Wassmuss had a handle to turn successfully. The Khans also felt that the British in no way desired their friendship and continued their fighting attitude. The whole movement known as the ’'Mili” move- jr ment in which the three Khans, Gazemfar-es-Sultaneh, Zair Khader Khan and. Sheikh Hussein took at once a prominent part was engineered by Germans and collapsed when the Russians drove these mischief makers out of Persia. Our whole effort and immediate policy in Persia should be primarily the suppression and frustra tion of all German intrigues in the country. Even Persian politics must be viewed from the only admirable policy at present, viz., the attainment of our aim in the great cause and world wide struggle in which we are engaged. No petty revenges or side issues bearing no relation to that should be allowed to influence our actions* Experience has shown us that in Southern Persia such side issues have been allowed to creep in which have materially helped the German cause. Now the three recalcitrant Khans really believed the so called 'Mill' movement to be a national one (although they knew the Germans had helped) against what they believed to be Russian and English aggression. They only heard the German views, our people treated them with contempt. It was only when they realised that their aspirations were not national but purely a fictitious and spasmodic attempt of a dis contented and treacherous party almost entirely under theinfluence of German gold that they bethought themselves of veering round. All the promises of troops, ammunition, money, which Wassmuss lavishly made them failed and they realised their mistake. The Gazemfar-es-Sultaneh being cleverer than the others and not having supplied fighting men at all quietly changed over and owned alle giance to the Government. Zair Khader Khan of Ranges tan and Sheikh Hussein Khan took longer and it was only on IGtn April that they offered to release us on conditions almost similar to those finally accepted on 10th August except that they askea. for an assurance of friendship. That was categorically denied them - another point for Wassmuss - and although they were told their offer had been refused by the Minister and the Indian Government, in the same breath, an ultimatum was given them that, if we were not at once released, their villages would be bombarded and. destroyed. Wassmuss persuaded them that come Vvhat might the British intended to destroy them, lock stock end barrel and. our action looked like it. He urged on them to shoot HfLfight to one end. fust at the time of this threat Zair Khader Knan had decided to send us all in and after ( persuasion from us prisoners he had even decided to send Wassmuss I off. On the 29th April before there could have been time for a reply to the offer made, the military authorities made a raid on a place called Chokadek and burnt a few palm roofs with a loss of one Major and a Sepoy killed by snipers, and retired to Bushire. This was meant we presumed to be the fulfilment of the threat made previously, but such a dismal failure was fatal and most ignomi nious, besides undoing all our efforts and helping Wassmuss once more. Bor a long time after that the Khans would have nothing to do with us and there seemed no prospect of a, settlement. Wassmuss managed to recall a considerable number of rebel gendarmes under Sultan Ahmed. Khan and. the trenches were again manned ready to meet a second threat from Bushire, which said that if we were not delivered up in five days the ,? militarv authorities* w ould not undert a ke to refrai n from ta kin g action af te r that da te.' However nothing followed this threat, and we were again able to bring the Khans to a better frame of mind. They made tentativeovertures once more. It must be remembered that they had had no . .i-gi- v rat ever 01 any conciliatory attitude on our part nor any eope of forgiveness, and under the circumstances I think: we did iair 12 , well in persuading them to release us — their hostages — n tne conditions they finally agreed, to. They continued, to repeat their proposals, omitting the assurance of future friendship, trusting that England would be generous. Their tone was sometimes inclined, to be arrogant, but any knowledge of their characters, and association witn them, which the Bushire people do not seem to have nad, was sufficient to show that that boastful attitude was only shin deep and meant very little. It was only a pity that the Resident intimated that he had received authority to treat with the Khans and started off by fixing a day for our exchange, saying that all the Tangistani prisoners were now in Bushire. Luckily a little delay took place because on the 2nd August the Resident was obliged to admit that the principal prisoner was not in Bushire. After a few days however the exchange of all of us except Col. O'Connor took place. He was kept because the second principal Tangistani prisoner also was not produced and it turned out that he also was lost. It turned out that he had been sent in error to Bombay. He was Zair Khader*s nephew. On the 2^th August Col. O'Connor also was released. A few days before our release the news of the recapture by the Turks of Kermanshah reached AhX&amp;nv and, as a proof of what I say that the Khans are really anxious for friendship. Sheikh Hussein Khan wrote to Zair Khader to start us off at once as at any moment'the message might reach them from their rebel friends not to release us and they wished to reply that our exchange was a ’’fait accompli.” They did not wish to be drawn into any more fighting on account of Germans Turks ”Mili' or any other party. Now I find that the desire of vengeance and destruction of these people is the one idea of the Bushire authorities both military and political. If we had nothing else to do and they continued troublesome, of course by all means give them a lesson, but as I said at the beginning of this somewhat, lengthy note we must attend to the great cause first, and if by accepting the complete sub mission of these local Khans we attain by peaceful means, a resultwhich t'voiap fighting pnd bloodshed between ourselves j^nd them, who ere the only tribe near Bus hire or even on the wpy to Shiraz who really dare to put up fight, surely a very great aeal will be seined. The very fact that the Tangistenis have mr.ae friends with the British will influence many of the tribes ana parties further north, and tend largely to prevent any concerted movement such as has been described before. A binding fx lenaship with these people is what we should have had in the past, and it is never too late to change a policy which has been proved to be disadvantageous. The military want to fight, as is their proper spirit, but imperial interests, if served better otherwise, should be paramount. Just at the moment when the Persian influence may gain another ana let us hope temporary footing it is most important that we should give no cause for creating t similar movement as occurred last year. If a military expedition is really necessary let it oe one to further the real aim of the great war and not occupy itself in little ^ide issues. We have a comparatively small force in the heart of Persia now within 120 miles of Bushire, ana to utilise the Tangistenis to keep the road open and be useful to us when they are willing to be friends is too impor tant bo be set aside for vengeance or any other reason of a like nature. Besides Wcssmuss 1 or any other German's influence in these p; rts at once ce* ses. Common sense alc^t,es such a policy yet I fear the Bnshire authorities have other views. I Wr s * ble in some degree to convey to Mr jor Trevor my views. but although we had actually come from wha t might be termed the enemy's country, neither the political nor the military made any attempt to get either views or information from us. The Intelligence Department never so much as asked me to tell them anything. I believe the same applies to Col. O'connor.

Dyer, Commanding Sistan Field Force, Khwash, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. I have the honour to forward herewith an account of the circumstances under which Lieutenant Duncan and various sowars of the 28th Light Cavalry were wounded at Khwash on the evening of the 28th July. Lieutenant Duncan acted with skill and boldness in cutting off the retreat of a party of the enemy and will I hope be mentioned in despatches. I regret to say he is not progressing very favourably from the serious wound he received. Enclosure. Memo., No. A.-l—469, dated the 29th July 1916. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Claridge, Commanding 28th Light Cavalry, To—The Brigade-Major, Sistan Field Force. On information received by the Intelligence Officer, Major London, that Shah Sowar with some of his followers might possibly attempt to come in for7 6 Either trihe could then be dealt with singly, which was considered satis factory as the physical difficulties of moving in these hilis were known to be reat In order to delay the Yar Muhammadzais, I considered it necessary to make some sort of false movement in the direction of Gazu, and then to move rapidly towards Gusht. This was done by moving to Kamalabad on July 12th and on the same afternoon the cavalry were sent out by daylight in the direction of Gazu for some miles, with orders to return after dark to Kamalabad. This move during daylight would he seen by the enemy from the Morpish Hills, and Lieutenant Brownlow, 28th Light Cavalry, made it still more effective by lighting numerous fires, to represent camp fires, after dark at the end of his forward move. He returned safely to camp alter dark. On July 13th the force moved, without incident, to Hurrah Chah, distance 15 miles; on July 14th to Muzen, distance 11 miles, and on July 15th to Ab-i-Kahugan (marked as Hugenab on the map), distance 15 miles. Luring this last march the advanced guard was fired on, and some of the enemy with sheep and camels were seen moving into a durrah, some 5 miles north of Hugenab. After reaching camp, and after the animals had been watered, 1 Company Infantry, 1 Troop Cavalry, 1 Section Mountain Battery, and some levies moved out under me to attack the durrah. Three Hamanis were killed and 360 sheep, 4 camels, 3 donkeys and some grain and loot were captured, without loss on our side. On the 16th July the column marched to Gusht and on approaching it, the fighting troops deployed for action, as Sirdar Jelal Khan, Gushti, had not come to pay his respects. The deployment evidently had the desired effect, as Gushti hurriedly came out to meet me, and declared that he had only just returned from Jalk and hence his apparent hesitation. It was found necessary to halt at Gusht on July 17th much against my will, as no information of the enemy or the nature of the country or roads could he gathered on the 16th. After offering to bribe Gushti heavily, better information was forthcoming and it became clear that a move in the direction of Kalag, some 3 miles north of Gusht, would draw the enemy on us, as the Yar Muhammadzais and Gumshadzais had collected in full force. Their advanced patrols were seen that evening half a mile north of Gusht. On July 18th the force marched to about 1J miles beyond Kalag fort, which lies 2 miles north of Gusht. This short march was deemed necessary, in order to get as near to either Guz or a place called Saragan, where the Gumshadzais were said to have a prepared position, to where it might be necessary to move. There was much sniping at our piquets during the evening and two Yar Muhammadzais were killed and two taken prisoners, with two rifles and swords. On July 19th a move was made intendedly towards Saragan, hut owing to some misunderstanding on the part of the guide, the column was moved for about a mile in the direction of Guz, causing much annoyance and delay. This was rectified, and the column moved towards Saragan up a defile offering extraordinary difficulties in the way of surmounting the heights on either side, and at the same time protecting a convoy, which in single file would lengthen out to some four miles. Every hill top now seemed to be occupied by the enemy, and he was also reported to be moving with some 200 men towards my left rear. I at once recognised that it would be unwise, after the delay, to attempt to move to Saragan that day, and ordered the force to return to its camp of the night before. Ihe Hazaras had, in the meantime, with great gallantry, ousted the enemy from their sangars on many of the hill tops, and in doing this, reported that two men of a piquet had been wounded and were in difficulties. I was then with the advanced guard with Major Lang and ordered up reinforcements for the piquet, in order to enable it to withdraw. Immediately after this Ihoard that the enemy w Bre in our rear and were preventing any animals from approaching the water-supply at the camp. ^ I went back with the cavalry and machine guns and cleared the enemy away from the water leavmg a piquet there and then returned with the cavalry and machine guns to assist the withdrawal of the Hazaras to cmn which was carried out without further loss. -Uazaias to camp, ; The enemy on this day seemed to be full of fight and usino much ammu nition with little result I decided to play with the enemy for a day o“?wo m the hope of bringing them down to attack me and at any rate wasting much to Wan “rGuz 011 C1BS aCe0rdinS to either On the 20th July, in order to secure a good water-supply and in the hopes of further emboldening the enemy, I retired one mile to Kalag, where there is a tine Karez and a good position for the camp. Th e enemy opposed my move with long range fire and appeared greatly elated at my apparent retreat, and were heard imitating the sound of the fire of the maxim guns. The enemy, though firing thousands of rounds of ammu nition during the day, only succeeded in killing one sepoy and one Mountain Battery mule. At dawn, on July 21st, the enemy made a most determined attempt to reach our camp, having moved round during the night from the north-east to the south-west of us. Evidently Sirdar Halil Khan, Gumshadzai (who had surrendered to me in April when I moved to Khvvash), their leader, thought that my arrangements lor defending my camp would be similar to those which I had made m moving through the open country from Khwash to Galuo&gt;an and thence to Kacha, and that I should have no piquets on the hfidi Mils surrounding my camp. I attribute his boldness entirely to this, and'’thou-h Ms dispositions were good and made with great quietness in the night, he was undoubtedly surprised in the morning by the fire of my piquets above and round him. ^ He and his men fought well, but he must have suffered very heavily, as his sangars when taken by the Hazaras, were found covered with blood and his further retreat was well punished at short range. One man of the Hazaras declares he fired 200 rounds himself at men he could see. At about 10 a. m., firing on the part of the enemy ceased altogether, and I heard that Halil Khan had been killed. I sent for his body in order to make quite certain of the truth of this before reporting it, but I did not collect any more of the enemy dead, as I recognised that a push forward would be necessary and possible the following day and it served no useful purpose to exhaust my hard worked troops in trying to swell the numbers of the enemy’s dead which I might report. The enemy themselves were seen to collect many of the bodies, and the amount of blood told its own tale. I gathered, towards the evening, that the Gumshadzais had run off towards the Safed Koh, whilst Jiand, with his following, had run towards the Sar-i-Drokan. I also got sure news that Jiand’s herds of sheep and goats were at Kahan-i-Gumshad, near the Banderan Pass. I considered that the Gumshadzais had suffered sufficient loss for the present to keep them quiet, and so determind to carry out my original inten tion of driving Jiand, if possible, northwards through the Hast Kird. My further march was unmolested. On the 22nd July we arrived at Chakul, where there was no water, and so moved to the Hinjiruk Nullah, where there was said to be some water. This place is known on the map as Guz, but no inhabitant knows it as such; its proper name is apparently Chakul Lalla. The water-supply is sufficient for 19 horses only at this season. On July 23rd the force moved to Kahan-i-Gumshad, some three miles short of Banderan Pass. En route, we captured Jiand’s herds of sheep and goats to the number of 25 “ Bamas ”, each “ Kama ” consisting of from 300 to 400 animals, totalling some 10,000 in all. This march had been so arduous and the camels so done that I decided to halt at Kahan-i-Gumshad on July 24th.On July 25th we moved to two miles beyond Sar-i-Drokan where there was no water. The column suffered much owing to the extraordinarily difficult piqueting, the heat, and the want of water; a very early march was made on July 26th, through a very narrow defile, in places not wider than 100 yards, with craggy heights rising up on either side in parallel spurs, running down from the Morpish and Gelekoh Eanges. The road itself was easy for animals, hut any reasonable opposition would have killed my force for want of water, and I can only congratulate myself that the enemy had been thoroughly frightened before I undertook this march. The sight of the captured herds reaching water at Gulas is one to be remembered. They charged the watering horses in a mass, brushed aside the sowars and horses and sucked the stream dry for some twenty minutes. No amount of force on the part of my men could move them for a considerable time. On July 27th, we moved to Gazu, burning some Gidans en route and unearthing some sixty maunds of buried grain at Gazu. On July 28th, we marched to Nokju, a very hot march during which numbers of sheep died en route and hundreds more on arrival in camp. There was nothing to be done for the sheep, as I was anxious to reach Khwash. On July 29th, we marched to Khwash, the road being strewn with dead and broken down sheep and goats. The sight was pitiable, but there was nothing for it but to push on, as en route a verbal message was brought me saying that an officer and many sowars had been wounded at Khwash the night before. We arrived at Khwash at noon, when I learnt that Lieutenant A. B.. Duncan, I. A. B. 0. (28th Light Cavalry) and three sowars had been wounded in a very successful affair against some of Shah Sowar’s men, who had come to the Khwashi settlement in order to carry off Shah Sowar’s daughter and daughter-in-law. Nine of the enemy were killed. The sheep actually brought into Khwash numbered 4,000, most of which I have sold to the Kekis at rupee 4 a head, as I have not the staff to look after them, and must go to meet Keyes at Gusht, who, I have this moment, heard, is due at Gusht to-day. I would ask that the following officers be mentioned in despatches for tho very able manner in which they have worked for me during my expedition. against the Gumshadzais :— Captain JkL. Saunders* 86th Sikhs, Brigade Major, who, though not very well the whole time, left nothing to be desired in the way of doing his work, and was always cheerful under the most trying circumstances. Captain {Temporary Major) L, JE. Lang*- —106th Hazara Pioneers, for the very able manner he carried out the piqueting duties, which consisted of 75 miles of continuous piqueting, entailing some 30 to 40 piquets daily up, what looked like impossible heights. The following men have been selected for mention, but X would say that every officer and man who accompanied me did his duty well and to the best of his ability, with cheerfulness and determination, and I cannot say too much for the force I handled and for the manner in which they put up with hard ships which I have left to the imagination, ^ ^ It must be remembered that the force moved, in the month of July, through a country, where water was not to be found in many places where it was reported to exist, and the heat was terrific.

With reference to page 9 of Sir Percy Sykes’ No. 68-P., dated July 19th, to Poreign (N. T. W. S.), re German documents found at Kerman. Owing to the presence of 4,000 Austrian prisoners under a guard of some 50 old soldiers only moderately well armed at a place so near the frontier as Ashkabad combined with considerable details, regarding the prisoners’ camp, which the Germans had thought it wo rth while to collect, there is a suspicion that, should opportunity offer, action there may be intended. That this aspect be pointed out to the Russian General Staff is suggested from here. Addressed Chief of the General Staff, Simla ; repeated Director, Military Intelligence, London. 158 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 8690, dated the 23rd August 1916.)

The pressure10 ■ — on Sirian has been relieved; some Baharlus have gone north others have split into small parties in various directions. Arrangements had been made by him for prisoners to leave Sirjan for Daulatabad under escort of 68 rifles, presum ably Persians, but they had not left ten days ago.

These are obvious, and I have stated that you will not quit Tehran until last moment necessary to avoid capture by Turks. It is pointed out by Gommander-in-Chief in India that Russians at Ispahan might join General Sykes, should they be cut off from General Baratoff. Ends.

As soon as news of Turkish advance reaches Shiraz, efforts will inevitably be made to release Germans and other prisoners at present under arrest there— a contingency which we should do our utmost to prevent. I had hoped that Sykes would arrive at Shiraz in time to make this impossible, but the change in situation here may delay him. Have you any suggestions as to how the removal of the prisoners could be secured ? Is there any chance of effecting it from your end ?

It must have crossed my telegram of August 2bth, No. 560. When I despatched my telegiam JN o. 543 on August 19th, I had in mind chiefly risks of journey to S naz, as Soulet-ud-Dolweh s attitude was then very dubious. As Gough and Barman. Farma have started, it is clear that in their opinion danger is now muc ess than I then thought, and it may fairly be assumed that Farman. ±arma has found means to square Soulet or is confident he can do so or else e would scarcely have started south. As telegraph wire has been cut at Ardestan for a day or two, I am not very well informed as to exact present position south of Ispahan, but as Farman Farma and Gough have been in close touch with events there, we should, I think, trust their judgment. Gough s departure was authorised by your telegram No. 387 and it would produce disastrous results in Shiraz and considerable ill results in other parts. of Persia to recall him and Farman Farma now.17 I must also respectfully urge reconsideration of decision tint d 11 so to Ispahan and thence to Shiva r 1 u y cl ® 10n that Sykes should Russians to offer successful opposition to Tuiddsh 18 v lriSl i fficie f nt t0 enable according to latest information from Baratoff is a vew i^^f 1 *!^ 1 ’ 00 ^ wlllcl1 in the near future and Kussians alone are strong enou^ Cy pi' o“ 1 iK»s , ‘SS.?Kl‘S4“atd' &gt; S^XoSr ,, , t ,„ „„ o„, b , ^^watrasi* 2 rysa‘ 8 e letake Hamadan if his own reinforcements arrive first.

In continuation of my telegram No. 1650, dated 11th August 1916 I have the honour to submit the following report regarding the negotiations with the Khans and the exchange of the British and Tangistani prisoners. After receiving the telegram from the Government of India No 398 S dated 12th (received 13th) July, I opened negotiations by writing* to Zair Khidar on the 13th informing him that I was authorized to negotiate and suggesting a simple exchange of prisoners on the last day of Bamzan. I thought it better to do this, as an emissary from the Soulet-ud-Douleh was with the Khans at the moment urging them to exchange the prisoners On the same day I telegraphed to Basrah reminding about getting the Tan°istani prisoners back. (I had previously suggested this when the subiect of tions was first mooted.) ° I did not receive any answer from Zair Khidar for a week, so sent a reminder on the 23rd July, wffiich crossed his reply. In this he stated that as all he had written to me during the last five months, had produced no result he did not hope for any result from the present negotiations, and he, therefore* preferred to wait and put his trust in God. 5 * I replied to Zair Khidar stating that the reason for the lack of result of his previous correspondence was due to fact that I was not then authorized to negotiate whereas I now was; I, therefore, urged him to fix a day for the exchange. In the meantime I had heard from Colonel O’Connor about the illness of Mr. Christmas. I therefore wrote on the same day suggesting that if the Khans released Mr. Christmas, I would release two of the Tangistani prisoners and, without prejudice to the other negotiations, pay a sum of mone^ which if the Khans liked might be considered a proportion of the cash and tea I sent a hospital mule and a stretcher over with this letter.f, 18 nn the 28th July I received an excessively insolent reply to this letter . Hussain who sent hack the stretcher and mule. After receiving from ShaAh Hussain, who sm 30th July) t0 S ir Percy Cox and this ^f.V^GCelnment of India. The same day (30th July) I received aTecond letter from Shaikh Hussain stating that Mr Christmas would be released and asking me to return the mule and stretcher. 1 also received letters from Zair Kbidar and Colonel O’Connor to the same effect. I at onee sent the mule and stretcher back with a letter to Colonel O Connor. The next night (31st) at midnight I received an urgent letter from Colonel O’Connor stating that Mr. Christmas was too ill to start and could not do the journey without a medical attendant, and that Mr. Ferguson s state of heal h was causing grave anxiety. I therefore arranged with the Kesideney Surgeon to send Sub-Assistant Surgeon Farid Khan over to Abram to etch Mr Christmas across and to attend to the other prisoners at the same time. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Farid Khan left on the afternoon of the 1st August; he crossed Mr. Christmas on the way but did not see him as they went by different routes Mr Christmas arrived here early in the morning of the 2nd August He was weak and badly nourished-apparently because he could not or would not take any food at Ahram-but otherwise well. I may here mention that Sub-Assistant Surgeon Farid Khan went on to Ahram arriving there on the mornino- of the 3rd. He examined Mr. Smith and found he had accelerated heart action, but apparently nothing organically wrong: apparently the accelerated action was brought on by nervous excitement. He also examined the other prisoners who were reported to have had heat strokes. I hey had do fever when he was there and were apparently well. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Farid Khan returned to Bushire on the evening of the 5th instant, having carried out his mission with courage and discretion. The same day I released two Tangistani prisoners, one Mulla Ghulam for whom Zair Khidar asked and the other Ahmed Ghulam. The latter was selected by the Officer Commanding Troops as no second name was suggested and as he appeared sick, and I had mentioned that a sick man would be appropriate. I received two or three insulting letters from the Khans, because I had let this man go : they said he was an imbecile and no fighting man, and 1 had let him go to insult them, etc., etc. I replied that Ahmed Ghulam was released, because he was sick and that if they did not want him and would send him back I would release some one else. I received no answer to this. In the meanwhile on the 29th July I received a telegram from Basrah that the Tangistani prisoners from India had left Bombay in the H. T. “ Ellenga ” on the 21th instant and that the Master had been instructed to drop the prisoners at Bushire : I was also asked if the two Tangistani prisoners, who had remained in Basrah all the time should be sent down or remain till called for. The “Ellenga ” arrived on the 30th and the prisoners were duly landed. I reported this to Basrah the same day, and asked that the other two prisoners should be sent to Bushire by the first opportunity. On the 2nd August I received a telegram saying that the military authorities had sent one prisoner, Zair Hussain, to Bombay by mistake on the 29th July, and had telegraphed for his immediate return. On the 2nd August I wrote a letter to the Khans on the lines indicated in my telegram No. 1584, dated 30th July. Subsequently, on the 4th August after receipt of the telegram No. 482-S,, dated 2nd August, from the Govern ment of India, I wrote again and cancelled the two paragraphs about the confis cated cash and tea, and informed the Khans that I was authorized to hand these over in whatever manner they liked. I further suggested that, as their con ditions had been conceded, the prisoners might be exchanged without further ado, and suggested daylight on the Mashileh, a short distance in front of our outpost line, on the 8th or 9th August as being a suitable time ; 1 mentioned these dates, as Khalu Hussain, the principal Tangistani prisoner, was not due to arrive from Basrah until the 7th or 8th August. On the 6th August I received letter from Shaikh Hussain asking for a separate assurance regarding the opening of the road, and stating that if this were given the prisoners would be exchanged on the day fixed. I replied on19 the 7th stating categorically that the tea and cash would he handed n ™. ,, restrictions against travellers and mnvpmAre nf , u uia oe nanded over and would be removed during dayh^t hou; cTratus wn ?, ‘ I'’ r ° ad inspection by a representative of the Governor and men b f e , sub J® ot to to enter the Island armed.

I accordingly wrote alToT thfftf, f ° r Khans to agree to the 10th for the exchange; I also sent a semrate^letter of assurance regarding the road to Shaikh Hussain. feparaie letter ot On the evening of the 8th August I received a letter from Colonel 0 Connor saying the prisoners had been brought to Gurak and that Z and the Khans had arranged for the exchange to take place on Wednesdav ten i afternoon at o-30 r. M. This necessitated a great deal of work on Wednes day morning tor Major Rae, First Assistant Resident, who had to draw the money and get the interest from Haji Abdur Rasnl, and have thl tea all carted out to the outpost line, &amp;c. The Officer Commandin .- Troops had to make many arrangements also. However, at about 2 pm on the 9th instant, I received an urgent letter from Colonel O’Connor saying that the Khans now refused to let them go, as the separate assur! anee regarding the road given m my letter of the 8th did not satisfv Shaikh Hussam. He enclosed a draft agreement drawn up by the Khans which he suggested I should sign and return. I attach a translation of this document. As it was headed “ Treaty of peace (Sulhnameh) between the British Government and Zair Kbidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan made &amp;o.,&amp;c. I wrote to Colonel O’Connor that I was not authorized to steu such a document but I enclosed an assurance from myself regarding the road couched m very similar language, which was as far as I could go: if the Khans would not accept this, it would be necessary to telegraph to Govern ment about the matter. A copy of my assurance is enclosed. The next morning I received a letter from Colonel O’Connor sayin^ that the Khans accepted my assurance, and that he had agreed with the Khans that the exchange should take place at 5-30 p. M. that afternoon, Thursday the 10th August. J ’ This afternoon timing again caused considerable inconvenience, and the arrangement accepted by Colonel O’Connor, viz., that the tea and cash and Tangistani prisoners should all he sent out to Sar-i-Bast, about 4 miles outside our outpost line, and that guard should not exceed 20 men, was all in favour of the Khans. However, it seemed best to accept it as not to do so mMit delay the matter indefinitely. So I contented myself with writing to Colonel O’Connor to say that only 20 men should accompany them : if we saw more we should not send out our small guard; if more than 20 men accompanied the prisoners from Gurak, all except 20 should remain a mile or two away from the spot fixed for the exchange. On the 9th instant I had arranged to go out myself to settle the exchange. But several people suggested that it would be a mistake for me to do so, as Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidar would probably try to be friendly and might ask for verbal assurances of pardon, &amp;c. 1 therefore decided to send Major Bae, First Assistant Besident, out with the prisoners, and remained myself in the outpost line. At the last minute Lieutenant-Colonel Evans, Commanding- Troops, decided to accompany Major Bae. The camels which were to tike the tea had arrived late and some considerable delay ensued before they could be loaded up. Eventually they got off, and Colonel Evans and Major Bae with the cash and tea and the prisoners in the charge of a guard of 20 men started otf with the son of Haji Bais-ut-Tujjar and Haji Muhammad Hassan as witnesses of the exchange by special request of the Khans. Haji Muhammad Hassan was sent aheau to tell the Khans that the tea and cash and prisoners were on their way out and to ask them to bring the British prisoners nearer as it would delay matters so much to go out 4 miles. However, the KhansMRiPBi — ~ as soon as he the Khans to 20 were too suspicions of our intentions to do this. When the party had got about two rmles out a confidential slave of Zair Khidar s named Khusm ealloned up, with a note from Colonel O’Connor saying they had arrived and that no trick was intended by the Khans. Major Rae invited him to assure himself that the escort was only 20 men and that the tea, cash and prisoners were there. Khusru noticed that there was one prisoner short. Maior Rae told him that one prisoner had been sent to India from Basrah by mistake, but had been sent for and would be released arrived. Major Rae also asked Khusru to try and get advance their party as far as possible, and he then galloped off. Ihe party went on anotlJ li to 2 miles and then halted. There another of the Khans’ men came up with Haji Muhammad Hassan and asked about the missing nrisoner savin- “if he is dead, say he is dead, and the matter will be ended.” Maior Rae replied that the man was not dead, but had been sent to India by mistake and would be got back and released as soon as possible. Haji Muhammad Hassan told Major Rae that the Khans were about a mile off with the prisoners and a large following. Conversation then ended and Haji Muham- mad Has«an and his companion went back. After sometime Khusru galloped up with a note from Colonel O’Connor saying that the Khans had decided to keep a prisoner until their missing prisoner arrived and that he was to be the one kept • he had agreed to this and was going back to Gurak. He asked Major Rae to send up the tea, cash and the nine Tangistani prisoners on receipt of the other five British prisoners. This Major Rae agreed to do and Khusru went off with his reply. After a considerable time the five prisoners arrived in charge of some of the Khans’ men. Major Rae then hamded over the money and the tea, and the exchange was effected. All this had taken a very long time and it was then about 11 p. m. Colonel Evans and Major Rae then returned to the outpost line with the five prisoners arriving there at about 12-30 A. M. During all this time the officers in the outpost and I had been getting very anxious, and we were heartily glad to see the prisoners, though of course very sorry to hear Colonel O’Connor had been detained. It turned out that all the trouble had occurred, because the missing prisoner was Zair Hussain Baghaki (referred to in the correspondence ending with my letter No. 68-C., dated 28th February 1916). Zair Hussain is a very common name in Tangistan and Dashti, and when I received the telegram from Basrah saying that Zair Hussain had been sent to Bombay by mistake, I did not connect him with Zair Hussain Baghaki, Zair Khidar’s nephew. It was an unfortunate mischance which caused this man to be sent to Bombay: if any other prisoner except him (and Khalu Hussain) had been absent it would not have mattered at all, the matter could have been settled at once by a simple assurance of his release on return. As it was the suspicions of the Khans w r ere aroused. On the other hand, if I had informed the Khans in advance that this prisoner was not present, they would probably have put off the exchange altogether until he was forthcoming. As a matter of fact, as he left Basrah on the 29th July, I had some hopes that he might have turned up at Bushire by the mail of the 10th instant. If he had he would have been just in time. 1 gather from the prisoners that the Khans did not themselves wish to keep Colonel O’Conner whom they regarded as too important a personage to keep for such a man : they suggested Mr. Ferguson, or one of the others. As Mr. Ferguson’s wife and daughters were waiting for him and the other prisoners had all recently been ill at Abram, Colonel O’Connor apparently volunteered to stay, and more or less insisted on doing so. Up to the present time I have not, I am sorry to say, been able to get any news of the missing Zair Hussain ; when 1 do and can say with certainty where he is and w hen he may be expected here, I think 1 may be able to get Colonel O’Connor released in advance on an assurance. Colonel O’Connor writes that he is being very well treated and that everybody is very polite and that he is being treated as a guest. I regret that this letter should have grown to such inordinate length, but it seemed to me advisable to report all the negotiations in detail. In con clusion, I beg to attach, for the information of the Government of India, ann extract from a letter from a friendly Tangistani of the old Khans familv giving cover to a copy of a notice published in Borasjun purporting to give ti l “ terms of P e ? c ® ^een the British Government and the Khans.

Extract from a letter from Eassan Khan, bin All Khan, Tangistani, Chah Arabi (Borasjun) to K. G. Chick, Esq., C.I.E., 8fc., 8fC., Bushire, dated 11th Shawwal, 1334 (= 11th August 1916) received 13th August 1916. ******* There is no news from Borasjun worthy of mention, except that the day before yesterday a copy of the terms of peace reached Mirza Muhammad Reza,W.(5) ^ MuEshi of Wassmnss, from the rebels. He has posted the original _ of that copy of the terms of peace at the entrance of the bazaar of JBorasjun, and. afterwards sent copies of it to everyone in Dashtistan, to Shiraz and Kazerun. The Borasjunis are rejoicing greatly over the news of the peace- obtained) by the Mujahidin, and this copy of the terms of _ peace : in fact, in ) their meetings they do nothing else but taunt, and speak slightingly of Haida r Khanf They say that by dint of force Shaikh Hussain has opened the Shahi and that the British Government has complied with every demand they had. The say that it was beneath the dignity of the British Government to Ji make peace *with Shaikh Hussain of the Dumukh : of a certainty they must have received a defeat somewhere. boasting which I heard, I w'as not able to stand hearing it, and after copying the terms of peace returned home. I have sent this copy of the terms of peace to you, so that if they have written anything false, you may particularly send me a copy of the terms of exchan ge of the prisoners, so that I may show it to the friends I have for their information. * * * * * * * Result of the valuable services of Salar-i-Islam and Amir-i-Islam or the victorious temporary peace of the Mujahidin of Southern Rersia. It has become evident to all the world that Zair Khidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan, in order to put an end to the encroachments and high-handedness of the British, have persevered, and demanded the Germans whom the British have taken off from the interior of our country; and that they have fought for a whole thirteen months, without any assistance from the other tribes of Persia. Both sides have done to the full all that was possible for the prosecution of the war and hostility : a small number of the British were in the hands of the Mujahidin, and a small number of the Mujahidin in the hands of the British. Now the British have clearly under stood that they have no powe r to resist, and have agreed to make peace: they have accepted all the demand s of the Mujahidin, and the Mujahidin, as their original object was to restore the honour of the country, which had been violated, have also agreed to this peace. The terms of peace have been arranged according to the folio win o- state ment :—• On the 8th day of Shawwal 1334, these terms of peace, as stated below, were latified, signed, and exchanged betw r een the British Government and Zair Khidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan. The British Government agrees to the following terms: (1) The return of the Tangistani and Dashti prisoners, taken in the fighting, among whom Khalu Hussain of Dashti, and evervone else whom they hold. (2) The return of Haji Ali of Tangak, and his followers. (3) The release of the Germans who were seized in the Persian Gulf, i. e.j the Consul, and the German merchant and his wife in ushire, and the German Doctor at Bandar Big, and three other German merchants, who were seized in the Persian ports. (4) The handing oyer of the confiscated tea belonging to people of langistan, which was seized in Bahrain. o r r (5) The surrender of the 10,000 tomans of Shaikh Hussain Khan, Salar- i-lslam, which was seized in Bushire. (6) The opening and freedom (from restriction) of the road to Bushire or t e passage and traffic of all the people, in particular the peop e of langistan, and the cessation of interference with anyone passing. The Shahi route to be as formerly by Ahmedi ana no change fo be made in it. If in Ahmedi or Tangistan Borasjun on business : but on account of the excessiveterritory any robbery occurs, British officials to have no right to lement and tracing of the robbers are thelrht of the Kalantar of that territory, in which that robbery took place. Salar-i-Islam and Amir-i-Islam accept the following conditions (1) The return of the British prisoners, eight in number: two of whom tnf fh 00 ^ ° i t i hel / t llness &gt; and in v iew of the extreme humanity (of the Khan), had been previously released. (2) Responsibility for the Shahi road to be with them: if goods are lost, they will pay compensation for them. (3) They agree to having the telegraph line, after it is repaired.

They went off in easterly direction and are believed to be in the neighbourhood of Balward about longitude 56-15, latitude 29*30. Shahzada Hussain, who had been put in charge by Sykes, accompanied them probably willingly. Boerrill had just arrived, but had not seen them. I am doing all I can do towards raising tribes with a view to rounding up prisoners and securing them and their rescuers dead or alive.

Captain Merrill, who was sent from Kerman to Sirjan to take prisoners to Baft in view of interchange at Sirjan, reports on August 22nd that on his arrival prisoners fled eastwards towards Baft and are now in hill district of Balward(?) about 25 miles east of Sirjan. They are apparently trying to collect men and their guard appears to have been won over. Please instruct Kerman direct, as action is being taken from there.17 I must also respectfully m4c reconsideration of decision that Sykes should go to Ispahan and thence to ^Shiraz. His force is insufficient to enable Russians to offer successful opposition to Turkish regular troops which according to latest information fr^m Baratoff is a very improbable contingency in the near future and Russians alone are strong enough to hold Isnahan against any Persian attack. Sykes’ force however sufficient to ensure safety of affairs at Shiraz where our chief interests lie. J There is unanimity of friendly dpinion here as to necessity for followino' our original plan of allowing Farman Parma and Consul to proceed to Shira! followed as soon as possible by Sykes, and we must he prepared if it is abandoned to see situation there entirety collapse as Kawam’s situation which is not an easy one will be untenable as soon as it is seen that we cannot come to him. . 1 would &gt; however, point out that dedision to alter Sykes’ move was taken in consequence of threatening military position. That position, however, is daily improving, and Akbar Mirza, who has iust returned to Tehran from the front, has been informed by General Officer Commanding that he considers that Turks whuld be incapable without consi derable reinforcements of attacking him and that he expects to be able to retake Hamadan if his own reinforcements arrive first. Hence actual situation does not appear to warrant decision which will have such untoward and far-reaching results. Addressed London Foreign Office; repeated Sykes and Gough. 188 No. 306-C., dated Bushire, the 14th (received 23rd) August 1916. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T° The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my telegram No. 1650, dated 11th August 1916 I have the honour to submit the following report regarding the negotiations with the Khans and the exchange of the British and Tangistani prisoners. After receiving the telegram from the Government of India, No. 398-S. dated 12th (received 13th) July, I opened negotiations by writing to Zair Khidar on the 13th informing him that I was authorized to negotiate, and suggesting a simple exchange of prisoners on the last day of Bamzan. I thought it better to do this, as an emissary from the Soulet-ud-Douleh was with the Khans at the moment urging them to exchange the prisoners. On the same day I telegraphed to Basrah reminding about getting the Tanristani prisoners back. (I had previously suggested this when the subject of negotia tions was first mooted.) I did not receive any answer from Zair Khidar for a week, so sent a reminder on the 23rd July, which crossed his reply. In this he stated that, as all he had written to me during the last five months, had produced no result he did not hope for any result from the present negotiations, and he, therefore' preferred to wait and put his trust in God. I replied to Zair Khidar stating that the reason for the lack of result of his previous correspondence was due to fact that I was not then authorized to negotiate whereas I now was; I, therefore, urged him to fix a day for the exchange. In the meantime I had heard from Colonel O’Connor about the illness of Mr. Christmas. I therefore wrote on the same day suggesting that, if the Khans released Mr. Christmas, I would release two of the Tangistani prisoners, and, without prejudice to the other negotiations,, pay a sum of monev, which if the Khans liked might be considered a proportion of the cash and* tea. I sent a hospital mule and a stretcher over with this letter.On the 28th July I received an excessively insolent reply to this letter from Shaikh Hussain, who sent hack the stretcher and mule. After receiving this letter I sent my telegram No. 1584, dated 30th July, to Sir Percy Cox and repeated it to the Government of India. The same day (30th July) I received second letter from Shaikh Hussain stating that Mr. Christmas would be released and asking me to return the mule and stretcher, 1 also received letters from Zair Khidar and Colonel 0*Connor to the same effect. 1 at once sent the mule and stretcher back with a letter to Colonel O’Connor, The next night (31st) at midnight I received ^ an urgent letter from Colonel O’Connor stating that Mr. Christmas was too ill to start and could not do the journey without a medical attendant, and that Mr.^ Eerguson’s state of health was causing grave anxiety. I therefore arranged with the Residency Surgeon to send Sub-Assistant Surgeon Earid Khan over to Abram to fetch Mr. Christmas across and to attend to the other prisoners at the same time. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Earid Khan left on the afternoon of the 1st August; he crossed Mr. Christmas on the way but did not see him as they went by different routes. Mr. Christmas arrived here early in the morning of the 2nd August. He was weak and badly nourished—apparently because he could not or would not take any food at Abram—but otherwise well. I may here mention that Sub-Assistant Surgeon Earid Khan went on to Ahram arriving there on the morning of the 3rd. He examined Mr. Smith and found he had accelerated heart action, but apparently nothing organically wrong: apparently the accelerated action was brought on by nervous excitement. He also examined the other prisoners who were reported to have had heat strokes. They had no fever when he was there and were apparently well. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Earid Khan returned to Bushire on the evening of the 5th instant, having carried out his mission with courage and discretion. The same day I released two Tangistani prisoners, one Mulla Ghulam for whom Zair Khidar asked and the other Ahmed Ghulam. The latter was selected by the Officer Commanding Troops as no second name was suggested and as he appeared sick, and I had mentioned that a sick man would be appropriate. I received two or three insulting letters from the Khans, because I had lei this man go : they said he was an imbecile and no fighting man, and 1 had let him go to insult them, etc., etc. I replied that Ahmed Ghulam was released, because he was sick and that if they did not want him and would send him back I would release some one else. I received no answer to this. In the meanwhile on the 29th July I received a telegram from Basrah that the Tangistani prisoners from India had left Bombay in the H. T. “ Ellenga ” on the 24th instant and that the Master had been instructed to drop the prisoners at Bushire: I was also asked if the two Tangistani prisoners, who had remained in Basrah all the time should be sent down or remain till called for. The “ Ellenga ” arrived on the 30th and the prisoners were duly landed. I reported this to Basrah the same day, and asked that the other two prisoners should be sent to Bushire by the first opportunity. On the 2nd August I received a telegram saying that the military authorities had sent one prisoner, Zair Hussain, to Bombay by mistake on the 29th July, and had telegraphed for his immediate return. On the 2nd August I wrote a letter to the Khans on the lines indicated m my telegiam No. 1584, dated 30th July. Subsequently, on the 4th August after receipt of the telegram No. 482-S., dated 2nd August, from the Govern ment of India, I wrote again and cancelled the two paragraphs about the confis cated cash and tea, and informed the Khans that I was authorized to hand these oyer m whatever manner they liked. I further suggested that, as their con ditions had been conceded, the prisoners might be exchanged without further ado, and suggested daylight on the Mashileh, a short distance in front of our outpost line, on the 8th or 9th August as being a suitable time ; 1 mentioned these dates, as Khalu Hussain, the principal Tangistani prisoner . principal Tangistani prisoner, was not to arrive from Basrah until the 7th or 8th August. due On the 6th August I received letter from Shaikh Hussain askin 0, for a separate assurance regarding the opening of the road, and stating that° if this were given the prisoners would be exchanged on the day fixed. I replied on19 the 7th stating categoneally that the tea and cash would be handed over and restrictions against trave lers and movement of merchandise on the Shahi road would be removed during daylight hours; caravans would be subiect to inspection by a representative of the Governor and men would not be allowed to enter the Island armed. I suggested the exchange for daybreak on Thursday This ietter crossed one from Colonel O’Connor stating that the Khans suggested Friday, 11th August, at sunrise at Sar-i-Bast, fou? or five miles out on the Mashileh, and another letter from Shaikh Hussain asking for a separate assurance about the road. I accordingly wrote again on the 8th, asking the K ans to agree to the 10th for the exchange; I also sent a separate letter of assurance regarding the road to Shaikh Hussain. On the evening of the 8th August I received a letter from Colonel 0 Connor saymg the prisoners had been brought to Gurak and that he and the Khans had arranged for the exchange to take place on Wednesday (9thl afternoon at o-30 p. m. # This necessitated a great deal of work on WedneJ day morning for Major Rae, First Assistant Resident, who had to draw the money and get the interest from Haji Abdur Rasul, and have the tea all carted out to the outpost line, &amp;c. The Officer Commanding Iroops had to make many arrangements also. However, at about 2 p on the 9th instant, I received an urgent letter from Colonel O’Connor saying that the Khans now refused to let them go, as the separate assur ance regarding the road given in my letter of the 8th did not satisfy bhaikh Hussain. He enclosed a draft agreement drawn up by the Khans which he suggested I should sign and return. I attach a translation of this document. As it was headed s; Treaty of peace (Sulhnameh) between the British Government and Zair Khidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan made &amp;c., &amp;c.” I wrote to Colonel O’Connor that I was not authorized to sio*n such a document but I enclosed an assurance from myself regarding the road couched in very similar language^which was as far as I could go: if the Khans would not accept this, it would be necessary to telegraph to Govern ment about the matter. A copy of my assurance is enclosed. The next morning I received a letter from Colonel O’Connor saying that the Khans accepted my assurance, and that he had agreed with the Khans that the exchange should take place at 5-30 p. m. that afternoon, Thursday, the 10th August. J ’ This afternoon timing again caused considerable inconvenience, and the arrangement accepted by Colonel O’Connor, viz., that the tea and cash and Tangistani prisoners should all be sent out to Sar-i-Bast, about 4 miles outside our outpost line, and that guard should not exceed 20 men, was all in favour of the Khans. However, it seemed best to accept it as not to do so migkfc delay the matter indefinitely. So I contented myself with writing to Colonel O’Connor to say that only 20 men should accompany them : if we saw more we should not send out our small guard; if more than 20 men accompanied the prisoners from Gurak, all except 20 should remain a mile or two away from the spot fixed for the exchange. On the 9th instant I had arranged to go out myself to settle the exchange. But several people suggested that it would be a mistake for me to do so, as Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidar would probably try to be friendly and might ask lor verbal assurances of pardon, &amp;c. 1 therefore decided to send Major Rae, First Assistant Resident, out with the prisoners, and remained myself in the outpost line. At the last minute Lieutenant-Colonel Evans, Commanding Troops, decided to accompany Major Rae. The camels which were to tike the tea had arrived late and some considerable delay ensued before they could be loaded up. Eventually they got off, and Colonel Evans and Major Rae with the cash and tea and the prisoners in the charge of a guard of 20 men started off with the son of Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar and Haji Muhammad Hassan as witnesses of the exchange by special request of the Khans. Haji Muhammad Hassan was sent ahead to tefl the Khans that the tea and cash and prisoners were on their way out and to ask them to bring the British prisoners nearer as it would delay matters so much to go out 4 miles. However, the Khans20 were too suspicious of our intentions to do this. 'W hen the party had got about two miles out a confidential slave of Zair Khidar’s, named Khusru, galloped up, with a note from Colonel O’Connor, saying they had arrived and that no trick was intended by the Khans. Major Rae invited him to assure himself that the escort was only 20 men and that the tea, cash, and prisoners were there. Khusru noticed that there was one prisoner short. Major Rae told him that one prisoner had been sent to India from Easrah bv mistake, but had been sent for and would be released as soon as he arrived. Major Rae also asked Khusru to try and get the Khans to advance their party as far as possible, and he then galloped off. The party went on another 1J to 2 miles and then halted. There another of .the Khans’ men came up with Haji Muhammad Hassan and asked about the missing prisoner, saying “if he is dead, say he is dead, and the matter will be ended.” Major Rae replied that the man was not dead, but had been sent to India by mistake and would be got back and released as soon as possible. Haji Muhammad Hassan told Major Rae that the Khans were about a mile off with the prisoners and a large following. Conversation then ended and Haji Muham mad Hassan and his companion went back. After sometime Khusru galloped up with a note from Colonel O’Connor saying that the Khans had decided to keep a prisoner until their missing prisoner arrived and that he was to be the one kept: he had agreed to this and was going back to Gurak. He asked Major Rae to send up the tea, cash and the nine Tangistani prisoners on receipt of the other five British prisoners. This Major Rae agreed to do and Khusru went off with his reply. After a considerable time the five prisoners arrived in charge of some of the Khans’ men. Major Rae then handed over the money and the tea, and the exchange was effected. All this had taken a very long time and it was then about 11 p. m. Colonel Evans and Major Rae then returned to the outpost line with the five prisoners arriving there at about 12-30 a. M. During all this time the officers in the outpost and I had been getting very anxious, and we were heartily glad to see the prisoners, though of course very sorry to hear Colonel O’Connor had been detained. It turned out that all the trouble had occurred, because the missing prisoner was Zair Hussain Baghaki (referred to in the correspondence endin” with my letter No. 68-C., dated 28th Eebruary 1916). Zair Hussain is a very common name in Tangistan and Dashti, and when I received the telegram from Basrah saying that Zair Hussain had been sent to Bombay by mistake, I did not connect him with Zair Hussain Baghaki, Zair Khidar’s nephewl It was an unfortunate mis chance which caused this man to be sent to Bombay: if any other prisoner except him (and Khalu Hussain) had been absent it would not have mattered at all, the matter could have been settled at once by a simple assurance of his release on return. As it was the suspicions of the Khans were aroused. On the other hand, if I had informed the Khans in advance that this prisoner was not present, they would probably have put off the exchange altogether until he was forthcoming. As a matter of fact, as he left Basrah on the 29th July, I had some hopes that he might have turned up at Bushire by the mail of the 10th instant. If he had he would have been just in time. I gather fro 111 the prisoners that the Khans did not themselves wish to keep Colonel O Conner whom they regarded as too important a personage to keep for such a man: they suggested Mr. Ferguson, or one of the others. As Mr. ierguson s wife and daughters were waiting for him and the other prisoners had all recently been ill at Ahram, Colonel O’Connor apparently volunteered to stay, and more or less insisted on doing so. Up to the present time I have not, I am sorry to say, been able to get any news ot the missing Zair Hussain ; when I do and can say with certainty where he is and when he may be expected here, I think 1 may be able to get Colonel O Connor released m advance on an assurance. Colonel O’Connor writes that he is being very well treated and that everybody is very polite and that he is being treated as a guest. I regret that this letter should have grown to such inordinate length, but it seemed to me advisable to report all the negotiations in detail. In con clusion, I beg to attach, for the information of the Government of India, anZI extract from a letter from a friendly Tangistani of the old Khans familv giving cover to a copy of a notice nnhlisP^ t&gt; • . aris mmily giving cover to a copy of a notice published iS Bora.sjun purpm™™! - term8 0£ tv [&gt; e f“ b ^, ween the Government andthe P Khans °It wiU that the Khans are very much elated with the success of their be seen plans. and toSK^ Co7 y ° f tMS ^ be6n Sen ‘ t0 His Ma i est y’ s Tehran, Enclosure iVo. /. .translation.

Enclosure No. III. Extract from a letter from Eassan Khan, bin All Khan, Tangistani, Chah Arabi (Borasjun) to II. G. Chick, Esq., C.I.E., 8fc., 8fc., Bushire,, dated 11th Shawwal, 1334 (= 11th August 1916) received 13th August 1916. * * * * * * * There is no news from Borasjun worthy of mention, except that the day before yesterday a copy of the terms of peace reached Mirza Muhammad Beza,^■1 22 Mtmsln of Wassnmss, from the rebels. He has posted the original ^ of that copy of the terms of peace at the entrance of the bazaar of Borasjun, and afterwards sent copies of it to everyone m Dashtistan, to Shiraz and Kazerun. The Borasjunis are rejoicing greatly over the news of the peace (obtained) by the Mujahidin, and this copy of the terms of peace r in fact, in their meeting they do nothing else but taunt, and speak slightingly of Haidar Khan They say that by dint of force Shaikh Hussain has opened the Shahi road and that the British Government has complied with every demand they had ’ The say that it was beneath the dignity of the British Government to make peace with Shaikh Hussain of the Dumukh : of a certainty they must have received a defeat somewhere. I had gone to Borasjun on business : hut on account of the excessive boasting which I heard, I was not able to stand hearing it, and after copying the terms of peace returned home. I have sent this copy of the terms of peace to you, so that if they have written anything false, you may particularly send me a copy of the terms of exchan ge of the prisoners, so that I may show it to the friends I have for their information. Result of the valuable services of Salar-i-Islam and Amir-i-Islam or the victorious temporary peace of the Mujahidin of Southern Persia. It has become evident to all the world that Zair Khidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan, in order to put an end to the encroachments and high-handedness of the British, have persevered, and demanded the Germans whom the British have taken off from the interior of our country; and that they have fought for a whole thirteen months, without any assistance from the other tribes of Persia. Both sides have done to the full all that was possible for the prosecution of the war and hostility : a small number of the British were in the hands of the Mujahidin, and a small number of the Mujahidin in the hands of the British. Now the British have clearly under stood that they have no powe r to resist, and have agreed to make peace: they have accepted all the demand s of the Mujahidin, and the Mujahidin, as their original object was to restore the honour of the country, which had been violated, have also agreed to this peace. The terms of peace have been arranged according to the following state ment :— Copy of the terms of peace. On the 8th day of Shawwal 1334, these terms of peace, as stated below, were ratified, signed, and exchanged between the British Government and Zair Khidar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan. The British Government agrees to the following terms;— (1) The return of the Tangistani and Dashti prisoners, taken in the fighting, among whom Khalu Hussain of Hashti, and everyone else whom they hold. (2) The return of Haji Ali of Tangak, and his followers. (3) The release of the Germans who were seized in the Persian Gulf, i. e., the Consul, and the German merchant and his wife in Bushire, and the German Doctor at Bandar Kig, and three other German merchants, who were seized in the Persian ports. (4) The handing over of the confiscated tea belonging to people of Tangistan, which was seized in Bahrain. (5) The surrender of the 10,000 tomans of Shaikh Hussain Khan, Salar- i-Islam, which was seized in Bushire. (6) The opening and freedom (from restriction) of the road to Bushire for the passage and traffic of all the people, in particular the people of langistan, and the cessation of interference with anyone passing. The Shahi route to be as formerly by Ahmedi, and no change to be made in it.

V ; v Jrom - The G.O.O., lorce 'D” Basrah. To - The Chief of the General Staff, ^itila. The General Jfficer Commanding, Bushire, has recently brought to notice the condition of the roads at Bushire leading trom the town to the Jireless Station at Bushire, where the present garrison is encamped, and the British Residency at oabzaoad. The attached sketch shows roughly the general align ment of the existing roads. 2 * £b0 Te mentioned General Officer states that owing- to the large increase of military traffic, especially of motor xonies, t j ' road a.B.C. originally bad, has been so cut up as to be little more than a rut, which after rain becomes a watercourse. 3. I have consulted Sir Rercy Cox, as Political Resident in rhe Persian Gulf, who agrees as to the desirability of metalling the roads, and suggests that the alignment A.B.n.C. mav be adopted. This alignment is only mile longer than the direct one n.B.C. and will benefit the Residency to the extent ot the sections A, J, as well as the Cantonment at Reshire. If this alignment be adopted, ^ir Percy cox, considers that it would be reasonable to ask the Political department of the Government of India to Dear a share of the costs oi the construction and maintenance, and is prepared to take the necessary action as soon as an accurate estimate has neen drawn up. ZL - The General officer Commanding, Bushire, agrees to this to restrict heavy traffic, except m cases oi emergen-cy, to the old road A.B.C. 5. The roads are, of course, m Persian territory, ana the cost oi their maintenance should properly speailing devolve on the Persian Government. The circumstances are exceptional howeverhowever since, as aoove stated, the present condition ol the roads is principally due to heavy military tratfic oonsejuent on the occupation of Bushire by British troops. Sir Bercy Oox ~ \forms me that it is possible, though not irobable, that the l Persian Government may ee induced to contribute say Ks.5,000 towards the project. 6. Eetore proceeding any further with this matter, i have the honour to request that i may be informed whether the cons truction of the roads referred to, and the apportionment of the cost between Military and Political Jimds, are approved in principle by the Oovernment of India and are in accordance with their future intentions regarding the garrison of hush ire. 7. If the necessity for metalling the road is accepted I would ask that I may be informed by telegram and I will then cause an estimate to be framed and will submit it lor sanction with definit proposals regarding the apportionment of cost.fv Any iurtiier communication on this subject should he addressed to— The Secretary, War Office, London, S.W., t and the following number quoted. 0162/155 (D.M.O.)

I am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge ^ the receipt of your letter No. P.3157 of the 15th instant, and to say that they appreciate the desirability of rehabilitating British prestige and restoring order in the Gulf. They consider] however, that the attention of the General Officer Commanding Force ’D 1 is at present fully occupied in dealing with the very difficult situation in Mesopotamia, and they have been recently informed by him that he does not consider that the conditions in that theatre will be sufficiently improved to admit of more active operations before December of this year. Further, it is quite possible that within the course of a few weeks the enemy’s forces in Mesopotamia may have been considerably strengthened, as shown in the Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff dated 21st instant and forwarded to the War Committee, and in that case Force D would be unable to spare troops for Tangistan. The Council are not in possession of sufficient information to enable them to form a definite opinion as to the size of the force required for Tangistan, but from such data as they have it would seem that probably not less than equivalent of one division would be needed The Under Secretary of State for India. -i/: m ^ X iV&gt;2.

Sir:- With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 230/12S7 dated 16th June, 1916, on the subject of the confinement of the Shiraz Colony in Tangistan, I have the honour to forward for your inform ation a Memorandum prepared by Vice-Consul Chick on Tangistan and its people, and the reasons why severe measures should be taken against them. It may be of interest to note that the rebellion of the past year is only the climax of a long series of law- less acts. The tribe has learnt from past experience that the Persian Government can be flouted with perfect impunity. Should it learn as a result of this business that the British Government can be treated in the same maimer, 1 submit that the position of British officials and other British residents in Bushire will become quite impossible. In view of the telegrams which I have despatched from time to time, I need hardly say that I am in hearty accord with Mr. Chick as to the urgent necessity of punitive Sir C» Marling, G.C.B., C.M.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.punitive measures against the trihe. Provided that the arrears of revenue were recovered and a fine in addition, uhe actual method of inflicting the punishment and its nature would have to he left to the Commander of the troops. I am informed that a small motile force of 2 tattalions Infantry, one or two squadrons of cavalry and two mountain guns would te quite sufficient to carry out the punishment, and as a matter of fact except for the guns this force could te provided from the present garrison of Bushire. I trust that as soon as the state of affairs in Mesopotamia permit, an expedition against the trite will te sanctioned. I have, etc*, (Signed) A. P. Trevor, Major Acting Consul General.REASONS FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF TANG I STM AND MEASURES The lawlessness of Tangistan has been proverbial in Southern Persia for half a century, and more. When Bushire was governed hy the Arab Shaikhs there was only one quarter of the town, that farthest from Tangistan, which did not suffer from their frequent raids. The southern face of the town was walled, up to a comparative ly recent date, as a defence against their depredations: and the townspeople were unable to reside freely in the outlying parts of the island. Under their Khan, the Tangistanis defended the fort at Reshire against the British force in 1856, and most of the British casualties occurred there, mainly owing to misuse of the white flag. In the march of General Outram's troops towards Chahkutah and Borasjun, the tribe however escaped all punishment, their district lying to the South. There are some 25 villages in the interior of the district, none of them, save Ahrarn the principal one, possessing more than 200 habitations at the present time and most of them less than 50; in addition there are a dozen small hamlets on the coast. But the population has from long ago been made up of different tribes, who are most prone to fight against one another, and cherish blood feuds: one village will be on most bitter terms with its neighbour a rifle-shot away: and in many cases the same tribe, in the same village, has split into settlements hostile to each other, and everyopportunity is taken to pay back old scores. The tribesmen are particularly hardy, and of fight ing stock: revengeful and predatory. In 1909 at the The case ag a inst Taneastan . SUGGESTED. invitation( 'i&amp;S/ invitation of a Mullah in Bushire they poured into that poro, terrorized it for some days, and carried off con- siderail© plunder from the hazaars: they escaped all punishment. Unlike the other districts of the Bushire littoral, they never during the past 40 years seem to have Been under any real control hy the ruling family, in their case the Khans of Tangistan, who were Zahits on Behalf of the Persian Government. Prom 1890 onwards, more especially, the two last Zahits of this family ruled so unwisely that they lost the adherence of the tribesmen, and raised up enemies for themselves in the village headmen. The latter ceased to pay revenue, were not brought to book, gradually threw off their allegiance, and became independent of the Khans. Village warred against village, and headmen were put up to kill off other headmen. This coincided with a period when the arms trade began to make its appearance; and a few years later the Belgian regime over the Customs, and the Tariff, made certain Tangistan ports, particularly ^ Dilwar, a great smuggling depot. Village headmen became wealthy through the trade in prohibited articles with the interior: they obtained large supplies of rifles and ammunition, and their men were well armed, and have been until recently (when the war with Germany, and the Masqat arms warehouse arrangment cut off most means of supply). The Persian Governors of the Ports, and the Central Government, allowed the state of Tangistan to go to rack and ruin: provided a certain sum was paid as farm to Tehran, and to the Governor by the Zabit, they did not interfere. The Bushire Government was left without a force: its guns were not provided with sufficient ammunition.ammunit/ion. When the Governor did find the revenue in arrears, or his own pocket empty, and took out a single gun and a small number of riflemen with the intention of punishing iangistan, he was soon turned from his purpose t^y being bought off by some guilty headmen, or, Persian fashion, by the women throwing themselves across the gun, and asking pardon. As often as not, he played one Khan, or one Khadkhuda off against the other: the present Governor, Darya Begi, is largely to blame for this proce dure, In the end, the Governors ceased attempting to levy the revenue at all, particularly after a regular salary was assigned them, and they no longer had to worry about the sum for which the Provincial Government was farmed. The fact that Tangistan was nominally part of the Government of Pars, which is far removed from all knowledge of the situation there, and not under the Government of Bushire and the Ports, only served to diminish Government authority in the district. In 1902 Nizam-us-Buitaneh, then Governor of the Ports, managed to take Zair Khidhar, the present rebel chief, and confined him as a prisoner at Bushire: but he soon escaped. In 1903 this man, a mere Kadkhuda (or village headman) of Baghak led a revolt against the Khan of Tangistan, and, supported by Darya Begi, soon obtained the upper hand. The rest of the headmen did not support the Khan, who was pushed aside, and ignored henceforth. In 1905 Zair Khidhar was placed in charge of the district, and entrusted with the duty of collecting and paying in the revenue. Payment of the revenue has entirely ceased now for the past 6 years: whatever he has been able to extract for himself from the headmen, who consider them selves his equals, has been due to his being the strongest, and wealthiest among them. The income derived from profitable sales of smuggled arms, ammunition and tea throughthrough the port of Dilwar made him rich enough to leave uhe others to their own devices. i&lt;rom 1907 to 1912 Zair Khidhar personally was at hitter feud with his present ally Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah, a small district some 20 miles from Bushire on the Shiraz road; raids on each other’s territory were constantly taking place. As uo the relations between him and his followers on the one hand and the Persian Government representatives in Bushire and the British Government on the other. In I9G9 the tribesmen en masse seized Bushire, imprisoned the governor and looted the bazaar, being turned out only by a landing of bluejackets from H.M.S. ”Fox M . A small party of Tangistanis shortly afterwards made a landing from the sea with the intention of seizing the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Customs, and were driven out after fighting. In 1911 Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Pars, who enjoyed the goodwill of the British authorities at that time, sent a tribal expedition against Zair Khidhar, destroyed his village of Shamshiri, and chased him to the hills, where he remained some months, until Nizam’s removal from Pars allowed him to return to his former position in Tangistan. In 1912 a gross case of piracy and murder against an Arab dhow led to the bombardment of the guilty coast village of Rustami by H.M’s Ships. Other villages of Tangistan, Dilwar and Madumari, joined in, and were also bombarded: but the effect produced was, as in the case of the second bombard ment of Dilwar in 1915, only temporary. It costs little on the Persian coast to rebuild stone, and mud buildings, and mat huts. The pirates were never caught, and the pearls and money taken were divided among Zair Khidhar anc other headmen. In none of the reprisals was any lasting effect produced,f *2*&amp;X 7 produced, or salutary punishment inflicted, either hy the Persian or British Governments with the result that the Tangistani tribesmen and their leaders, while regarding both Governments as ill-disposed towards them, were emboldened, and impressed with their own fighting strength. It has never been possible in such circumstances for the Residency at Bushire to maintain the same cordial terms as with the Khans and inhabitants of other districts, Shortly after the outbreak of the European war, the headman of Dilwar was corresponding with the German Con sul at Bushire, and offering to attack and kill the British troops then peaceably quartered there, as a Consular guard, Wassmuss, before he reached the Persian littoral, wrote to the German Consul, enquiring if Zair Khidhar could not be used for operations against the British in Bushire, supposing arms could be provided. After the arrest of the Germans at Bushire, a friend ly letter explaining the reasons for the step was sent by the Residency to Zair Khidhar: his reply was violent reproach, and a demand for reparation. Within two months he had joined a confederacy to obtain the restoration of the German deportees by force if necessary; and had welcomed Wassmuss, and announced his hostility to the British. The ambush laid for a British patrol, when two British officers were killed near the Residency by the headmen of Dilwar, was the first of a series of raids and attacks by Tangistanis and their allies, organized largely by Zair Khidhar, against the British lines round Bushire, and these have continued from July 1915 till early in 1916, when Zair Khidhar and the Chahkutahi chief seeing that the British force and defencedefence at Bushire had Been strengthened began to confine themselves to maintaining a number of men, varying,from uo oOO, about 12 miles from Bushire, ready to oppose any advance against them by the British troops. The strong and remote position from Bushire of the fort of Zair Khidhar near Ahrarn made it the place chosen for the imprisonment of the British taken captive at ohiiaz. The fact that he is their jailer, and that for 6 months he has seen the British authorities unable to obtain their release, has enhanced Zair Khidhar's opinion of his ovai importance. He has demanded a number of conditions in return for their surrender, and apparently considers the captives as pledges, with whom he will always be in a position to buy off his pardon from both Governments. one other point needs observations: during his campaign, Zair Khidhar has only been able to rely on a certain number of villages In Tangistan for his force: several of the more important villages have held aloof, and sent no men to take part in raids in fighting, out of their hostility towards Zair Khidhar himself, and their inter-tribal feuds. Zair Khidhar's following in Tangistan has been limited from the beginning. Many headman would be glad to see him killed, or removed, but co-operation among themselves is beyond them. reasonsV ‘iiie need 102 ^ eictensive, radical measures in suppressing lawlessness in Tangistan must seem plain irom oi.e summary given above. The Persian Government are not, and will not oe for years, in a position to command the means of restoring order there: they have no regular troops; and tribal chieftains with shadowy power like soulet-ud-louleh, whose winter encampments lie many miles across the mountain ranges, could not under the most favourable circumstances get their tribesmen to suppress in an effective manner a district of the plains of the coast. The coastal tribesmen in their own districts are fully a match for the pashoai; a few raids, and villages looted, and then the Qashqais w r ould be tired, and bought off by bribes: the Tangistanis would return from the coast hills, and the position would be no better than before A ashoai force too, of any sizegw/ould only oe procurable between the months of kovember and March. The Governor of Push.ire could collect a force of the loyal districts, which have been friendly to the British throughout the rebellion, and would be only too glad to see their Tangistani enemies severely punished. But for the Governor to oe able to collect such a force, and march them into Tangistan, His Majesty ? s Government would have to supply (i) Field-guns, machine guns and ammunition. (ii) British troops to work these guns. (iii) Money to pay for the wages of the men un; iilu ^ loye g | nd provisions for the force. Guns are essential, because it is impossiole for Persian tribesmen armed with rifles only to capture thick stone or mud forts, well del ended oy othei tribesmen. Guns are the one arm that Persian fttribesmen fear. iuOieover, previous experience of Persian Govern- i-ien g expeditions makes it certain that even with a properly equipped force, only half measures would result: a Persian .Governor s like the Darya Begi, is incapable of doing such a task thoroughly: the tribesmen, whom he might lead, would have no confi dence in him. They have insisted for months past on their readiness and desire to march, and settle with ohe situation once and for all, but in co-operation with any British movement. Pur trier prolongation of the present unsatisfac tory situation will prove most deleterious, Doth for the Persian and British Governments. All in this part of Persia are well aware that the force at the command of the rebel chiefs, when unattacked as at present, does not exceed 300 Tangistanis, and some 200 Ghahkutahis and Gendarmes: while it is equally well known that, if attacked oy a force from Bushire, many of these men, who are now serving under com pulsion or for wages and are bound by no ties to the rebel chiefs, would aesert them, and scatter. To keep a force of some 2000 well-armed British troops on the defensive in the face of such an insignificant enemy for months together, when it would be easy to deal with them, seems not only waste of men: it makes the reoel tribesmen think we are afraid of them, and has conveyed the worst possible Impress ion of timourousness on the part of the British force throughout all Pars, and all the shores of the Gulf. The rebel chiefs realise that they committed themselves from trie day when ohiey began acoacj-^s against us and are outlaws; they will continue to maintain men under arms, and to treat Bushire as an enemy district, as long as they see us maintain soV /y i°\y large a iorce there. In the meantime they have full ^ 00 - }G ^ or intrigue, in the hope of setting themselves right v/ibh their own Government, inconsistent at all times, and they can play on our feelings 'oy using their ci ea,tmenb of their British captives, and their desire ior release, as a bait. . Ihe continuance of the present state damages Per si aii interests, as it is obviously impossible to allow passage along the caravan routes from up-country, which traverse the hostile districts and then cross our outpost lines, ne cannot afford to have any of the enemy inside Busnire Island, especially at night: and for several reasons it would be impossible to prevent this, if the caravan routes were thrown open. Ihe result means the stoppage of trade with the interior, and severe loss to the Customs. On the other hand, it is unthinkable that a great Empire should make terms with an outlawed village headman with a few hundred followers, merely because he holds a few British captives in his hands, when the British force only 25 miles away is five or six times more numerous. It is certain that such terms would insist on Zair Khidhar and his accomplices being guaranteed frprn all punishment ay both the Persian and British Governments, and on his being again granted the zabitship of Tangistan. Ihe result would be disastrous to both Govern ments. Ihe Tangistanis would oe able to dictate to the Governor of Bushire, to raid and smuggle as they liked, and to pay back old scores against the loyal tribal districts. Ihe effect would spread over the whole region: and, instead of order being restored, districtso.is oricts now loyal to a certain degree would refuse u0 revenue &gt; and imitate Tangistani methods. ihd position would be intolerable for British officials and traders. Unless a regiment or more of British troops were kept as a permanent guard the hesiaency officials would hardly be safe from attack, 01 ' I ' 000ei T in their houses, by tribesmen, who would be sure of immunity from punishment, in fact a loop in Gij .0 Cctole, and the removal of the Residency to iuiarg Island as in 1838-1842 would be far more sat is- factory, ana dignified. To agree to terms in Persian eyes would mean no be oeaten, and Bushire would be treated accordinglyi a renewal of friendly intercourse is not understood oy lawless Tangistani tribesmen: and Bushire is exposed to the interior for 6-8 miles on its eastern side. It does not do to forget that whatever success we have in the Lesopotamia or Bur ope an campaigns will be of little interest to tribal Persians: they see no farther than their own immediate environment, and their own hostilities. The reoel chiefs have all along spread the news assiduously of the losses inflicted oy them on our 1 troops i? t55 men killed at the landing at Dilwar”, i? not a man was aole to return to the boats 51 , ten and twenty men killed in each raid &amp;c. be have oeen loadea with opprobrium and we possess the letters of Zair Khidhar and his ally, telling Persians that n we consider the best of their (English) Generals worse than dogs n . SUGGE3T3L PU h I oHi iEPT . bith the situation as it is to-day in central Persia, ana beyond the coast range, opinion is unanimous in Bushire, and in the friendly districts surrounding'fi surrounding the rebel trioesmen, that it would oe an sasy matter for the British force to deal effectively ma decisively with langistan, without the least chance of any complications arising with Tangistan. ihe greatest possible service would oe done to fne „ ersian Government, and the restoration of order; lie Persian officials in Bushire and Pars desire it, nd it would oe easy to give the Persian Government a hare in it. lo secure a lasting and tranquillizing effect on '.angistan the following objectives should oe attained, il) hair idiiuhar should be captured and executed oy the Persian Governor without delay. 1 is two sons, and his other relations and principal supporters, who are all known by name, should oe deported, .and imprisoned for several years, in some suitable Place in the Gulf.

It would oe an excellent thing if, m addition, one or two boys of principal inhabitants of the villages, could be sent to India, Basrah or r*ah Luhammareh to school. n Persian force of Government tufangchis under a responsible man, properly paid, should be stationed at Dilwar. \ o is ii o ole qouq^ that if the above measures are adopted and can be effectively carried out, Tangistan will be reduced to good and lasting order, Bushire will be rendered secure from all danger on that side, and the British garrison could be greatly reduced. Measures [2), (3) and (4) are particularly important. Ihere is no more cogent method of making Persian tribes men recognise the existence of their Government than by exacting the full payment of revenue. . The disarmament of the villages will remove the means for their lawlessness, and the possession of hostages from each village will ensure individual obedience, which is very necessary in a district, v/here most villages are separate units, and composed of different tribes.
