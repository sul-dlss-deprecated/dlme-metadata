April 10, 1^42. CONFIDENTIAL. Section \ [E 2234/14/34] Co Py No * 96 Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received Af ril 10.) (No. 89.) Sir Tehran, March 18, 1942. SUPPORTED by Uhe vote of confidence of over 100 to 2, which 1 had the honour to report t o you in my telegram No. 301 of the 7th Mar ch. Mr. Soheily 1 ^^succeeded in forming a Government which was approved by the Majlis a few days later by a similar vote. The sudden change in the Majlis, from complete irresponsibility and chaos to almost complete unanimity, is so remarkable as to deserve examination. 2. Mr. Firughi is personally popular because he has never sought office, was in disgrace with the late Shah for the last years of the old regime, and is admitted by all to be completely honest—a phenomenon almost as rare in Persia as a two-headed calf, and attracting as much attention. Much opposition, however, gradually collected against him, some of it factious and malevolent, but some of it well founded. He chose as Minister of Education Mr. Mirat (Personalities No. 126), who was exceedingly unpopular with the more reactionary Persians for having cleared away a mosque to make room for one of the Shah’s schemes of town improvement, and, above all, for being identified with the policy of encouraging Persian schoolgirls to take part in sports, including swimming, in public. The clamour against Mr. Mirat was so great that he resigned. The Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Hakimi (No. 81), had little to recommend him except that he had held the office before and that he was reputed to be honest; he was a sick man, and at moments when the most ruthless efficiency was wanted, to encourage landowners and cultivators to use every opportunity to grow food-stuffs so as to reduce the dependence of this country on foreign imports, it was unreasonable to retain in office a man who did nothing whatever. Eventually, I pointed this out to Mr. Firughi,who did, in fact, discard Mr. Hakimi, but only when the crisis had gone too far to be restored without a change of Prime Minister. The Minister of War, General Nakhchevan, was quite unable to deal with the problem of re-establishing the army after its collapse and disgrace at the time of the Allied entry into Persia. Mr. Sajjadi (No. 183), who was insufficiently active in his co-operation with the Allies in the Ministry of Communications, was early discarded at my request, and replaced by General Jahanbani (No. 100), whose mildness of character, which had been out of place at the Ministry of the Interior, enabled him to work harmoniously with the British and Soviet transport experts, and whose inability to refuse a friend a job could be held in check by Brigadier Rhodes. General Jahanbani’s successor at the Ministry of the Interior, General Ahmedi (No. 16), is active and determined, but he is very unpopular because it is feared that he might attempt to obtain despotic powers, while the corruption by which he amassed the substantial fortune he possesses affords another ground of objection to his holding office. The general criticisms of the Firughi Cabinet were that it was inactive, having failed to solve the questions of security, food supplies, return of lands acquired forcibly . by the late Shah, and so on; that it contained too many soldiers (the Ministers of War, Interior and Communications); and that too many of its members had held office under the former regime, and could be regarded as Reza Shah's men. Unfortunately, one of the best Ministers was the subject of some of the most violent attacks. This was Dr. Nafisy (No. 142). He had worked untiringly to try to restore the financial situation after the shock of the Allied occupation, but he is not a man who courts social popularity, and he could not carry off successfully the double crime of having worked for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of maintaining openly that the rate of 140 rials to the pound is reasonable. 3. Mr. Firughi was not made to deal with such a crisis. He is not good at lobbying; he believes in the power of reason—a commodity in small demand among the Deputies of the Majlis; and when attacked he adopts a take-it-or-leave-it [28—33] r\ iattitude, which, while it is a tribute to his disinterestedness, encourages his critics to leave it. On the other hand, the Deputies, who have already forgotten for how many years they were lick-spittles of Reza Shah, are so deeply conscious oi their responsibility towards the nation that they seem to think that every Minister must be approved by every Deputy, and, while they continued to vote for hirughi^J^ they refused to vote for the last two Cabinets which he presented, and there was nothing for him to do but resign. He has since been appointed Minister of Court—a position well suited to his education and character. It is pleasant to see the mutual confidence of Mr. Firughi and the young Shah, the more so in that the Shah, in the first days of his reign, complained that Mr. Firughi was keeping him in the dark, and that Mr. Firughi hardly expected any son of Reza Shah to be a civilised human being. 4. In my telcgr am—Na.—28fi I reporteii-the figures of the vote on the premiership which was taken by the Majlis at a private session on the 4th March. They were :— Firughi ... ... ... ... ... ... 47 Qawam-al-Saltana ... ... ... ••• 39 Tadayun ... ... ... ... ... ••• 5 Soheily ... ... ... ... ... .•• 4 Later about seventy Deputies declared that they would support Firughi in the formation of a Cabinet, but the Majlis then selected by lot a committee of fourteen to advise him on the formation of his Cabinet, and, as it included an even larger proportion of his enemies than the Majlis itself, he was naturally unable to come to an agreement with them, and resigned. 5. Then followed a period of great confusion, the Deputies looking rather uneasily at the mess they had made, and the newspapers and the public realising that, unless the Government could enjoy some freedom to do its work and some hope of continuity, the situation was hopeless. In view of the vote taken on the 4th March, it seemed probable that Qawam-al-Saltana might be called upon to form a Government. I found that he was supported by the Soviet Ambassador, who spoke strongly in his favour, though this may perhaps have been because he had no hope of a Soheily Cabinet at the moment (no one had), and because he is particularly hostile to Tadayun for having, as Minister of Education, suppressed a newspaper which the ambassador considered “ anti-Fascist.” My own tendency was rather the other way, since Tadayun was a member of the Cabinet which concluded the Tripartite Treaty, while the Qawam was supposed to have been connected with a newspaper, the Iqdam, which published a rather contemptuous article on the treaty a few days after it had been signed. I enclose an extract from a note written by the oriental secretary, Mr. Trott, on an interview which he had with Qawam-al-Saltana. He denies all connexion with the objectionable article in the Iqdam —a denial which I had already received through another channel and accepted. He denies that he had bound himself in any way to the Russians, and, while M. Smirnov’s attitude suggested a greater anxiety for his election than is quite compatible with such an assurance, it may be truthful. Finally, he declares that he withdrew his candidature at the request of the Shah. 6. Whether the Qawam recommended Deputies to vote for Soheily or not, it seems that Soheily’s election was not secured without considerable pressure. There was legitimate pressure from certain classes of the public, especially the merchants, who are interested in the passage into law of one or other of the proposals now before the Majlis, or who merely want to see in power a Govern ment which will be more active than that of Firughi; and these are said to have told Deputies that, if they continued to make it impossible for any Government to work, they would find the Majlis dissolved and their salaries at an end. Soheily admits that he himself placed this prospect before certain members of the Majlis. Finally, it is asserted with some credibility that the police canvassed Deputies on Soheily’s behalf, saying that he was the Shah’s candidate and they had better vote for him. 7. Mr. Soheily’s Cabinet is composed, on the whole, of as decent a body of Persians as we are ever likely to secure. They have certainly shown praiseworthy activity, and Mr. Soheily tells me that they 1 are working together with a unity which is refreshing after the dissensions of the Firughi Cabinets. I was rather apprehensive when I heard rumours of the impending appointment of Mr. Badr3 (No. 41) as Minister of Finance, since he was closely identified in Reza Shah’s time with negotiations with the Germans and has been said to be pro-German; but after careful consideration, and consultation with the general manager of Imperial Bank of Iran, I decided not to object to his appointment, on the ;^*und that a clever man w T ho understood finance might be more useful to us in tne matter of the rial rate, the increase in the note circulation, &amp;c., than an acknowledged partisan of the British, especially one not able to argue the point with knowledge. It was decided to watch his work and to object at the first sign of anti-British or even unhelpful conduct. In point of fact, his attitude has been by no means unhelpful, and he has just taken a decision, designed to secure local wheat for labourers working on the loads for the C.R.F., which required both courage and detenuination. 8. It is not to be believed that the Deputies will continue in the state of almost complete unanimity with which they welcomed the Soheily Cabinet. There are no parties in the Majlis, and no divisions of principle, and if left to themselves the Deputies could easily swing over to the Opposition in a few days. There are strong rumours that they will give Mr. Soheily a month and will then embark once more upon criticism, which can be counted upon to be rambling, venomous and destructive. Mr. Soheily has. I know, considered seriously whether in such a case it would not be better to get the Shah to dismiss the Majlis, e.g., on the ground that they were nominated, not really elected, under the late Shah; but it is hoped that the possibility of being thrown wageless upon an unsympathetic world will tend to make the Deputies less obstructive. 9. If Mr. Soheily’s Cabinet does fall, it will probably be as difficult to find a successor as it was to find a successor for Mr. Firughi. Perhaps the Qawam will come forward with his proposal for a Ministry of all the talents, but we kn ow from your telegram No. 339 that Taqizadeh is not prepared “to be at the mercy of irresponsible Deputies ”—a significant statement from one of the stalwarts of the revolution and of the first Majlis; and Saiyid Zia (No. 206) has shown no sign of ambition to return to political life in Persia. Tadayun seems to be in eclipse for the moment, but I think that he may emerge again, and that, if he does, he should not be hastily rejected by us as a candidate, if he secures the necessary support from the public and the Soviet Embassy. In the Majlis he has shown himself strong and able to make himself respected, and while at the Ministry of Education he managed to do what very few Ministers could have done without being subjected to indignant and mostly interested criticism : he got rid of a considerable number of senior employees who had been occupying positions for which they were unfitted. It is true that he is accused of being reactionary, but after the violent campaign of modernisation under Reza Shah a certain reaction was probably as inevitable in Persia as was the reaction in England in 1660, and there is no indication that Tadayun did not share the views of the Cabinet in general, which did nothing to encourage any violent reaction in social life, and continued the Reza Shah policy of preventing any religious excesses in public during the month of Muharram. 10. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Bagdad, Angora, Kuibyshev and Cairo, and to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department. I have, &amp;e. R. W. BULLARD, Enclosure. Extract from an Interview with Qaivam-al-Saltana by Mr. A. C. Trott. IT was untrue to say that he was in any way responsible for the newspaper Iqdam. He knew the editor and had on several occasions given him good advice and tried to make him write more sensibly, but his advice was usually ignored. Anyway, we could be quite sure that he was not responsible in any way for what that paper wrote. The Qawam also said that, as far as he remembered, the paper had not come out till after the treaty had been signed. I said that, anyway, there had been an article against the treaty.4 2. It was untrue to say that he had in any way bound himself to the Russians. He had been to their national fete, and after that he had had a talk with M. Smirnov, in which he told him exactly wlmt the Persians thought of the Russians, and how~ bolshevism would never go down here. After that he had not met the Russians till our party. M. Smirnov made much of him at that and insisted that he should go to lunch at the Soviet Embassy, and he went. TTk*€ was much talk about what he thought of the Government and of the Majlis; he replied, in answer to questions, that Eirughi was an excellent man and that he thought it very undesirable that he should be changed; similarly, if any of the Ministers who were principally connected with the treaty should be changed, he thought it would be very unfortunate. 3. It was untrue to say that he had sought to form a Government. He wished to give me an account of the recent Cabinet crisis as far as he knew it. On the Wednesday Mahmoud Badr came to him with a message from the Govern ment to say that it was proposed that a new Cabinet should be formed by him, with Eirughi as one of the members. He asked Mahmoud Badr to come back again next morning so that he could have time to think about the proposal; and he even began to make out a provisional list of suitable people for the Cabinet, his idea being to have a truly national Cabinet, including Taqizadeh, Seyyid Zia, Mu’tamin-ul-Mulk, and others. The next day Mahmoud Badr turned up, so the Qawam sat him in the waiting-room; meanwhile, Soheily and Ahy also turned up, so he saw them first. They asked whether he would accept to serve in Firughi’s Cabinet. He replied that he thought the proposal was the other way about, and brought in Mahmoud Badr to prove it. The result was that everybody agreed that the main thing was to have both of them in the Cabinet, and the Qawam agreed to that, whichever way it was. The next thing was he heard that the Majlis was in an uproar and was being canvassed to give an unconditional- vote of support to Eirguhi; so he (the Qawam) got annoyed and gave it up. The next thing was that the Shah sent for him and asked his advice, telling him that Firughi had gone away. The Qawam advised the King that Eirughi was the man and ought to be got back. The Shah insisted that Firughi would not have it; failing Firughi, whom would the Qawam suggest? The Qawam refused to be drawn and left it to the Shah. The Shah said : “In that case we'll have Soheily,” and expressed the hope that the Qawam would do his best to secure support for him. The Qawam agreed, and ever since then had done his best for Soheily, with, he thought, complete success. Tehran, March 13, 1942.4 2.

'V s ' I hav# th« honour to trafionit horowith a copy of a memorandum in whioh His Itojeaty’s Oonaui at Kamanshah oxpraaaaa the fear Xeat the non-Moalem minorltiee in Fereia ahould euffer, after th^ retirement of the foreign troop® tvaen lereia f for their friendly and helpful attitude toward® tie Majesty*a force®, X may quote a relevant paaeag e iron my telegram 1 ?q. 46 A m tad 9th January, in which X reported on the attitude of the itooetollc Delegate in Tehran;- 'He wa® however concerned for the fate of the Christian® especially in Azerbaijan, ai'ter the withdrawal of the ioviet troopa. lightly or wrongly, the loslema accused the Christian® of helping the invader ano were already threatening vengeance. 1 admitted that His Majesty's Consul at Tabriz had similar apprehension®,* 2, migration to British territories is not X'eaeibie except in a very fe# case**, and we must face the fact that when the Allies withdraw from Serai® large numbers of nor- Moalema who have incurred the «tmity of th^ir Moslem compatriots for their real or fancied support or the invaders will be left behind among a hostile population. The massacre of th« Assyrians in Iraq may serve as a warning of what might goasibly happen here on a large scale if no Bteye were taken to prevent it. It ia suggested to me thfct as th« many Jews and Christiana we employed during the last war came to no ham afterwards, the present apprehensions are baseless; but I do not think the analogy hold®, for although the Persian aovemm^nt seemed to believe during the last war that the Germane would win, there was not that anti-British feeling among the Persian® that there undoubtedly is now in many districts, especially in Kerrrmnshah and Hamadan, The Russians are also widely hated. The vanity of the Persian Moslems, especially tfie - 5 3 i v it ^E y ®lfis*f,hsabeen oeverely wounded, and it would be the natural thing for thw. to take revenge unon the non-Moslem minorities. 3. It seems probable that the ^rsian Government will wish to stand high in world opinion during the early years after the present war, and that they will consequently do all they can to preve-t any occurrence which would stamp 'croifi a® incompletely civilised. Moreover they will retain a dread of Rusaia whict should prevent any victimisation of any persons who may have be«an useful to the loviet forces during the occup tion, and will try to avoid in general any act which might be used as a pretext for soviet intervention. 4, For a considerable number of years Persia was ' almost iinwrune from critioisn in the pres® ox foreign J countriesi the slightest unfavourable reflection on /anything The kight Honourable Anthony den, P.Q., m.o., u.r. #an ring i eraian callnd forth a protest trm the Sh«h # am* yt of deference to his aueoeptibilities^ and fear lest nis irritation should reset unfavourably upon their interests, foreign governments tried to induee the press to refrain fro®* publishing anything about Persia that was unflattering* However necessary this may have been to protect foreign interests In Persia, it certainly encouraged ilza ;hah in his obstinacy and his indifference to the effect of his policy upon his people, since It silenced the one voice which might have exposed defects and expressed grievances. It is to be supposed that the foreign press will not be held in check in regard to hersis after the war, and that any threat to the nonHIosle^ population from vengeful Moslems will be widely reported and discussed. This should act as a serious deterrent, by its affect upon the Persian Government. 5. After the drafting of this despatch had reachau this point I had an opportunity to mention to the Prime Minister the possibility that Moslems in Persia might be feeling revengeful towards the noh*&gt; osl^ms. Monsieur Peroughl, while he professed to believe that the Moslems *would never do auch things, not being savage like the Arabs,** said that non~ oale i foreigners tended show a preference for Christiana and fews in Persia and thst this might arouse feelings of jealousy. He instanced the Belgians who used to rrsanage the Persisn customsi they seemed to prefer Armeniansj and he suggested that perhaps the British military authorities right be showing a similar preference - a feeling no longer justified, no* thst Persian Moslems are acquainted with foreign languages. 1 did not suggest to Monsieur Feroughi that perhaps the greater energy and capacity for work and general reliability of the Armenian and Jew caused then to be preferred above the Persian, but thanked him for a promise he gave me to keep the matter in mind. 6. X am therefore of thw opinion thrt circumstances* will encourage the ?eraian Govermcent to keep the peace between the various races and religions and I think that they will have the power as well as the desire to do so. X am however arranging for the possibility of inter-commun&amp;l strife to be mentioned to various Persians of influence, so that the* governing class may be aware ox the danger, such as it la. 7.

The problem is less reorganisation than the restoration of discipline and counteracting pro-Axis feeling. The mere announcement that the United States agreed to send the Mission would have good effect. Advice of British Military Attach^ could do little in this respect and the larger scheme whereby he and his staff (which would have to be con siderably increased) would have the right to inspect and contact all ranks is, I fear, not feasible. It is doubtful if the Persian Government would accept such a scheme unless we could offer the equipment they need, and if they did accent it I fear the main object would be to make use of us against the Russians. If our experience with the railway, where we have better case, is valid as example the Russians would demand position equal to ours. 2, Alternatives in order of desirability appear to me to be (a) United States to provide the Military Mission. (b) United States to provide financial adviser for Ministry of War.

F-o• | ^^ The fact that Soheily secured over 100 votes for himself as Prime Minister and then for his Cabinet is complete surprise to everybody, and reflects credit on him and also on the Shah who called him to form a Government in spite of the fact that Qawam al Saltana had run Firughi close in earlier vote. Parliament probably used Qawan merely as a means to get rid of Firughi whose inactivity they criticised. Deputies seem to fear him^ and not to wan'j him as Prime Minister. Soheily says he has^ hinted to Deputies that unless they allow the Government 1 to do its work Parliament may be disso.lved and they will lose their pay. They have certainly been factious and unhelpful and their objections to certain ministers as former tools of the late Shah, are n^e^inent in view of their own careers. The constitution may not provide for their dismissal but if they actively obstruct, the government will have to find a radical solution. 2. I think Soheily is as good a Prime Minister as we can hope to get. de is active and he is not afraid of the Deputies. He proposes to retain the Ministry of the Interior whose work he knows well but to appoint a Minister for Foreign Affairs as soon as possible, he asked me v/hether I thought that Said, Persian Minister at Moscow would do, I said I thought he would suit us and them too very well, 3.

Ii+j • ' ' 0 0 0 0 ^ My telegram No. 116 [of 21st January: developments in Persian Azerbaijan and.Kurdistan.] Following is summary of Soviet Ambassador’s note dated February 12 conveying his Government’s reply. Soviet Government consider that Hib Majesty’s Government s information from Tehran and Angora about events m Persian Azerbaijan and Northern Kurdistan is. somewhat exaggerated. Soviet Government are naturally interested in maintaining public order^and security in in regions■where Soviet forces are stationed. They consider however that order should be maintained by the Persian Govern ment themselves. Soviet authorities are tullv , assist, and are actually assisting Persian authorities to take the necessary measures. Soviet Government have never objected to numbers of Persian police and gendarmerie being increased when necessary and when Persian Government have requested this to be done. Instructions to consider favourably Persian Government s wishes in this respect were sent to Soviet Ambassador at Tehran earlv in January. They had also agreed, as soon as the Persian Government approached them, that required numoers of Persian troops should be sent to ^ZQrbaiprn Ma ivhora wi to deal with bandits and to restore order. . Soviet troops in these provinces were also instructed to assist tne local Persian authorities in restoring order. Soviet Ambassador at Tehran had also, on instructions, twice called the attention of the Persian Government to the need for urgent measures to combat the rebels and_ had. offered to give the°Persian Government any help they required to re-establish order. Persian Prime Minister had expressed has thanks for assistance given by the Soviet Government. AnyAny information.differing from these facts should not be considered reliable and may be the work of Hitlerite agents who are trying especially in disturbed districts to spread provocative rumours', e.g. that some of the rebel leaders in Khorason are English agents. It is the task of the Persian authorities, with the help of the Soviet authorities on the spot, to dispel all such rumours whose only aim is to stir up trouble among the population. Note maintains that events in Northern Kurdistan were* a sequel to the troubles in the Southern part of the province, while situation in Rezaieh was caused by provocative attitude of the Governor, who was spreading false rumours and trying to stir up trouole between various nationalities. After the Governor had been dismissed oy the Persian Government and had left Rezaieh the situation returned to normal and Soviet forces stationed there helped considerably in effecting this. In this case also the Soviet Government agreed to the despatch of as many gendarmerie and police as the Persian Government wished to send to Rezaieh. 2. I asked the Soviet Ambassador, when he left this note with me on February 12th, to thank his Government for their full reply and to tell them that my latest information confirmed that the situation had been exaggerated by the- Persian authorities. The Ambassador said that he felt sure this was so hoped that we would not be too ready to believe Persian and Turkish complaints about Soviet behavour. . They were after’ all prejudiced parties in these matters. I said that it was not a question of believing these reports- but that when I received such information I thought' it only the part of an ally to pans it on. I should certainly expect the Soviet Government to do the same by me.V ■3 VirkmimriTit lo f!

The main intrigue has been led by Qav/am es Saltaneh (personalities No, 213), He sent an emissary to me- 3 days ago to^ say that he had the support of 80 /c of deputies and was proposing to take over as Prime Minister but wished firstly to have an assurance of our support 0 I gave most discouraging reply to the^ effect that while we welcomed and v/ould lovally support any Persian Government that had the confidence of the people and of the Shah, we had no intention of being drawn into any personal intrigues of which we highly disapproved. Letter from Qawam appeared in to-day's press, stating that he had never had any intention of trying to become Prime Minis ter, which in any case the state of his health v/ould not permit. (Minister lor Foreign Affairs tells me that he attributes this to my rebuff of which I had informed him). 2° The chief objection to Qav/am is- that he has been offering portfolios in 'new M Cabinet to all kinds of undesirables, including notorious Lashti. 3. Minister of Foreign Affairs having told me the Prime Minister was much depressed, I v/ent to see the latter to-day to put heart in him; but found him much more cheerful. He said the crisis had not reached culminating point, but thought that Qawam must now drop his intrigues and all may be well/ I took the opportunity to impress upon him that we would very deeply regret it if he found it necessary to cast the Ministers of Finance, Interior and Communications to the v/olves. (Deputies have been pressing for this, as well as for the sacrifice of the Minister of Agriculture. The latter is almost useless and I stressed my reference to three out of four only). The Prime Minister was guarded as to this but left me with the definite impression that he did not now intend to yield to this clamour. 4* We shall all oe much relieved if H.

December 18th, 1941. Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith translations of extracts from the local newspapers ’’Azerbaijan” (published hy an-Iranian Azerbaijani named ali Shabistary, but suspected of being under* -Russian influence at least)., and ;, Vatan Yolinda”, published by the Red /i.rmy at Tabriz in the local Turkish Dialect. - T L - - 01 . o t &gt; u i 1 o C ^ o • * j. &lt; ' ■ C J • ( • * r-&gt; j kj. Before considering these extracts, • it may be useful to note what the Soviet authorities at Baku are alleged to have said to the aelegations of Kurds ana of non r Kurdish Azerbaijanis who were recently taken on a so-called cultural visit there. I am told by my Turkish colleague,owho naturally takes-a keen interest in the subject* that, the Kurds were addressed separately; they were to return home and reflect on the wonderful things they had seen.at Baku, but to be peaceful ’ and law-abiding among themselves and towaras their neighbours, and one day they would 'realize their hopes”. The other Azerbaijanis are said to have been addressed by Bakhiroit, the President of the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic in person., He is stated to have saia that as one of the same race and blood, he felt as deeply for the so recently oppressea Iranian Azerbaijanis as they did for themselves, it not .none so. But their hardships and calamities were now over, and they would never be allowed to recur. The frontier between Soviet Azerbaijan and Persian Azerbaijan no longer existed in a cultural or psychological sense, and the day would come when the whole of Azerbaijan would be one. 3 . I have so far not had an opportunity of checking this, but it seems to accord with what I have recently noticed and reported to you in various telegrams regarding the apparent attitude of the subordinate officers of the Russian political branch here. While Major-Generals ana Golonels directed from Moscow may say one thing, their persistent, not particularly well-educated subalterns of Caucasian, Armenian or Russo-Azerbaijani blood and sympathies may be doing vpuite another, and it is not always clear where t^e control lies. 4 . Their Tabriz newspaper ('For the Country', a somewhat ambiguous title ) is published by a Baku Azerbaijani named Azaroglou. When the Iranian authorities once mildly pointed out that their press-laws had not oeen observed or any permit obtained for this journal, they were tola that it was not really an Iranian paper, but was published ior the Soviet’s 'own people' here, which could only mean their political officers ana the gang of so-called 'relugee riff-raff they use as spies and informers, who surelw c hardly read or write. But efforts are being made to increase ihe circulation, beginning with the schools, where His Majesty’s Minister, British Legation, TEHRAM.ioO Resume of extracts from ^AZSKBAIJAN 11 newspaper.

' “In the middle ages fabriz was one of -the great cities of Azerbaijan,' but it J has fa lie h behind the other cities of Azerbaijan such as Baku, G&amp;nja and-others, yet still remains great. It was the capital of Shah Ismail Safavi, the cradle of merchants, travellers, historians and rulers, the centre Jf of trade between Turkey, Russia and India. If you study the historians you will see that Tabriz is Azerbaijani, and thfe district has not fallen under the^- influence of Persians, Tuhks br 1 Tartars, but has remained the country of the great J nation^which lived there independent long ago. Why are Tabriz and its Azerbaijanis different from the others, forming a* special people? It is because its language, character, habitat and economic life are one, and fabyiz and' the Azerbaijanis are quite different from the Uzbegs, Persians; Turkomans, Ottomans and others in those four What has caused the misfortunes of Azerbaijan? Strangers have taken advantage of our- sincerity ana simplicity to stir up strife and enmity among us, and have hindered all progress. { x t is time to wake up,put away enmity and to cease being a tool in the hands of others, who have always tried to destroy the Azerbaijanis because they realized that if Moslems, Armenians, Kurus, Assyri&amp;ns and others were to unite, they would form a nation famous throughout East and West. - We -call specially upon the Kurds and Bhahsevanis, the brave tribes of purer origin to realize that they are Azerbaijanis and to join us in unity and friendship.

But he must understand our difficulties, especially the limitations imposed by shipping shortages. 3. Minister thanked me and oromised to report what I had said to his Government.

(b) Bill has been introduced regarding lands acquired by the ex-Shah. This applies to all parts of the country but affected Kurdistan less than some other regions since, except for the valuable Kerind area, little land there was acquired by the Shah. Bill is very complicated and difficulties are enormous so that results are not to be expected soon. (c) A local magistrate related by marriage to Kalhurs has been appointed Governor-General of Kermanshah, and, as reported in my telegram No. 179, a member of Ardelan family has been made Governor of Saqqiz. It may be that latter appointment helped to secure peaceful reoccupation of Saqqiz by Persian troops,.but the appointment of Kurdish governors is not universally supported. Kurdish districts have been known to ask for Persian official as more likely to be impartial. At present time at least two Kalhurs are competing to become Governor of Shanabad. (d) Minister of Justice has promised His Majesty’s Legation to try to procure settlement of cases where lands of Kurdish chiefs were’*'either sold or exchanged for land elsewhere. (e) He firing Shahbakhti v/as sand to be intending to shoot S£Hie^of the .replaced Kurds an. instigators of the revolt , the Persian Government issued instructions that no executions should be carried out excepe on orders from Tehran. In fact there heare been I believe no executions. 2. Some grievances are common to the whole copulation e.g. corrupt officials and over-taxation while others are common to all tribal areas e.g. removal of chiefs, exchange of land and transplantation oj sections. Persian Government are inclined to say that there are many general grievances but no specific Kurdish grievances but first paragraph above shows they have not contented themselves with a policy'of mere repression. I do not think we can do better than encourage the Government...G-dvernrnent in their policy and urge them to send some of their best officials to Kurdistan as pacification proceeds. Where suitable Kurds can be found, somuch the better* It^. will also be necessary to go slow with conscription in Kurdistan* Task is extremely difficult, for v/hereas most of the Persian officials are incorrigibly corrupt and un-consgientious, the Kurdish idea is plenty of smuggling and convoy, no Government control and no taxation, fljinimum programme which any Government must impose viz. establishment of customs police, disarmament of persons not authorised to carry arms, and levying of minimum taxation must appear tyranny -to the Kurds. Greatest difficulty of all in my opinion is that of finding reasonably honest officials. Situation might improve in this respect if, as suggested in my telegrams 174 and 175, the Persian Government could secure the services of American officials in revenue and finance and Anerican relief workers for organisation of food distribution [Copies sent to Colonel Jacob and Mr. Armstrong.]FILE COPY [This Document ii the ^Property of His Britannic Majesty's under Lock and Key.] ument il £ - U • ft . ^LlltaJUu OlLtX.

Large majority for Treaty has given him confidence, size of majority is due, I think, to a combination of causes - Russians behaviour in the North, Allies 1 replies in annex 3 of Treaty, length of time allowed for debate^, which enabled the deputies and public to realise that the treaty was less dreadful than Berlin had painted it and that the Government were using no pressure, and finally, fact that 'Treaty was defended by Prime Minister v/hose reputation has npt only withstood ferocious criticism and aiouse from close vicinity but has greatly increased since he took Office. 3.

Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received February 24.) (No. 33.) Sir, Tehran, February 1, 1942. I HAVE the honour to enclose French translations of the speeches delivered, at the dinner held to celebrate the signature of the treaty of alliance, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister in Persian and by the Soviet Ambassador in Russian. A copy of my own speech is also enclosed, in English. Summaries were sent to you in my telegram No. 143 of the 31st January, 1942.( 1 ) _ —— 2:^—The Prime Minister had suggested beforehand that my Soviet colleague and I should try to dissipate the anxiety caused by the reports that when the Secretary of State was in Moscow he made a deal with M. Stalin about Persia. He admitted that the clear wording of the treaty ought to suffice to dissipate the false reports, but pleaded the ignorance of the Persian public and (this to me alone) their suspicion of Russian motives as justification for his request. M. Smirnov was so fortunate as to discover a wide assurance given by M. Stalin in his last speech, and he quoted this; as for myself, I was able to convey an assurance based upon my conversations in Moscow. 3. It will have been noticed that the Prime Minister did his best to associate the United States with the alliance. When the signature of the Atlantic Charter was first announced I quoted the charter to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs as affording an additional guarantee for the execution of British and Soviet undertakings towards Persia, and this obvious idea has been adopted by the Persian Government so firmly that they not only secured the insertion in the treaty of a reference to the charter, but they even suggested to the American Ministe r, as I reported in mv telegram No. 57 of the 12th January. that the United States should adhere to the tripartite treaty of alliance. They are even expecting economic assistance from the United States, Mr. Bullitt having aroused their appetite by suggesting that Persia might be able to benefit by the provisions of the Lease and Lend Act. 4. The Prime Minister, in his desire that the draft treaty should be discussed fully, so that no one should be able to accuse him of having secured its passage under pressure, seemed annoyingly dilatory to His Majesty’s Government and at times even “ prevaricatory.” Having, however, secured a sweeping majority for the treaty in the Majlis, he is supporting it strongly. This support is very valuable, for I doubt whether any other Persian statesman has the reputation for honesty and disinterestedness which M. Feroughi enjoys. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Kuibyshev, Bagdad, Cairo and Angora, and to the Secretary of the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi.

So Persians have shamefully persecuted and bullied these communities for years and nrobably have conscience now that the Government has virtually collapsed outside the towns.

From my point of view it is important that P-£\&gt;» £ A '0 ?

On the contrary , the soviet troops take all the accessary measures to conflseate the arms held by the Kurds which trickle in to them from regions whore no Soviet troops ere stationed* Immediately after the arrival of soviet troops in northern Iran they did their utmost to prevent any conflicts breaking out between the Kurds and the Iranians, and so far, in those parts of Iran where Soviet troops are stationed, no conflicts or disturb^uces have occurred among the Kurds* It is necessary also to point out that the Iranian oovcmiaent has not expressed any aiasetiafaetiou with the behaviour of Soviet troops via-a-via Kurds, and hss not submitted any complaints to the soviet A&amp;basaador in Iran* In this connection It can perhapa be sentioitsd that, accoruing to inforr&amp;ation received from the oviet Ambassador at Teheran, tiiS Iranian Prime iaiater, rorugi, on the lith December, 1941, in the presence of the soviet Ambassador, stated to the Hrltiaft Minister at Teheran, that the British are supposed to support I the Kurds who, in s number of districts UUre tiking aa unfriendly attitude towards the Iranians* However, there is 1 no further information to hand on this matter* Thus, the Turkish aovenu&amp;ent should have no reason for anxiety on account of this alleged encouragement of the Kurd population in Iran by the soviet troops with s view to cresting disturbances there and still less have they any reason in this connection to send their troops to the Turkish- Iranian frontier* Proa the above it is clear that there is no cause lor estrangement in the relations of the soviet aovermumt with Turkey. kith mguirfl to the visit made by certain Kurd public sen to &amp;aku» this visit had no political signifIsaac* end was of a purely cultural nature.

Regarding his Azerbaijan enquiries the Turkish Ambassador said that as a result of what he learned from Sir S, Cripps ; ' ; and Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen ; - (including suggestion that the Turkish Government should seek information direct) he asked permission to tell Vyshinski that he lias been given general account of '-Kurdish'- discussion by the British Ambassador but that as this question naturally interested the Turkish Government, he in^his turn would be interested in any fuller account which Vyshinski could give him. Permission was eventually accorded with the result described in paragraph 4 of Angora telegram under reference. 3. The Turkish Ambassador added that Molotov’s declara tions about the Kurds seemed to him 'very sincere', the only false note being 'cultural' visit to Baku. His information being that whatever the Soviet Authorities might be planning in Azerbaijan, they were not supporting a v Kurdish ; - move as such. He thought that the Turkish Government and his colleague in Tehran had been unduly alarmed. (This statement must be taken with some reserve: was quite alarmed till recently.) H.E.

Both of them tend to be alarmist, but see above mentioned telegram from His Majesty's Consul Tabriz. Before I had seen this telegram I asked the Soviet Ambassador whether he had news from Rezaieh. He said that the Governor had resigned and left; that it was the Governor who had sown the trouble by arming the Kurds and by other acts; and that all was now quiet. Turkish Ambassador and the Persian Government regard the situation as having been deliberately brought about by the Russians and there is much to support this belief. 2. I pointed out long ago that the Russian interpretation of non-intervention in internal- affairs differed from ours. In the early days of the occupation they would refuse to assist in the suppression of disorder after they had : disarmed the gendarmerie of tne town police. In Azerbaijan they have placed the'authorities at a disadvantage and have allowed disorder to take its course, if not encouraged it. 3* According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Soviet Ambassador says that he telegraphed to Moscow more than once about the Persian request to be allowed to increase the gendarmerie, but has had no reply. The Ambassador has no influence with the Soviet iiZer ^ a ij a ^ a ud is not even well informed as a rule. Whether Moscow formulated the policy which is being followed is unknown. ^They will repudiate it if it suits them to do so, but it would be difficult to deny the responsibility of the local Soviet authorities. | nftC*. p01 - ib ' EPt * &gt;7 JAN 942 INDIA OFFICE A. o •1. (1) The Soviet authorities have refused to alloy/ ^ Persian troops to be stationed, not only in the Russian . occupied areas, but anywhere, north of the Kazvin-Tehran-Meshed line. It is impossible for the Persians to maintain order with the gendarmerie alone, (2) For some weeks after the occupation, the police and gendarmerie were not allowed to carry arms. The Persian Government declare that the'arrangement, by which the Soviet military authorities allowed the posting of a certain number of recommended men in the various places, referred only to gendarmes, and that there v/as no limitation of the number of police; and that the Soviet authorities recently ordered reductions of gendarmerie below the agreed scale. • My own belief is that the town police were not limited. There v/as, however, no written agreement but only a rough map on which the numbers v/ere marked here and there. In any case, if the Soviet authorities really wished, as they alleged, to support the Government, there was no reasonable ground for refusing increases of gendarmerie in the areas obviously disturbed, especially as there was no military support, or for ordering the reduction of police. Reduction in Tabriz from 1-00 to 205 v/as ordered at a moment v/hen, as His Majesty’s Consul reports, the Kurds, armed with rifles and. even tommy guns, were walking the streets with impunity. (3) Kurdish leaders were taken to Baku on a cultural visit. There is plenty of evidence that the invitations were pressing. (1-) Although complete evidence on this point cannot be obtained^ there is no doubt that, on the whole, individual Soviet officers and commissars, if not the Soviet authorities, have encouraged minority and local feeling against the Central Government, labourer against landlord, tax-payer against Government the Turkish against the Persian language, and in fact all tendencies making for disruption. 5.

My belief at first v/as that Soviet Government i: would postpone until after the evacuation anv serious attempt to disrupt Persia and would content themselves with studying the situation and acquiring agents* Recent events in Azerbaijan however suggest“an intention to go further* If there is such intention it may have been adopted under the influences of new factors, for example: (1) Victories over Germans, which, not only increase the weight of Russia in the alliance but make it less necessary to conciliate Persia. (2) Realization of key position which Russia holds in the Far East. (3) Discovery from inside of the rottenness of the Persian State. (4) British loyalty to Persian Government which has prevented our encouraging the Kurds and has thus left opening for the Russians to pose as their friend, 6. Whatever the motives behind Soviet policy in Azerbaijan situation is disturbing and can only be improved if Persian Government are treated in the North as we treat them in the South, i.e# are allowed to have as many police and gendarmerie as they consider necessary and to support them with reasonable number of troops. Whether that would suffice without the co-operation or af least [grp. undec. ? non] intervention from Soviet authorities such as may not be forthcoming is an open question but it is the essential minimum.

Instructions in my telegram 999 [of 28th November] were based on the assumption that the material purchased from the Persian Government would be divided more or less equally between the Soviet Government and ourselves. 'Then it became evident that Soviet Government insisted on receiving the greater part of the available material the Soviet Ambassador was informed (see my telegram 1131) that we agreed that his Goverrment should purchase the greater part of this material provided that certain items were reserved for His Majesty's Government. It is, therefore, not intended that we shall pay for the arms destined for the Russians, and I approve your action in asking His Majesty’s Ambassador at Kuibyshev to press the Soviet Government to give the necessary assurances. 2. The arms which we urgently need are those specified in paragraph 6 of my telegram 1131 [of 5th December] plus the nine Mohawks. It is not clear from your telegrams 1338 and 1385 [of 18th and 28th December] whether we shall secure any of the mountain guns and howitzers and whether we are to get the number^ of machine guns for which v/e asked. A further telegram will follow as soon as possible on the suggestion that we should accept tanks in place of light weapons.

In accordance with instructions in your telegram No. 999 to [grp.undec:? purchase] arms without waiting for final arrangements with the Soviet Government regarding their share, preliminary offers to purchase were made by this Legation. When it was decided that the Soviet Government should have first claim the Soviet Ambassador and His Majesty's Minister made a joint offer without informing Persian Government of the ultimate destination of any arms purchased. The Persian Government agreed to sell 100,000 rifles, 10 , 000,000 rounds of ammunition, 800 light and 400 medium machine guns. Delivery has just commenced but is being delayed pending reply to the Persian Government as to who will accept liability for payment. 2. His Majesty's Minister agreed with the Soviet Ambassador that we should have as our share 25^ of the small calibre weapons. The approach to the Persian Government was a joint Anglo-Soviet one and taken as such conformable to the Persians who are expecting a joint or at least a British guarantee of pay ment. They also expect that a British representative will be present at delivery of all arms to the Soviet authorities at Kasvin, The latter, hov/ever, will not permit this on grounds that all arms except our very small share are solely their own affair. 3. The Soviet Ambassador is unable to give any assurance regarding payment and I have telegraphed Kuibyshev asking His Majesty's Ambassador to press the Soviet Government. 4. The matter is extremely urgent and is likely to drift unless decisive action can be taken quieklyc The Russians are showing a most unco-operative spirit in this as in the matter of railways, about which I shall be telegraphing shortly. 5.

Turkish.ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered on 2nd December aide-memoire urging that Kurdish movement was aiming at establishment of inde pendent Kurdish state s that Armenians, and Assyrians were said to be participating, and that some Kurdish chieftains were alleged to have been encouraged and materially helped by 'occupying forces in Persia”, Aide-mdmolre also asserted that there had been a recrudescence of tribal raids into Turkish territory. British Embassy were asked .orally to supply statement of our views and aims, and His Majesty's Minister replied that Embassy were strongly opposed to any encouragement of Kurds and Armenians. , 2. Turkish Secretary General reverted orally to the matter on 5th December and spoke with.great earnestness regarding^Kurdish activities in North Persia. He believed that Turkish Consuls at Tabriz and Rezayieh were in danger. Trouble had not yet spread to the Turkish side, of the frontier, but Turkish Government would probably have to move troops to replace Turkish gendarmerie in those districts, in spite of bad impression which this would create. ;• 3. Sir R. Bullard reports that no Kurdish chiefs have been encouraged by us. On the other hand, Soviet authorities had been taking a considerable number of Kurdish and other leaders on a propaganda visit to Baku. Sir R. Bullard had warned his Soviet colleague about suspicion which this visit might-arouse in Persia and Turkish Governments, and impressed on him necessity for avoiding anything that would injure our relations with Turkey. Soviet ambassador .replied that there was no ground for suspicion, that Soviet authorities had done nothing whatever to encourage the Kurds, that they had even helped Persian gendarmerie etc., against Kurdish threats, that they had^done everything to bring about peace between the Kurds and th= Persian Gcr &gt;o rnment, and that this was in FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSCOW Np, 18 ' T8th De c emb e r ? ’191-1 D. 5&lt;30 p.m. 18th December, 1941 Repeated to Kuibyshev No. 348« ddddddd accordance/accordance with their declared policy. The visit to Baku was purely culturalc He admitted that visit had been arranged without his having been informed in advance. 1. Sir R. Bullard believes that Turkish Govern- meat have been badly informed in recent months about Kurdish affairs in Persia. arrival of new Turkish Ambassador at Tehran should improve situation. Sir R. Bullard has offered, in order that some assurance might be given to the Turkish Government, to keep the Turkish ambassador‘informed on Kurdish affairs, and to do his best to encourage British, ^ Turkish and Russian co-operation. Sir R. Bullard has also asked Soviet Ambassador to endeavour^to reassure his Turkish colleagueand Soviet Ambassador agreed to do this. 5. Sir R. Bullard’s action has been approved, and His Majesty's Charge d’affaires at Angora has been authorised to use material provided by Tehran for a reply to Turkish ministry of Foreign ^flairs. 6. Meanwhile Turkish Government have now communicated second aide-memoire dated 11th December. This complains that Kurdish insurrection against^ . Persian Government has resulted in virtual seve ^ n § of communications between Turkey and Tehran. it adds that the Soviet occupying forcesin North-Jest Persia have now definitely taken up position on the side oi those elements which favour the establishment of a Communist regime, or annexation pure and simple to the U.S.S.R. It asserts that those who oppose uhis policy are subjected to a 'merciless terror',^ 'h lc p~ mdmoire quotes in this connexion murder of a iurkioh subject, adding that this is not the first case of its kind. Aide-memoire concludes by stating that the Governor-General of Urmia, Who was recently appointed by the Persian Government to suppress Kurdish revolt, has, ov/ing to his lack of armed force, been obliged to negotiate v/ith the rebel leaders in-order to bring them to reason; it is pointed out that nothing t could be more dangerous in the present staue of things than to adopt such a course, which must necessarily involve unspecified concessions to the rebels.

According to the Turkish Ambassador 5 Soviet Ambassador told him that even after the signature of the treaty his Government would take particular interest in the following questions (a) Nationalisation of the property of the late Shah. (b) Reduction in taxation. (c) Relaxation of administrative centralisation. 2, Factories, hotels etc. belonging to the late ohah have in fact been nationalised but the fate of agricultural property is complicated by the claims of the former owners many of jmom declare often with reason that the lands were taken from them forcibly tor nothing or almost nothing. 3, Insistence on reduction in taxation would come oddly from the Soviet authorities since their influence is at least partly ^ responsible for the fall in receipts from taxes in Northern Persia and they themselves are not paying customs dues on Soviet goods 7 .sold direct to merchants and are unlikely to pay lor one arms W *UL whlGh they are acquiring from the Persian Government. Mo • , * r .v 4, Soviet Ambassador said that centralisation must not be carried too far. This is harmless as a general statement oi policy. 7/hat is important is how the Soviet Government will expect'it to be applied in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. A. The programme set forth to the Turkish ArAbassador by , M. Smirnov is identical, but for the omission of all reference o elections, with the one reported m my telegram No.79 1 dated Oie 19th September as having been demanded from ihe PrimeTfinister by M. Smirnov. It is possible that M. Smirnov, in his recent conversation with the Turkish Ambassador was merely acting on instructions three months old which may applicable to tne changed circumstances which the signature of i.he treaty pp RECd.POL. L Pt. I ^ d H l\) INDIA OFFICE toto inaugurate, but the three points mentioned ail fit in well with what we might expect the Soviet G-overnment to adopt as their policy in Persia: they would naturally oppose the re version of crown lands to private ownership, however unjustly the original expropriation had been carried out; they would wiSh to keep down prices in their own occupied area ; without respect to the injury which that policy might do to the central Government or to the additional burden v/hich it might throw upon tax-payers in other parts; and they would probably be glad to secure supporters among the minorities who might be useful when the war is over and the Allied troops have left.■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■I e«r»r*.) sfanjn# [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key ] .»xk. ... r 8434 [CYPHER] POLITICAL DISTRIBUTION FROM; TURKEY.

It followed utilitarian line most likely to appeal to the man in the street and is the first clear statement by a Persian politician on the situation made to the public. Fact that no mention was made of Persia having joined the democracies can be explained partly by the fact that Russia being a party to the treaty would [? grp. omitted: ? make] such a statement look unreal. It is satisfactory that phraseology of the following points about which public opinion is chiefly exercised were made clear.

Ambassador declared that there was no ground for suspicion. Soviet authorities had done nothing whatever to encourage Kurds. They had even extricated a Persian fo^ce which was surrounded by Kurds and had compelled certain ‘ Kurdish districts to accept the presence of Persian gendarmerie ^ om Kurds wished to drive out. They had done everything to Dring about peace between Kurds and Persian Government and Chat was m accordance with their declared policy. Visit to Baku was purely cultural. He had been informed by commissar coneernea that the party was just going to theatres and so on. . . ^^P^Q-ted that we must avoid anything that would injure our relations with Turkey, whose adinission to the Denents of Lease and Lend Act should have been reassuring to a he new Turkish Ambassador was a man of good will and i hoped that the Soviet Ambassador would do his best to reassure him. ^The Ambassador said that ho would be glad to explain the Soviet policy in Persia to the Turkish Ambassador. finally the Ambassador said that in any case commissars had not informed him beforehand.

I have no doubt that M. Feroughi s position is a difficult one, especially with Russian and British troops in temporary occupation of parts of the country. I fully recognise that it was not the fault of the present Government, but that of the late regime that Geman agents were enabled to establish themselves in ' key positions throughout Persia and that repeated Allied representations through diplomatic channels remained unheeded thus^ rendering military action unavoidable* It is because we wish to gain the sympathy and goodwill of the new Government and the Persian people that we have held out to them the offer of a treaty of alliance. If Persia wishes, she can acquire the status of an ally and become entitled to the benefits of an alliance. She will then be in the same category as Egypt, Iraq and Turkey, to all of whom we are sending supplies, and all of whom we have helped so far as we can in respect of their export • trade, I realise that some parts of Persia have been suffering from a shortage of grain, but we have already sent more L.han 13&gt;000 tons of wheat to Persia and are arranging for still larger quantities to reach the country before the end of the year. As Persia normally grows sufficient wheat to meet all her requirements, and on occasion has even had a surplus for export, the supplies which we are providing will. I hope, be fully adequate for her present needs. If Persia becomes an ally, we shall continue to do what we can to help her in her economic difficulties,. *ECd. ) 3 p OL.

Zj^ n Times' would appear^to suppose that British^diplomacy in regard to Persia is untrammelled, whereas it is the Allied policy which is in question. Delay^in concluding the treaty is due to the fact that Russia is one of tne parties, not only because consultation naturally takes rime (it took Moscow a fortnight to decide that your draft was acceptable) but mainly because Russia is regarded in Persia with fear, suspicion and hatred. The Persian Government have tried to fill the draft with safeguards, many of which seem to us trivial, because they know that a treaty with Russia must be unpopular and they want to make it less so, and because they hope to compel the Russians to refrain from interference. We could have secured the treaty in a week or two had we been alone. The Persian Government admit in theory that their position m regard to the Russians should be improved by the treaty, since at present they have no safeguards at all, but then argue - illogically but naturally - that even written promises^ mean nothing to Russians who, e.g. in spite of commercial treaty are paying no customs duties on goods v/hich they export to Persia.

Aide-memoire was handed to His Majesty s Minister on December 2nd. It has not been coimvanicated to the soviet Ambassador. Following are principal points made. ^Kurdish move ment is developing on some-scale olong the Turoo-Persian, Thico-Iraqi. and Turco-Syrian frontiers. Immediate symptoms of this have been a recrudescence of tribal raids into Turkish territory from these three countries and the border countries. 4 'ihe tribes are said to have profited by dispersal of Persian gendarmerie following occupation, in order to ootam arms and are even reported to have occupied the villages oi Savuchbulak, i^cp. undec. ?Trimie] and Necada, and to have advanced to the neighbourhood of Kermanshah. 2. More far-reaching manifestation of the movement aims at the estab 1 islment of independent Kurdish State, comprising the western provinces of Persia and tne north- east regions of Iraq inhabited by the ^Kurds. Armenian and Assyrian elements are said to be participating in tnis and it is alleged that some Kurdish chieftains have been . encouraged and 'materially helped by '’occupying forces m Persia 1 '. The following cases are quoted. (a) Kurdish chiefs who took part in Agri revolt of 1950, 1931 and who were removed to the interior oi Persia nave now been released under pressure from occupying xorces ana have returned to their villages in the frontier zone* (bj Several Kurdish chiefs from Persia are reported to have gone to Iraq, to ask the Sheik Mahmoud to lead uhem.

Assistant Secretary-General in handing the aide-memoire to Minister said that from time to time he might have to give us information on this subject and would be glad to receive statement of our views and aims in return.

I also said what I could to reassure hjm as to Soviet policy in Kurdish areas and assured him that if Kurds in Persia were armed it was because they had acquired rifles from deserters from the army and not from Soviet authorities. It was after this that I received the report given.in paragraph 1. I communicated the report to the Soviet Ambassador and said that if it were correct/ it would have a very bad effect on the Turkish Government who would hear about it from the Turkish Consul at Tabriz and I urged him to do everything in his power to ensure that nothing shall be done in Kurdish areas which might arouse the suspicion of the Turkish Government whose friendship is of such importance both to Soviet Russia and to His Majesty s Government.

AS reported in my fortnightly diary for the first half of July the local inhabitants were even then discussing the prospect of a British invasion of Khuzistan. It was not until British forces crossed the Shatt-al-Arab at Tanumah on the 4th August that the invasion began to be regarded as probable and imminent. From that date until the 25th August excitement and tension increased and the local population gradually came to regard the entry of British forces as a certainty. After the 15th August local prophets began announcing the date of the occupation—5 a.m. on the 20th. 22nd. 24th and 26th, each in turn being accepted as zero hour. In Abadan the question of on which jetties the British forces would land was freely discussed. Throughout this period it was noticeable that the Indians and Persians were much better informed than the Europeans, many of whom did not know or realise the significance of the crossing of the Shatt-al-Arab at Tanumah until a week later. 2. At about 0445 hours on the 25th August British naval and military forces began their attack both at Khorramshahr and Abadan. The first intimation of the arrival of these forces was probably the sound of the guns of Royal Navy vessels firing at the Persian gunboats Babr and Palang. The former was moored in the Karun near the naval base while the Palang was alongside one of the Abadan jetties. K hor ramshahr. 3. — {a) The British military forces approached Khorramshahr from Tanumah in two columns. The first took a sweep to the north of Polinao (the Persian customs post on the main Basra-Khorramshahr road), and arrived near the wireless station. It was here in the half light that Admiral Bayendor ran into the Indian troops and was subsequently killed while defending the wireless station. This column sent four armoured cars at 0800 hours into Khorramshahr town. The second column approached along the main Basra-Khorramshahr road, passed over the Polinao bridge and at about 0900 hours joined the first column between Polinao and the wireless station. Both columns then spent the rest of the morning clearing date gardens of isolated bands of Persian soldiers. Sniping by Persian forces continued until about 1500 hours. At about 1700 hours Major-General C. O. Harvey and the 8th Divisional Headquarters arrived in Khorramshahr. By this time all was quiet on the right bank of the Karun. lf&gt;) Shortly before 0500 hours British naval forces attacked the Persian gunboats moored in the Karun and the naval base. During the early stages of [23—49] _ 1 RECd. POL. DEPt. -20tc94l|| INDIA OFFICE ithis attack the Babr was set on fire and began to sink, but did not become completely submerged. Royal Naval vessels then entered the Karun and boarded the gunboats Simorgh and Chahrukh and the armed tug Yadak Bar. Indian troops were landed and after some fighting captured the naval base. Sniping continued on the left bank of the Karun until late in the afternoon. (f) rhe following day the road between .Khorramshahr and Abadan remained closed until the evening by which time military forces had combed the date gardens and the villages along the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. Abadan. •a R°y a l Naval vessels and ships carrying Indian troops arrived along side Abadan just before 0500 hours. Some sharp fighting took place before the jetties were captured and before Indian troops were able to enter Braim (the western residential area) and Abadan. Meanwhile the Persian gunboat Palana had been set on fire and she soon sank in deep water. (b) Once the Indian troops had entered Braim and Abadan fierce street fighting began and lasted until late in the afternoon. Some Persian soldiers armed with rifles and automatic weapons held strong positions on the roofs of various buildings and declined to surrender. Others retired slowly through the Braim residential area firing from the gardens and roofs of houses occupied chiefly by European employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Most of the Persian officers had deserted their men and fled across the Bamashir ferrv They were followed by the remnants of the Persian forces later in the dav. Meanwhile other bodies of Persian troops retired along the south side of the refinery near the hospital and Indian clerks’ quarters and were driven out after sharp street and house-to-house fighting. The surviving Persian soldiers escaped across the Bamashir. The civilian population and damage to property. 4.—(a) Khorramshahr.—No British or Indian British subject was either interfered with or maltreated in any way. When the attack began all the European residents except Mr. and Mrs. Gregor (Gray, Mackenzie and Co. (Limited) ) who lived too far away and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Macqueen of the Imperial Bank of Persia who have no telephone, were collected into the vice- consul s house. Whenever possible contact was maintained with Mr. Gregor and Indian British subjects by telephone. There was no damage to British or'Indian British subjects’ property. (b) In Khorramshahr several Persians and Arabs were wounded by stray bullets and snipers, but the exact number of casualties is not known. There was no damage to civilian property. {c) Abadan.—Throe British subjects, Messrs. Weedon, Hartung and Stiff lost their lives while seven others, Messrs. Wheeler, Fenton, Burnett, Eorbes-Scott’ Buck worth, Vincent and Laurie, were wounded. One Indian British subject Mr. -Driver was wounded. All these casualties were employees of the Wl 0 - Persian Oil Company. Four British subjects, Messrs. Skipworth, Bluck. Buchan and Vyse, who had left their houses for the refinery very early on the mornin£ of the 25th were captured by Persian soldiers, taken across the Bamashir and then forced to march with them to Shadigan. During this march of about 1J miles across the desert approximately 200 Persian soldiers died from exhaustion. One of the four British subjects collapsed on the way, but a Persian officer sent a car back to fetch him. These British subjects were rescued from b adigan by British troops two days later when the Persian forces surrendered. • u , f nc T ans living in Abadan bazaar remained in their houses neither they nor their property suffering any loss or damage. (e) The refinery, except for a few bullets in two tanks, was undamaged beyeral houses occupied by European and Indian employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were damaged by bullets and during the house-to-house fmhtin^ some articles were stolen or broken. One Anglo-Persian Oil Company house' which was defended for several hours by Persian soldiers, was hit several times by mortars and the top storey will require major repairs. (/) The number of Persian civilian casualties (deaths) is not known but it was probably under 10(1 Damage to Persian property, apart from the police stations and buildings defended by Persian forces, was on the whole slight.3 5 I he Persian civi] administration ceased to function on the 25th and, apart from 25 town policemen, no officials returned to work until the 27th. During the following week almost all officials returned to their posts and bv the 1st September more than 200 of the Abadan town police had resumed duty. a k° P^ a(e on record that the civil administration in Khorramshahr and j^Abadan could not have been restored at such an early date had it not been for he assistance of Mr. Johnson of the Imperial Bank of Persia and Mr. Pattinson ot the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, both of whom spent many hours in advising and encouraging the local officials. There were also many Europeans who worked untiringly in driving cars, helping in the hospital, &amp;c. their efforts undoubtedly mnuenced the local officials and population, who soon regained a considerable degree of confidence.

In Kurtistan Persian General Officer Commanding has made a start in his negotiations for peaceful settlement and has won over Galbagh tribe by making reasonable terms. Truce rather than final settlement, describes the General Officer Commanding s ariangement with the above mentioned tribe. He has not yet tackled chief leaders of the revolt, who are believed to intend to resist until the Persian Government agree to their^far-reaching demands, including virtual autonomy. I consider that we should urge Kurd leaders modify the most extravagant of their claims and thus facilitate the Persian Government's efforts to secure peaceful settlement.

He had received a personal telegram from Feroughi, who expressed the utmost depression. Russians were keeping in prison in Meshed about 500 Persian officers. They were also looting and robbing. The fact that up to now His Majesty's Government had been unable to provide the necessary grain supplies and financial assistance was a further complication. Persian Government desired nothing more than to rely on and work with their British friends 0 But their position vis-a-vis Russia was a very serious difficulty. All this was making the personal position of Feroughi and the Minister for Foreign affairs very precarious 0 If Feroughi resigned there was no-one to take nis place and the situation would become extremely serious 0 2. [sic]. There was much more in the same strain with which you will already be familiar. I listened to M. Sepahbody as sympathetically as I could. He asked me, on the strength of his personal acquaintance with yourself and of your past friendliness to him, to inform you of what he had said as a message from himself. I undertook to do so. 3. [Sic], If you can possibly give me any return message for him it would have good effect, at all events as far as he personally is concerned. 4. [sic].

After seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister, I have decided to make an attempt tomorrow 0 bring tne Persian text into close relation with ours and it will oe quickly clear whether that is possible. Some of the amendments have been devised to avert the fierce criticism which 'a 6 .? 3 o 31 ♦ ? as IIlee ^ some try to keep arbitrary conduct ol the Soviet forces within bounds. One or two go beyond what the Prime Minister says was the intention of the Government, 4 ? have the Minister for Foreign Affairs more than once of the possibility of a re-occupation of the capital and I spoke ol it to the Prime Minister today, but although the prospect is unwelcome to them they are so badgered on all sides by Deputies, the Berlin wireless, people who have suffered bv Russian occupation e.g. the wives and relations of Persian officers sent away to Russia, and by our allies, that they are perhaps less frightened of the possibility than they were. My Soviet colleague is^most indignant at what he considers the Prime Minister s misrepresentation of the Persian reply and indeed I nave myself spoken strongly about this to the Prime Minister, i Qpcious to avert it, if I can, by trying to secure a treaty irom tne present Government who if they go, are unlikely to be replaced by men more useful to us. +in Soviet Ambassador has not yet received instructions to tnreaten the re-occupation of Tehran.

Nevertheless if we can secure in essence everything that we want I hope that full consideration will be given to the proposal to change the name. I do not doubt that the Persian Govern ment sees in the oh^ge of name a means of depreciating [sic] the wrath of Geiiucujy not that they can hope [?grp. omit. ?for] this for themselves but they must suppose this possibility would occur to the people and make a strong appeal to them. It may be argued that the change would also encourage both the Government and the people to be slack in their support of Great Britain and Soviet Russia but it is just as likely that if there were an alliance they would be slacker still because it went so far beyond their feelings. By threatening the Persian Government we can probably secure their signature to a nominal alliance but I suggest that that would be worth less than a more willing ,? association ; '. 3 . I have not had time to discuss this with the Soviet Ambassador who received the same information but he believes that his Government will take a grave view of the proposal of the Persian Government to be our associate instead oi allv.

We pointed out that our agreement in principle was already embodied in Article 7 but in view of our unfortunate record m economic matters in this country since the war began it is natural that the Government should want to have some specific gain to show to the people. Since my interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs I have learned that the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have begun negotiations for the purchase of 25,000 tons of sultanas. I? this transaction could be concluded it would have good effect as a beginning. What is chiefly needed however is speedy arrival of con siderable quantity of wheat. Shortage is threatening in several places and at Ahwaz which is m our occupation, His Majesty s Consul says there is no wheat for sowing. [Repeated to Kuibyshev under Foreign Office No. 77]. RECd.

Rumours assisted by German wireless have been .current, frightening the Persians with a tale that a large Persian army would have to go to the Caucasus to fight the Germans' and I gathered that this has been one of the diff culties. Another is vagueness of the clause about economic help. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he was unable to give us details of the amendments which would be suggested. Asked whether Government proposed to sign on presentation of the reply Minister for Foreign Affairs said that they would want our rejoinder first, but he denied that the amendments would be of a nature to cause delay.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Ahwaz despatch No. 66 of the 12th September, 1941, on the subject of events in the Ahwaz consular area which attended the entry of British troops into Persia. Tehran, September 16, 1941 Enclosure. Consul Kina to Sir ft. Bullard. (No. 66 .) Si*, Ahwaz, September 12, 1941. I HAVE the honour to give you herewith a report on the events in this area which attended the entry of British troops into Persia. A report on the events at Khorramshahr and Abadan will be furnished by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr and transmitted through me as soon as possible. P n . 24tlp August, after receipt of your circular telegram No. 28 of the 23rd August, I removed all cyphers and recyphering tables with IEeT remainder of my secret and confidential files from the consulate to my house at Khazalieh, 2 miles away, in order to be able to destroy them as soon as I received your prearranged warning telegram or at the commencement of hostilities. 3. At about 5-30 a.m. on the 25th August an unidentified reconnaissance plane, followed later by two others, flew T over Ahwaz, and was fired on by anti aircraft guns. At the same time I noticed an armed policemen at my back gate. I tried to telephone to the consulate, but found the communications cut. A little later I attempted to leave my house, but was informed by the police, who had now arrived in force, that I was under house arrest. At the same time my car was seized. It was returned two days afterwards intact except for the flag. 4. I thereupon locked myself up in a room and hastily burnt my cyphers and the remainder of my secret and confidential documents—a precaution which afterwards proved to be unnecessary, as the consulate building itself was never entered and my safe was left untouched. A list of the documents destroyed is attached hereto. Q My own house was also never entered except once with my consent, when it became necessary to prove to the police that my radio receiving set was not a transmitter. 5. My wife was with me at my house, and during the morning we were joined by the wife of the manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran and her small son and by the only Anglo-Iranian Oil Company wife left in Ahwaz. The men of the community and the wife of the bank accountant were arrested, and I learnt later were held also under house arrest at the bungalow of the company’s manager in the town. They were joined there next morning by the four company wives from Kut Abdullah, after a hazardous journey, during which they were fired on by Persian troops and by the station superintendent and his wife from Dorquain, brought in under military escort. 6 . Most of the Indians were also rounded up and kept in detention, but were in no way badly treated. I should like here to pay tribute to the behaviour of the Indian colony in general. In the period of suspense before the fighting (’) Not printed. [ 22—68 RECd. POL. DEPt. sy OCT ^941 INDIA OFFICE ENCLOSE IN WEEKLY lETTtR No. 44 FROM ; NOV 1941 &lt; l DEPT.,/f $ ^ ft-bouc and during and after the hostilities they remained calm, confident and loyal. The conduct ot several of the company’s Indian key-men was particularly praise- 7. I he men from Kut Abdullah, on the other hand, were removed in most unpleasant circumstances to Burujird, and as soon as they were awav their bungalows were looted by the officer in charge at Kut Abdullah, Major Afshari and ms men. Most of the stolen property was later recovered from the house of Major Atshari himself, but personal and household effects to the value of several undied pounds are still missing. I have asked Mr. Stewart, station superin- tendent at Kut Abdullah, to give me a report of this disgraceful affair, which I will forward when received. From personal interrogation of the authorities conceined, I am satisfied that the responsibility for the manner in which this sma11 f r ^ lsh community was treated rests with Sarlashkar Shahbakhti the „ ,;£ eaerai officer commanding in this district . I suggest that compensation for the Abcku.*\stolen goods should be paid by the company and debited to oil royalties. ^ r ^ rema i n i n gy^ n gi 0 -I r anian Oil Company communities in this area came oft lightly. Haft Kel was occupied immediately by air-borne troops without incident except for the crash-landing of two troop-carriers, in which, fortunatelv, no one was hurt. Bandar Mashur was protected by naval forces operating at Bandar. The staff at Agha Jari and Gach Saran were evacuated to Behbehan and later returned. I have heard no complaint of their treatment. The community at Masjid-i-Suleiman, men and women, were ordered by the local police to leave at 9-30 a.m. on the 28th August and were sent in their own transport to Andimiakh. Ihey returned the next day, having suffered no more than a hot and tiring journey. The British military authorities had instructed them to come to Haft Kel two days before, but they had refused—quite rationally, m my opinion, seeing that they would have been abandoning their posts and their houses. 9. At Ahwaz Royal Air Force planes bombed the gun emplacements and the army aerodrome on the right bank of the river on the 25th, 26th and 28th August. No bombs fell in the town. My servants informed me that the population was fairly calm and was only hoping that the British troops would be quick in coming. I instructed them to tell their friends that there was no danger on this side i.e., the left bank of the river, and that our bombers would only attack the military objectives on the right bank. J 10 . On Thursday, the 28th August, I was informed about 11-30 a.m. that I was free, and about the same time our forward mechanised units, havin°- slipped iound the back of the Ahwaz ridge of hills, could be seen advancin 0- across the desert from the east. Had hostilities continued for another hour, they would undoubtedly had entered and captured Ahwaz from that quarter without the slightest opposition. 11 . I took my car and drove to the consulate. Fvervthing there was in order. I went on to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company manager s house and found the rest of the Ahwaz colony safe. I transported a few of the company’s key- men to their jobs and then happened to meet the chief of police, Sarhaiio* Amjadi, in the street. He had been correct and helpful in his attitude throughout and all British subjects within his jurisdiction were courteously dealt with. He told me that an English colonel had arrived and was with the Sarlashkar and that he would accompany me to the Sarlashkar’s headquarters. There we found Colonel Lockner, commanding the 18th Brigade, with two of his officers and Sarlashkar Shahbakhti awaiting the arrival of General Harvey. The geneial ailived a few minutes later and arrangements were made for the entry of the British troops into the town and the disposal of the Persian forces. These arrangements were confirmed and amplified at a meeting next day at the British Consulate. 12 . I then accompanied General Harvey to select sites for camps and head- quarteis. It was decided that the troops should be put m the desert and along the river to the north of the towm and that divisional headquarters should be located in the company compound at Khazalieh. At about 2-30 p.m. the mechanised troops of the 8 th Indian Hivision began to come in and continued to do so throughout the night. 13. On the 30th August I went to Bandar Shahpur (P.G.) with General Harvey. The line had been torn up near Sar Bandar, but was now repaired. Operations down there had been highly successful.

We found that all 'the more poisonous specimens had fled. Later, three Italians working for the AgrTcnW Syndicate, harmless so far as I know, were brought in from the com t?v and delivered to the British Military Police. The Italian engineer in charge of the i U Bandar Shahpur (P.G.) was captured there.
