Shaikh Salman at present sits on the Bahrain Court jointly with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Mr.G*L* Beigr&amp;ve), but at a conference during your visit to Bahrain in November 1933, it was thought that the presence on tne Bahrain Court of the Adviser was no longer appropriate ana that it was preferable if possible that the Ruling Family should be made responsible for the administration of justice* It was deciuec that the time had come when the work of the Court might be entrusted to Shaikh Salman,with the help of a younger member of the Al Khaiifah, and that the Adviser, whose time might more properly be occupied with other matters, might be withdrawn from the Courts* 3* the opportunity has, therefore, been taken of the /forthcomingfl 2 lort&amp;coming leave ot absence ot tne Adviser to place SliaiKd Kalman in full cdnrge of tiie Court ana to grant aim an extra allowance for bis increased responsibility, it is not propose* that the adviser shall return to the Court, provided that Shaiith Salman maxes a success of the work, with the exception that he will continue to sit with the Court in pearling cases, as he is in a position to withstand the pressure which influential persons connected with the pearling industry may attempt to exert on a Court consisting solely of local juages. 4. As a further safeguard, however, it is proposed tnat, should eny case arise m which it may appear desirable to strengthen the Court, his excellency Shaikh H&amp;ma bin Usa Al Khalilah should appoint the Adviser as an Additional Judge for the purpose of that particular case. b. I would only add that the somewhat obscure reference to slaughter-house fees has really nothing to do witn the questioi ox the Court, but refers to a local squabble.

MEMORANDUM Reference paragraph 9 of C.I.C.I. Suinnary No. 233 for week ending 2nd August 1945. It was Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa al Khalifa, and not as reported by you, His Highness Shaikh Salam, Ruler of Bahrain, who arrived in Baghdad on the 30th July. I should be grateful if you would issue a correction to this effect in the next issue of your Summary. C for Political Agent, Bahrain. LR. AAt a meeting between the Political Resident (Colonel Fowle), the Adviser to the Bahrain G-ovemment (Mr.Belgrave) and the Political Agent,Bahrain,(Colonel Loch),the question of Mr. Belgrave working on the Bahrain Court was discussed. It was considered that he had far too much work to do to justify his spending long hours on the Bahrain Court. It was further considerea that it was not altogether desirable that he should sit on the Court permanently,though this may have been justified when the post of Adviser was first created. It is not possible for him to cease his duties on the Court at once as it might be regarded as a sign of disagreement between him and Shaikh Salman, who is at present disgruntled over tne 1 slaughter-house 1 question and also regards himself as underpaid for the work which he does. 2. It was decided that Mr.Belgrave should gradually go less and less to the Court and that at the end of his leave he should definitely leave the Court work in the hands of Shaikh Salman. It was thought that it might be possible to get over the slaughterhouse fees difficulty by giving Shaikh Salman a definitely higher rate of pay and putting him in charge of the Court,it being understood that he would relinquish his claims to the slaughter-housb fees. This will need discussion in detail between the Political Agent and the Adviser. 3. It was,however,considered undesirable that Mr.Belgrave should disassociate himself from the Pearling Court side of tne Court oecause the Salafiyah Court to wnich pearling cases were reierrea was composed of Nakhudahs who would doubtless revert to their old ways and the oppression of the divers if they were not strictly supervised. In view of the interest of the outside world in the state of pearl divers (which is regarded as connected with slavery) it was decided that Mr.Belgrave should continue to sit when pearling cases were taken up.© 2 4. The Political Agent thought that it would be advisable to have some machinery whereby Mr.Belgrave could sit on the Court if any cases were to come up of financial or political import ance. It was thought that this could be made by the Shaikh using his sovereign powers in any particular case to order a special tribunal to sit ad hoc . 25-11-1933IOn the 30th November 1933 Mr.Belgrave informed me that Shaikh Salman has dropped the question of his taking the fees for the slaughter house but that he still thinks that he should receive an increase m his pay in view of the work which he does on the Court. He ^points out that Shaikh Abdullah gets Rs.b,600/- and Shaikh Muhammad Rs.2,80Q/- for doing far less work,i.e.,attending the Baladiyahs occasionally. Mr.Belgrave tells me that Shaikh Salman’s court work is excellent and tnat he attends regularly. Shaikh Salman’s feeling is that his f\fay£- uncles asd enough to pay for certain enjoyments,Shaikh Muhammad goes to Egypt and Shaikh Abdullah can get off to the mainland for hawking. 2. I suggested to Mr.Belgrave that it would be a good thing to take advantage of our having got a little money from oil. Shaikh Salman is at present getting Rs.ldO/- per mensem and the idea is ikaci to give him a further Rs.3,000/- per annum. 1 said that I was anxious that anything of that sort should be done by them and not by me. I said that I thought it was desirable that matters of that sort should be treated as internal. Mr.Belgrave is going into the matter. 3. Incidentally,there was some talk amongst the Shaikhs ojr Shaikh Muhammad ana Shaikh Abdullah each subscribing Rs.100/- a month and His Excellency Shaikh Hamaa a like amount so as to increse Shaikh Sulman’s pay. The idea was mooted by themselves but Shaikh Salman says it is only talk. 4. Please remind me on the Ibth December 1933.I discussed this with Mr Belgrave on the 7th January 1934.. I will take an opportunity of seeing Shaikh Salman and asking him if he thinks he can manage the judicial worK and suggesting that for the extra responsibil ity he slid get some more pay, Rs250 a month hasbeen suggested to the the Shaikh already by Adviser. Shakh and Shaikh Salman are not on particularly good terms at the moment - their wives have had words over the servants 1 34 P.A. lie ■Vwr CtVwc C£twT • 4- ' A Submitted. • *&gt;/' On tne 2bth January 1934 Sbaikn Sulman came to see me at my request. I told, him that I nad heard good reports ot his work on the Joint Court tnat tnat it was possible tnat,il His excellency Shaikh Hamad gave permission^the Adviser may be going on leave # l said that m that case I thought of recommending for the Shaikh's consideration, whether it would not be possible for him (Shaikh Salman) to carry on the work of the Court with the help of a younger relative. I said that in that case he would have a greater responsibility placed on him and that i thought that he snoulu have an increase in the pay which he gets for the Court work. He told me that he would gladly take the work on and naturally slurred over the question of the increased pay. I think that it is clear,however,that he would welcome an increase of pay oi Rs.200/- a month. He brought up the question of his rights m tne markets in kanamah and showed me various documents but I think that this matter will probably adjust itself if he gets extra pay. u 2.
