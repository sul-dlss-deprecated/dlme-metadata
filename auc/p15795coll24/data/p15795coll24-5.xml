Born in Cairo, Hekmat’s mother dying while giving birth to her, and she moved to Qurna when she was young. She recollects attending school near Qurna for three years, and living with her father and relatives until she married at age 14. Hekmat tells of visiting a sheikh before her wedding day for blessings, and about the stories of miracles associated with sheikhs in Qurna like Sheikh El-Tayeb, whose blessing was peaceful relations among its residents. While she took care of the household, Hekmat’s husband worked in a hotel until his death.  Hekmat speaks about the important role of tourism in Qurna for the livelihood of its residents, and of tourists’ interactions with residents like her, such as eating at her home when visiting nearby monuments. She describes the negative impact on decreased tourism on locals, resulting in financial strains and unemployment for young people like her sons; her 33-year-old son Mohamed Talaat, who joins the interview, echoes these concerns.  Hekmat and Mohamed tell the story of their relocation from the hillside, returning from signing the contract for their new home to find their old house destroyed and their furniture scattered outside.  Mohamed notes that the new apartments do not compare in size with the houses and land they used to have in Qurna, and Hekmat says that she would rather be living in old Qurna.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
