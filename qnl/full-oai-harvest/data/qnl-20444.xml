Kemball reports that a boat carrying slaves and belonging to Mahomed ben Fullah, a native of Mumzur near Sharjah recently landed at Doah [Doha] for water, whereupon two of the slaves escaped to a neighbouring village of Smaysmah. Kemball writes that, unable to retrieve his two slaves, the man forcibly took two other slaves as replacements from a boat belonging to Smaysmah, taking property and wounding members of the boat's crew in the process. In response, the people of Smaysmah intercepted a Ra's al-Khaymah boat headed for Bahrain, taking everything they found on board.There are two enclosures following the letter:1. The translation of a letter (folios 147-48) from Kemball, to Sheikh Sultan ben Suggur [Sultan bin Saqr], chief of Rusulkhymah [Ra's al-Khayman], dated 16 June 1853, demanding that Sheikh Sultan ensure Mahomed ben Fullah is made accountable for his actions, and that compensation or restitution of the stolen property is arranged;2. The translation of a letter (folios 148-49) from Kemball, to Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa [Muhammad bin Khalifa], chief of Bahrein, dated 16 June 1853, demanding that Sheikh Muhammad arrange for restoration of the stolen property.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00002c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
