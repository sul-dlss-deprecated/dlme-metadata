Carlton Hotel* Karachi, 13th August 1932* The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Subject:- Zakat assessment 1932. Memorandum* While the year 1932 has been marked by falling revenues in all directions it is satisfactory to be able to report that in consequence of the new assessment of Zakat revenue in a more up to date manner a substantial increase in receipts is promised under this heading. 2. The Batinah and Shimaliyeh coasts comprise the largest stretch of continuous date cultivation in the world. The plantations extend in almost unbroken regularity for close on 200 miles. Numerous varieties of dates and other trees are found by far the most popular of which is the Batni date, which, though inferior in quality, has the advantage of being able to ripen in spite of the excessive humidity of the sea coast. Next to the Batni date comes the •Mebsili*, which when boiled and dried is known as the ’Bisr* and is largely exported to India for cunsumption at marriage feasts and other entertainments. 3. The Batinah coast is by ancient custom, divided into 9 •Walayats* or districts. These, commencing from the town of Muscat itself are Sib, Birkah, Masnaah, Suwaiq, Khaboorah, Saham, Sohar, Liwa and Shimaliyeh. Prewious to this year four of these 9 districts have been paying a more or less adequate Zakat. I iThese were Birkah, Sahara, Sohar and Liwa. Of the remaining 5 districts 3 i.e. Sib, Khaboorah and Shimaliyeh were paying purely nominal sums and the last two Suwaiq &lt;^nd Masnaah paid nothing at all. This year out of the total 9 distriiifs seven i.e. Sib, Birkah, Khaboorah, Saham, Sohar, Liwa and Shimaliyeh have been fully assessed to Zakat revenue while the two districts, Masnaah and Suwaiq, which have never yet paid Zakat revenue have been left out. jjo serious opposition other than the usual grumbles of the tax payer was met with except in the case of one or two small villages wnere the assessing party were refused entrance by the Sheikhs. These difficulties, however, were all settled amicably as they arose and my latest information shows that work in the district is progressing smoothly. fr.

Moreover in little more than two years from now the State will lose the Anas Traffic subsidy of Hs. 1*00*000 (vide uoverrment of India Express Letter ho. JM61-K/33* of 30th June 1933). Xf the State therefore is to weather the depression, almost literally every rupees Increase in its revenue is of con sequence. The prospect therefore of raising more revenue from the date districts of the lint inch and shiwaliyoh is an Important factor in the finance of the State. 3. When Captain Alban therefore suggested to me his scheme/acbeme for a proper aeaesament of the dietriota In question, 1 concurred provided that it could be carried out in such a way that trouble was not created amongst the tribes con cerned, and further that alien thf aaaessxaent had been com pleted It should only be imposed on the same terms: absence of tribal friction. Captain Alban agreed with my vices and proceeded to mute the assessment. 4. It appears from Captain Alban's report that the aseessment has been successfully carried out without serious friction. It remains for the assessment to be imposed under the same conditions. &amp;• In effecting the assessment, tm greater part of which was done under his personal supervision before he left Muscat for Karachi, Captain^has done good work under trying conditions. ¥he hot weather is far from being an Ideal time for revenue assessment in uman, which of course is entirely lacking in the amenities of dak bungalows, rest- houses, and so forth, which exist in India. 1 have the honour to be Bir Your moot obedient servant ST)/ T.C.W.
