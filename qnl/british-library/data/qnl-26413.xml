Since the last Progress Report was issued on September 1st, 1947? (PY/G2(47)16), the Working Group has held three meetings on September 24th, October 10th, and December 5th, 1947* 2. It has considered the fifth Report of the Working party of Panel No.3 on integration of Signals at joint-user stations on trunk' routes and agreed to.the deletion of Nicosia, Aden, Negombo, Gibraltar, Wadi Haifa and Rangoon from Appendix ’D* of the Report. The Report has been revised by Panel No.3 and a 6 th Report issued, details of v/hich have been for warded by the Air Ministry to Commands for comments, under A.K. letter C343i7/Sig.8. dated 30/11/47. 3. The Working Group has also discussed the reports of the survey parties which visited the MEDME Area (F,TG2(47)19&amp;20) to investigate air traffic control facilities . It has agreed that there is no immediate require ment for civil controllers at Khartoum, or Eastleigh as the R.A.F. are prepared to carry on for the time being, and that MCA should investigate the present position with regard to civil controllers at Eastleigh. The agreed responsibility for providing control at the category 'A' &amp; 'C' joint-user airfields is laid down in appendix A to the minutes of the 7 th meeting. Principles 4. It has been agreed that certain principles should be developed in addition to those already quoted in FWG2(47)17&gt; viz:- (a) Finance (b) Supply of Technical equipment ^c) Signals integration (based on PWG2(47)18) (d) Legal, liability (e) Refuelling (f) Briefing (g) Control 5. Principles on: Control Signals Integration Refuelling have now been issued as R7G2(47)25* 6. Further substantial progress cannot now be made until those concerned in the two Departments are able to develop the financial principles upon which must depend the success of the whole joint-user plan.

The Conference, which was attended by representatives of the United Kingdom raid many Colonial Governments was convened to discuss some particular questlore of administration which needed to be settled at the present stage of the development of Empire air communications, .s well as to consider the development of air transport generally. Subjects discussed included, inter alia. (i) Plans for the operation by the British Corporations.of trunk services to and through the Colonial areas and the integration of those services with the local and regional services. (ii) Policy to be adopted for the regulation of charter and private flying. (iii) Charges to be made for landings at colonial airports and, morev. generally, the economics of airport administration. The Conference recommended tho appointment of a Committee to consider the legislative powers for the control of the operation in the Colonies of both scheduled and non-scheduled air services and to dra.ft model regulations on this subject for the guidance of Colonial Governments. Colonial civil avia.tion service on the same general lines as other unified Colonial services was recommended for the maintenance of the ground organisation on the routes together ;.ith the establishment of an advisory Boarc^This;;ould be concerned' particularly with the recruiting and training of personnel to the unifor i high standards required for safety, regularity'and economy of air services. It was also agreed to recommend that a Colonial meteorological service should be organised on a regional basis having an Advisory Board in London to give advice on the facilities which would be. required in each regional area, and also on the recruiting and training of staff. It was appreciated that in some areas the services would be organised and controlled by the Meteorological Office. Agreement was a.lso reached on certain principles which should be followed in the shading between the United Kingdom and the Colonial Governments of the cost of necessary ground facilities.for British Services. CIV. 10645 1* The delegates Inter visited London ^.iroort and Royal Aircraft Establishment Farnborough,_and sa,’ displays of several types of British aircraft, radio and radar equipment. TURKEI: 130. Reference.v/as made in paragraph 10 ef Middle East Summary No. 1. to a contract which Turkish State airlines had agreed with the Westinghouse Company for the reconditioning of five major Turkish aerodromes.° The .negotiations have been protracted due mainly, it is reported, to the apportionment of dollars which had proved to be insufficient when the lira ecpreciated in value in September, 1946. The Turkish Press reported in March that this difficulty had been overcome , by a higher alloc-tinn n-P currency, and it was anticipated that•the contract would be signed in !oril or May. It is understood that work is to be carried out at Yesilkoy ,\mkara and Adana in that order. An additional runway, 7,000 x 180 feet, is to be constructed at each of these aerodromes. York will be subsequently carried out at Izmir end Elazig. LEBANON: 131. At a meeting of the Anglo-French Joint Standing Committee on April 9th it v/as explained by the United Kingdom Representatives that British Overseas Airways Corporation had no financial interests in Middle East Air Lines but supplied two pilots and technical advice for British aircraft operated by that Ccmpany. Any amalgamation between Middle East Air Lines and CompagjjWie Generale de Transports. might mean that the joint company would choose Air France as its technical adviser. If so, British Overseas airways Corporation would be prepared to withdraw. The French representatives stated that there v/as in ct, little chance of alteration from the status quo I no amalgamation would if it meant 'removal 01 French interests,' whrle El^Hoss would probably not accept amalgamation if French interests remained. SYRIA: 13-^. -un *.ir Agreement, terminable by either party at one year t s notice, was signed on 28th April in Damascus by representatives of the United States and Syrian Governments. The provisions of the agreement are understood to become operative from the date of signature; the Agreement is subject to ratification by the Syrian Pruplianent. Details of the Agreement are not yet buo it is reported drawn up on the Bermuda pattern. Iran.: ^33* The negotiations to establish Eagle Airlines continue. Mr. Madon has been put into touch with British Overseas .airways Corporation with a view (i) an introduction to ..irwork (Heston) Ltd, who are at. ted to be now in a position to supply 2 Dove aircraft to Mr. Madon on hire purchase terms, and (ii) Discussion with the Corporation on the arrangements for their technical advice. 1j)4» It is reported from Teheran that the efficiency of’ Iranian Airways has been rapidly deteriorating. It would appear that differences between Iranian Directors and. Trans-World Airways.have resulted in the latter withdrawing their staff and severing their connection with Iranian.. Airways. The Company is reported as over J million dollars down on operations during the last nine months. In an attempt to prolong the life of the Airline, the Company are reported to be attempting to engage more pilots and ground staff. CIV. 10643 . 2 CIV.1 0643© 135. The Royal Board of Civil Aviation, Sweden, have, in accordance with the provisions of ..rticlc'9 of the bilateral agreement between Sweden and the United Kingdom, been granted permission to change the route of the Swedish service Stockholm - Teheran as under:- ^ Present route : Stockholm - Copenhagen - Geneva - Rome - ^thens - Ankara - Baghdad - Teheran. Proposed route : via nthens - Lydda - Teheran. AFHANISTAN : 136. Following the proposals put for./ard by Trans-florid airways the Afghan Government have prepared a plan for establishing a civil air service of their own vhich involves the purchase of six ..vro XIX aircraft for services between Kabul and Peshawar, Kabul and Mazar - i - Sharif, Kabul and Herat via Kandahar and FaraJi, and Kabul and Teheran via Kandahar and Herat. It is estimated that the sum of Rs. .5 million afghanis will be required to inaugurate these services, and that maintenance for the first year will amount to Rs three million Afghanis. SAUDI - ARABIA: ’ 137. Since British Overseas Airways Corporatkn have intimated that in view of their other commitments it would be for them to implement the Air Training Scheme referred to in Middle nast No. 1 and subsequent summaries, Airwork (Heston) Ltd were asked whether they would undertake the project. In consequence ^irwork have sent out a representative (Captain Pritchard) for the purpose of making a brief survey. His Majesty’s Ministeredda, has reported that he understands that as a result of his mission Captain Pritchard will recommend to his principals that ^irwerk should undertake the training f Saudi pilots and that he should submit to Saudi Arabia plans for the general lay-out and v/orking drawings of hang/tr, workshops, offices and lecture rooms on the assumption that these will be constructed by the Saudi Arabian Government. ETHIOPIA: 138 . An Exchange of Notes is being arranged between the Governments of Ethiopia and the Sudan according permission, on a basis of reciprocity, for an airline designated by the Government of Ethiopia to over-fly the Sudan on a route from ^ddis Ababa, via ..smara, to Cairo (in both directions) and for the exercise of Freedom Two at Port Sudan. This permission is subject to termination at six months’ notice. EGYPT: 139. It is learned from an American source that the United States/Egypt bilateral a.greement is due to come before the Senate for ratification curing May. There are indications that the Agreement will be ratified. 140. The Egyptian Government have been informed that it is hoped shortly to approach them with proposals for a bilateral civil aviation agreement - referred to in para 107 °d Middle East Summary No./ - and have been asked, pending the negotiations, to permit British Overseas Airways Corporation to exercise the sane rights to and through Egypt that it has enjoyed under the authorisation of 30th May, 1932, granted to Imperial airways and inherited by the Corporation. This authorisation expires on 29 th May, 1947. 140A.

TR..NS-JOKLUN : 142. There is nothing further to report. IRtiQ: 143i The latest informat ion from Baghdad, indicates that the Iraqi Government have now given the United States Airlines temporary permission to operate through Iraq 'under the same conditions as they enjoy under the United States - Lebanon Civil Air Agreement', that is to say under Bermuda conditions. Paragraph 114 of Middle East Summary No. 7 refers. PALESTINE: 144. Czechoslovak State ..irlinos have been granted pemission to land in Palestine on a twice-weekly service over tho route Prague/lstanbul/x.nkara/ Lydda• PERSIAN GULF: 145. The problem of serving Bahrein both from the United Kingdom and India (See para 122 of Middle East Summary No. 7 ) has been, resolved by the operation of British Overseas airways Corporation Plying-boat services as under:- (i) Poole/t/Iarseillos/Augusta(night-stop)/Cairo(night-Stcp)/Basra/Bahrein. Date of commencement ex-Poole 2nd May; ex-Bahrein 8th May. (ii) 'Bahrein/Karachi (Shuttle service). Date of commencement - cx-Bahrein 5th May; ex-Karachi 8th May. Both services are operated weekly with Plymouth Flying-boats. 146. Two proposals are under consideration for the grant of operating rights in the Persian Gulf:- (i) A trice-weekly service by Air India Ltd. over the route Karachi/ Jiwani/l Sharjah/Bahrein/Kuwait /Basra/Baghdad. (ii) A thrice; -weekly service by Iraqi Airways, operating by arrangement with the Kuwait Oil Company, between Basra and Kuwait . Since the airfield at Kuwait was evacuated by the Royal Air Force more than a year ago, limited facilities have been provided by the Kuwait Oil Company. As neither the Royal Air Force nor Ministry of Civil Aviation havehave any future requirement there, the India Office are arranging through the Political Resident ta obt in further details of the two proposals in order that further consideration may be given to the future of Kuwait airfield, against the background of the Kuwait Civil ^ir agreement v/hich expires in 1948* 147* Following official approval of the formation of Cyprus Airvvays,j the British European dirway^Cor#porationrepresentative, is at present in Cyprus with the object of concluding the arrangements. It is hoped that the Company will shortly be in operation at Nicosia, The scheme for, the establishment of a Cyprus Training Unit originally in Lord Da.vidson’s report ha.s been postponed at least until the new Company is firmly established. 148. Arrangements for the formation of Aden Airv/ays are at present held up pending the conclusion of negotiations for the joint use of KhormaksaT Airfield. TRIPOLITANIA. 1.49. The United States Amy Air Force are withdrawing from Mcllaha on 13th June. Accordingly Trans-World Airways^ who have been using Mellaha under special pemission, will be asked to transfer to Castle Benito as the designated civil airport in Tripolitania f A Survey Party was recently sent out to examine the respective merits of Castel Benito and Mellaha. They reported in favour of Castel Benito, which was built before the war as a permanent military camp 3 Mellaha being a war-time staging post. The runways and approaches are butter at Castel Benito: in length the main runway at Castel Benito is 7»38&gt;5 that at Mellaha 6,000 ft. The buildings at Castel Benito are sounder structurally, and the roads also. Castol Benito is rather further from the town of Tripoli, but the connecting road is better and the journey can normally be done by car in 45 minutes. The technical facilities are rather better at Mellaha, but it is hoped to obtain some of the surplus equipment for installation at Castel Benito. The position should then be entirely satisfactory. A site Conference will shortly he held at Castel Benito to make arrangements with Royal Air Force for transit accommodation for civil purposes; this should cover the needs not only of British Overseas Airways Corporation- whose four-engine services will soon be transferred from Malta owing to tho reported deterioration of the condition of the runways at Luqa - but also of foreign charter and private operators* Castel Benito will be a joint civil and military airfield, involving some limitation on civil capacity. Being under military administration, there is no airport Authority of the noraal kind. Passenger handling, including restaurant, and servicing facilities will in due course be available by arrangement with British Overseas Airways Corporation. Owing to Royal Air Force demobilisation, it will take a little time to get the organisation running adequately on the new basis. CYRENnICA : 150. There is nothing further to report.

The rumours are described as 'erroneous and irresponsible'. (W as hington id L. 10 -4-7») TURKEY. 96. Notification has been received from H.A. Tiinister, iingora, that the Turkish Ainistry of Foreign affairs now insist that 5 days - instead of 43 hours - notice must in future be givun of arrival of special i.e., mon-scheduled operation, aircraft in Turkey. H. .. minister adds that he has heard unofficially that t.-ie will shortly be increased to 10 days. The question of an approach to the Turkish authorities, to induce them to agree that 48 hours notice is sufficient provided that the British authorities concerned give an assurance that they will rigidly observe the 48 hour period, is under consideration. This may also involve the acceptance of sanctions which the Turkish authorities might wish to impose on aircraft which arrive in Turkey without prior clearance having been obtained. LEBANON. 97• From a B.O.A.C. source in Beirut , it seems that difficulties are still being experienced in implementing'the middle East air Lines request for the Corporation to act as their technical advisers for the ’whole of .their operations including the Dakota services which have hitherto been operated to doubtful standards outside the Corporation's control. We are having discussions with B.O.A.C. on the subject with a view to the maintenance of B.O.A.C. association with A.E.A.L* and if possible, strengthened to cover thu whole fleet of A.E.A.L. The situation is further complicated by the suggested amalgamation between A.E.a.L. and the French Company C.G.T. SYRIA. 98. Discussions have taken place with B.O.A.C. arising out of the recent /for tTiation CIV.961 f&gt;«•3 2 - SECRET. formation of the National Syrian Aviation Company (see paragraph 11 of II.E« Suuanary No*5)» The agreement concluded with P.A.A. is for one year only in the first instance and B.O.A.C, have expressed unofficially the view that ther is ground for hoping that the arrangement may not be renewed at the end of the first year. In the meantime, it follows from the decision to withdraw the B.O.A.C. li.E.A.T. Board service through Damascus, that B.O.A.C. cannot be pressed to keep open their Syrian Office but that the Corporation should be pressed to pursue their suggestion that Iraqi Airways, with whom they are closely associated, should keep their Damascus office open. H.D. Minister in Damascus is also being informed that. M.C.A. shares his views on the importance of maintaining the British position in civil aviation in Syria and that we are pursuing with B.O.A.C. the possibility of their keeping an agent in Syria. In the meantime a B.O.A.C. representative (.ir. Dunderdale) is assisting the Syrian Government with communication and traffic control. 99* Discussions have been proceeding with -ir. Liadon of Eagle Airlines, who has recently been in London, with a view to providing his Company with at least two Doves before the end of the present year, otherwise the Company may be obliged to buy 'American'. The situation is complicated by the fact that the Company are apparently not in a position to pay outright for their aircraft but wish to spread payment over a period of four years. The possibility of supplementing the two Doves with Dominies for a period of a few months until some Doves can be obtained is also being explored. jilG-ri/iNISTAI-i « 100. There is nothing further to report. oAuDI ARABIA . 101. The Saudi Arabian Government have been notified of the U.K* requirements for rights for B.O.A.C. and associated companies operating on the services specified below:- The services for which these rights are required are the trunic services between U.K. and India, Australia and the Far East. The route would enter Saudi Arabian territory either from Cairo or Lydda direct or via Baghdad or Basra to Dhahran and would go thence to Karachi and beyond. 102. Additional requirements include assurances from the Saudi Arabian. Government that charges levied on ILK. aircraft for the use of the airport at Dhahran and for fuel, oil and spares taken on board in S.A. territory, would not be higher than those levied on aircraft of any other country or on S.A. aircraft engaged on international services. 103. The formal acceptance of the Saudi Arabian Government hqs been obtained for the proposed Training Unit scheme outlined in paragraph 23 of Summary No. 1 for which Treasury authority has now been given. The estimated cost of the s c he mes will be A3A- , 500 , made up as foilows:- • 'IRAN. (i.U ‘The right to fly over Saudi Arabia (freedom one).

ETHIOPIA. 105. Whilst the Southern African Air Transport Council saw no objection to the proposed Addis-Ababa/Nairobi service to be operated by Ethiopian Airlines, it had been hoped to discuss this question more fully at a meeting of the Council. Since, however, this has proved impracticable, and since it was felt it would be unreasonable to withhold permission any longer, it has been agreed that permission to operate tbo service should now be granted on a basis of reciprocity for a British Commonwealth airline if and when desired. 106. The suggestion that Ethiopian Airlines might operate a round service Addis Ababa - Mogadiscio - Aden - Addis Ababa in both directions is under consideration. In the meantime H.i.i. Minister in Addis Ababa is being informed that in the interests of the Aden Airways project the suggestion should not be encouraged. EGYPT. 107. The question of the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between the U.K. and Egypt, the necessity for which arises from the Egyptian Government's formal notice to B.O.A.C. on 23th November, 1946, that their authorisation to operate to and through Egypt would terminate on 29th May, 1947, has reached the following stages:- . (i) A draft Agreement -has been prepared by M.C.A. and discussed with the Foreign Office. • (ii) Copies of the draft have been forwarded to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, requesting their comments and enquiring whether the respective governments wish to associate themselves with the U.K. Government in their proposed negotiations with the Egyptian Government by the appointment of a representative to join the U.K. delegation or, if they would wish, the U.K* delegation to negotiate on their behalf. Since the timing of the approach to the Egyptian Government may be influenced by political considerations, the M.C.A. will look to the Foreign Office and H.M. Ambassador for advice on this point. 108. The x^noject put forward by Mr. Moustaki of the Brooks Civil and Aeronautical Engineering Company for the formation of a Company in Egypt for the repair and maintenance of aircraft is under discussion with Airwork (Heston) - to whom, according to Mr. Moustaki, the management agency is to be offered S.B.a.C. and the ,Ministry of 8ux)ply. Mr. Moustaki is understood to have ''' approached the Egyptian Minister of National Mofence with a view to obtaining a suitable site at Alma^za or Farouk Field. (The original proposal to commence activities at Aboukir avjpears to have been abandoned.) 109. Consequent upon the withdrawal of the R.a.F. from Egypt, arrangements are in hand for the loan of five Civil Air Traffic Controllers to the Egyptian Government for a period of six months. Two, so far, have taken up duties. 110. For political reasons, and also in view of the fact that rapid communication is being provided between Almaza and the R.A.F.

On 7th December, 1946, the Iraqi Government made formal application for the appointment of a British national as Director of meteorological Services in Iraq. The Air Ministry accordingly made the necessary arrangements to recruit. Against this, however, it is to be noted that the Ear East Technical Survey Party which visited Baghdad en route reported that the D.C.^. Iraq had sent forward for approval the name of an Iraqi, ^bdui Jabbar Abdullah, and had suggested that the British Meteorologist should be an adviser. This unsatisfactory alternative has since been ruled out. Arrangements for the appointment of a British Director are nearing completion. 113. Iraqi airways have made representations to 'Turkey for the operation of an air service between Baghdad and ^nkara and were reported, towards the end of February, to be on the point of sending a British member of their staff to make the necessary arrangements with the Turks. The Turks intimated, however, that they would like the Iraqis to send a 'deputation' to discuss it. The Iraqis are in the process of appointing a Committee to appoint the deputation.- The Manager of Iraqi Airways has expressed a fear that at this rate it will be several months before the service actually opens. Iraqi Airways at present provide the following services:- • Baghdad - Damascus - Beirut Baghdad - Lydda - Cairo Baghdad - Mosul Baghdad - Basra (Twice weekly) (Twice weekly) (Weekly) (Twice daily) 114. The negotiations for a bilateral agreement between Iraq and the U.o.A. appear to be progressing favourably. In a letter dated 15th February, 194/4 Foreign Office inf or'seed the American Embassy in London that last September H.M.G. had expressed the hope that Iraq would conclude a bilateral agreement on the Bermuda model. They added that those representations might have been of assistance to the U.S. negotiators since recent information from Baghdad indicated that it was expected that P.A..,. and T.W.A. would shortly receive permission to operate through Ira j, 'under the same conditions as they enjoy under the F. ..-Lebanon civil ain agreement' - i.e. under Bermuda conditions. Paragraph 79 of liiddlo East 6 reiP 's. SUDAN. 115. Plans for the improvement of Wadi oeidna aerodrome to take Tudor II's, including the 'carpeting' of the runways by the aid of the Barber Greene apparatus, are still under active consideration. It is to be noted, however, that in view of the airfield’s uncertain future, any developments will need further specific approval. 116. The development of a site for an aerodrome at Gmdurvaan is still in an exploratory stage. 117. A report from the-Governor-General indicates that Sudanese Aerodrome Officers are being posted to Wadi Haifa and Juba to deal with trunic route aircraft. This would obviate the necessity of posting B.O.A.C. .air Traffic Controllers at /the seCIV. 9615 * - 5 - L_ these aerodromes. The Governor-General has, however, been asked for his views on the suitability and competency of these officers and whether similar ^arrangements are to be made at lialakal. PALEGTI1TE. 118. According to a recent note from Air ninistry, Lydda Airport, which is at present an R.A.F. controlled airfield, is to be handed over to civil Control as soon as possible under the terms of an agreement between H.A.G. and the Palestine Government. The R.A.F. will, however, retain lodger rights at the aerodrome. The use of Lydda is mainly confined at present to i/iED. i/i.E. theatre services and the number of R.A.F. personnel there has been reduced to meet these counitmonts only. Fayid is now used as the main R.A.F. trunk route Staging Post in i'iFD. j/i.E. iJED. ii.E. arc now anxious to be relieved of the responsibility for Lydda and the Air .dnistry are prepared to hand it over to the civil authorities as soon as they are in a position to assume responsibility for the airfield and can provide the requisite personnel to man it* In view of the possibility, however, of an extension of R.A.F. operational commitments in Palestine, the Air Linistry recognise that they have a responsibility to see that Lydda does not fall below acceptable standards of efficiency. Latest information indicates that these conditions will, be fulfilled and the 'hand over' is likely to take place in the near future. 119* The question of bringing Lydda up to Tudor II standard - a sum of L227,000 is mentioned in this connection - is under consideration. ADEN. 120 Nr. Bechgvvard, Crown Councel, has been appointed Director of Civil Aviation, Aden, with effect from 1st January, 19V7, in audition to his other auties. PERSI AN GU L F. 121. The Air ministry has agreed to continue the present policy of keeping airfields on the South Arabian air route (including Salalah and Lasirah Island) open by means of care and maintenance parties. ' Limited facilities for casual visiting aircraft would only consist of point-to-point comraunications for signalling aircraft in and out. 122. A proposal for a n.E.A.T. Board service Cairo-Baghdad-Basra-Bahrein has been discussed with B.O.A.C.‘who do not agree with the proposal on the grounds that (a) it is impolitic to increase L.E.A.T. Board services at a time when there is difficulty in substantiating a 'raison d'etre' for existing ones and (bj a service Cairo-Bahrein which would cater for passengers to and from the U.K. would impose an unacceptable additional strain on U.K. - Cairo service which is already severely taxed, due to recent reduction in frequency. Alternative proposals for serving Bahrein by a flying boat service are under consideration by the Corporation.

The final reactions of the Colonial Office and the Government of Cyprus are awaited.

CYRENAICA. 124* The question of undesignating the R.A.P. Controlled Castel Benito Alport and designating in lieu nellaha (maintained by the Americans) in the interests mainly of charter operators is still under active consideration. The problem is rendered more complex by a recent request from B.O.A.G. to use Castel Benito for their trunk services in lieu of ^ialta until repairs to the latter airfield have been put in hand. 125. A somevdiat similar problem exists in the case of El Adem and Benina, iieanwhile, a report on the full Civil Aviation requirements at Benina is awaited. ERITREA. 126. In consequence of the consultations on Asmara aerodrome between si.C.A., Treasury and the Tar Office foreshadowed in paragraph 44 of A.E. Summary No.5, the Treasury have agreed to repair work being undertaken on the two runways within a maximum of 010,000. 127. While this ministry holds the view that it is desirable that the aerodrome shoula be maintained, it feels that the responsibility for operating and maintaining it must rest with the B.-jl.A. -with B.O.A.C. acting as their agents, and that there can be no question of the cost of the aerodrome falling on M.C.A. funds. In this connection it is understood that the B.O.A.C. figures of running .costs are currently under examination by the B.wI.A. authorities in Eritrea with a view to operating with the strictest economy and austerity consistent with safety. Nue to difficulties in arranging Ronoo facilities, in turn due to the extreme pressure of work in the Section concerned the publication of the present summary has been unavoidably delayed.

It was also suggested in paragraph 3 of Middle East Summary No. 5 that member states of the League might weaken in the face of pressure from more powerful non-Arab states, Egypt and the Lebanon have already concluded Bermuda - type agreements with the U.S.A. and it is now reported from Baghdad that Iraq -will probably grant the U.S. rights in the standard Bermuda form. Turkey Iran Saudi-Arabia CIV. 8071. /U. S/ seems CIV. 8071 2 U. S. sources state that negotiations are also nearly complete for a similar treaty with Syria. ^ 48. As a background to this subject a brief history of the Arab League may be of interest. In the latter half of 1943 and the first half of 1944 the then Egyptian Prime Minister, Mustafa an - Nahhas Pasha, held a series of conversations on Arab unity with representatives of other Arab Governments. m preparatory committee met in Alexandria on 28th September 1944, which was attended by representatives of Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, Saudi-Arabia, the Yemen and also a representative of the Palestinian Arabs. On 7th October a Protocol was signed by the first seven states. a Preparatory Committee met in Cairo in February 1943 and again on 17th March, with representatives of all the states mentioned above except the Yemen, On 22nd March the representatives of Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Trans-Jordan and Saudi- iirabia signed the 'Pact of the ijrab League' at the first meeting of the Plenary Arab Congress. A copy was sent to the Imam of the Yemen for his adherence. 49« The object the League was to draw closer the relations between member slates, to co-ordinate political action, to safeguard their soveriegnty and to interest themselves generally in questions affecting Arab countries; it provided also for co-operation in economic, financial, cultural and social problems and questions affecting communications, passports, extradition, etc. There was also a pact of non-agression. The permanent seat of t le League is Cairo, where there is a permanent Secretariat General. The Council meets in ordinary session twice a year. Any member state can withdraw from the League after a year's notice and the Council by unanimous vote can exclude any member-state which has not fulfilled its obligations. The Pact can be modified by a two-thirds majority. An annex to the Pact concerns Palestine: it declares that Palestine since her liberation from Ottoman rile is T de jure* independent (sic) and that a representative of Palestinian Arabs should participate in the work of the League. 30. At the eleventh session of the Arab League Council it is reported that thirteen of the articles included in the draft civil aviation convention between member states were approved. It was further decided to form a Civil Aviation Council to enforce the provisions of the convention and to encourage closer co-operation between members: this Civil Aviation Council should include two delegates from each of the member states and two technical advisers (without a vote). It was also declared that, aircraft should not be allowed to fly over the holy places in the Hejaz except by special authorisation, 31. As a result of the enquiry set up to investigate the T.W.A, pilots r strike of last autumn, the Pilots Arbitration Panel has ordered increased rates of pay which it is estimated will cost T.YAA. about $ 15,000 per month. 52. 'Aeroplane', in their number for 17th January, printed a column on the general question of T.W.A’s commercial future. The columrAst refers to a Wall Street rumour that P.A.A. may buy up T.W.A.: The rumour is evidently based on the very weak financial position of T.W.A., whose domestic losses alone are four times greater than the biggest loss shewn by any other U.S. company - and in fact many shewed profits - while their overseas expansion has been on the most extravagant lines. Juan Trippe of P.A.A. also has a strong interest in buying out T.W.A., not only to stem T.W.A’s overseas encroachments but also in an attempt to ’inherit' their domestic routes and so settle out of hand the C.A.B. Domestic Route Case which is now ’sub judice’. Whether the C.A.B. will allow this to happen is doubtful. And' whether T* A A# can survive at allCIV. 8071. 3 - BXT seeins to depend on the decision of the U#S, Reconstruction and Finance Corporation over the $40,000,000 loan (see paragraph 4- of Middle East rvSummary No* 5). ^ All commercial banks have refused T*W. A., a loan. The G-cvemment loan in its turn maybe conditional on a change of management: apparently Howard Hughes, co-founder with Jack Frye of T.W.A. and holder of 4o/o of the^outstanding common stock of the company, fell out with Frye and left to join Kaiser*s: the Reconstruction and Finance Corporation may insist on this outstanding rift being settled in one way or another. 53* ^ On the 17th of January a K.L.M. delegation left the Hague to negotiate agreements with Iraq and Iran en route to India, Turkey 54-. According to a report in 'Aeroplane' of 3rd January two Beechcraft D-18 all-metal transports (the civil version of the Expediter), modified for photo survey work, have been bought by the Turkish Government. A Beechcraft pilot will stay for several months in Turkey to supervise training and instruction. Services presently operated by D.H.i'. are shown below.

The flight from London to Ankara (2,1 e9 miles) was flown non-stop. After spending the night at Ankara the aircraft made the return journey the next day, Lebanon 57.

The Lebanese-Air France conpany La Conpa&amp;uie G&amp;n&amp;rale de Transport (C.G.T,) operate four times a week from Beirut to Cairo (Almaza) and once a week from Beirut to Baghdad. 59. A signals representative from B.O.A.C. recently visited Lebanon and reported that civil meteorological, telecommunications and aeradio facilities are being adequately operated, but that there is a serious lack of trained Air Traffic Control Officers, Syria 6JO. There is nothing further to report. /IranCIV. 8071 /in..•• * ~ 4 - Iran 61 i In paragraph 17 of Liddlo East Summary No, 5 it was recorded that Iranian airways had acquired another Dakota, They have also acquired two/*** more Fairchilds, Their fleet new consists of.eight Dakotas and four Fairchilds, The company...has made a trial flight -to Tabriz and announce that they will institute a regular service, but they are being hampered by lack of adequate met reports from the Russian meteorologist at Teheran, 62, The Russian company, a subsidiary of Aerflot, continue to operate more or less regular services.to lieshed and Tabriz from Teheran. Afghanistan 63* There is nothing further to rejjort.

On January T, ..A#.started its onee—weekly service to India, which calls at Dhahran on the last stage to Bombay, Ethiopia 67. An advertisement appeared in the 'Ethiopian Herald' on 27th January announcing that Pan-African Charters Ltd of Johannesburg will call every Tuesday at Addis Ababa and will accept freight and passengers for Asmara, Cairo, xrthens, Rome, Marseilles and London, No doubt this is another example of a ‘regular’ non-scheduled flight series. According to Mitchell Cotts representative in Addis Ababa this has been instituted under verbal agreement with the Ethiopians. '■d£ypt 68 . Egypt has not yet formally ratified the U.S. Agreement of 15th June 1946. (Appendix A to Middle East Summary No, 1 ref era) 69- According to press reports of the 31st January negotiations for a Franco-Egyptian air transport agreement have been suspended. The mam questions are said to have already been settled and the discussions have been suspended to allow consideration by the two governments of outstanding points, mir France is to continue to havu operating rights on a non-discriminatory basis. 70. The Department of Civil Aviation is in an unsettled state: the Arab Press announcement, quoted in paragraph 28 of Middle East Summary No.. 5 , that Rushdi Bey had resigned his appointment is not strictly true: it seems that King Farouk has declined to confirm his appointment as Under Secretary of State for Air. Moursi Bey is acting as Director General Civil Aviation but, although Rushdi Bey is supposed to be on leave outside the capital, he is in fact in Cairo and is proving a source of embarrassment to his successor. 71. Reference has been made in previous summaries to the existence of two airfields serving Cairo: Almaz a, which is used by B.O.i.C., Misr and • most international operators; and the cx-UMLa-, i.,F» base at Payne Field (since re-named King Farouk Field). The P. I.C.a. C. Middle East Regional Conference recommended that both airfields should be designated as Long Range Regular Airports and should be brought up to P.I.C.a.O, Standard B.CIV. 8071 In January of this year a mission from this Ministry went to Cairo, first, to find out whether the Egyptians intended to develop both, if not both, which, ££id to try to influence then to designate ^Imaza* Secondly, to persuade them develop one airfield by June 1947 to-take the Tudor II# (Postponement of the target date for Tudor II operations has made this consideration less urgent.) Present Egyptian opinion seems to incline towards King Parouk Field but the arguments of the U.K. mission were probably not without influence. 72. While the U.K. mission was in Cairo certain other questions were discussed. . . Group Caj^tain Ibrahim, Egyptian Chief Control Officer, agreed at his level to take two British'Air Traffic Control Officers for .ALmaza and also accepted the U.K. offer to train four Egyptian Control Officers in England; the training would be provided free, except for subsistence and the cost of the voyage which the Egyptians would pay. This agreement is subject to Treasury approval in the U.K. and confirmation by the Egyptian Government. The R.A.F. move out of Villa Rose, Almaza, Heliopolis and El Hagg by 31st March and arrangements are in train to hand over to the Egyptians, though there is some doubt whether they will be able to maintain adequately the existing facilities. The Chief Meteorological Officer, Suliman, seems efficient and his department is probably capable of taking over without any assistance from us. The Egyptians also agreed to take over B.O.ij-.C’s point-tc-x^oint signals communications. 73. The Egyptian Department of Civil Aviation informed B.O.A.C. in January 1947 that they must evacuate the flying boat base at Rod El Farag by 1st February, in spite of a previous verbal assurance from Rushdi Bey that they need not move until the new base at Mariut had been completed and found to be satisfactory. The reason alleged was that Rod El Farag was dangerous on quarantine grounds, but it seems that the property is v/anted on other grounds and private intrigue has put x'/ressure on. the Department. B.O.A.C. have been given another reprieve. 74. Misr, as was generally exxjecteft, has voiced her objection to competition on local routes from Dakotas of Iraqi Airways, operated by B. O.A.C. on charter, f\ndof laddie East Airlines, bought and operated by El Hoss’■ company. Under the agreement whereby Misr acquired British .^vro XIX’s the company is bound to replace them with British aircraft. They are‘therefore^prevented from buying ex-military Dakotas and they cannot get suitable British types. What lends more point to this is the fact that one of their Avros was damaged • recently by a B.O.A.C, Lode stab. 75* Services presently being operated by Misr are shewn below:— Route * 'Weakly frequency Type of aircraft Cairo - Alexandria Cairo - Port Said - Alexandria Cairo - Assiut - Luxor Cairo - Lydda - Tel Aviv - Jerusalem Cairo - Haifa Cairo - Beirut Cairo - Damascus Cairo - Lydda - Tel x^viv - Jerusalem - Tel Avivj Lydda - Damascus - Baghdad Cairo - Lydda - Jerusalem - Tel Aviv - Lydda - Nicosia 21 Avro XIX 7 D.H. 89 4 Avro XIX 14 Beechcraft 3 , Avro XIX 14 Beechcraft 2 Beechcraft 7 Beechcraft 2 Beechcraft 76.

At the same time they asked for a British Director of Meteorological Services. They already have a British subject as Expert Radio Engineer in their Civil Aviation Directorate, Squadron Leader C.B.J. Gilroy, who was engaged in the late spring of 1946 j and in December' they ..ngaged as Control Officer, Baghdad, on a two-year contract an ex-E.„.F. ./arrant Officer, Mr. R. Brooksbank. 79. As was stated in paragraph 47 above, the U.S.^. are likely to conclude* shortly working agreements for P.A.A. and T.w.A., which, to avoid the appearance of ignoring Arab League recommendations, will be described as being ‘on the same conditions as the U.S. - Lebanon bilateral agreement’. 80. Services presently operated by Iraqi Airways with D.H, Rapides (excluding the Dakota service Cairo - Baghdad - Beirut - Baghdad - Cairo which is being operated twice weekly by B. 0,^.C, on charter) are shov/n below:- Baghdad - Basra (14) Baghdad - Kirkuk - Erbil - mosul (2) Baghdad - H.3* - Beirut (3) Baghdad - H.3* - Damascus (2) Sudan 81. Work on extending the runways at Wadi Seidna South is held up solely because certain parts of the Asphalting Machine, due to come from the U.S. A., have, not yet arrived. The Sudan Government is pressing the U.K. to start work on the Omdurman site. Not only is Wadi Seidna South wanted for Gordon's College, but also its communication with Khartoum is poor; Khartoum Civil Airport is wanted for building development under the new city plan and in any case is unusable during the rainy season. Palestine 82. It is reported that Eastern Airways Ltd. has declined the Government offer to take 30/3 of the shares ir the proposed Palestine Airways (Paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Middle East Summary No. 1 refer.) rt the same time' we have heard confidentially that Skyways have been approached by a certain Mr. J. Morris to operate a service 1 under charter from Western Europe to Palestine, Tel.Aviv being the Palestine terminal and Paris or Eire the European terminal. Mr. Morris, in anticipatory v;©in, expects that the aircraft will be registered with the new Jewish State. From the above it seems likely that the formation of Palestine Airways as proposed will be delayed. 83 . The Far East Survey Party has sent back a preliminary report on Lydda airfield. The cost of developing the airfield to P. I.C.A. 0. Class B (£2,000,000) or Class C (£1,100,000) differs so considerably from that necessary to make it usable by the Tudor II (£200,000) that it seems probable that, for the moment 7.I.C.A.O. Middle East Regional Conference recommendations oannct be implemented and work will.proceed merely to bring it up to Class C length but not bearing strength . , . . 84. As far as met., air traffic control and communications are concerned, the Survey Party recommend that Lydda should have an Independent Met.

It is not clear whether Ethiopia is being regarded as a Member State of the Arab League, or 'whether the inter-Arab State and Arab - Non-Arab State agreement are exactly similar, or whether the draft in B.O.A.C.’s possession has wrongly been described as an inter-Arab State Agreement.

PAA asked for 10A financial participation ru. this was refuse . Lt seems that P,. 1 have already provided tw r c Dakotas and miscellaneous equipment and pilots. 'TLd Company has been formed' by the Sedhnawi group .no intends to opor' te services to Cairo, Baghdad and Teheran as well as intern .1 services. It is not yet certain that P/A. will be technical advisers to this company and there may be an opening for British interests. The possibility is being explored. It is reported that Sedhrawi was finally persuaded to take cheap converted Dakotas, for which he had been promised an early delivery, rather than Vikings which were more expensive and net available until July 1947. Ir' .n Recent reports from our ^lir attache in Teheran, which have been confin ted. and amplified by a visit of iir. I.Iadon,a director of Eagle Airlines, have thrown some light on the position and objects of this company. It seems that . 1 . airshan of Levantour no lodger intends to form a company of his own but is taking 2fg of the sir .res in Eagle airlines on the condition that Levantour shc.ll m.-.nage the coir.icrci'.1 side for the ne’z company. The company is entirely Persian and has a. sound, financial banking; it is perhaps significant that among the sn rmolaers are .Ar, Nikpay, :ALnist.er of Posts Tele^ raphs and Tclcuhcncs, ^nc. »■ 1 , :i. e. iq, tne Director of Civil itviation. The company is anxious to have^British ‘.ircraft and British technic,‘.1 advise^;so f-r they have resisted xx. nrican attempts to sell them Expeditors and Dakotas and' are a.nxious to buy Doves when these are available. 13. It seems likely that Iranian State Airlines will cease operating as soon as Eagle Airlines is in a position to begin their services. The State airlines are probably beyond resuscitation and it has been rumoured that their mail contract is to be given to Iranian Airways. Mr. Madon hov:ever states that Eagle Airlines will be given a contract for the carriage of all internal air mails. 14. Shefiq is pursuing urgently the provision of suitable meteorological and control facilities on the route Baghdad - Teheran as a result of numerous complaints from airline operators. The Iranian Government has agreed to take on ten local mcte.orolo ical observers previously employed by the R.A, F, 15. Shefiq is anxious to conclude an a*ir services agreement both with the India Government and with the U. K. Government. His proposal for a service to India follows a route Teheran - Persian Gulf ( presumably Abadan-Bushire - Bandar Abbas- Karachi^ 16.

Thi W^our has not been confiri.ied by the ministry of National Defence but it is l jnificant that Rushdi Bey has left Cairo on ten weeks leave. The reason for his resignation is not known, but it is suggested that it is due to Palace opposition to his appointment as Under Secretary of State for Air. 29. The Per East Survey Party is visiting Cairo, and at the sane tine a small technical survey party left the U,K. on 10th January 1946 , to examine in. detail Ainaza and Payne Piold, to see how soon and at what cost one or other of these two airfields could be made suitable for Tudor II operations. The survey party ..ill '.Iso take the opportunity to liscuss through the British Embassy the possibility of British flying control and meteorological officers being appcinte r . by the Egyptian Government to Air;aza* • It is difficult to forecast what the outcome of this exploratory visit will be: although the middle East Regional Conference of PICAO rocon. ended that'both Alnaza and Payne Field should be named as Long Range Regular airports, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Egyptian Government will not be willing to maintain at considerable expense two contiguous airports and that they will choose whichever of the two is less expensive to develop and maintain. 30 , There, is a proposal, sponsored by Sir Alexander Keown Boyd., to acquire iiboukir Airfield as an aircraft maintenance base. The equipment of an R.A,F. ...mintenance Unit is now on sale through the R,F, Disposals Board in Egypt and this has prompted the proposal. Nothing has yet been decided but Airwork and B.0.A.C. are being consulted. Trans-Jordan 31* There is nothing further to report. 32. The Far East Survey Party is visiting Iran to exarinc the suite-bility of Baghdad and Basra, airfields for Tudor II aircraft,, Yemen 33. The future of Kanaran Island, which a,t present is being .administered jointly by the Government's of U.

The airfield on Kamare,n Island nay be of importance to the R.A, F. on their subsidiary route to India via Khartoum, Aden and the Hadrnmaut Coast, but it seems unlikely that it will have any commercial interest at all. The island is at the moment being visited twice a week by a M. E. A. T. Board service from Cairo, but neither Aisr nor Egyptian airways is anxious to operate this service on commercial grounds and, if the British Administration is withdrawn from the Island, there will be no grounds whatever for calling there.

Headquarters R # A.F, IIKDI'E point out that at the moment makers are being provided at Salalah by the Sultan of Muscat and that there are Aden Protectorate levies at a. sir ah. They suggest that, as the numbers of British involved ere only fifty, it will be more economical in the long run to maintain reliable and competent R. 1 , P, personnel at these bases. It seems probabl^. that the present care and maintenance arrangements will continue. Cyprus 39* A technical expert from this Ministry is visiting Cyprus this month to look at Nicosia and Tynbcu airfields and to make recom endations for J.E.C, and the Governor of Cyprus, in view of the proposal to form a Cyprus Airline. 40.

BiO.A.C* has therefore been asked to consider how otherwise tnese routes can be covered. Aircraft Situation 155* Investigation of the report that the'Dominie spares position in the Middle Bast is serious has disclosed tnat there is no substance in the rumour. De Havillands say that they nave no orders outstanding and, in fact, tney recently received a request from Middle East airlines to stop sending them spares as delivery was in excess of requirements. Iranian State Airlines, which were reported to be grounded earlier in the year due to lack of spares, nave no outstanding orders with De Havilland; De Havillands nave recently given quotations for price and delivery date to a firm acting as agents for this airline, so an order may be received in tne future. Turke y 156. There is notning furtner to report, Lebanon 157* There is notning further to report, Syria 158« A group of Syrian financiers, which includes Mr-j Sennaoui, has recently bought two Dakotas from the United States Disposals Board in Italy, and the aircraft are now being converted in Turin, for civil air operations. It is re ported that, although there will be no United States financial holding in this venture, the aircraft will be operated by P.A.A* crews and it is tne intention of the Company to offer pilgrim charter work to Kang ibn Saud. Tnere is just a possibility that this report is linked with a rumour which Mr. Hilary heard in Cairo in October of this year to the effect that P.A.A. had offered charter services to King Ibn Saud, but in the latter oase the aircraft' mentioned were Skymasiers. Iran 159* We have had a report that Swedish A.B.A. opened a once monthly service as from the 13th November, running Stockholm - Copenhagen - Rate - Ankara - Baghdad - Teheran. 160. Shefiq is making use of United Staves equipment to improve w/T, Point to Point and radio navigation facilities in Iran. According to the report of the Aerodromes Air Routes and Ground Aids Committee, P.I.O.AOQ. Middle East Regional Conference,Iran intends to build no less than four intercontinental Airports: Abadan, Teheran (Mehrabad), Zahidan and Kermanshah • 161. Mr. Shahidi and a group of Persian financiers have formed a new airline, which is to be called Eagle Airlines, and they intend to acquire two Airspeed Consuls and two 2-seater Austers. They ha- . also asked for a British managerand technical and ground staff. One of the directors of the Company, Mr Madon, is in Europe now and has been instructed to come to tnis country to buy the aiparaft and try to obtain the necessary staff, 162, Iranian Airways is now advertising a twice weekly service to Beirut via Baghdad, As far as can be determined, tne present services being operated by this Company are as follows Route Weekly Frequency Teheran - Basra direct Once Teheran - Basra via Baghdad Twice Teheran - Cairo Once Teheran - Pahlevi Twice Teheran - Meshed Twice Teheran - Kermanshan - Baghdad Once Teheran - Baghdad - Beirut Twice Teheran Circular service - - Ahwaz - Abadan - Bushire - Shiraz - Isfahan --Teheran / Circular service - Twice Teheran - Yezd - Kerman - Yezd - Teneran Once Afghanistan - ^ - - - - - - - 163* It has been reported that Afghanistan is building an airport to Inter continental standard at Khawaga (Qabul), to replace Sherpur aerodrome some time in 1947* There, are also airfields (P.I.C.A.O. Standard E) at Herat and Kandahar. Saudi Arabia 16A. Detailed estimates for the cost of the training unit have now been received and are being examined, 163, A rexx&gt;rt from 'Anerican Aviation Daily' of 29th October, 1946, states that T.W.A. has signed a contract with King Ibn Saud for management of the recently created Saudi Arabian Airlines(sic). It says that T.W.A. will nave no financial holding. It also states that tne airline, in addition to domestic services, will run external services to Cairo, Damascus and other Near East points, using six Douglas DC-3s, Tnis agrees substantially witn Mr, Hilary’s report, which was quoted in paragraph 131 of Middle East Summary No. 3, except that the number of aircraft has gone up by one. 1 . \ Ethiopia 166, Recent information from our Minister in Addis Ababa reports tnat Ethiopian Airlines Incorporated has now opened tne Dire Dawa route wnich-was forecast in paragraph 134 of Summary No.3- 167, As an example of the increased freight trade which has resulted from tne setting up of the airline and especially from the institution of the Djibouti - Aden service, H'.B.M, Minister in Addis Ababa quotes statistics for imports through the airport for the period 10th July to 10th August (E ^ f 000) and period 10th August to 10th September (E jz(360,000), which conpares with tne previous monthly average of E $20,000. Final approval for the Aden Service was notified on the 19tn June, 1946, and clearly this large increase in freight traffic is a direct result. 168, The Ethiopian Government has now sent a formal request to operate from Addis Ababa to Nairobi to H.B.M. Legation, Addis Ababa, for transmission to the East /AfricanCIV. 6178 4 b l &gt; k frioc.n G-overnors’ Conference. At the same time they asked for permission to set up an independent agent at Nairobi. Egypt ^ 169 .' An extract from 'International Aviation' of the 1st November, 1946, says that throe Beechcraft D.lSa were flown from the U.S. to Cairo in early November for Misr, It also added that Misr Airlirfes were expecting heavy air traffic during the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in November and no doubt these aircraft would pe used on charter operations. The pilot from the Company will remain in Egypt for four months to train pilots for these planes. This report links up with information which we received recently, dated 13th August, that Misr Air lines had applied to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for ^300,000 for purchase of U.S. aircraft, because tneir technical staff had alleged that the U.K. could provide only four suitable aircraft and those not before March or April, 1947, whereas the United States could deliver within eighty days of tne order being placed. At the same time the Board is said to be considering the purchase of Vikings, but no decision on this has yet been taken. 1?0. The appointment of Carnal Bey Kotby, who until recently was manager of Misr Flying School, as Operations Supervisor and Second-in-Ccmmand to Abdelsalam Bey Osman, has apparently been strongly resented within the Company. Pernaps as a result of this and certainly becuase of the general decline in efficiency within the Company, there have been two resignations and one threatened resign ation; Captain Luxton, the chief pilot has resigned and leaves the Company in April 1947, and Mr. Lawrence, the only British engineer left with Misr, has also resigned and will leave in January. At the same time, the United States Beechcraft pilot referred to above has threatened to resign and may not stay for the full four months. It is alleged that these resignations are chiefly due to the bad state of training of the pilots, which leads to a lowering of the safety standards, a number of accidents, and the consequent increase and difficulty of ground maintenance. Abdelsalam Bey is aware of these shortcomings and Kotby is anxious to bring in British pilots. But apparently .Rus'hdi Bey has persuaded the Board to agree to take pilots transferred from the Royal Egyptian Air Force; even now the proportion of ex-R.E.A.F. pilots to regular airline pilots is 30:30; The hope was expressed by Abdelsalam Bey that, when the formation of Egyptian Airways had been sanctioned, British aircraft and crews would be able to operate under charter to Baghdad and other long range routes. 171« Misr Flying Scnool was recently put up for sale. One offer has been received and that was turned down because the prospective buyer was not prepared to co-operate with Misr. As the Flying School is apparently doing muen better now, it is possib le that the sale will not go tnrough. 172. On the 11th November, 1946, Mohamed Rushdi Bey was appointed Under-Secretary of State for National Defence (Aviation Matters). He is now responsible for the Royal Egyptian Air Force, Civil Aviation Department and the Meteorological services, but whether or not he will be obliged to resign from his position as a director of Misr Airways is not certain. 173; A meeting was Held on 14th November to discuss the appointment of an Air Traffic Controller at Almaza. The meeting also discussed an offer to the Egyptians of training in the U.K. for their Control Officers and proposals are now under consideration for the training of twenty Egyptian candidates at R.A.F. courses at Watchfield. Trans-Jordan 174« There is nothing further to report. Iraq 175. As mentioned in paragraph 159 above, Swedish ABA are running a service once monthly to Teheran via Baghdad. /176civ. 6178 5 (R) X) 1/6.

The R.A.F. has announced its intention of reducing their Station at Bahrein to an emergency base with only a small handling party* The signals facilities will be available only from dawn to dusk and will not include R/T aerodrome control, but will include VHF/DF, M.F. Beacons, Eureka Beacons, and a point to point W/T administrative channel. Cyprus 183. A record of the meeting held in Cyprus on tne 12th October, 1946, to discuss the formation of Cyprus Airways, Ltd., has been received. Tnere is very little to add to what has already been reported in previous summaries, but tne estimate of traffic offering whicn was put forward at that meeting is inter esting to note. It was assessed at nine aircraft per day botn in and out,which, at lirst signt and taking into account tne services already being operated by Misr and Middle East Airlines, does not appear to justify the formation of an other airline. On the other hand, as was suggested in paragraph 145 in Middle East Summary No*3, estimates of traffic offering have possibly erred on the conservative side. The meeting emphasised the urgent need, first, to arrange for joint user with the R.A.F. of Nicosia airfield in the immediate future; secondly, to investigate the cost of developing Tymbou and -.the annual cost of maintenance; and, lastly, to consider how these costs could be met. /Aden.X 6.

B.OoA.C. has therefore been asked to consider how otherwise tnese routes can be covered. Aircraft Situation 135» Investigation of the report that the Dominie spares position in the Middle East is serious has disclosed tnut there is no substance in the rumour. De Havillands say that they nave no orders outstanding and, in fact, tney recently received a request from Middle East airlines to stop sending them spares as delivery was in excess of requirements. Iranian State Airlines, which were reported to be grounded earlier in the year due to lack of spares, nave no outstanding orders with De Havilland; De Havillands have recently given quotations for price and delivery date to a firm acting as agents for this airline, so an order may be received in tne future. Turkey . . f . . 156 . There is notning furtner to report. Lebanon 157- There is notning further to report, Syria 158« A group of Syrian financiers, which includes Mr, Sehnaoui, has recently bought two Dakotas from the United States Disposals Board in Italy, and the aircraft are now being converted in Turin, for civil air operations. It is re ported that, although there will be no United States financial holding in this venture, the aircraft will be operated by P,A»Ae crews and it is tne intention of the Company to offer pilgrim charter wor to King .Can Saud. There is just a possibility that this report is linked wi: „. a rumour which Mrs Hilary heard in Cairo in October of this year to the effect that P,A.A. had offered charter services to King Ibn Saud, but in the latter case the aircraft mentioned were Skymasters. Iran 159* We have had a report that Swedish A.B.A. opened a once monthly service as from the 13th November, running Stockholm - Copenhagen - Rome - Ankara - Baghdad - Teheran. &lt; 160. Shefiq is making use of United States equipment to improve W/T, Point to Point and radio navigation facilities in Iran. According to the report of the Aerodromes Air Routes and Ground Aids Committee, P.I.C.AOO. Middle East Regional Conference,Iran intends to build no less than four intercontinental Airports: Abadan, Teheran (Mehrabad), Zahidan and Kerman shah . 161. Mr. Shahidi and a group of Persian financiers have formed a new airline, which is to be called Eagle Airlines, and tney intend to acquire two Airspeed Consuls and two 2-seater Austers. They nave also asked for a British manager CIV. 6178 /and.civ. 6178 3* and technical and ground suaff. One of the directors of the Company, Mr Madon, is ^ Europe nov; and has been instructed to come to this country to buy the aircraft and try to obtain the necessary staff* 162. Iranian Airways is now advertising a twice weekly service to Beirut via Baghdad. As far as can be determined, tne present services being operated by this Company are as follows Route V/eekly Frequency Teheran - Basra direct Once Teheran - Basra via Baghdad Twice Teheran - Cairo Once Teheran - Pahlevi Twice Teheran - Meshed Twice Teheran - Kerman shah - Baghdad Once Teheran - Baghdad - Beirut Twice Teheran Circular service - - Ahwaz - Abadan - Bushire - Shiraz - Isfahan - Teheran Twice Circular service - Teheran - Yezd - Kerman - Yezd - Teheran Once Afgiianistan 163, It has been reported that Afghanistan is building an airport to Inter-^ continental standard at Khawaga (Qabul), to replace Sherpur aerodrome some time in 1947* There are also airfields (P.I.C.A.O* Standard P) at Herat and Kandahar* Saudi Arabia 164# Detailed estimates for the cost of the training unit have now been received and are being examined. ■ • 4 165» A report from 'American Aviation Daily' of 29th October, 1 94e t states tnat T.W.A. has signed a contract with King Ibn Baud for management of the recently created Saudi Arabian Airlines(sic). It says that T.W.A. will nave no financial holding. It also states tiiat tne airline, in addition to domestic services, will run external services to Cairo, Damascus and otner Near jiast points, using six Douglas DC-3s. Tnis agrees substantially with Mr. Hilary’s report, which was quoted in paragraph 13'! of Middle East Summary Ho. 3, except that the number of aircraft has gone up by one. Ethiopia 166. Recent information from our Minister in Addis Ababa reports tnat Ethiopian Airlines Incorporated has now opened the Dire Dawa route wnicn .was forecast 111 paragraph 134 of Summary No.3« 167. As an example of the increased freight trade which has resulted from tne setting up of tne airline and especially from the institution of the Djibouti - Aden service, H.B.M. Minister in Addis Ababa quotes statistics 1 or imports through the airport for the period 10th July to 10th August (E #151,000; and period 10th August to 10th September (E #360,000), which conpares with one previous monthly average of E #20,000. Final approval for tne ^den ^Service notified on the 19tn June, 1946, and clearly this large increase m treignt train- is a direct result. 168. The Ethiopian Government has now sent a formal request to operate iron Addis Ababa to Nairobi to H.B.M. Legation, Addis Ababa, xor transmission to tne East /African4 CIV. 6178 • k frioan Governoi’3’ Conference* At the same time they asked for permission to set up an independent agent at Nairobi* Egypt 169* An extract from H Incernational Aviation' of the 1st November, 194&amp;, says that throe Beechcraft B*l8a -were flown from the U.S. to Cairo in early November for Misr* It also added that Misr Airlines were expecting heavy air traffic during the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in November and no doubt these aircraft would be used on charter operations. The pilot from tne Company will remain in Egypt for four months to train pilots for these planes* This report links up with information which we received recently, dated 13th August, that Misr Air lines had applied to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for ^300,000 for purenase of U.S* aircraft, because tneir technical staff had alleged that the U.K, could provide only four suitable aircraft and tnose not before March or April, 1947&gt; whereas the United States could deliver within eighty days of tine order being placed. At the same time the Board is said to be considering the purchase of Vikings, but no decision on this has yet been taken* 170. The appointment of Carnal Bey Kotby, who until recently was manager of Misr Flying School, as Operations Supervisor and Second-in-Command to Abdelsalam Bey Osman, has apparently been strongly resented within the Company* Perhaps.as a result of this and certainly becuase of the general decline in efficiency within the Company, there have been two resignations and one threatened resign ation; Captain Buxton, the chief pilot has resigned and leaves the Company in April 1947, and Mr* Lawrence, the only British engineer left with Misr, has also resigned and will leave in January. At the same time, the United States Beechcraft pilot referred to above has threatened to resign and may not stay for the full four months. It is alleged that these resignations are chiefly due to the bad state of training of the pilots, which leads to a lowering of the safety standards, a number of accidents, and the consequent increase and difficulty of ground maintenance* Abdelsalam Bey is aware of these shortcomings and Kotby is anxious to bring in British pilots. But apparently Rushdi Bey has persuaded the Board to agree to take pilots transferred from the Royal Egyptian Air Force; even now the proportion of ex-R.E.A.F. pilots to regular airline pilots is 30:30; The hope was expressed by Abdelsalam Bey that, when tne formation of Egyptian Airways had been sanctioned, British aircraft and crews would be able to operate under charter to Baghdad and other long range routes. 171* Misr Flying Scnool was recently put up for sale. One offer has been received and that was turned down because the prospective buyer was not prepared to co-operate with Misr, As the Flying School is apparently doing much better now, it is possib le that the sale will not go tnrough* 172* On the 11th November, 1946, Mohamed Rusndi Bey was appointed Under-Secretary of State for National Defence (Aviation Matters). He is now responsible for the Royal Egyptian Air Force, Civil Aviation Department and tne Meteorological services, but whetner or not he will be obliged to resign from his position as a director of Misr Airways is not certain* 173; A meeting was Held on 14th November to discuss the appointment of an Air Traffic Controller at Almaza. The meeting also discussed an offer to the Egyptians of training in tne U.K. for their Control Officers and proposals are now under consideration for the training of twenty Egyptian candidates at R.A*F. courses at Watonfield. Trans-Jordan 174« There is nothing further to report*. Iraq 173* As mentioned in paragraph 139 above, Swedish ABA are running a service once monthly to Teheran via Baghdad. /17sCIV. 6178 © 5. ^B.O.A.C. arc planning 'co arrange for the hire of vwo Dakotas and three cr ews to Iraai Airv^/ays, which will run a service Baghdad - Damascus - Beirut, ancJ^aghdad - Lydda - Cairo* This is being achieved by reducing the frequency of ■uie U.K. - Cairo Dakota service to thirteen a week from 24-th November and to ten a week from the 1st December. It is likely that there will be further requests for B.O.A.C, to operate charter services to Teheran and Ankara. It is reported that at the beginning of November the Iraqi Government olfered limited Fifth Freedom’ rights for six months to certain airlines - K.L.M. Air France, Norwegian S.A.F.A., T.VV.A., and P.A.A. These rights were to obtain between Iraq and all points outside the Arab League, though the restriction within the j- A rab League did not apply to diplomatic passengers and mail and members ol Government Missions. This offer has been accepted by the Dutch, French and Norwegian airlines, but will probably be refused by the two United States airlines. Sudan 17B. There is nothing further to report. Palestine 179* The Palestine Branch of the Canadian Association for Labour, which has its Headquarters at Montreal, has applied for shipment of two Tiger Moths to Palestine for use by the Flying Training Club. 180* In 'Flight' of 28th November 194&amp;, is published a brief account of the activities ofAviron, (See paragraph 41(a) of Summary No.1). From their school at Ramie airport over a hundred students have graduated with an official pilot’s licence. The company plans to acquire an airfield of its own and .also to develop a Maintenance Section to service aircraft of international airlines in transit. Persian Gulf States 181• The following addition should be made to the list of agreements quoted in paragraph 43 of Middle East Summary No.1 Abu Dhabi - 13th February, 1947 182. The R.A.F. has .announced its intention of reducing their Station at Bahrein to an emergency base with only a small handling party. The signals facilities will be available only from dawn to dusk and will not include I^T aerodrome control, but will include VHF/DF, M.F. Beacons, Eureka Beacons, and a point to point W/T administrative channel. * Cyprus 183. A record of the meeting held in Cyprus on tne 12th October, 1946, to discuss the formation of Cyprus Airways, Ltd., has been received. There is very little to add to what has already been reported in previous summaries, but the estimate of traffic offering which was put forward at that meeting is inter esting to note. It was assessed at nine aircraft per day both in and out,which, at first sight and taking into account the services already being operated by Misr and Middle East Airlines-, does not appear to justify the formation of an other airline. On the other hand, as was suggested in paragraph 143 ih Middle East Summary No.3, estimates of traffic offering have possibly erred on the conservative side. The meeting emphasised the urgent need, first, to arrange for joint user with the R.A.F. of Nicosia airfield in the immediate future; secondly, to investigate the cost of developing Tymbou and -.the annual cost of maintenance; and, lastly, to consider how these costs could be met. / AdenCIV. 6178 r\ 6.

The attached Middle East Summaries Nos. 1, 2 and 3 received from Planning Division, Ministry of Civil Aviation are referred for information. The subject matter is of greater interest to^and more likely to concern, the External Department than this Department, and it is suggested that the Summaries should be retained in External Department. If you agree arrangements will be made with the Planning Division for them to be addressed direct to External Department in future. We should, however, like to see them.X i t r \ NTRODUOTION TO SUMMAHY NO.l. 1, This sumniary will, if the amount of mtcrhfl justifies it, appear fort nightly. It will be in two parts: 2.

Board Services currently ope rated. (A) Information (B) Action outstanding CIV. 4661r (a) information General 6 * Of inportance is the recent interest in civil aviation v/hich has been taken by the. Arab League, In general this is a welcome tendency as it brings some form of unity into the conflicting patchwork of private national interests in this area: the U.K, Government lias abways advocated consultation betv/een neighbour states before Fifth Freedom rights are irresponsibly granted and the present policy of the Arab League should strengthen this principle, 7, Progress is summarised below: (a) At a meeting of the Civil Affairs Sub-Committee of the Communications Committee of the Arab League, held in Cairo at the beginning of June 194^&gt; it was agreed: (i) that a unified policy in the Middle East region was desirable (ii) that Arab territories, including Palestine, should be regarded as a cabotage area (iii) that a common policy -should be adopted by Arab states in the grant of Fifth Freedom to non-Arab states (iv) that a plan was necessary for building a network of air communi cations in the Middle East, (The proposal for an Arab Air Company was NOT supported), (b) At a meeting of Directors Civil Aviation of member states of the Arab League, held in Aley (Lebanon) on 8 th June 1946: (i) A form gf Inter-Arab Treaty wan drafted, providing for the mutual grant of all five freedoms with limitation of capacity according to traffic offering; for consultation before entering into agreements with non-Arab states and for revocation of existing agreements which conflict with Pan-Arab interests; for the formation of an Arab Civil Aviation Council, (ii) A form of agreement between Arab and non-Arab states v/as drafted, containing the Bermuda provisions for regulating capacity, (iii) The proposal for a Pan-Arab Air Company was definitely rejected, (iv) It was recommended that efforts should be made to secure recognition of Palestine as a non-mandated territoiy* (c) The recommendations at (b) above were considered at a meeting of the Communications Committee of the Arab League at Aley on 10th August 1946 , but the results are not yet known, 8 , First, all this is still only at the recommendation stage. Secondly, it is not yet clear how sincere are the intentions of the member states: for instance, at the Aley conference on 8 th June the Egyptian delegate v/as apparently silent about the terms of the U,S, - Egyptian agreement then being negotiated, although they were certainly in conflict with the recommendations of the conference: and on 11th August Lebanon concluded an agreement with U. S.A, giving P.A.A, conditional Fifth Freedom, Thirdly, the fact that the proposal for the formation of a Pbn-Arab Company was rejected may suggest that Arab unity is by no means complete and that national rivalries still exist, We should do well in the future to continue encouraging consultation between Arab states, v/ithout in any way sponsoring the Arab League; to try to modify the more discriminatory aspects of Pan-Arab policy: and to encourage Middle East countries to turn to British aviation experts for disinterested help and advice. CIV,4661 /TurkeyTurkey 9. Turkey has been , air-ooneoious T for some years. An Air League ( Turk Hava Kurumu - T.Ii.K. - or Devlet Hava Kurumu - D.H.K.) v/as formed in 1925 and has had a certain success under General Kocak, who has run a flying ^Training School and since 1942 lias organised aircraft construction. There is me Aviation Company, Devlet Hava Yollari (D.H.Y.), founded in 1934* which runs at a loss but which receives a subsidy from the state. It is a monopoly corporation, run by a Director General of Civil Aviation (Colonel Sahinbas) as a department of the Ministry of Communications: the safety record is excellent, chiefly due to the fact that flying is limited to the summer months. The company recently bought thirty Dakotas from the U.S. Disposals Board in Egypt and its plans include external services to Lydda, Cairo, Athens and Cypres. 10. U.S. commercial firms have been talcing an interest in Turkish civil aviation, an interest which the rumoure# $ 10 million credit has stimulated the Turks to reciprocate. For example, Colonel Sahdnbas against our advice has agreed a contract with Westinghouse Company the total reconditioning of five Turkish major airfields, including Istanbul and Ankara v/hich have been designated as international airports and which are being used by P.A.A. Lebanon 11* In October 1945 Hunting Aviation Company drew up a proposal to form an Air School, originally'scheduled to open in January 1946 with Proctors and later acquiring De Havilland Doves and Percival Mergansers. The agreement was never ratified by the Lebanese. 12. Middle East Airlines (El Hoss), a protege'of B.O.A.C*, operates from Lebanon with British and American aircraft. 13. Lebanon proposes to build a new airport at Ealde (South of Beirut) which is to be designated an international airport. We originally suggested that a survey should be undertaken and a report made by a reputable British firm in the'hope that the contract would be given to us f but recent rumours suggest that the contract has been put into the hands of a U.S*. firm. Syria 1 14. Hunting Aviation Company have had more success in Syria with their proposal to form an Air Training School. For political reasons this agreement was held up because of certain clauses'stipulating rJd itrry training and modification of training aircraft for military purposes, but the Foreign Office finally gave their clearance on 30th July 1946* By mid-August two Proctors (with pilots) and six Tiger Moths had been sent out by Huntings. 15. In June 1946 a proposal was moo tod by the Syrian Government to form a Syrian airline for internal and postal communications, developing external services later. Iran 16. Persian relations with us are 'conditioned 1 by xenophobia, which is itself a hangover’ from the period of military occupation, and by fear of granting concessions to the U.K. or U.S. governments which my result in demands for similar concessions on the paid: of the U.S.S.R, From the point of view of civil aviation northern Persia is still a closed area, served by a Russian nrilitaiy/diplomatic service, 17. On 22 May 1946 a separate department of civil aviation was formed. The director of this Department, Ahmed Shefiq, who is an Egyptian and the husband of Princess Ashraf sister of the Shall, is energetic and appears to be anglo- phil. Two airlines exist already and it is rumoured that a third may shortly be forhied with U.S, participation. The two airlines are: (a) Iranian State Airlines, Persian operators with British aircraft (one Rapidc and three Dominies): official ma-1-carriers, at present operating to Baghdad, Bushirc and Meshed. /M CIV.4661K O'Vif (To) Iranian Airways* I * V/. A* operators v/ith small T,W#A* financial participation: Ebtehaj is the moving Persian personality. The company runs services to Meshed, Abadan, Shiraz, Bushire&gt; Fahler; and externally to Egypt and Iraq on a charter principle under short-term agreements, O 18, ^A recent proposal from a Persian merchant. Shahidi, to form an Anglo- Iranian company was turned down. Latest reports suggest tlnat the Persian CrOVornment, instead of designating a. monopoly company, is going to allow an indefinite number of independent commercial operators; this, coupled with the fact that Iranian State Airlines (which we have supported in the past) is ‘ moribund duo to bad maintenance, may necessitate a change of policy. 19* In spite of vigorous anti-British propaganda. Hawkers have secured a contract to supply the Iranian Air Force with Hurricanes* The first Hurricanes have already been delivered, 20, Shefiq is pressing to nominate Abadan as an international airport, which may be considered as an ’alternate’ to Basra, Afghanistan 21, During tho last war proposals ’were mooted to run a courier service Delhi- Kabul. In 19-4-1 the proposal was hold, up for fear that a similar concession would be made to the German Lufthansa and when it was finally put to the Afghan Government it was refused. In 1945 it was never raised officially since the India Government had no aircraft available except Lend-Lease Beech- craft and there were political objections to their use at the time, 22, Up to dato the only two proposals for air services to Afghanistan have come from the India Government; first, for India to operate an extension of the Calcutta-Peshawar service to Kabul: secondly, to operate a joint Indo-Affehan circular service Peshawar - Kabul - Kandahar - Quetta, 23* In February 194-8 we received a report through tho Military Attache^ at Kabul that Afghanistan was negotiating with the U,S, Government for an inter national air service to be routed through Afghanistan; at the same time they would welcome the establishment of a similar British air service and British technical assistance in the construction of airfields and other installations, Afghan desire to see international air services staging in their country has been expressed more recently by Najibullah Khan, the Afghan representative at the P.I.C.A.O. Middle East Regional Conference: he specifically said that the question of the feeder service Peshawar - Kabul, though by no means shelved, was being subordinated to this primary aim: one of such international air services would, he hoped, be British. Saudi - Arabia 24* For several months the U.S. Government has been trying to negotiate an agreement for tho formation of a U.S. - Saudi-Arabian airline, hut no far without success. Proposals included: % (a) Financial participation by T,W,A. and Ibn Saud. (b) A thirty-year monopoly charter in Saudi-Arabia for the company, (c) Twice-weekly frequency with Douglas 0,47 aircraft. (d) Route Jeddali-Riyadh-Dhahran, possibly extending later to Cairo. 25. At the same time we made coimtor-proposals for the formation of an Air Transport Unit, proposals which increased in scope' and cost, in an effort to compete with the American offer and which in the event were refused by Ibn Saud. Our most recent proposal was an Air Training Scheme, whereby .we should send a Training Unit to Saudi-Arabia for two years: the unit would train 'hb initio' eight or ten pilots in each year, from which number eight selected pilots would be sent to the united Kingdom for more advanced training: the aircraft needed 01 V, 4661 /wouldn CIV ^ 61 ' /the present would be two Tiger Moths for training -and one Avro XIX for communication purposes. There is strong Treasuiy opposition to the proposal but it is still being considered. 26. The Americans are in^a strong position on Dhahran airfield. On the eve of the Japanese capitulation construction had just begun on the airfield* although we were justified in arguing that there v^as no longer a militaiy need for it, we finally agreed to work being continued. The ^ift* of this airfield, together with other promises of assistance and 'relief' in Saudi- Arabia, was used by the Americans as a weapon to secure certain advantages, notably unlimited Fifth Freedom and a monopoly of the airfield. Although this attempt was clumsily transparent and in spite of a suggestion from us that Dhahran airfield should be operated under the auspices of P.I.O.A.O. the Americans had a large measure of success: the final agreement gives ’ T.J.A. full Fifth Freedom rights, subject to six months' notice of termina tion on the part of Saudi-Arabia, and gives U.S.A.A.F control of the airfield for tinoo years, after which it will be handed ever to Saudi—Arabia, to operate with T.W.A. assistance. Ibn Saui takes all landing fees. On 4th July 1946 ^T.Vv.a. concluded an operating agreement, valid for two years, to run seivj og&gt;jz on the routes Cairo-lydda-Basra-Dhahran and Cairo-Dhahran - on a onc ® a . fortnight on each route in each direction. On 9th July lAb J.• W, A. ran their first flight from Washington to Dliahran. An interest- ing commentary on the bargain appears in an article from ’’American Aviation” ,f r e J . August 1946, which complains of the ommous cost ($ 4 million) to lie /merican taxpayer of a project v/hich involves an average of only four irequencies a week. However, on a short-term view, Dhahran is being consi dered as an alternate for Tudor II aircraft on the Cairo-Karachi stretch and it may assume some importance to us on that account. Ethiopia 27* Our present civil air rights are secured under Article IX of the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 19th December 1944, which 'inter alia* provides (a) mutual grant of freedom of passage to individual aircraft (b) pemussion for a British Air Transport undertaking to operate regular services into Ethiopia. 28. _ The main difference be Ween Article IX in this treaty and in the previous treaty of 31st January 1942 is that we were obliged to omit the monopoly clause which gave B.O.A.C. sole right to operate into Ethiopia. The lane;s ol any future Anglo-Ethiopian. Civil Aviation agreement will probably follow the Anglo—Turkish model, providing for the mutual grant of Third and Fourth freedoms on the routes Addis Ababa- Aden and Addis Ababa-Nairobi. W* influence in Ethiopian:civil aviation is now considerable. First sign of U.S. infiltration was in July 1943 when we heard of the appointment 01 ai American, Robert S. /mis, as Director of Air Transport (sic). In I 944 the Americans formed an Air Training School and appointed a 'negro' colonel as commandant; by November two aircraft and pilots had arrived from U S and the school^entered on -'in active phase. Climax was the formation of Ethiopian Airlines on 30th December 1945. Under this contract T.W.A. were to operate the company for an annual management fee and the Ethiopian oveminent was to pay all expenses: the company was given a monopoly by the government (including carriage of mail) -and ms to operate external services to DJibuti ^ and Aden, Asmara, Khartoum and Cairo. They are now pressing to run a service to Nairobi. T.W.A. financial participation up to a limit' of 2570 is provided lor, but on the last analysis the success of the venture depends on Ethiopia's capacity to pay. This is doubtful. Egypt 30. Civil aviation rights are at present secured by the 1931 Imperial Airways agreement which runs out in mid 1947. Progress towards concluding a bilateral agreement with Egypt has been held up by the extreme delicacy ofthe presont negotiation of the Treaty, hut it ic probable that a delegation vn.ll go out in October of this year, 31, The IvELddle East Air Transport Board is still operating services from Cairo under a thin disguise of military necessity, but it is likely that -these will have been greatly reduced or completely eliminated by the end of the year. It is hoped that they can be kept alive until Egyptian Airways can take over, Egyptian Airways is the designation of a proposed Anglo—Egyptian company, in which B.O.A.C, and Misr Airwork will participate (on a 30 - 30 financial basis). The Heads of .greonent wore signed en 30th .pril 1946 subject to tho approval of the two governments. Y/hen the Egyptian Parliament re-assembles after Rama dan it should be approved. The Articles of Association bo tween the two com panies were reported by B.O.u.G. on 2nd August 1946 to be ‘well 'under way T . 32, On 13th June 1946 tho U.S. Govoramcnt signed an agreement with Egypt whereby, in exchange for the gift of Payne's Field (CairoJ and a quantity of cheap aircraft from the U.S. Disposals Board, the Americans secured^thu nomination of Payne’s Field as an international airport and also gained Fifth Freedom on the Bermuda model. The present R.A.F. airfield, Almaz--, s o0 pledged to be nominated an international airport: apart from the economic difficulties of maintaining two large contiguous airports, there are two problems - first, iOmaza. is not yet capable of taking Tudor II aircraft, nor will be for several months; and secondly, the R.A. . (H.Q. M.E.r).k.m.) moves from Cairo to Ismalia in August 1947. Sudan 33. The Sudan Government was agreed that there was not room for more tnan one air company in the Sudan and favoured a government-owned, commercially operated company on the U.K. model. After offering tenders to B.O.A.O., Air- work, Mitchell Coutts and lion ting Aviation, they finally decided: (a) Airwork should operate the air services with an annual .management fee (b) Sudan Railways should run the traffic agency. 34 # Ibur Doves have been ordered and are due to be delivered, one on each of the following dates - August 1946, October 1946, November 194o, January 1947. 33, Projected services on a weekly frequency are; North Khartoum - Shcllal South Khartoum - Juba Eas t Khartoum - Atbara - Port Sudan - Kassala - Gedaref - Khartoum West Khartoum — Geneina, with a monthly shuttle to Gambeila from Malakal. Trans-J ordan 36 . The only airline in Trans—Jordan, i-iiub Airways Association, is a 'child of Eastern Airways. The moving spirit is a certain Bishaiat, Although c-n all-Arab concern it employs two Englishmen as technical managers: Ledger, who was formerly Chief Clerk to the Trans-Jordan Government, .and Sanders, an ex-R.A.F. Flight Lieutenant who was stationed in Trans-Jordan, The company has already bought five Rapides and has arranged to use the ex-R.A.F. airfield at Amman. ' Plans include a flying school and club, charter work, e.g. carriage of fish from the Gulf of iikaba to Damascus and conveyance 01 pilgrims to El Hejaz, Petya, etc. 37. Although originally doubt was felt about the conpetence of the two English advisers,' it is clear that we shall have to make the best of an accomplished fact: B.O.A.C. never shewed interest in Trans-Jordan, and Bisharat deliberately preferred Ivfessrs.Ledger and Sanders to Airwork. Our Civil Air Attache in Cairo is accredited to Transjordan and can give friendly assistance. CIV. 4661 /Iraq38, Iraq, has not yet signed agreements either with the U.K. or the U.S. Governments and her attitude will 'be largely determined 'by the conclusions of the Arab League Communications Committee conference: she is still trying to preserve Fifth Freedom between Middle East states. ^9* A British subject. General Smith, who is the director of Iraqi State Railways, is influential: requests hava already been made for the employment of British aviation technicians. 40. Many proposals have been put forward for a civil air company in Iraq, e.g. an Anglo-Iraqi company with B.O.A.C. participation/, and also an amalgamation of Iraqi State Railways and the Iraqi Aeroplane Society with B.O.A.C, ’leavening 1 . The final agreed solution appears to be that the airline shall bo a branch of Iraqi State Railways, with B.O.A.C, as technical advisers but not participating financially. Palestine 41. The form in which civil aviation should operate in Palestine has been mooted for some months. Three firms are in existence: (a) Aviron Aviation Company: supported by the Jewish Agency, existed before 1939-43 war, runs a flying School and does charter flying, (b) Palestine Airways Limited: British-Semitic: founded in 1937 and by 1940 it looked like breaking even, when all aircraft were handed over to the R.A.F. (c) Eastern Airways: formed in 1944 by a group of Arab merchants. 42. In June 1948 the High Commissioner approved a recommendation that there should be a single statutory corporation on the East Africa model: kO/o of the shares to be Government-owned, 3Q/o Arab (to be offered to Eastern Airways) and 30^0 Jewish (to be offered to Aviron and Palestine Airways), with a Government option to take up any unsubscribed balance: representation on the Board, would be in proportion to the shares held. A draft constitution is being currently considered by the Colonial Office. Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms* 43* Our relations with the Shaikhs in so far as transit and landing rights are concerned are adequately covered by agreements. Expiry dates are: Bahrein 31December 1933 Kuwait 23 rd May 1948 Sharjah 21st July 1948 Kalba 27th August 1948 Debai 21st July 1948 Cyprus % More than one application has been made in the recent past to the Colonial Office for permission to form an airline based on Cyprus. The most recent proposal was from Hull, Blythe &amp; Co. and was presented to the Colonial Office by a Cyprus Government official, 2\ir. P.R. Taylor, Conptroller of Transport. These proposals are being drawn up in detail and considered in conjunction with B.E.A.C. 43# Nicosia airfield, at present with joint R.A.F./Civil user, figures in R.A.F. post-war plans as an Armament Practice Camp. The Cyprus Government will probably be asked to find an alternative airport, which should be available in between six and nine months. There is an airfield at Tymbou, which is reported to be capable of -development to intern-continental and -even to trans- ocean standards. CIV. 4861 /Aden ProtectorateAden Protectorate 4-6. For some months a proposal, which has had the approval of the Colonial Office in principle, has been mooted for the formation of an airline based on Aden and operating to Hejaz and the Yemen, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, also possibly to Jeddah and Palestine, Apart from assisting towards the more convenient administration of Aden Protectorate and Somali-s land and linking the Protectorate with the U,K,-India trunk line by way of Cairo, these routes would follow existing trade patterns and v/ould servo the needs of the countries concerned more effectively than the T,W,A,-inspired airline in Ethiopia. It would incidentally help to halt American infiltration in this region, 47. Mir, R.M. Hilary, General Manager designate of Egyptian Airways, is visiting the Middle East during the period X 6 th September - 9th October to reconnoitre the possibilities for such.an airline, 48. The R.A.F, airfield at Khormaksar is being currently used. Territories under British Military Administration 49. In territores administered by B.M.A* all rights granted are provisional and subject to confirmation, modification or refusal by the final mandatory power: the number of landings is limited: the first four freedoms have been granted and the fifth freedom on a limited frequency. Tripolitania 50. Castel Benito has been designated as the international airport. U.S, diplomatic pressure v/as exerted to persuade us to name Mellaha, ex~U.S.A.A.F. base, and in fact it has been agreed that T.V/.A. may operate there to save administrative ’overheads*. T.V/.A. is limited here to a once-daily frequency. Cyrenaica 51. El Aden will almost certainly be designated as the international airport, although Benina was also proposed. Similarly the Americans tried to have Berka 2, ex-U.S.A.A.F. base, named. Here also T.W.A, is limited to a once- daily frequency. Eritrea 52. The airfield at Asmara was constructed by the Italians before the war and its maintenance has therefore been assumed as a responsibility of B.M.A. Ihe Treasury gave approval on 22nd August 1946 for B.M.A, to assume constitu tional and financial responsibility. B.O.A.C. are in fact operating the airfield, which is being used regularly by their services, by Air France, Ethiopian Airlines Inc, and (occasionally) by Swedish A.B.A. (B) ACTION OUTST AH D I N G Assessment of the Position 53. For the development of civil flying the Middle East can be considered as: (a) A series of stages on trans-ocean routes (b) Centres of national and regional airline networks. The choice of nodal points in influenced by the amount of traffic •ffering. The importance of the type of traffic varies under (a) and (b) above. Suggested factors and variations in order of importance are tabulated below: CIV. 4661 /(a)(a) Trans-ocean routes 1, Mail 2 , administration-movement of officials 3# Diplomatic 4. Tourist 3* Commercial-movement of executives 6 . Freight * (b) Regional networks 1. Commercial-movement of executives 2. Freight* 3* Mail 4. Administration-movement of officials 3. Diplomatic 6 . Tourist (* Limited to air-transportable, i.e. non-bulky items, and practicable only when the bulk of imports into a given country approximately equals the bulk of exports from it). 34* At the same time we have two strong reasons for extending our influence in civil aviation throughout as many Middle East countries as possible: (a) Political . Where countries turn to us for advice on civil aviation matters, our political influence is likely to be that much stronger. The converse is also true. (b) Commercial . It is in our interest to encourage Middle East countries to buy British aircraft and spares and to employ British technicians. 33* Stages on trans-ocean routes, according to this assessment, are ideally chosen on geo-political and prestige grounds, although other considerations have recently arisen, e.g. suitability of airfields for modem aircrad’t. In fact we were in a good position after the 1939-43 war, as we already possessed a foothold through Imperial Airways agreements, in the form of traffic rights and'ground organisation. 56. As far as 5&gt;( b ) is concerned, commercial reasons predominate. Here we have two main difficulties: V (a) U.S.S.R. A negative obstacle. In the countries on tire fringe of the ’Iron Curtain’, i.e. Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, there is a strong xenophobia which shews itself in an exaggerated fear of giving concessions to any country on the alleged ground that it would involve giving a similar con cession to Russia. (b) U.S.A. An active trade rival. She has used dollar credits, bribes of modem transport aircraft at cheap prices, ’gifts’ of airfields built by the U.S.A.A.F. and diplomatic ’bludgeoning’, to secure full commercial rights and points of entry. So far Ethiopia has fallen, while Turkey and the countries of the Arab League are wavering. Conclusions 37* On this assessment, Egypt assumes immense importance in the Middle East, Commercially Cairo is the historic junction of three continents, while politically it is the seat of the Arab world, Egypt is recognised to be the main pivot of our Middle East network. It is for consideration whether we should not develop two subsidiary pivots in the north and south: North - Lydda , to link Levant trade with Iraq and Iran, or Qyprus (Tymbou), as an all-British point of entry. South - Aden . An all-British point of entry and a commercial link between Saudi-Arabia and Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia. Civil Aviation Agreenrents 33, Column (f) of Appendix ’A’ shews the position. Considerations which give priority to the negotiation of certain -agreements are given below: CIV. 4^31 /EthiopiaEthiopia . Eg/pt . Iraq Our civil aviation rights are secured under the Anglo- Ethiopian Treaty of 19^4-, which is due to run out on 31st December, 1946. The agreement does not expire until mid-1947&gt; hut as this is the most important negotiation which we shall have to undertake, we shall need plenty of time: if possible, unless it is likely to conpromise the Treaty, a bilateral civil aviation agreement should be negotiated separately. i T .S. pressure, due to the conditional codicil inserted in their agreement with Lebanon (llth August 1946), is likely to be intensified. Negotiations with us may act as a counter. Saudi-Arabia The proposal to use Dhahran on the U.K.-India trunk line as a short-term f altemate , makes urgent the negotiation of a bilateral' agreement. Miscellaneous 39. We should sound airwork, to see if they are interested in participating in a Syrian air company. 60. We should watch the position generally in Iran and especially the status of Iranian State Airlines. 61. We should examine the possibility of a service through Afghanistan, either from India or as a joint Anglo-Indian venture - B.O.A.C. operating Athens-Teheran and linking with a DeIhi-Peshavwir-Kabul-Tehe ran service. 62. The proposal for an Air Training School in Saudi-Arabia is still out standing. 63. Replies are outstanding from the Dominions Office and India Office to questions v/hich we put to them on the views of India and the Dominions about the proposed agreement with Egypt . 64 . Royal assent to the formation of Egyptian Airways has not yet been notified. 63 . Towards mid-October we should ask B.E.A.O. for their views on Hull, Blythe and Co.’s proposals for a Cyprus- based airline. 66 . About mid-October we should expect a report from B.O.A.C. on Hilary’s reconnaissance for an Aden-based airline.

On particular routes, it was agreed that the high frequency (three times weekly) of the service 7N/8N (Egypt - Turkey) was justifiable at the moment but might have to be reduced in view of the introduction of the U.K* - Turkey service; continuation of service 11R/12R (quoted above as 'having a low ratio of military traffic) wa.s still justified on the grounds of mail carriage.

There is unlikely to be a firm decision on this until the report of Hr. Alistair Gibb has been received. civ. 5230 /The-o- The unwisdon of spending a lot of money at this tine v;hen the price of land is so high is amply recognised in certain circles in Lebanon, The Civil aviation Department has taken over from the french the meteorological and signals organisation* If it is our intention to stay in Lebanon, the question of ^providing a British Control Officer at Beirut must be further considered# cO, liiddle East ^mrlines are reported as using their three Rapides to 'full capacity and are trying to borrow two from .erab Lirways. A Dakota is also being used^ with profit on charter services. It seems likely that El Hoss is ■making money; apparently Pan maerican 'Airways recently approached him with an offer to take up 4Qo of the shares in his Company, The flying school which El Hoss is running has acquired two I [agisters. The appointment of a Chief Instructor has not yet been filled and although we should like to see a nominee from B, 0 ,^.C, El Hoss has not, so far 'as is known, approached them yet, 81, There seems little prospect of Syria - Lebanese co-ordination in the field of civil aviation or co-operation through’ a joint .aviation Company, Syria has withdrawn permission for E3 Hoss to operator to Damascus and Aleppo, and 'A generally El Hoss complains of obstructiveness on their part, SYRIA: 82* Recent reports from Syria agree that the present state of civil aviation there is'chaotic. Civil aviation matters come under the ministry of National Defence and, .are being subordinated to the interests of military avaiation. The Civil' aviation Department has no funds at the moment and although it has been granted a Vote, it is relatively small and is not effective until next year; so far as is known, no plans have been made or decisions taken; employees are not being paid and strikes on ilezze airfield are threatened. Any hopes we may nave had of Syria employing a British subject as expert aviation adviser appear to, have been confounded by the appointment of an Egyptian Captain Hazek, ‘who takes his orders from the Ninister of National Defence and who has been told to take over the flying school* the same time B,0*A,C. report their suspicions that the Syrian Government is' 'flirting' with P.P.A.dl has apparently approached Syria, with a view to forming a joint U.S. - Syrian air company with a minimum of 10)b financial participation by P.A,.,, and using United States aircraft. Complaints are current that British aircraft will not be available until 1948 , °3* Hunting -aviation Company have apparently decided that they cannot afford to retain Brigadier Hutchings; any hopes which we may have had of maintaining our influence in Syria through Huntings seen now to have gone. It even seems that their estimates for the flying school were optimistic and they are now trying to have their agreement revised. They have been further considers.oly embarrassed by Captain Hazek Who, as stated above, was instructed to take over the school. It is not even known how the Syrian Government propose to utilize the school; rumour has it that it will be divided into:- (a) an Elementary wing run by civil aviation for both civilian and military trainees; and ('b) an advanced 'ling run from the Ninistry of National Defence for military trainees only, 84* Hezze airfield is being shared on a joint military civilian user basis. The Signals facilities are adequate but there is a serious lack of competent Control Officers and of certain equipment, e.g. meteorological and fire which are urgently required. As was stated above, the staff are not being paid and strikes are threatened. If we intend to remain in Syria, the appointment oi a competent Control Officer at Damascus requires further consideration. The position is too confused for any effective action to be taken at present.- 4 -‘ 8 R. Pan .xierican Airways are planning to operate a service to India through Ankaraj-Tatrin and Teheran* It seems certain that and T.W.A, through Iraiiian Airways^ are heading for a commercial battle -which .'will no ■y~' i ht cone to a head in Persia. lae question of am at action le should take is discussed further in part B of this su'.uiary. m 86 . f or: - Recently the Russians submitted to the Iranian dovernnent a 'demand' (a) the exclusive right for a Russo-Iranian Air Company to operate in North Persia; and (b) the exclusive use of the airfields in Tabriz and Pahlevi* ■ This demand was rejected by the Cabinet on the 2nd October. The recent re-shuffle of the Iranian Cabinet and the resignation, of Tudeh members can possibly be interpreted as signs that Iran is prepared to resist Russian aggresiveness. APIKARCAJ:: .. In spite of ^ifghan desire to see a U.K. trunic route going through Afghanistan^ the re-routeing through Afghanistan of our landplane routes to India, the far Bast or Australia is not considered practical, but consideration may be given in the future to extending the U.K. - Teheran service to Kabul. 86 , ■ India is actively considering the conclusion of an agreement with Afghanistan, nhich they think should be negotiated urgently in view of a United States proposal to route their service to India through Afghanisatn. The various Indian'proposals are:- pa) an extension of the Calcutta - Peshawar service to Kabul, giving .iiignanisoan reciprocal rights on the Kabul — Peshawar sector; ( 0 ; proposal to for:; a joint Afghanistan - Indian company, operating wi oli Da.cotas (later Vikings) on a three -times weekly frequency • (Kmi. :at ely a daily. frequency) from Kabul to Peshawar, and linking at Peshawar with services to Delhi and Calcutta. India will be prepared to' offer technical assistance and training facilities at the civil aviation training centre which she is forming in India; (^0 jcinc -iighamstan — Indian company operating a service Peshawar— Kabul - Kandahar - Quetta. SAUDI- ARABIA: • an view 01 the possibility that our Tudor id services nay have to use Dhahran instead of Bahrein on the Cairo - Karachi stretch of the Indian trunk route service, we have asked the foreign Office to approach the Saudi-Arabian G-overnnent 1 or operating rights at Dhahran, including first four freedoms and fifth freedom on the Bermuda basis; if this permission can be given by an exchange of letters, so much the better; if not, we- shall have to negotiate a b.i -l-u,eral Civil Aviation Agreement* as was pointed out in paragraph 26 of Cum: ,ary No.l, the .miericans have already commercial rights in Saudi Inrabia and ar ^ 1 ' ; -ctoperating Dhahran airfield. gde have requested the Civil Air Attache, Cairo, to obtain details of ground organisation and Control and meteorological facilities on the airfield.

Our own rights are covered by a Aar Subsidy Agreement which ends on 31st December, 1946 and we have asked the India Office .to approach the Sultan to conclude an Aviation Agreement, giving us operating rights. As the have long-term strategic requirements and wish to maintain airfields in the Sultanate on a care and maintenance basis, it was mooted whether the IMA. . should negotiate for bases or whether we should try to include these in a Civil Aviation Agreement. On general grounds the latter is preferable, as the Sultan is more likely to accede to requests for civil aviation rights; apart from the possibility of using the Hadramaut coast on B.O.A.C. ! s proposed truns-Africa - India route, there is also a likelihood of developing a service based on Aden vdth aircraft smaller than Tudor IPs, so although at the moment the use of airfields in the Sultanate may not be commercially justified, prospects of future development do exist. CITR US: - On the 3rd September B.E.A.C. examined Hull Blythe and Company 1 s proposals for a Cyprus-based airline, and from the 11th to 16 th October .Mr Commodore 'Whitney Straight, the Deputy Chairman of B.jE.-l.C., paid a. visit to Cyprus. E• Division of this Ministry has prepared an appreciation of potential air traffic from and to Cyprus and their conclusions are not entirely discouraging; the tourist trade to Cyprus doubled itself in value between 1932 and 1933 and present indications show than, even allowing for abnormal post-war increases, tourist traffic to Cyprus is likely to increase still further; they also forecast a general increase in trade travel between the U.K. and the Middle East due to the elimination of G-ermany and Italy as trade rivalsthey consider tnat a total of seventy passengers each way, each week, may be expected. 1°3* There is still uncertainty over the use to which kicosia airfield is to be put in the future. The R.-^.F. proposals to use it as a Bomber School have left the Cyprus Government with the prospect of no civil airfield and have not given them sufficient time to choose and construct, at reasonable cost, a suitable alternative. 104* The proposal for a Middle East training school, which was made by Lord Davidson’s Trade Mission, is dicussed in part B of this Summary. The Trade Mission suggested Cyprus as a suitable place but, in fact, there are objections: apart from the uncertain tenure by the Cyprus Government of Nicosia airfield, the type, of school contemplated should be sited-near a trunk route airport in order to give adequate training to flying control officers and airport managers; , further, Cyprus is not geographically very well placed and, politically speaking, is less suitable than Egypt, for example.

The incident is quoted by our Civil Air Attache in Washington. Apparently Hr.

R.H,Hilary’s Report on his survey during September - October of this year has been received. Much of the information in the Summary concerning this area is derived from his report. A meeting to consider his proposals was held at this ministry on the 11 th kovember and the minutes of the meeting are being circulated to the Departments concerned. 116. It is desirable that the network of regional airlines in the Red Sea area should be co-ordinated both with the proposed Trans-Africa-India route (if operated) and with the local services of Jest African and Central African Airways and, more especially. East African Airways Corporation and' Sudan Airways. The Trans-Africa to India route, as originally proposed, was to run Accra—Kamo- E1 Geneina- Khart oum-Asmara-Aden-Riyaii-Salalah-Masirah Is*-Karachi; The possibility of substituting Bombay for Karachi or serving both places has been mooted, Bombay being for commercial reasons the more, suitable terminal. 117* B.O.A.C. proposals include the following: (a) E;y. &gt;t ian Air ways based on Cairo, to fly three services running roughly North-South and R.H.'J-S.S.E, the three 'legs' of the base to be Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Aden. (b) Aiden Airways and East m f rican -Airways , operating either jointly or in parallel, to link the three base terminals of the 'legs' and also to link the two outer terminals, Nairobi and- Ad fen, via Mogadishu'and Hargeisa. (c) Sudani Ain;ay s to run a.cross the middle of the triangle by linking . Khartoum with Asmara and with Port Sudan and Jeddah. (d) V/est Afri can Airw ays to link Khartoum with ’West African territories. aircraf t Position 118. A report has been received from L.O.^.C. in the Middle East that th« Dominie spe.res position is acute and that unless urgently needed spares are soon delivered planes nay be grounded by January. This is being investigated. 119. It is important that Marathons should be available in sufficient numbers as soon as possible, as Liany ' 1 die East operators are now using Rapides or Dominies and will be using Doves ■( with Gipsy engines) and if: they had to be equipped with Vikings or Wayfarers ( using Hercules engines) the problem of setting up organisations to service two different types of engines night prove both difficult and expensive for Middle East Operators.

A circular route Jeddah- Cairo-Damascus-Hiyad-Taif-eeddah is planned. ^t present it is difficult to assess the commercial significance of the embryonic company, which was described by Lr. Maxwell as a 'Boyal taxi service'. 132, There is also a rumour that Paid has offered King Ibn Saud some 31 for three or four months in the year for pilgrim traffic. This may point another commercial battle between P.„.a. and T.K.a. yiasters to Ethiopia 133* In spite of the difficult and hazardous flying country which it is necessary to cross before reaching Addis Ababa there appear to be coi merical prospects between Addis Ababa and Eritrea/Aden: the port of DJibuti and the railway which links DJibuti to Addis Ababa has long been a bottleneck to Ethiopian trade* Due to the considerable time that is needed to bring freight by rail from Aden to the hinterland, the heavy port charges and railway dues,' the venaJLity of the Customs Officials and the heavy incidence of damage and theft, air freightage by contrast appears to offer good prospects, especially as the french operated DJibuti - Addis Ababa railway is insolvent and it will take at least xour years to build the Assab—Addis Ababa*line which is projected by U*S* - Belgian interests. 134. Recent information- about Ethiopian Airlines Inc. shows that they have ton Dakotas in their fleet, with an additional Dakota for cannibalisation and one special Dakota for the Emperor. They are flying 'Weekly .services to Gondar, Gimma and DJibuti ana twice weeicly to Cairo and Aden. Their plans include internal services to Debre Tabor, Dessie, Dire Dawa, Harar,Gore,Debre Marcos, •• and external services to Ganibela and Jeddah.

It seems likely that negotiations for a bilateral agreement will have to be postponed. There is no further progress to report in the formation of Egyptian Airways. 1B7.

Cyprus ^ 145 # vie have not yet received a full report on the visit of mir Commodore Yhitney Straight to Cyprus, but in an interim recovmenlation he suggested that the future prospects of Cyprus .airways depend largely on the premiss that the formation of Egyptian -imays may not go through. On that assumption he foresees a future for such an .airline, and he recommends that H. through, B.0..1.C. and B.E....C. should participate both in an advisory, and operating capacity and also in a financial capacity ( talcing up to 40 p of the total shares); of the remaining capital he recommends that the Cyprus Government should take up 2CS and that 40 p should be subscribed locally; a possible capital cf 0300,000 sterling was mentioned. Previous to -dir Commodore l/hitney Straight's visit, 3.E.Y.C. had- dra-.m up throe poseable schem. s, which did not differ in broad essentials. They proposed that a fleet should be formed consisting of tvo/tliree Vikings, three/four Doves, four lusters for flying club and internal chaner work and one Proctor for .external charter work. Poutes included Nicosia-^'-.hens, Nicosia-Cairo both direct and via Alexandria, Idcosia-Haifa, Wicosia-Beirmt and Wicosia-Istanbul; one scheme also included services to Iraq and Lydda. The premisses on which the schemes were based appear to differ from those adopt'd by E.I.Div. in this ministry ( para.. 102 of Gui.iary ho. 2 refers). In the C. schemes route- frequencies are not based on estimated traffic flow but are derived from the number of flying hours available to a minimum fleet, which is laid down 'a priori”. The ratio as between various terminals is based on the combined export- import trade figures with other countries, representing the relative trade interest, and virtually ignores the considerable tourist traffic which is likely to be attracted to Cyprus in the future and on which indeed most of the justification for this airline will depend. -hden Prot c ct o ra t e 146 . Aden Chamber of Commerce is showing some alarm at the falling-off of trade. This deterioration is partly due to the fact that countries in the orbit of mien's trading are now buying direct from producer countries and also to the fact that other ports are being opened up. To improve the position they have drawn up certain proposals which include: (a) reduction of port dues; (b) removal of import and export restrictions; (c) improved internal comuni cat ions, and (d) reductions of loss through damage and theft by increased supervision at the port. V/ith this background the commerical prospects of a company based on -.den appear to offer possibilities. As was mentioned above Mr.Hilary's report is being currently examined on the basis of recommendations contained therein. Tr ipolitanla 147• - report has been received that Skyways, operating by charter from 3.0. A.C. are using Hell aha instead of Cast el Benito.

Satterthwaite that in fact they would prefer to use Benina, This is being investigated. Eritrea fife 14.9. In view of the political uncertainty of the future of this country, trade is largely stagnant. '/hat has increased this tendency is the reversal 01 the inport-export flow; under Italian rule there, was no attempt made expore and the country was used merely as overflow for the peasant popula Jn of lual^ itseli; now under British -i lie ary ddfiiinistration it has become necessary to encourage exports ana this is proving difficult. However, there are signs that merchants , • chiefly ..rub, are looking for a trade revival, so air links with -xS-mara may be of value in the future. The main trade flow is southwards to -uddis _ do aba and estwards to Jeddah and Jjden. 18th November, 1946. Planning Division. CIV. 9803 r o a aCIV 531 9 CGi~I&lt; 1 II£ ,;Tj.
