Acting British consul at Shiraz states that the affair reported in my telegram of this morning was an organised attack by road guards from a tower and neighbouring hill-tops. The road guards belonged to the Governor of Kazerun, Mohamed Ali Khan Kashkuli, who is the official guardian of the road. With a view to securing a safe passage for Smart’s escort, Colonel Douglas is sending out a second party of fifty men to hold the top of the passes. No. 4. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 26.) fTelegraphic.) Tehran, December 25, 1911. ESCORT incident on Shiraz road. Please see my telegram of this evening. Colonel Douglas reports as follows - “The affair yesterday began with a treacherous attack by apparently friendly road guards on an advance party of three sowars. The road guards were outside a tower. One of the sowars was wounded, and before help could arrive the other two were overpowered and their rifles taken away. Tofangchis in the tower and on the surrounding hills then opened fire on the whole party, and before the latter could [ 565 ] B2 proceed the hills had to be cleared and the enemy driven from the tower. A messenger sent back by the party with news to Mian Kotal was fired on at close range from there and had his horse shot under him. It is thus clear that the affair was prearranged.

PUBLIC opinion here is much excited by recent events at Tabreez and Resht. “ Novoe Yremya ” and the press in general advocate the adoption of stern measures of repression. I have again received assurances from M. Sazonof that he will not regard the Tabreez incident and the withdrawal of the expeditionary force as having any connection, but will treat them as separate questions. At the same time he appears not to regard the assurances already given by the Persian Government as sufficiently binding to justify the issue of an order for the immediate withdrawal of the force.

COLONEL DOUGLAS reports as follows :— “ The only duty performed by the road guards is to blackmail passing caravans, and they have to be watched, if allowed to remain on the road, so as to prevent the muleteers with the troops from being interfered with. The local authorities should, therefore, I consider, be called in to withdraw their men when troops are passing; it might be pointed out to them that otherwise they may be mistaken for enemies. Major Birdwood has some of Mohamed Ali Khan’s men with him, and I have asked Mr. Smart to assist the officer commanding the party moving to-day through Tangi Turkan to distinguish between the natives encountered. Mistakes should therefore not occur. The officer commanding the party which is to assist Major Birdwood on his return was, he reports, fired on near Khaniginian from a distance.”Sir G.

The latter may at any moment have his supplies cut off, but is unlikely to be attacked while he remains at Kazerun.

The Persian Government desire, however, that, until permanent appointment has been agreed upon, one of Shuster’s staff should he designated as provisional treasurer-general. This would have been a convenient solution, since the delay which will be occasioned by waiting for Mornard’s appointment, and further by the fact that the system of accounting used by Shuster (as also the English language) is strange to him, would be avoided if the machinery were handed over to a person acquainted with the previous system.

OFFICIAL commmunique published to-day states that, in consequence of attacks at Tabreez, Resht, and Enzeli, accompanied by brutal mutilation of the wounded and outrages on the dead, and in view of the fact that the Persian Government, though not implicated, is powerless to punish the offenders, the Russian Government have decided to take punitive measures in towns mentioned. Viceroy of the Caucasus was accordingly instructed on the 23rd December to order military commanders, in consultation with Russian consuls, to proceed to severest punitive measures. Measures suggested are arrest and trial by martial law of all Russians and Persians who took part in attacks ; disarming of fedais and other turbu lent elements; destruction of buildings from which opposition is offered to present measures ; and any other necessary steps to restore order and punish offenders.

Ministei for Foreign Affairs referred to alleged intention of Russia, as reported in the pi ess, to take vengeance on Fabreez for what has happened there. He was much perturbed and pointed out that such action would cause lasting animosity. - He asked that our good offices might be used to stop the execution of the threat, which, he added, was now particularly inopportune, since the Persian Government had just given evidence of their desire for reconciliation by submitting to demands of Russia. According to his Excellency, every effort had been made by the Persian Government to put an end to the fighting, but the authorities on the spot assured them that the Tabreezis were only fighting in self-defence. The last news which Minister for Foreign Affairs had from Tabreez was that the deputy governor and other local officials were engaged at the Russian consulate in considering, in consultation with acting Russian consul, the best means of stopping the disorders. Minister for Foreign Affairs would also be grateful if you could obtain from Russian Government the withdrawal of their troops at Kazvin. The departure of 200 of them for Resht cannot be considered as a first step in the withdrawal, as they have only gone to reinforce the troops at that place. No. 18. Sir G.

My Russian colleague does not see any objection to the employment of these young officers, whose services as instructors are urgently required by the colonel. 1 hope Russian Government will make no difficulty. There are now ten Swedish officers employed with gendarmerie here. I think they ought to be able to turn out an efficient force in time, if money is forthcoming and they are given a free hand, as they seem to be capable officers.

A body of about 1,000 men had already been brought back from Kazvin to Pesht, but, so long as there was any risk of further disorders breaking out, it was impossible for Pussia to withdraw the whole force. She could not risk a repetition of the surprise attack at Tabreez. It was therefore impossible for him at present to name any definite date for the withdrawal. The complete restoration of order would doubtless take some time, but the troops now in Northern Persia would have to remain there until this had been accomplished. At the same time, he disclaimed all idea of a permanent Pussian occupation. Those guilty of the attack at Tabreez would have to be severely punished as a warning to others. No. 30. Sir G.

I saw Miller later in the day; he said that, out of deference to the unanimous desire of the population, Shuja himself would come to Tabreez, but not before some four or five days. Miller added that as the Russians could not themselves undertake the administration of the town, and in view of this unanimous expression of popular opinion, he would be unable to oppose Shuja’s coming, and that he would consider him as governor de facto. Shuja would, however, come in entirely at his own risk; he had given him no guarantee of any kind. I gathered from what Miller subsequently told me that it was improbable that Shuja would bring more than 200 of his men into the town. “ The feeling in the town is, so far as I can tell, undoubtedly as Miller states, and the opinion of such Europeans as I have been able to consult coincides with my own, namely, that there wmuld be no opposition to Shuja’s appointment provided the difficulties of his connection with the ex-Shah can be overcome and if his appointment is sanctioned by the Central Government. It seems in any case to be commonly agreed that no one else here is capable of undertaking successfully the government of the town.” Unless Shuja is prevented, it is possible that he may proclaim the ex-Shah at Tabreez.

I CALLED on the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the 23rd instant, and expressed the hope that, now that the Persian Gi-overnment had announced their intention of complying with the Russian demands, the Russian expeditionary force would he recalled, in spite of the regrettable outburst at Resht and Tabreez. M. Sazonof replied that so far the Persian Government had only given M. Poklewsky a verbal assurance, but that, when this assurance had been confirmed by a formal written engagement, and when Mr. Shuster’s dismissal from the Persian service was an accomplished fact, the troops, which were at present stationed at Kazvin, would be at once recalled. There was, his Excellency proceeded to say, no connection between the question of the recall of these troops and the very serious incidents that had just occurred in the north. On my remarking that in conflicts of this kind it was not always easy to fix the responsibility for their origin, his Excellency declared that the Russian troops had given no provocation whatsoever, and that they had been attacked in the most treacherous manner. Two officers had, he believed, been killed, and this was a very serious matter. A detachment of some 500 or 600 troops were being hurried up to Tabreez from Julfa, and severe retribution would have to be taken on the fedais. He would, he added, let me know as soon as he had any definite news to give me. Meanwhile, the loss which the Russian troops have sustained during the fighting at Tabreez has deeply moved public opinion here, and the Government are being taken severely to task for their want of foresight in not having dispatched to Persia a force strong enough to render the occurrence of such incidents impossible. The Government are also blamed for having pursued what is termed a vacillating policy in their recent dealings with the Persian Government, and, though the latter are acquitted of all responsibility for the attacks made on the Russian troops, it will* I fear, be very difficult under present circumstances for the Imperial Government to recall the expeditionary force from Kazvin. M. Sazonof has been too busy to receive me for the last two days, but in a short conversation which I had with him yesterday through the telephone, he once more assured me that he would treat the Tabreez incident as distinct from that of the recall of the expeditionary force. He added, however, that that force could not be recalled till the engagements taken by the Persian Government had assumed a more binding character than they have at present. He also told me, in reply to an enquiry which I had addressed him, that the question of the punishment to be meted out to the fedais, who were still holding out against the Russian troops at Tabreez, would be left to the military authorities on the spot; and I gathered from the way he said this that it will be an exemplary one.

CONVEYS the substance of the following despatch, dated the 10th January :— Sir, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copies of two notes which I addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 27th and 30th ultimo respectively on the subject of the recent attack on Mr. Smart’s escort in the south. Copies of his Excellency’s notes in reply are also enclosed, together with a copy of an aide-memoire on the same subject left with me by Hussein Khan. I have told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that unless it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the party at Kazerun that the troops now landed shall proceed inland, they will remain at Bushire. The notes might, I think, remain unanswered until His Majesty’s Government decide as to the action to he taken. Enclosure 1 in No. 36. Sir G. Barclay to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, December 27, 1911. I DEEPLY regret to have to inform your Excellency that the escort accompanying Mr. Consul Smart on his journey from Bushire to his post at Shiraz was yesterday the object of a severe and prolonged attack. The attack commenced about 12 miles west of Kazerun and continued for the rest of the journey to that place. Each village which the escort passed during this period renewed the attack. Indeed, His Majesty’s acting consul reports that the inhabitants of the whole Kazerun valley joined in the attack. Mr. Smart and others of the party are missing and numerous casualties are reported. The escort, after prolonged fighting, succeeded in reaching Kazerun, where it is now in the caravanserai, where it is in a precarious position, as the acting consul reports that supplies may be cut off at any moment. I am requesting instructions of my Government, and shall have the honour to address you further on the subject of this grave outrage. In the meanwhile I must request your Excellency to send peremptory orders to all the authorities along the route between Kazerun and Shiraz to refrain from molesting British troops and to satisfy the requirements of the British officers in charge. A force is being sent from Shiraz to-day to occupy the passes between Kazerun and Shiraz, as it is only when these passes have been occupied by British troops that the force now detained at Kazerun can proceed on its journey with any prospect of safety. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 2 in No. 36. Sir G. Barclay to Vos suk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, December 30, 1911. IN consequence of the recent attack on Mr. Smart’s escort near Kazerun it has been found necessary to land some Indian infantry at Bushire. I must request your Excellency to instruct the governor at Bushire to co-operate with His Majesty’s consulate-general in the arrangements for landing this force, which numbers 269 men. Instructions should also be sent to the custom-house to allow the passage of the arms brought by this force. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.Enclosure 3 in No. 36. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, December 30, 1911. I HAVE received with much regret your Excellency’s note of the 27th instant respecting the attack stated to have been made on Mr. Smart’s Indian escort by the inhabitants of the villages in the neighbourhood of Kazerun. On the evening of the 26th, when Abbas Kuli Khan informed me verbally of the incident, after expressing my regret for the incident, I sent strong telegrams for the investigation into the matter, punishment of the offenders, and for the protection of Mr. Smart and party. I am waiting for the reports of the measures taken by the local authorities, when I will communicate again with you on the subject. I do not consider it superfluous to refer you to my reply of the 30th October last, in which I had foreseen the difficulties which might arise on the arrival of the Indian troops. I also refer you particularly to the passage in your note of the 24th of the same month, in which you have expressly stated that the force in question will neither patrol the roads nor make expeditions. I have to add that, had the British Government carefully considered my sincere statements at the time, there would have been less chance of the present regrettable incident for which the Persian Government is extremely sorry. While drawing your Excellency’s attention to the opinion all the time expressed by the Persian Government, I have the honour to inform you that the Persian Government will make every possible effort for the punishment of the offenders and for the preservation of suitable respect towards Mr. Smart, and I request the assistance of your Government in the matter in order that the measures taken by the Persian Government may freely and without hitch or hindrance come to a successful issue. I avail, &amp;c. VOSSUK-ED-DOWLEH. Enclosure 4 in No. 36. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, December 30, 1911. SIMULTANEOUSLY with the receipt of your Excellency’s note of the 30th instant regarding the arrival of 269 Indian infantry at Bushire, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Governor of the Gulf ports, stating that the consulate-general informed him on the 29th that the troops would arrive on the 30th. The governor at the same time states that in view of the present public excitement, which is on account of the present incident, the arrival of the troops may in all proba bility give rise to some unexpected incidents. I, therefore, have the honour to inform you that at the present moment when the public excitement is not yet allayed, the Persian Government adhere more than ever to the opinion expressed in my note of the 30th October last, on the occasion of the arrival of the Indian sowars. I feel confident that a friendly Power will not admit that before the difficulties created by the dispatch of the first party of troops are removed (and of these Mr. Smart’s regrettable incident is an example), further troubles should be created by the dispatch of fresh troops. As is evident from the telegraphic reports received from the Shiraz Karguzari, and which were sent to the legation for your information, the measures taken by the Persian Government for the arrest of the perpetrators have been quick in their effect, and the men have been arrested by the Government officials. Of course, after full investigation, they will be punished. Under these circumstances there will be no necessity for the dispatch of further troops on the part of that friendly Power, as such a measure will increase the present difficulties. I earnestly hope that your Excellency will take the matter into serious consideration, move your Government to give up their present intention, and oblige the Persian Government by the removal of the causes of the present difficulties. I avail, &amp;c. VOSSUK-ED-DOWLEH. Enclosure 5 in No. 36. Aide-memoire communicated to Sir G. Barclay by Persian Government. ACCORDING to a telegram received this morning from the Movagher-ed-Dowleh, the British consul-general has informed him that a force of 250 Indian soldiers are landing to-day at Bushire. Contemporaneously with this intimation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning received Sir G. Barclay’s note corroborating that statement, and requesting that facilities be afforded for the disembarkation of these troops. 1. Hussein Khan is instructed to inform the British Minister that the Persian Government have taken without loss of time the most stringent measures to deal them selves with the situation; as the Yossuk-ed-Dowleh himself assured Sir George when he expressed deep regret on Thursday, all necessary steps are being taken to ensure Mr. Smart’s safe arrival in Shiraz and the exemplary punishment of the offenders. Already, according to a telegram received yesterday and communicating to the British Minister through Abbas Kuli Khan, the culprits, or a number of them, have been apprehended, and they will be dealt with, after an enquiry, with the utmost rigour of the law. 2 . Moreover, Sir George Barclay will admit that by the improper use of Maxim guns the sowars have already exacted for these untoward incidents a more than sufficient reparation represented by the loss of over 100 Persian lives. 3. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the Russian ultimatum to which Great Britain was a party, has created a widespread anti-foreign feeling in the country, which it will not be so easy to modify. It has intensified the agitation already fostered by the increase of consular guards. 4. Sir G. Barclay will remember that when first, in spite of our protests, these reinforcements arrived it was specifically and officially undertaken by His Britannic Majesty’s Legation that they would not be used as escorts or on expeditions. Sir E. Grey even stated in the House of Commons on the 27th ultimo that their action had been limited ; they were merely going to increase the consular guards at three places, and they would remain there to protect life and property if danger occurred. Nevertheless, and without any attention being paid to our remonstrances, these troops haVe been constantly sent to and fro, without even due notification being given to the local authorities; they have freely moved about the interior with artillery, and, as already pointed out, this action has added fuel to the fire of public feeling. 5. The coincidence of the projected arrival of the new force, mentioned in Sir G. Barclay’s note, with the period of religious mourning, when the susceptibilities of the people are awakened in a peculiar degree, make it difficult for the Government—who are quite able themselves to cope with the situation—to take any responsibility for the safety of a foreign armed force. Hussein Kban is to urge strongly that any contemplated measures be dispensed with, and a free field given to the Persian Government to exercise their legitimate sovereign action. The situation is a delicate one and requires to be handled with great care; we must guard against all provocation, which might have disastrous consequences. The British Minister knows that the southern tribes are numerous and powerful; they are brave, restive, and well armed. Once their passions are aroused —and such foreign intervention will achieve that end—it will be a gigantic task to bridle them. An expedition in the present circumstances would not only be a direct infringement of the sovereignty of Persia, but it would defeat the very object it was intended to serve. Hussein Khan is, finally, to appeal to Sir G. Barclay’s feelings of friendship for Persia, his foresight and sagacity, and his desire to facilitate the arduous task of the Cabinet (at a moment when they are hard pressed by so many misfortunes) to urge the British Government, for the above reasons and extenuating circumstances, not to take any drastic measures, but to leave it to the Persian Government to deal themselves effectively with the situation.

Please see my telegram of the 29th December. } I have received the following telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Tahreez, dated the 31st December :— “ I have to report that General Voredonoff arrived in Tabreez yesterday afternoon. Two more regiments arrived shortly afterwards. With the reinforcements which had already arrived, the Russian force should now consist of at the least 4,000 men. In consequence of a proclamation signed by my Russian colleague, certain of the shops in the bazaars were opened to-day. Certain of the Russian soldiers, principally Cossacks, have been committing thefts of watches and other articles from individuals, and robberies from shops, a certain number of which were broken into. In spite of this, confidence is, I think, being slowly restored. Miller has been doing everything in his power to stop these robberies, and the recently arrived general has confirmed, in a more stringent form, the orders to this effect which had already been issued by the commanding officers. . “ The only visible sign now of Persian authority here is the fifty or sixty Persian Cossacks under their Russian commander. The town is completely occupied by the Russians, who have posted detachments at the public offices, the Customs, and the post office. All measures concerning public order and the government of the town are necessarily in their hands* “ The population, however, seem to be only desirous of peace, and I do not anticipate any trouble. They are helping the Russians, as before,An the search for arms. _ They have also handed Sheikh Salim over to the Russians : he is one of the leading agitators, and it appears that they attibute their present misfortunes to his teaching. Miller tells me that he is to be court-martialled : it will go hard for him if the court find him guilty. _ . “ Search parties have recovered the missing bodies of fourteen Russian soldiers.

ESCORT incident. Acting British consul at Shiraz, in a telegram dated the 31st December, gives the following account by Smart of the commencement of the incident:— “ Mohamed Ali Khan informs me that two of the ringleaders who were in the Rahdar caravanserai have been arrested. He adds that it will be easy to arrest one of the culprits of the Dokhtar attack. There are two other culprits whose guilt he denies, and about whom there is some difficulty. Amir-ul-Mulk has just arrived ; he is endeavour ing to secure the arrest of all the other culprits by means of the Kadkhodas, all of whom he has sent for. I was the first to reach the caravanserai; Birdwood’s party arrived a few minutes later accompanied by a mamur from Mohamed Ali Khan. The mamur said that we could halt at the river below for lunch and for watering the horses ; he assured me that we had nothing to fear from the caravanserai. While we lunched, mamur went into the caravanserai. When we were on the point of starting again, mamur came up and said he had heard that our caravan would be stopped by force by the caravanserai tofangchis. A message was to be sent to Mohamed Ali Khan at Shahpur for permission for us to proceed; mamur insisted that we should await the reply to this message. Our caravan was already in progress; I asked Birdwood to proceed with it to a less exposed place, while I remained behind with mamur and Persian sowars to argue with the caravanserai riflemen and endeavour to pacify them. Caravanserai tofangchis opened fire, however, before I could do anything ; of course our men had to reply. Persian casualties, according to Mohamed Ali, were one killed and seven wounded ; I think this is an exaggeration, for Mohamed Ali would, for obvious reasons, endeavour to exaggerate the Persian casualties. Whatever these latter were—if, indeed, there were any at all—they must have been very slight. This account is confirmed by Birdwood.” Please see my telegram of yesterday.

So far, indeed, does the rumour of a massacre lack foundation, that as a matter of fact some twelve or fifteen Persian women and children went to the Russian camp, where they were received and well treated ; moreover, other Persian families are reported to have applied for similar protection. On the other hand, a Russian officer was shot dead by the fedai while he was engaged in superintending the departure of the Persian women and children. Further, His Majesty’s consul states that, though some women and children mayhave perished while certain houses were being bombarded, the charge of general inhumanity made against the Russians has been supported by no evideuce, and is, in Mr. Shipley’s opinion, unfounded. ’ I have, &amp;c.

No. 52. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 3.) (Telegraphic.) ^ St. Petersburgh, January 3, 1912. CONVEYS the substance of the following despatch, dated the Jth January :— Sir, I took the opportunity of a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 3rd instant, to speak to his Excellency on the subject of the execution by the Russian military authorities at Tabreez of Sikat-el-Islam, on which Sir George Barclay had reported in his telegrams of the 2 nd January. I said that the execution of this high-placed ecclesiastic struck me as being a most [565] ' C18 unfortunate occurrence as well as a grave blunder. It was almost certain to arouse intense indignation throughout Persia ; and one of the first consequences would be that the present Government, who had done so much to conciliate Russia, would be unable to face the storm, and would have to resign. It also seemed probable that the Russian authorities would be represented as having caused Sikat-el-Islam to be executed for the express purpose of provoking popular resentment, and thus bringing about fresh disorders, which would furnish them with the necessary pretext for occupying Tehran. M. Sazonof replied that the military authorities had had no choice but to inflict capital punishment on Sikat-el-Islam, who had been one of the chief instigators of the recent troubles and of the anti-Russian movement. The fact of his being an eccle siastic could not shield him from the consequences of his acts. The military authorities moreover were obliged to take account of the temper of the troops, who were incensed at the tortures to which the Russian wounded had been subjected. _ One, if not more of them, had been actually buried alive, and horrible mutilations inflicted on others. His Excellency also reminded me of the fact that it was only last year that a Greek Bishop had been tortured to death in Macedonia, without any outcry having been raised by Europe. I said that I quite understood that acts, such as those which he had just mentioned, must be severely punished, but that I still thought that it would have been more politic not to have inflicted the death penalty on Sikat-el-Islam. Russia was, like Great Britain, a great Mussulman Power, and I feared that his execution would shock the feelings of our Mahometan subjects. What, however, preoccupied me most for the moment was the danger of its provoking an outbreak of fresh disorders in Persia, which might in their turn lead to.the occupation of Tehran by the Russian troops. His Excellency was, no doubt, aware of the violent opposition which the dispatch of Russian troops to Persia had aroused in the House of Commons and of the very difficult position in which you had consequently been placed. I, therefore, trusted that he would do all that was possible to restrain the Russian military authorities in Persia, as the occupation of Tehran could not fail to put a severe strain on the Anglo- Russian understanding. His Excellency replied that he trusted that nothing would happen to render such an occupation necessary. It was, he said, impossible for the Government not to reckon with Russian public opinion ; and, in view of the state of anarchy reigning in Persia, he could not meet the wishes which Mr. Mallet had expressed to Count Benckendorff in your name, with regard to the withdrawal of the Kazvin force. His Excellency explained that the force of 1,000 men sent from that place to Resht had only been transferred in order to strengthen the garrison at the latter place. No. 53. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, Janua7‘y 3, 1912. YOUR telegram of 1st January : Attack on Mr. Smart. I concur in view that no answer is required at present to Persian Government s communications. Persian Minister here has now used similar language, and has been told that, as regards Shiraz, we had been obliged to send additional guards on account of disorders prevailing there, and that it was notorious that roads had been impassable for months past. We were awaiting with anxiety the march from Kazerun to Shiraz, and every thing depended on whether Mr. Smart and his party arrived safely. Persian Government were responsible, and we intended to hold them so. Minister was asked to telegraph this to Persian Government. No. 54. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. Sir, Foreign Office, January 3, 1912. MR. MALLET, by my instructions, informed the Russian Ambassador on the 1st instant that, as the Persian Government had complied with the Russiandemands it seemed to be very desirable, as well as reasonable, that a beginning of the withdrawal ol the Russian troops from Kazvin should be made without delay m accordance with the assurance given to your Excellency by the Russian Minister for foreign Affairs. Mr. Mallet said that I quite saw the difficulty of an immediate and total with drawal, but that it was most desirable to do something to encourage the Persian Government after their compliance, especially since recent occurrences at Tabreez had apparently forced Russia to take strong action there, although the present Persian Government were not to blame for what had happened. On learning however, of the more recent information contained in your Excellency’s telegram of the 30th ultimo, that about 1,000 men had already been transferred from Kazvin to Resht of which Mr. Mallet informed Count Benckendorff, his Excellency said that he would telegraph to his Government saying that I had been glad to hear that this step had been taken and hoped that the process of withdrawal would continue Mr. Mallet further expressed the hope that discrimination would be used at labreez, and Count Benckendorff expressed his entire confidence in the humane disposition of the Viceroy of the Caucasus. Count Benckendorff expressed gratitude for the publication in the press here of a denial of the reported Russian atrocities at Tabreez. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 55. Sir G.

THE Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke yesterday of the execution of Sikat- el-Islam, and emphasised the difficult position of the Cabinet. He urged upon my Russian colleague and myself that the Russian Government should assist the Cabinet in the following ways :— 1 . Give assurances to the Persian Government with regard to the duration and nature of the Russian administration at Resht, Enzeli, and Tabreez ; 2 . Expel Shuja-ed-Dowleh from Tabreez ; and 3. Agree to an enquiry being held to establish responsibility for the court- martialling of Sikat-el-Islam, who, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was entirely innocent. Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his confidence that I would lend the Persian Government my offices in obtaining from the Russian Government the assistance asked for. While the first and second of the above points would appear reasonable, the third attacks the dignity ot Russia, and is of course out of the question. &lt; According to reports received from Tabreez by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shuja’s friends received him with acclamations for Mohamed Ali.

His Excellency pointed out that, if any demand were made on this ground for the withdrawal of the Swedish officers who are already in Persia, Swedish susceptibilities would be strongly affected. I did not telegraph this enquiry immediately, as Russian charge d’affaires was expecting his instructions at any moment, and I thought our present action wmuld suffice to dissipate any apprehensions which might be entertained by his Excellency.

THE Persian Minister called at this department on the 2nd instant to represent the serious effect which the summary execution of the Sikat-el-Islam at Tabreez would have throughout Persia. The execution had been most unfortunately timed for the 10th day of Moharrem, which was an additional provocation to religious feeling. Mr. Mallet asked Mehdi Khan whether the Sikat-el-Islam had taken part in politics, and he replied that he was a strong nationalist. Mehdi Khan asked whether I could do anything. Mr. Mallet replied that Sir G. Buchanan had begged the Russian Government to exercise discrimination in the punishment which they meted out at Tabreez, and that he had himself spoken in the same sense to the Russian ambassador on the 1st instant.

Colonel Douglas sends the following report, dated the 7th January, of the incidents :—■ “ I have nothing to add to my previous telegram (repeated in legation telegram of the 25th December) respecting the fight at Kotal Dokhtar on the 24th December. The treacherous attack on advanced scouts was the cause of almost all the casualties. “ Smart has already reported the commencement of the fight on the 26th December. It was not serious for the first mile and a-half. The fire then became hotter, as more men, presumably Kashgais, joined in on Birdwood’s right flank. “ There are several villages and towers along the road ; as the retirement continued numbers of riflemen poured out of each of these and fired on our party. This lasted till within 2 miles of Kazerun, the detachment being pursued and attacked for about 8 miles from both flanks. Our casualties in this fight amount to 2 followers killed, 6 sowars, 3 followers and hospital assistant wounded, 10 regimental mules either killed or stampeded with loads, 10 horses killed or died of wounds. The numbers opposed to Bird wood amounted to several hundreds, including villagers, but it has been impossible to form any accurate estimate. As regards losses incurred by enemy, Birdwood can vouch for five seen to be hit. I cannot give any opinion as to who instigated the attack, but, unless the road guards at the caravanserai had been assured of the support of the villagers along the road, it does not seem probable that they would have commenced the firing. It is possible that the men who first joined in on the right flank were those whom Mohamed Ali is supposed to have sent to stop the fighting; they naturally joined in when fired on by our men. Smart saw nothing of the later proceedings, as he unfortunately fell behind and was wounded early in the fight. None of the men appear to have seen him fall, and Birdwood thought he was on ahead. I cannot sufficiently express my regret that he should have been left behind.” * 565 No. 72. Lord Kilmarnock to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 9.) (Telegraphic.) Stockholm, January 9, 1912.

I have therefore ventured to join charge d’affaires in action proposed by you in your telegram to St. Petersburgh of the 5th instant. The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs thanked us for the communication, and declared that it was the firm determination of the Swedish Government not to take any step with regard to Persia without having previously entered into consultation with the Russian and British Governments. No. 73. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 10.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 10, 1912. I HAVE discussed the situation with my Russian colleague, and we now submit the following identic suggestions-:— We regard prompt termination of insurrection as indispensable preliminary to any useful attempt on the part of the Persian Government to deal with general disorder. Insurrection has already cost the Persian Government 300,000h in actual money, and has resulted in pillage and in destruction of cultivation and of means of transport involving, if not something approaching ro famine—wheat and barley have risen 100 per cent, since the summer—at any rate incalculable loss to the country, which must react also on foreign trade. It is of utmost importance that the insurrection should cease, not only because of direct expenses and loss which it is causing, but also because it absorbs the attention of the Persian Government to the exclusion of the chronic disorders which so urgently demand a remedy. While the two Powers maintain their attitude of non-interference prospect of a termination seems remote, for while the Persian Government are strong enough to prevent the ex-Shah from entering the capital unaided, they are powerless to crush him in the provinces. Possibly things will continue to drift, and the Persian Government will lose such vestige of authority as still remains. Result of recent pourparlers of the two Governments seems to preclude recognition of ex-Shah. If, therefore, they intervene it must be on the side of the present Govern ment, and we would suggest that we should offer the Persian Government, on certain conditions, to inform the ex-Shah that the two Powers will not recognise him and to advise him to return to Europe. Conditions would be the grant to him of a suitable pension, proclamation of a general amnesty, and, the more important one, some form of engagement binding Persian Government to conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian Convention. The present Cabinet shows no disposition other than to conform to those principles, but it may resign, and, moreover, we shall have to count with the Medjliss. An express engagement, therefore, that Persian Government will do nothing injurious to our respective interests, or some formula, would be very desirable. At the same time, Persian Government should be urged to dismiss their irregular forces (fedais) which, when ex-Shah is gone, will be no longer needed, and will be only a constant source of trouble. We believe that in the present condition of affairs it would be possible to obtain the above conditions in exchange for our active support. It is of urgent importance that the Persian Government should obtain money and arms for gendarmerie, and as with the dismissal of Shuster loan negotiations have stopped, the easiest financial operation would be the conversion by the Russian Bank of the Persian Government’s debt to it, or some operation by this bank on the same security. The proceeds of this operation would not be large enough to render it advisable to deduct from it our claims. Payment of these should be made from a later loan which might possibly be specially arranged for settlement of foreign claims. The need of money is so urgent that, pending conclusion of the proposed Russian Bank’s loan, the two Governments might make advances to be repaid from the loan on condition that proceeds will be spent under supervision of treasurer-general, and a large portion be earmarked for gendarmerie, which now promises well under Swedish officers. (Latter have now taken over treasury gendarmerie.) Besides the gendarmerie Persian Government will need a small army to garrison the bigger towns. A scheme for such an army could be discussed with the Persian Government by legations according to politico-geographical exigencies.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 10.)

The military authorities would, however, his Excellency said, continue to exercise a punitive jurisdiction and to maintain order both in the town and along the caravan routes. His Excellency defended those authorities against the charges of undue severity that had been brought against them, and said that the execution of Sikat-el-Islam had not provoked the slightest disorders either at Tabreez or Tehran. He Was, he said, a thoroughly bad character. He had acted, on the one hand, as head of the fedais, while, on the other, he was not an orthodox Persian, but the chief of a dissenting sect. This execution, therefore, had been taken quite calmly by the population. In conclusion, his Excellency said that the situation showed considerable signs of improvement. I observed that, as this was the case, I trusted that the Imperial Government would now find it possible to withdraw their troops from Kazvin, but his Excellency replied that they would hardly be justified in taking this step at the present moment.

CONVEYS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 11th January :— Sir, On the receipt of your telegram of the 8 th instant, I communicated to M. Sazonof, in a private letter, your views with regard to M. Mornard’s appointment, and I reverted to the subject in a conversation which I had with his Excellency yesterday. M. Sazonof said that M. Mornard was, he believed, the best man for the post. He was a good man of business, and, what was most important, had a thorough knowledge of Persian affairs. The Russian Government bad, however, never insisted on M. Mornard’s appointment, nor had they imposed it on the Persian Government. M. Poklewski had discussed the matter with Sir George Barclay, and the two Ministers had recommended him as the most suitable candidate. Now that he had been appointed acting treasurer- general it was, he thought, too late for us to suggest the appointment of some other individual or a commission, consisting of an Englishman, a Russian, and a subject of one of the minor Powers. This latter course would, in his opinion, be most objectionable to the Persian Government, as it would probably be regarded in the light of an Anglo- Russian financial condominium. He therefore thought that it would be best to give M. Mornard a trial, and if, later on, the Persian Government could show any good grounds for objecting to him, Russia would not insist on retaining him. M. Sazonof then proceeded to say that what we ought to do at once was to approach the question of a Persian loan. The best service which we could render the Persian Government was to help them to put their finances on a sound basis. Such material support would, he was convinced, be more appreciated by them than any amount of good words and friendly assurances.26 No. 77. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.)

The bodies of only seventeen of the killed have been brought in. The wounds received were chiefly from dumdum bullets. I have seen photographs of the bodies, which show that they must have received terrible mishandling, the heads especially. The Persians themselves have been remarking on the fact that mutilation has been practised, and one of them even told my dragoman that the corpse of a Russian soldier had been decapitated close to his house. The Russians declare that four of their men were tortured before their death during the night of 21st December, while Persian music was being played, but for this the only evidence so far appears to consist in the appearance of the four corpses when they were recovered. It seems that only the Persians actually engaged in the fighting were responsible for these mutilations, not the population in general. No. 81. Sir Edward Grey to Lord Kilmarnock. (Telegraphic.)

I HAVE received the following reply from Smart to my enquiries as to the circumstances in which he was wounded and his subsequent treatment:— “ A young Kashgai deliberately fired at me. I was riding with our rear-guard, and he, with several others, crept up to within 30 yards of us as we were retreating. He could not, of course, have known my identity. The same bullet wounded my horse in^ the neck. I fell, and was more or less winded. As the enemy passed over me in pursuit of our force one quickly extracted a few valueless objects from my pocket. As our Maxim bullets were whistling over me, I rolled myself down hill. I then waited for the enemy to return. Two came back. I introduced myself, but the only result was that one cleared my pockets while the other covered me with his rifle ; they then left me. The next party included the young Kashgai chief, Ardeshir Khan; there was considerable resemblance between him and the man who had shot me. He emphatically denied it, however, and I cannot be certain. He stated that he had been sent by Mohamed Ali Khan to stop the attack on the escort. He was extremely polite, mounted me on his own horse, and brought me back to the caravanserai, where I found Mohamed Ali, who assured me he had come from his camp at Shahpur with the express object of preventing the attack. He expressed his deepest regret and concern. My wound was bandaged as well as possible, and as the caravanserai was lacking in proper accommodation, Mohamed Ali insisted on my accompanying him to Shahpur, where he treated me with almost embarrassing kindness during my stay. A Persian surgeon, at his command, came there to attend to my wound. Mo'hamed Ali said that the common people were no longer properly under restraint; they had been much excited by the priests against our troops; he had given orders to the tofangchis to let me pass, but- the people were out of hand.” No. 84.

I am to point out that in the opinion of Sir E. Grey the situation as depicted by Mr. Knox completely justifies the conclusion arrived at by His Majesty’s Government from the telegrams received in the autumn that some increase of the consular guards was necessary for the safety of His Majesty’s consulate and British subjects in the town of Shiraz itself. It shows, moreover, that the trouble which has now arisen is in no way due to the increase in the escort recently dispatched to Shiraz, and that, even if a rescue of the British colony there has now to be effected, it would certainly have had to be effected, possibly even before now and under greater difficulties, if the increase of guards had not been sent three months ago. As regards Mr. Knox’s appreciation of the services of Mr. Smith, of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, of the sepoys and sowars attached to His Majesty’s consulate, and of the consulate munshi, I am to express Sir E.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 14.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, January 14, 1912. CONVEYS the substance of the following despatch, dated the 17th January :— Sir, On the receipt of your telegram of the 12 th of this month, I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and informed him that you were prepared to co-operate with the Imperial Government on the lines proposed by M. Poklewsky and Sir George Barclay, as you considered that it was essential to give some solid support to the Persian Government without further delay. I added that you would be glad to learn his views with regard to the programme which the two Ministers had elaborated. M. Sazonof replied that, while he approved of the programme as a whole, as offering a practical basis of co-operation, there were two points in it which seemed to him open to criticism. The first had reference to the attitude which it was proposed that the two Governments should adopt with regard to the ex-Shah. The Imperial Government, his Excellency said, would be quite willing to join His Majesty’s Government in advising Mohamed Ali in a friendly manner to return to Europe; but they could not go so far as to tell him that they would, under no circumstances, ever recognise him. His Excellency then repeated the various reasons which—as M. Ndratof had more than once explained to me on former occasions—rendered it impossible for Russia to take this step. I pointed out that, in view of the fact that the ex-Shah had made his attempt and failed, and that he would never now regain the throne unaided, the Russian Govern ment might, without exposing themselves to a charge of inconsistency, inform him that they could not countenance the perpetuation of the present anarchy which his presence in Persia must entail; that, if he left at once, the two Governments would endeavour to induce the Persian Government to grant him a pension ; but that, if he declined to follow their advice, he would have to abandon all hope of ever receiving a pension again. I added that, as his Excellency was aware, His Majesty’s Government would never recognise the ex-Shah, and that, as they were meeting the wishes of the Imperial Government in the matter of the proposed constitutional changes, it was but a small thing to ask that that Government should meet their wishes on this one essential point. M. Sazonof replied that it was by no means so certain that the position of the ex-Shah was as bad as I had made out. He had still a strong backing of Turkomans, and it was always possible that he might attempt to establish his authority in the northern provinces, which had declared for him, even if he had to separate them from the rest of Persia. He begged me to believe, however, that the Russian Government had no desire to take his part. In spite of all that had been said to the contrary, they had done absolutely nothing to facilitate his return, and it was only owing to a falsepassport and to a successful disguise that he had been able to pass unhindered through Russian territory. In the telegram which he had received from M. Poklewsky nothing was said on the subject of a pension, but it was evident from Sir George Barclay’s telegram that this was due to an oversight. The grant of a pension would greatly facilitate matters, and he would be prepared to tell the ex-Shah that it was useless for him to remain any longer in Persia. M. Sazonof then proceeded to speak of the second point to which he took exception, namely, the proposed financial operations. This was, he said, a matter on which he could not speak with authority until he had had an opportunity of discussing it with the Minister of Finance. His personal opinion, however, was that it would be a mistake for the two Governments to make small advances to the Persian Government., which would be insufficient to meet their financial requirements. What we ought to do was to arrange at once for a large loan. The Russian Government had no intention of pressing for the immediate payment of the indemnity, which formed the subject of the third de?nand accepted by the Persian Government, and they would also allow the outstanding claims of Russian subjects, which amounted to some 300,000Z., to stand over for the present. They would, however, be forced by Russian public opinion to demand the immediate payment of an indemnity to the families of the Russian soldiers who had. been either killed or maimed for life during the course of the recent fighting. He could not say exactly what would be the amount of this indemnity, but at a rough calculation it would come to about 20,000L I remarked that at a moment like the present, when complete anarchy reigned in Persia, it would he very difficult to find financiers ready to float a large loan, except on very onerous terms. It seemed to me, therefore, advisable to commence by affording the Persian Government some temporary pecuniary assistance, so tbnt they might be in a position to restore order in the country. With the restoration of order and an improvement in the general political situation it would be much easier for them to negotiate a large loan on reasonable terms. As regarded the question of the payment of an indemnity to the families of the Russian soldiers who had been either killed or wounded, it would, I suggested, be sufficient to obtain an engagement from the Persian Government that the sum demanded should eventually be paid out of the proceeds ot the new loan, and that meanwhile the Russian Treasury might advance the money necessary to meet any passing claims on the part of these families. M. Sazonof replied that he did not believe that it would make much difterence, as regarded terms, whether the loan were to be raised at once or to be postponed to a later date. In order to obtain a loan of several millions of pounds it would be necessary that the two Governments, without giving an actual guarantee, should reassure its promoters with regard to the political situation, and give them clearly to understand that behind Persia stood Great Britain and Russia. He would, however, repeat what I had said to the Minister of Finance, and discuss the whole question with him. I then read over to M. Sazonof the remaining points dealt with in Sir George Barclay’s telegram of the 10th instant, but his Excellency said that he had no observations to make with regard to them. No. 87. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey—(Received January 15, 1912.) gj r Tehran, December 21, 1911. OWING to the interruption of telegraphic communication between Tehran and both Astrabad and Kermanshah I have no very precise news as to how the insurrection is proceeding either in the east or west. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in the Medjliss on the 18th instant that the ex-Shah’s followers had advanced as far as Semnan. I have no confirmation of this from the telegraph department. At all events no rebel force has yet penetrated into the town. Both Shahrud and Damgham appear, however, to be in the hands of the ex-Shah’s forces. Beyond Semnan the telegraph line is cut, and the ex-Shah’s Turkomans are doubtless not far from that town. The ex-Shah himself is reported to be still in the neighbourhood of Gumesh Tepe at Khoja Nefes. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also stated on the 18th instant that Salar-ed- Dowleh had reoccupied Kermanshah. Reports from His Majesty s consul at that place, dated the 9th December, showed that there was fighting in the town between some30 Government forces and the insurgents, but I have so far not learned from him that the town has been taken by Salar-ed-Dowleh. From Tabreez there is no change in the military situation to report. Early this month an attempt was made by the Tabreezis to come to terms with the Shuja-ed- Dowleh, telegrams having been received by the Anjuman from the Extremists in the Medjliss urging them to make peace, as it behoved all Persians to unite in defence of their country and religion in view of the Russian ultimatum. An influential deputa tion waited upon Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and urged him to return with them to the town, but the latter declined these overtures, suspecting a trap. The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in the Medjliss on the 18th instant that Shuja-ed-Dowleh had sent a force to Ardebil, whence it was threatening Resht, but I have no confirmation of this from His Majesty’s consul at Tabreez. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 88 . Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 15, 1912.) Sir, Tehran, December 24, 1911. IT would serve no useful purpose for me to attempt to give a detailed account of the somewhat bewildering phases of the situation since the presentation of the second Russian ultimatum on the 29th November, but a brief review may be of interest. From the first the Cabinet were unsparing in their efforts to induce the Medjliss to realise the wisdom of submitting, but for three weeks these efforts, counteracted as they were by great clerical and popular agitation, encouraged by the Democrat party, seemed doomed to failure. In the hope of gaining the confidence of the Medjliss sufficiently for it to give the Cabinet full powers to settle with Russia, Samsam-es-Sultaneh had introduced into his Ministry as Ministers of Finance and Interior respectively Hakim-ul-Mulk and Kawam-es-Sultaneh, men of pronounced democratic sympathies ; but on the 11 th instant, and again on the 18th instant, when the Cabinet sought to obtain the full powers desired, they found the Medjliss as recalcitrant as ever. Meanwhile, the Russian troops, after stopping for a few da}^s at Resht, had advanced to Kazvin, where between 3,000 and 4,000 were concentrated. The day the 21st December) on which they were to begin their advance on Tehran, if the Persian Government had not by then submitted, was approaching. On the 19th the Russian chief of the staff had come to Tehran to make arrangements with the Russian Minister for the arrival of the troops. On the 20th, however, things took a more favourable turn. On that day it became evident that the Medjliss had come to a more reasonable way of thinking. It accepted a proposal which had been put forward by the Cabinet on the 18th as an alternative to the grant of full powers, and wffiich on that occasion had failed to pass owing to the abstention from voting of the greater part of the deputies, who w r ere evidently afraid to put their names to a proposal which they felt was bound to lead to the acceptance of the three Russian demands. These deputies, however, by the 20th seemed to have plucked up their courage, and the Medjliss voted by a majority of 39 to 19 that a committee of five should be appointed and empowered in consultation with the Cabinet to come to a settlement wdth Russia. The committee was appointed, the principal member being Sardar Assad, and at a meeting with the Cabinet on the 21st instant at the Palace, under the presidency of the Regent, the committee gave their consent to the Govern ment’s accepting the Russian demands. M. Poklewski was informed of this verbally on the 22 nd. Some delay occurred in recording the Persian Government’s submission in a note. It will be remembered that M. Poklew T ski had on the 15th instant told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that subject to there being no fresh incident or provocation the withdrawal of the troops would begin as soon as the Persian Government had given way. In the discussions with M. Poklewski as regards the drafting of the note, which extended over two days, the Minister for Foreign Affairs pressed him very hard to consent to its recording a Russian undertaking in unequivocal terms that the troops would be immediately withdrawn and no fresh demands put forward. This M. Poklewski firmly refused to permit, explaining that he was not empowered to say more than he had already said. Finally, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and M. Poklewski wereagreed upon the terms of the note, and it was handed to the Russian Legation this afternoon. M. Poklewski immediately replied, declaring his Government satisfied. Translations of the two notes are enclosed herewith. It will be noticed that the second demand, as recorded in these two notes, is worded as proposed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 12th December, with the amendment suggested by Sir G. Buchanan and agreed to by M. Sazonof. Simultaneously with the exchange of notes the Government have taken what is hoped may prove effectual steps to prevent the outburst of indignation which was to be expected from the Democrat party in the Medjliss. At the moment of writing I learn that a large meeting of all classes was convened at the Palace this afternoon, where the Minister for Foreign Affairs urged the dissolution of the Medjliss, which, he said, had impeded the task of Government both in foreign relations and in internal administra tion. No opposition was offered. The Regent immediately issued a decree, declaring the present session closed, and I hear that Yeprem, chief of police, has sent a force to occupy the Medjliss. Those in the building were invited to leave. No resistance was offered, and the gates are now closed. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 88 . Vossuk-ed-Dowleh to M. Poklewski. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, December 24, 1911. IN answer to your Excellency’s note of the 29th November, I have the honour to say that the Persian Government have always been desirous of safeguarding their good relations and friendly intercourse with the Russian Government, and have on many occasions proved their good intentions in the prevention of difficulties and incidents which might injure the friendly relations between the two Governments. On this occasion also in order that their former policy and line of conduct should in no way be modified ; in order that the historical friendly relations between the two Governments, which date from long years back, and are much prized by both sides, should not be shaken ; and so that every kind of cause of complaint and indifference on the part of the Russian Government should be removed as indicated at the end of the note, the Persian Government consequently have accepted the three demands laid down in the note above referred to, and have dismissed Mr. Shuster and Mr. Lecoffre from the Persian service. With regard, however, to the second demand in your note, which required that the Persian Government should undertake “ not to invite foreigners to take service under the Persian Government without having previously obtained the consent of the British and Russian Legations,” the Persian Government hopes that the Imperial Russian Legation will accept the following wording in place of the above, i.e. \ “ That in view of the sincere desire at all times for maintenance of cordial relations with the Russian and British Governments, the Persian Government in future, when engaging foreign employes and officers whom they consider necessary for the organisation of Government administrations, will take care that their choice will not be such as to injure the just interests of the two Governments in Persia. Consequently, regarding the engagement of foreign employes and officers, the Persian Government will be prepared to effect an exchange of views beforehand with the Russian and British Legations at Tehran in order that an agreement should be arrived at.” It is clear that, as stated in your note, after the acceptance of these demands of the Russian Government, the Persian Government are justified in their certitude that the causes of the principal differences between the two Governments have been removed, and that a basis has been formed upon which to build up cordial relations and a firm friendship. They are also justified in the certainty that, after the acceptance of the above demands, the relations between the twm Governments will return to conditions more favourable than heretofore, and before the conditions had been considered. And the result of the steps which the Russian Government thought it necessary to take in order to bring about the fulfilment of those demands will immediately be put an end to, and that the hopes of the Persian Government in regard to the absolute good-will of the Imperial Government will be completely confirmed.

I HAVE noted with great satisfaction the contents of your Excellency’s note of to-day’s date, that the Persian Government, in view of their friendly sentiments towards the Imperial Russian Government, have decided to accept the demands of the Russian Government made in my note. The Imperial Government are desirous of proving their good-will towards the Persian Government, and are pleased to accept the wording of the second article of their ultimatum as proposed by your Excellency, and consider that they have received satisfaction in all three demands. Therefore I have the honour, in communicating this to your Excellency, to say that I hope, now the principal differences which had arisen between our two Govern ments have been removed, that, as stated in your Excellency’s note, neighbourly good relations which are advantageous to both countries will be established.

Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending December 24, 1911. Tehran. THE past four weeks have been full of incident at Tehran connected chiefly with the Russian ultimatum, delivered to the Persian Government on the 29th ultimo, which was finally accepted by the Persians on the 24th December, on which day the Medjliss was closed. On the 1 st December the Medjliss rejected the Russian demands, as reported in a previous despatch. The Cabinet underwent partial reconstruction on the 12 th December, and is now composed as follows :— Premier, Samsam-es-Sultaneh. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. Minister of War, Sardar Mohtashem. Minister of the Interior, Kawam-es-Sultaneh. Minister of Finance, Hakim-ul-Mulk. Minister of Education, vacant. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Moazed-es-Sultaneh. Minister of Justice, Zoka-ul-Mulk. On the 18th December the Foreign Minister made a long speech to the Medjliss regarding the Russian demands, and proposed that full powers should be given to the Cabinet to settle the matter, or, as an alternative, that the Medjliss should select a committee to assist the Ministers, without further reference to Parliament, in dealing with the question. Both proposals were rejected. After an unsuccessful attempt had been made to refer the Russian demands to the Regent, the Medjliss again put the Cabinet’s second proposal to the vote on the 20 th December, when it was agreed to by thirty-nine members as against nineteen who voted against it. A committee of five deputies was chosen with some difficulty, and included Sardar Assad, who is still a[565] D J ib« uea a aecree declaring the session of the Med liss to be at an end. Yepnm Khan, the chief of police, sent a force during the course of the afternoon to occupy the Medjliss building, the doors of which were closed without incident. . *r e 1st December various acts of terrorism were perpetrated in Tehran, the most serious o± which was the assassination of Ala-ed-Dowleh. Sardar Assad arrived at Tehran on the 5th December, accompanied by Mukhber-es- bultaneh and ^Dabir-ul-Mulk. He at once advocated submission to the Russian demands, and did his utmost to quell the public excitement which was being actively fanned by the Democratic party. Various public meetings were held at which inflammatory ^ speeches were delivered, and school-children paraded the streets with banners inscribed with the words u Independence or death.” Telegrams were sent to the Parliaments of Europe, the Women’s Suffragist Committee in London, and to other bodies in Europe and in Persia, with the object of enlisting sympathy and support against Russia. Sardar Assads influence did much to stop the public excitement, which probably brought about hostilities with the Russian troops at Tabreez and Resht, as reported During^ the early part of,December the situation in Tabreez was so unsatisfactory that the majority of the merchants were ready to accept the appointment of Shuja-ed- Dowleh as governor, in the hopes that the prevailing insecurity would be put an end to. There had been no disorders in the town itself, but an anti-foreign feeling was prevalent, and, as a precautionary measure, the Russian consul-general considered it necessary to patrol the town and to reinforce the Russian troops by some 500 men from Ardebil. These arrived on the 17th and 18th December. On the 21st December fighting commenced between the fedais and the Russian troops. On the following day the fedais took up a position in the citadel, and the Russians commenced to bombard it. There was also some firing in the streets. The fighting continued on the 23rd and 24th. At the moment of writing communications with Tabreez are interrupted. The Russian and Persian accounts of the cause of the fighting vary. The Russians contend that a soldier repairing the telephone line was attacked by a police patrol, and that in self-defence he killed two Persians. On the other hand, the Persian Government reports that some Russian soldiers, without previous warning, climbed on to the roof of the police-station to lay a telephone wire, and that when challenged by the gendarme on duty they opened fire, killing two Persians. His Majesty’s consul states that owing to the existing state of affairs he is not able to ascertain the exact facts that led to the outbreak. He adds that the populace are remaining quiet, and that so far foreigners have not been molested. During the fighting the Russian consulate-general was attacked, as I am informed On the 30th November 250 Russian soldiers arrived at Astrabad and took up their quarters there. 0 Many Mazanderan noblemen, sympathisers of Mohamed Ali, have taken refuge in Ghilan. Tabreez. by the Russian Legation, and one Russian officer of the consular escort was killed and two Cossacks were wounded. Ghilan and Mazanderan. The British consular agent at Astrabad reports that the ex-Shah, with 350 followers, is still at Khoja Nefes, and that some 300 Caucasian mercenaries are on their way to join him.34 At Resht a general boycott of Russian goods has been declared, and the bazaars have been closed, causing much distress among the lower classes. At Enzeli the labourers at the wharf refused to handle goods coming from Russia, and trade is at a standstill in consequence. The arrival of Russian troops at Enzeli was as follows . In addition, several small parties landed on dates His Majesty s vice-consul at Resht has not been able to ascertain, bringing the total to 4,500, with 8 guns and The infantry belonged to the 2nd Caucasian Shemakhinski and Salianski Regiments, and the Cossacks to the Labineski Regiment. At Resht, on the 21st December, an affray broke out between the Russian troops and the Persians, and on the following day fighting occurred at Enzeli. His Majesty’s vice-consul reports a Russian officer wounded, three Cossacks killed, ten Persians killed, and about forty wounded. Rukn-ed-Dowleh, the new Governor-General of Khorassan, arrived on the 15th November, and was given a very good reception by all classes. The condition of the district is becoming worse. Mohamed Ali’s following and nondescript sowars, sent against them from Tehran, have been looting and pillaging the country as they go, and robberies are of frequent occurrence. On the 23rd November 400 of the ex-Shah’s followers took Shahrud, and on the 16th December Damghan was also occupied. Ninety time-expired men of the Russian consular guard were relieved by a similar number on the 17 th November. The Central Government have decided to separate Nishapur from Khorassan, to which the British and Russian Legations have agreed. On the 28th December His Majesty’s consul-general telegraphed that, owing to the approach of the Moharrem, and to the rumour that Salar-ed-Dowleh had taken Tehran, the population was arming and the situation becoming serious. The Russian consul-general, after consulting his British colleague, asked for reinforcements. The matter was referred to the Russian Minister at Tehran, who advised the dispatch of 100 Cossacks. On the 12th December His Majesty’s consul-general reported that the situation was better, and a sotnia of Cossacks was due shortly.

Owing to the presence of the Indian cavalry at Shiraz the Mullahs attempted tc stir up anti-foreign feeling, and instigated a boycott of Russian and British goods. They also induced the merchants in the bazaars to refrain from selling food-stuffs to the troops.^ On the 18th December, the supply officer was met with a definite refusal to sell. ^ The matter was referred to Tehran and the Foreign Office. In pursuance of the instructions of His Majesty’s Government the supply officer was directed to use force, if necessary, in order to obtain such provisions as he required. This was done and no incident resulted. The boycott was shortly afterwards put an end to, and since then there has been no trouble in obtaining provisions for the troops.

Early in December, Azam-ed-Dowleh, the representative of the Persian Govern ment, arrived, and fighting commenced between his followers and those of Ferrukh Khan.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 15, 1912.) Tehran, December 24, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 27th November 1 ' respecting the state of the southern roads, I have the honour to state that the usual weekly reports [565] See “Persia, No. 4 (1912),” No. 300. D 236 from His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan have not reached me this month, owing no doubt to the disorganised state of the postal service. The Indo-European Telegraph Department received an intimation dated the 8th October from their agent at Shiraz, to the effect that the Dehbid section of the road to Ispahan was being held by robbers, and that the muleteers refused to accompany inspectors of the line. Theie was little prospect of the condition of the road becoming more satisfactory m the near future^ A robbery on the Ahwaz road of twelve cases of opium was reported as having taken place on the 3rd December, and His Majesty s consul at Bunder Abbas telegraphed on the 22nd December that a caravan was robbed about 16 miles from Bunder Abbas, and that about 200L worth of British property was carried off.

Enclosure in No. 91. Diary from November 6 to December 4, 1911. ON the 6th November I left again foi Kazerun, there to meet Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas and two squadrons of the 39th Central India Horse. I ^took with me two sowars of the consulate escort, but no baggage at all. His Majesty’s consul had asked for two Kashgai sowars to accompany me ; they arrived late and would not go beyond Zinian ; the road, which had been bristling with armed guards a week before was now entirely deserted, the road guards having fled after the perpetration of a robbery by a band of Surkhi Kashgai. Having ascertained that all supplies were ready at Zinian in charge of the local representative of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, I went on to Dashtarjin (40 miles) arriving after dark, and slept in the telegraph rest-house. Next morning at dawn I left for Kazerun by a short cut over the hills, accompanied by one sowar and four riflemen from Dashtarjin; one of them shot on the way a mountain sheep with the finest head I have ever seen in Persia. I am sending it to the Bombay Natural History Museum. I reached Kazerun at 4 p.m. On the 8th November I accompanied the two squadrons to Mian Kotal, a long march of 21 miles with two steep ascents, one of them the Kotal Dokhtar, up a causeway paved with smooth boulders. The comparative ease with which the horses negotiated these ascents, the last of a very trying series, was remarkable. At Mian Kotal supplies had been laid in through the agency of the telegraph department gholam, and no difficulty was encountered on this score either here or anywhere else on the road. Heavy rain fell during the night. The next day we pushed on to Dashtarjin (14 miles), moving by two tracks across the Piri Zan Pass. On the 10th we went on to Zinian (14 miles) ; some trouble was experienced here with the Kashkuli roadguards, who succeeded in extracting some money as rahdari from our muleteers, who as usual, gave it readily, fearing (not without good reason) reprisals on some subsequent occasion if they made our presence an excuse for refusing. Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas sent for Isfandiar Khan, a minor Kashkuli chief, and insisted on the money being refunded, which was done at once. Rain commenced to fall during the night and continued all next day. It was therefore decided to push on to Shiraz at once with one squadron as the next stage, Chinar Rahdar, afforded shelter * gee “ Persia, No. 4 (1912),” Nos. 218 and 224.0 ^ e ^ adT0I l at f ost - was reached by the Sikh squadron after a long Hew d^later C ° 6 Very trying f ° r tlle follower ^ two of whom died For the next five days, till the 18th November, the force halted at Shiraz to refit, and the question of accommodation was gone into; a month’s supplies had already been accumulated, and no anxiety was felt for the moment on this score. Ihe arrival of the force at Shiraz was marked by no demonstration or ceremony ; the weather prevented all but a very few from leaving their houses ; next day, however arge crowds visited the camps to gaze quietly on the unaccustomed spectacle. As far as 1 could gather from the remarks of the crowd, and from enquiries made in various erections, the attitude of the population on the subject of the arrival of the troops was one of general apathy, tempered, in the case of the landowning and commercial classes, with satisfaction at the guarantee of law and order that their presence affords ffie onfy sign of dissatisfaction was the dissemination of a cyclostyled manifesto, in w l*? 1 . . e ™ va J t roo P s was used by the anonymous scribe as a pretext to revile his political opponents. On the Kazerun-Shiraz road I received several offers from leading villagers to provide men wherewith to form a local force of roadguards. The offers were made spontaneously, and deserve to be borne in mind, as there can be little doubt that the sedentary tribesmen inhabiting the villages between Kazerun and Shiraz form very promising material for such a purpose ; tribesmen could never be relied on, even were then chiefs to permit them to serve, which is unlikely ; I also believe that a locally laised foice would be effective only as long as the men were employed in the neighbour hood of their homes. On the 18th two squadrons left Shiraz. I was responsible for all arrangements for supply, Ac., as far as Yezdikhast, i.e., to the borders of Fars, in the same way as for the fvazerun-Shiraz road. I made all arrangements through the local staff of the telegraph department, with the best results. All provisions required had been laid in s ^ a ^ e ’ an 4 c -h ar ;g e d- for at current rates, which the local knowledge of the staff enabled them to insist on, a matter in which I should otherwise have been to a large extent powerless. Supplies were not collected without some difficulty owing to the unprecedented depredations of the nomad tribes. Half the villages of the Marvdasht plain had been looted, and 25 per cent, of them had been entirely .deserted during the last two years— mamy of their villages which I had seen and recorded as flourishing five years ago. All along the road meat was scarce, and dairy produce practically unobtainable owing to the wholesale robbery of flocks and herds. On the 25th Abadeh was reached, and a halt made ; we had been accompanied up to this point by some 300 mules, carrying British goods for Ispahan, and 300 disbanded I ersian soldiers, the last remnants of the Shiraz expeditionary force ; also the assistant or “ mawin ” to the ex-Governor-Gfeneral of Fars. Fiom Abadeh onwards we were accompanied by some 300 camels and a hundred or more mules and donkeys which had been waiting for our arrival. On the 26th the Sikh squadron returned to Shiraz with Miss Ross, the Mohamedan (Tiwana) squadron, under Captain Eckford, continuing northwards. The cold from Dehbid onwards had been severe, particularly as at least one squadron had always to camp out at nights. Both men and horses, however, stood it very well; it was noteworthy that, though our caravan numbered over 1,000 animals between Abadeh and Ispahan, nowhere was the slightest difficulty experienced in obtaining fodder. In Yezdikhast there were various rumours of robbers on the next stage, but these were contradicted by the arrival of a mail waggon, the driver of which had seen nothing, and of a local caravan. We left this place at 7T5 a.m., preceded by the merchants’ caravan, numbering over 900 animals, a large donkey caravan at Yezdikhast having availed itself of our passage to go to Kumisheb. I was almost at the head of the merchants’ caravan, in front of which were the Persian soldiers referred to above, driving along their donkeys, on which were tied most of their rifles. They were attacked by some thirty tribesmen near a mud tower some 6 miles west of Yezdikhast, but within Fars, one was wounded. The rest either sought safety in flight, or gave up their rifles and ammunition to the robbers, who thus secured six rifles. The caravan promptly turned back, and I sent word to Captain Eckford, who at once brought up the squadrons, and charged down upon the tribesmen, who kept up a sharp but apparently ill-aimed fire. Captain Eckford and Lieutenant Wickham, who [ 5(55 ] 338 were a Ion- way in front, were not hit, hut Rissaldar-Major Ghulam Muhammad, Khan Bahadur, who was leading his troop, was shot in the thrgh during the charge, and a bullet passed through the waist-cloth of Jamadar Muhammad Bahadur ; a horse was also wounded. The robbers unfortunately got into the tower before the cavalry could Thtraravan was meanwhile diverted to the east, covered by part of the squadron, whilst the remainder surrounded the fort and kept up a sharp fire on the loop-holes, and on any men who showed themselves ; wounded men were seen being helped into tlie 1 After a careful examination of the situation Captain Eckford came to the conclusion that to take the tower by assault would involve heavy loss of life, which the '“Kc' iully'concurred, particularly as, for the moment, the official role of this squadron does not extend to the protection of caravans. , . Aminabad was reached in safety the same day, and on tlie 1st December a telegraphic report on the incident was made from Yezdikhast. c ,, , Ispahan was reached on the 4th, Mr. Grahame meeting us at Kaleh Shur on the previous day; most of the Europeans resident in Ispahan, but comparatively few Persians, witnessed our arrival. . ...

AS I was about to close my despatch of the 24th instant, news reached me of the meeting held the same day at the palace, the result of which was the issue by the Regent of a rescript ordering the closure of the Medjhss. „ , . , I now have the honour to transmit a translation of the substance of the letter addressed by the Cabinet to the Regent setting forth the reasons for which the Regent s sanction for the closure of the Medjliss was asked. ^ This statement, to which the Regent drew my particular attention, contains several points of special interest. It is an unequivocal indictment of the Medjhss and its consistent obstruction of the Government, and it states, moreover, that the deputies and particularly the Democratic party—have incited the public to take up arms to revolt, to boycott British and Russian goods, and to oppose the Government. It holds them responsible, in fact, for the outbreaks at Tabreez and Resht, which is curious } inconsistent with allegations made to me by the Persian Government that the troubles were due to Russian provocation. , . This statement of the Government’s case, which was read to the meeting by tlie Minister for Foreign Affairs, who read it in His Highness’s name, was followed by the rescript of the Regent ordering the closure of the Medjliss, and by a further edict of the Regent’s ordering that fresh elections should at once be held. It is reported to me that elections are to be commenced forthwith at Tehran, and as soon as possible in the provinces. Copies of the enclosed document and the others referred to have been telegraphed to all the provinces, and I have not so far heard ot any particular cases of special excitement in consequence. This is not due to any moderation on the part of the Democratic party, for the Democrats have done their utmost to work up excitement. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 92. Abstract Translation of Letter from the Cabinet to the Regent, dated December 24, 1911. AS your Highness is aware, ever since the formation of the Cabinet by his Excellency Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the Ministers have used their utmost endeavours, jus as your Highness has also constantly done, to impress upon the Medjliss the necessi y[565] D 4 tZ 0i t g f T ures ( ? lculated 1 weaken the Government’s anthority, but that all these attempts have unfortunately failed owing to the intrigues of certain individuals. On the 29th November a note was addressed to the Foreign Office by the Russian egation containing three demands and announcing the dispatch of troops to enforce r em G + ^ er - a Cablllet Council had been held to consider the question and had formed them views as to the gravity of the situation and the seriousness of the advance o t ie Russian troops m view of the state of the country, the Ministers at once put their vmws before the Medjhss. The deputies rejected the views of the Cabinet, w ich replied to the Russian note m conformity with the decision of the Medi'liss. The . imsters &gt; foreseeing that under these unfortunate circumstances graver dangers were m^store, handed m their resignations to your Highness, but they were not accepted and at the same time a number of the deputies waited upon your Highness to express f 1G h confidenc e of the Medjliss m the Cabinet and to request that it should continue to hold office. In the hope that the Medjliss had realised the dangers of the situation t le Cabinet consented to continue in office and engaged in a further consideration of the Russian ultimatum. ob y iou ® ^ at if &gt; when on tbe first occasion the matter was put before the Medjliss by the Cabinet, the deputies had agreed with the Government the Russian troops would have returned from Resht, and that the subsequent misfortunes nought about by the agitation of particular individuals at Tehran who sent exaggerated telegrams to the provinces inciting the people to rise, would not have occurred, and the events at Resht and Tabreez would not have come about. Numerous telegrams weie sent by the deputies and the Democratic party to all the provinces and even to loreign countries. The people of Persia were incited to take up arms, to revolt, to boycott British and Russian goods, and to oppose the Government, and instead « 01 Pg fll P Government at such a juncture in order to find a way out of the imculties they did all they could to put obstacles in their way and the Government was confronted with fierce opposition from them at every turn whether at secret or private sittings. Though time was most valuable we found that they would not even assemble m the Medjliss in order to form a sufficient quorum, or if they did their opposition was not to be overcome. . Eventually on the 18th December the Minister for Foreign Affairs put the ultimatum proposals before the Medjliss; firstly, that the Medjliss should agree with the Cabinet regarding the Russian ultimatum ; or secondly, that they should choose a commission to which they would give full powers to deal with the matter ; or finally, that they should proceed according to the law with the formation of a new Cabinet! Unfortunately the debate on this occasion produced no result and no decision was reached. As the Medjliss could not form a new Cabinet the present Ministers were obliged to continue in office^ and to act in accordance with the dictates of their consciences in what they considered to be the truest interests of Persia. When only two days remained before the advance of the Russians from Kazvin to the capital and a few of the deputies saw that danger was very near, it was decided in secret session by thirty-seven votes to form a committee of the House with full powers, but at the public sittings the childish spectacle was witnessed of this same committee voted for by only thirty-nine members, and after this step had been taken it was announced that not a single member of the Medjliss would consent to sit on the com mittee. Theie continued to be great difficulty in forming the committee until the news arrived on the night of the 21st December of the commencement of fighting at Tabreez and Resht, and of the arrival in Khorasan of a number of Russian troops. At the very last moment the committee was formed and decided to agree to the acceptance of the terms of the ultimatum, whereas, if in the beginning the views of the Cabinet had been agreed upon, the incidents at Tabreez and Resht would never have occurred, nor would the Russian troops have come to Kazvin, and the indemnity demanded by the Russian Government would have been unimportant. Your Highness will observe from the above that the events at Tabreez and Resht are dangers which have been courted by the harmful dissensions and the opposition to the Government, and that these misfortunes have been caused by the telegrams and incitements from ^ the capital. It is obvious that unless the Government is strong, whether constitutional or republican, it is impossible to carry on the affairs of the State satisfactorily, and the paralysis of the Government as witnessed of late can only result in chaos and confusion. Furthermore, in view of the actual dissension and opposition of the present Medjliss, it is clear that good government and a cessation of the existing chaos is impossible.40 Therefore the present Government consider it desirable and, in order to deal with imminent dangers, even obligatory—that yonr Highness should issue without delay a rescript ordering the closure of the Medjliss, though the. fundamental law does not give the Government the direct right to close the Medjliss. On theother hand, the fundamental law does not empower the representatives of the people, after the lapse of the two vears for which they were elected, to prolong their own session indefinitely. ^ In these circumstances we are forced to ask your Highness to issue a rescript ordering the closure of the Medjliss, and to order, by the same rescript, that fresh elections should be begun.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 15.) gj r St. Petersburgh, January 4, 1912. IN a conversation which I had with the Minister for 1 oreign Affairs on the 30th of last month I enquired whether he had any news to give me with regard^ to Persia, and expressed the hope that he would soon see his way to recalling the Russian troops from Kazvin. M. Sazonof replied that he had no desire to retain them there longer than was necessary, more especially now that the Persian Government had formally complied with the three Russian demands in writing. He could not, however, give me any definite date for their withdrawal at present. Two rifle regiments had, indeed, already been transferred from Kazvin to Resht, but they would be sent back at once to the former place should the slightest indication be given of trouble or disorder at Tehran. Russia had been taken by surprise at Tabreez, and would not run this risk a second time. He could not, therefore, recall the Kazvin expeditionary force till all danger of any fresh outbreaks was passed. The troops which had been sent to Resht and Tabreez would have to remain there till order had been thoroughly re-established, and until there was some prospect of its being maintained. This, his Excellency remarked, would be a work of time, but, in reply to a question which I had addressed to him, he disclaimed the idea of converting this temporary occupation into a permanent one. On my expressing the hope that, m the punitive measures which it was proposed to take, the innocent would not be punished with the guilty, his Excellency said that he sincerely trusted that this would be avoided, but that severe punishment would have to be meted out as an example and warning to others. In view of the pressure which is being brought to bear upon them by public opinion, it will, I fear, be very difficult for the Government to recall their troops from Kazvin at the present juncture. I HQ TTO fXTO ’ GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 15.) mrjTr . u St. Petersburgh, January 10, 1912. THE semi-official £ Rossia ” of to-daj 7 publislies an article protesting against the charges of undue severity brought by the foreign press, and especially the British press, against recent Russian action at Tabreez. It refers angrity to the meeting which is to be held in London on the 15th January by “local Persian democrats, with Lord Lamington, Professor Brown, and Messrs. Lynch and Co. at their head.” It asks why all this outcry is now being made about Sikat-ul-Islam, whereas no voice was raised in protest when foul outrages were committed on Russian soldiers by the Tabreez fedais, supported by the scum of the Caucasus, under the leadership of this very Sikat- ul-Islam. It states that, according to eyewitnesses, the outrages on the Russian troops were too horrible for description. The writer declares that the moderation of the Russian court-martial is sufficiently established by the fact that only fifteen men were condemned, while no fewer than twenty-six were released and pardoned. He protests against the capital which is made by slanderers of Russia of the type of Lord Lamington, Professor Brown, and Mr. Lynch out of the fact that Sikat-ul-Islam was a leading ecclesiastic, and maintains that he and his associates, Sheikh Selim, Sadik-ul-Mulk, and Zia-ul-Ulema, were the chief leaders of the whole anarchist and anti-Russian movement in Tabreez, and were the centre round which the local fedais rallied. The article goes on to state that the charge of having carried out the executions on the Moslem holy day of “ Ashura ” is as false as the charge of the slaughter of women and children. The festival ended at midday, and the executions did not take place till 5 o’clock in the evening, and were fully approved by the populace, who had long suffered at the hands of the fedais and their leaders. It closes with a warning to the Persians and to “ their foolish European instigators ” that no one can be allowed to raise a hand against a Russian soldier with impunity, and that Russia is determined to preserve order on her borders. The above article is evidently inspired, as M. Sazonof held very similar language in the course of the conversation which I had with his Excellency this afternoon. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.

I HAVE received the following telegram from His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz dated yesterday:— “ I am informed by the Kawam, whose son has come back from Fesa, that a mullah called Sheikh Ali Dashti has gone to Borasjun, where he is doing his utmost to create an active anti-foreign league, and that Sheikh Zakerieh, of Laristan, is assembling his men with the avowed intention of advancing on Bunder Abbas. The Kawam states that it has come to his knowledge that telegrams of a very inflammatory nature have been sent to Borasjun from Tehran. Similar telegrams have been addressed to Mohamed Ali Khan, praising the conduct of the Kashkulis in the recent incidents. Kawam promises to show these telegrams to me if he can get copies of them from the Governor of Kazerun. Though the Kawam states that the return of his son from among the tribes was only due to the lack of money (his own force here is also dribbling away), this move seems to me somewhat disquieting.” I have made representations to the Persian Government on the subject of Sheikh Ali Dashti’s inflammatory activity, and urgent instructions have been sent to the Governor of Bushire to do his utmost to check it.

Y 88 ^ 11 Ml “ s . ter for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd ultimo, the course of which M Sazonof informed you that when a formal written engagement respecting the Russian demands had been received from the Persian Government and Mr. Shusters dismissal from the Persian service was an accomplished iact the Russian troops, who were at that time stationed at Kazvin, would be at once ' ca ,- e&lt;: ‘ is Excellency further stated that there was no connection between the question of the recall of these troops and the very serious incidents that had iust occurred m the north. J a these remarks on the part of M. Sazonof, it was with some surprise and disappointment that I read in_ your telegram of the 3rd instant that his xcellency stated that it was quite impossible at present to recall the force from Ivazvm, and that the 1,000 men already withdrawn from that town had only been transferred to strengthen the garrison at Resht. _ I he reasons which have led the Russian Government to decide not to withdraw len troops are doubtless to be found in the disturbances which have occurred in the north and the strong- public feeling in St. Petersburgh, but Tehran has remained -peiteeth quiet throughout, the Persian Government are admittedly not to blame, and ordei has now been restored in Tabreez, so that there does not appear to be any reason why the withdrawal of the troops from Kazvin should not now be proceeded . , You sll ? ul . d fake an opportunity of speaking to M. Sazonof in this sense, but m doing so it is desirable that you should explain the considerations that influence is Majesty s Government in the matter. They have recognised that a Persian Government which pursues a policy hostile to Russian interests cannot be strong. Such a policy leads inevitably to friction and conflict with Russia that must weaken the Persian Government and impair or destroy its authority. All the more is it necessary that a Persian Government, when friendly to Russian interests, should be supported and encouraged. The present Persian Government has complied with the Russian demands and has shown a genuine desire for friendiy relations with Russia; unless there is some response to this attitude and some encouragement is given to the Persian Government, it will not be apparent to the latter or to their subjects that they have anything to gain. A withdrawal of the Russian tioops from Kazvin would give such encouragement; it would justify to the Persians w f ] hf their present Government is doing, and would thereby strengthen its position, and enable it to regain the authority that is essential to the restoration of order m Persia. One. result of the weakness of the Central Government has been a state of anarchy m Southern Persia ; the trade routes are now completely blocked ; it is even doubtful whether inside Shiraz itself foreign lives and property will long be safe. This state of things is very prejudicial to British trade and interests, and makes the re-establishment of Persian authority a matter of great importance to His Majesty’s Government^ As long as the Persian Government were in conflict with the Russian Government it was recognised that no improvement could be expected, but now that this^ unfortunate condition of affairs has ceased, His Majesty’s Government are most anxious that the Russian Government should facilitate every measure necessary to enable the Persian Government to establish its authority and to restore order.

AFTER suitable arrangements had been made for the grant to Zia-ed-Dowleh (whom I reported in my telegram of the 29th December to have taken bast at His Majesty’s consulate at Tabreez) of a safe-conduct through Russia to Tehran, I expressed the hope to the Russian Minister that Russia would not demand any punishment affecting the basti’s life or liberty on his arrival in Tehran. My Russian colleague there upon advised his Government to demand merely that his title should be cancelled. The Russian Government were informed that, unless I received authorisation from you, I could not acquiesce in any punishment affecting basti’s life or liberty. The tone of the reply of the Russian Government shows some annoyance with me, and they threaten to cancel the safe-conduct already accorded to the basti if I persist in my attitude; they would thus be free to deal with him as they please Whenever he quits His Majesty’s consulate. The basti would, in consequence, probably prolong his stay at the consulate indefinitely. The following is my view, and I should be glad to know if you concur in it: The basti should not be discouraged from leaving the consulate and taking his chances at Tehran if, though knowing the attitude of the Russian Government, he is willing to avail himself of the safe-conduct still open to him. In this case our responsibility is at an end when he leaves the consulate ; but we cannot encourage the basti to leave unless we obtain assurances from Russia that no punishment affecting life or liberty will be demanded without a fair trial. I am satisfied that if the cases were reversed, and we had a charge against someone in bast at a Russian consulate, the attitude of the Russian Government would not be more amenable than that which I am adopting in the present case.

IN continuation of my despatch of the 30th December last, I now have the honour to transmit translation of the Regent’s firman of the 23rd December, ordering a general election “ as soon as possible.” It will be seen that the Regent refers in his firman to article 2 of the programme presented to the Medjliss by Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s Cabinet and passed by the House on tire 2nd September (see my despatch of the 5th September, 1911*), in which rnge that the deputies of the next Medjliss should be given a mandate by the country for the revision of the constitution. A species of “referendum” on this PO. m t. 13 therefore being made, but it is hard to imagine how it will be possible, under existing conditions in this country, to determine whether the majority of the electors are for or against the proposed modification of the fundamental laws of 1906 and 1907. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 108. Firman for the New Elections. (Translation.) IN the name of his Most Powerful and Exalted Majesty the King of Kings, Sultan Ahmad Shah Kajar (may God make luminous his State and kingdom). Whereas the parliamentary session of the National Consultative Assembly termi nated on the 23rd Zighedeh (15th November, 1911), in order that no lapse should occur between its expiration and the order for the new elections, with the issue of this firman we notify all those who are entitled to election rights, m accordance with the new law dated the 4th November, 1911, to be prepared to take steps for the election of new deputies. We have also, in conformity with our decree of the 23rd December 1911, given ample instructions to the Ministry of the Interior to take all necessary steps for the good management and execution of the elections and compliance with the important legal points. On this occasion, we deem it necessary to remind the people of the protected provinces that it is of the positive duties of those entitled to vote to thoroughly peruse and study the electoral law, and in giving assistance to each other in compre hending its meaning and points, to refer to their wisdom and conscience, and to know that by means of the votes they give they commit to the charge of their representatives * See “ Persia, No. 3 (1912),” No. 368.46 for the two new parliamentary years the ease and welfare of their own persons as well as the fate and prosperity of the country. Those who can be truly worthy of such important powers will have to be honest persons cognisant with the needs of the nation, competent to perform this ponderous duty, and whose political notions ought to have been made public to, and known by, the electors. In view of the discussions which on the initiative of the Ministers took place in the National Consultative Assembly on the 2nd September, 1911, the Ministers and members deemed it necessary that, by a power to be vested in the members by the nation, they (members) should revise the constitution in the new Medjliss for the organisation of the country; we, therefore, having regard to this question, in accordance with the usage of the fundamental rule of a constitutional Government —namely, the referendum to. the people—notify to all the individuals of the nation, and to those who are to be elected, to have this point in view, that for the deputies of this session this especial power is also observed, so that after the opening of the new Medjliss they should with freedom of decision and with exhaustive study of the question take what steps they may deem advisable. Although in constitutional countries it is an ordinary custom that the date of the beginning of the elections and the date for the opening of the Medjliss are previously appointed and notified by the Government, yet as the elections for this session are in accordance with the law which has been passed by the Medjliss, and as there had been no time to arrange the necessary preliminaries, we have urgently commanded the Ministry of the Interior to take the necessary measures, so that in the electoral centres the preliminaries for the matter should be arranged as soon as possible, and the elections be begun ; and that as soon as the result of the elections should become approximately known, to advise us accordingly of the appointment of the opening day of the new Medjliss. We also direct the deputies who will be elected to leave (may it please God) for Tehran as soon as possible. On this occasion we beseech God Almighty and Most High to bestow beneficent concord and to enlighten the minds of the people by His inspiration. ABUL KASSEM, NASR-UL-MULK. No. 109.

We then proceeded to discuss the question of a loan which M. Sazonow agreed in t inking was one of primary importance. His Excellency was, however, unable to say anything definite on this point until he had talked the matter over with the Minister of . 1 ,fi ext P r °ceeded to speak on the subject of the recall of the Kazvin troops, reminding his Excellency of the assurances which he had formerly given me, and uroing on him the necessity of the two Governments uniting their efforts to restore order by giving the Peisian Government some tangible proof of their support and confidence. I dwelt on the grave situation with which His Majesty’s Government were confronted in the south, and on the serious prejudice that was being caused to our trade there in consequence of the prevailing disorders, which would never have become so acute had it not been for the state of unrest and excitement produced by Pussia’s action in the north. I then read to his Excellency your despatch of the 15th instant. . Sazonof admitted that he had given me the assurances of which I had reminded him, and said that he had no wish to retain the troops at Kazvin a day longer than was necessary, more especially now that there was no question of an advance on Tehran. There had been a decided improvement in the situation, but he could not guarantee that fresh disorders would not break out at one point or another. Only the other day some Russian soldiers had been fired on at Resht; and as long as this danger existed Russian public opinion would not condone the recall of the troops. I suggested that, as everything was quiet at Tehran and Kazvin, they might at any rate be withdrawn to Resht or Tabreez as a first step towards their complete withdrawal when there was no longer any reason to fear the outbreak of fresh disturbances in the north. M. Sazonof seemed to think that it might soon be possible to do this, but said that he could take no decision without first consulting the military authorities. He then went on to say that it would be much easier to explain the recall of the troops to the Russian public if he could at the same time announce that the Persian Government had engaged to indemnify the families of the Russian soldiers who had been killed or seriously wounded during the recent troubles, as soon as the state of their finances permitted of their doing so. I carried away from this conversation the impression that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is most anxious to work loyally with us and to re-establish normal and correct relations with Persia.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

India Office, January 23, 1912. Enclosure in No. 114. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) _ January 23,1912. WE recommend that negotiations should be opened with a view to satisfaction being exacted from those responsible for past incident, and to opening the road by levies of headmen. As a means of associating Persian Government with the scheme, the Swedish officers now reported to be starting for Shiraz might be employed to supervise such levies with assistance of British officers. _ It is necessary, however, that present Khan of Borasjun should be punished before there can be a commencement of negotiations. Persian Government should, we suggest, be at once called upon to depose him formally from Borasjun governorship; if they fail to do this, it will be necessary for us to deal with him ourselves, a course of action in which, owing to khan’s accessibility from the coast, no serious difficulty is involved. # . Restriction of the present free import of arms and ammunition to the tribes is a primary essential to their good behaviour and control in future. It is of imperative necessity, in order to effect this, that Persian littoral should be placed under a strict blockade, on the same lines as that of the coast of Mekran. Arrangements for increasing the stringency of this blockade are already being made by us. The vindication of our position vis-a-vis Persian Government, in regard to lecen incidents, has still to be considered. Desire not to increase Persian Governments[565] E difficulties, and not to create a situation from which withdrawal would be difficult, is to a large extent the basis of our abstention from sending more troops to Shiraz and Shiraz road, or even to Bushire ; it is for consideration, however, whether we should not take steps to exact reparation for recent incidents and cost of measures now proposed from Persian Government.

IT has been ascertained that large supplies of arms and ammunition reach Albida from Muscat, partly by sea and partly by land, and thence come into the hands of the tribes of Luristan and Ears. This accounts to a great extent for the unruliness of these tribes. While the tribes farther to the east and north purchase old rifles, the ammunition for which can be refilled several times with black powder, the Luristan and Ears tribes now chiefly use small-bore rifles of a modern type, and cannot refill their cartridge cases. The ammunition can only reach them by one of the following routes :— 1. Through Turkey, via Bagdad ; 2. Through Russia ; and 3. Across the Persian Gulf. It is not at present possible to send large quantities by either of the first two routes, so that by stopping the supply by the third we ought soon to bring the disturbances by the tribes to an end. The question of the general policy to be adopted was discussed at a conference to-day, and we decided to render blockade as stringent as we are able. No. 116. Sir G.

It should not he forgotten, in considering the position of the ex-Shah, that he no longer has any right to claim a pension at all, and I am of opinion that if the two Governments decide to grant him one they should only do so on obtaining from him some fuller guarantee that he will not return to Persia. He has weakened the Persian Government by his incursion, which cost them considerable sums to check, and has thus made them less able to deal with the disorders in the south, which have consequently increased.

Count Benckendorff said the important thing was to get the ex-Shah out of Persia. He did not deprecate a written undertaking such as I had suggested being required, but it might be that the ex-Shah would refuse to come out of Pers’a with such a condition.

CONVEYS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 1st February :— Sir, In a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 24th of last month 1 spoke to his Excellency in the terms of your telegram of the 23rd ultimo, and impressed on him the importance of placing some proposals before the Persian Government without undue delay. I at the same time informed his Excellency of the report which had reached us that Peshid-es-Sultan was contemplating joining hands with Shuja-ed-Dowleh in making an advance on Tehran. M. Sazonof promised to telegraph at once to the Russian consul-general at Tabreez, instructing him to do all he could to discourage Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and to warn him that if he attempted to advance on Tehran Russia would have nothing more to do with him. Proceeding next to discuss the various points raised in the identic telegram addressed to their respective Governments by Sir G. Barclay and M. Poklewsky, M. Sazonof said that he was quite ready to join His Majesty’s Government in making a communication to the Persian Government on the lines which they had proposed. He had already explained the attitude which he was prepared to adopt with regard to the ex-Shah, and would agree that the grant of a pension should be conditional on his giving an engagement that he would not return to Persia without the consent of the Russian Government. The Russian Government, his Excellency added, would moreover refuse to allow the ex-Shah to establish himself again on Russian territory. It would be better, however, he thought, to leave it to the Persian Government to fix the exact amount of his pension, as they might not be prepared to go to so high a figure as 50,000 tomans.

I have brought this to the notice of the Persian Government, and have urged them to send orders to Mohamed Ali to surrender the arrested men as a step towards reparation. The desire of the Persian Government to effect improvement of Shiraz and Shiraz road is indicated by the impending departure of four Swedish officers for Shiraz, but it is very doubtful whether they will be able to reach that place, and whether, on their arrival, they wall be able to cope with the prevailing anarchy.54 No. 132.

I think we might leave it to the Persian Government to fix the amount of the pension to be granted to the ex-Shah.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 28.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 28, 1912. MY telegram of the 10th January. I learn from M. Mornard that no taxes are coming in to the Treasury ; that he is continually receiving applications for arrears of pay ; and that an advance of 200,0001. is absolutely necessary to enable the Government to carry on until a large loan can be arranged. I think an advance of this amount should, if possible, be made without delay. As a condition, we should insist on the execution of a programme of expenditure, to be drawn up by Mornard, in which a considerable sum would be set apart for the financing of the gendarmerie. In my opinion and in that of Russian Minister, we ought also, without further delay, to acquaint the Persian Government with the conditions on which the British and Russian Governments are willing to advise Mohamed Ali to return to Europe. There is no necessity to postpone this communication until the question of a loan is settled. No. 138. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received January 28.) (Telegraphic.)

Please see my telegram of the 22nd December last.* I have just received the following telegram, dated the 17th January, from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah :— “ Many shots were fired at the consulate on the evening of the 15th January. The Prince denies any complicity in this. I have forty rifles in the consulate, and Azam-ed- Dowleh could obtain more guards. What am I to do in the event of the Persian Government taking no steps ? „ . “The Prince was joined on the 16th January by Sardar Mozaffir with 250 horse : total force is thus about 1,400. Others will follow.

Please see my telegram of the 26th instant. Colonel Douglas informs me that the total value of the property stolen and the animals killed in these two incidents is about 9341. The casualties were three killed, ten wounded, exclusive of Smart, and one missing. Of the ten wounded, three are severely so, and three will probably be permanently disabled. # p 1 would propose that we should claim 4,734/., composed as follows : 1,000/. tor Smart, 300/. for each of the killed, missing, or permanently disabled, and 100/. for each of the other wounded. When forming this estimate I have had m mmd to reduce our demand as far as possible. [565] * See “ Persia, No. 4 (1912),” No. 318.

Our claim should be considered as a first charge on the next loan. No. 140. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edivard Grey. — (Received. January 28.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, January 28, 1912. ON the receipt of Sir G. Barclay’s telegram of the 24th January I addressed a private letter to M. Sazonof, and received a reply in which his Excellency stated that as Mornard had already assumed office it was too late to express our acquiescence in his acting appointment. He added that should M. Mornard prove fitted for the post, he did not propose to raise any objection to the appointment being made a permanent one. In reply to this letter I pointed out that, in taking no notice of the acting appointment of M. Mornard we should be neglecting the principle which the Russian Government had themselves laid down in article 3 of their ultimatum to Persia. In a letter which I have now received, M. Sazonof says that he cannot depart froin what he said in his previous letter, as the position of M. Mornard vis-d-vis the Persian Government would inevitably be weakened by any action such as we propose. ITjs Excellency adds that his attitude in this matter does not constitute any infringement of the principle laid down in the Russian ultimatum, since the two legations at Tehran had themselves put forward M. Mornard’s name. No. 141. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 29.) (Telegraphic.) ^ Tehran, January 29, 1912. YOUR telegram of 27th January : Persian treasury.

(felegiaphic.) ^ St. Petersburgh, January 31, 1912. n yAlArS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 1st February j j r I called on M. Sazonof yesterday to discuss with him the aide-memoire which I had sen mn in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram of the 27th ultimo. J 6After reading over with me this aide-memoire, of which a copy is enclosed, M. Sazonof said that he was to see the President of the Council on Friday and would then discuss with him the question of a temporary advance being made to the Persian Government by Great Britain and Bussia. In the meanwhile, however, our two Ministers at Tehran should advise the Persian Government to enter at once into negotiations with the ex-Shah with regard to his pension. They might at the same time draw up together the text of the communication which the two Governments were to make to the Persian Government on the subject, and might take as a basis for discussion the first paragraph of my aide-memoire down to the words “ principles of the Anglo-Bussian Convention.” He was, his Excellency said, quite ready to act in conformity with the principles which you had laid down ; but there were certain slight modifications which he would like to see introduced into the text of the aide -memoir e. He objected, for example, to such phrases as “ seems to preclude the recognition of the ex-Shah and c&lt; they would not recognise him ” ; but it would be quite easy to alter the text without compromising the attainment of the object which you had in view. Ihe two Ministers would communicate the text to the Persian Government as soon as it was agreed upon, and might at the same time inform them that the two Govern ments were consulting together as to the best means of affording them financial assistance. In addition to this official communication to the Government at Tehran, we might tell Mohamed Ali privately that his cause was hopeless, that His Majesty’s Government would never recognise him, and that he must therefore leave the country. In the subsequent course of our conversation M. Sazonof informed me that he was about to address me a note, which was only awaiting the approval of the President of the Council, laying down the conditions on which the Russian Government were ready to co-operate with and to support the Persian Government, and giving a general outline of their policy with regard to Persia. In addition to the conditions referred to in the identic telegrams of Sir George Barclay and M. Poklewsky, his Excellency mentioned two others, namely, the strengthening of the Cossack Brigade and its employment at any point in North Persia where its services might be required ; and the postpone ment of the meeting of the Medjliss till it had been possible to constitute a Senate which should assemble at the same time as the Medjliss. The object of the first of these two conditions was, M. Sazonof explained, to enable the Russian Government eventually to withdraw their troops from Tabreez. Enclosure in No. 143. Aide-memoire. HIS Majesty’s Government agree with the view recently expressed by the representatives of the two Powers at Tehran to the effect that the result of the pourparlers which have taken place between the Imperial Government and the British Government seems to preclude the recognition of the ex-Shah, and that therefore, if the two Powers intervene, it must be on the side of the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Government would accordingly propose to adopt the suggestion of the two Ministers that the two Governments should offer to the Persian Government on certain conditions to inform the ex-Shah that they would not recognise him and to advise him to return to Europe. The conditions would be the grant to the ex-Shah of a suitable pension (the amount of which could be left to the Persian Government to fix), the proclamation ot a general amnesty, and the more important condition of some form of engagement on the part of the Persian Government binding them to conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Although the present Persian Cabinet seems disposed to conform to those principles, the contingency of its resigning must be reckoned with, and, moreover, the two Powers will eventually have to count with the Medjliss.^ It would therefore be very desirable to obtain an express engagement that the Persian Government will do nothing to injure British or Russian interests, or an engagement to such effect. The Persian Government should at the same time be urged to dismiss their irregular forces (fedais) which, when the ex-Shah has left Persia, will be no longer needed and will merely be a source of trouble. His Majesty’s Government is further of opinion that, pending discussions as to a loan to the Persian Government and as to the financial institutions to which the negotiation of such a loan should be entrusted, it would be of advantage that the two Governments should make an advance of 200,000h each on the condition suggested by the two representatives that the proceeds58 will be spent under the supervision of the Persian treasurer-general, and that a large portion thereof be earmarked for the expenses of the gendarmerie. The sum of 200,000/. advanced by the British Government would have to be used by the Persian Government for the purpose of restoring order on the southern roads of Persia.

CONVEYS the substance of the following despatch, dated the lith February :— I have the honour to forward herewith a proposed scheme of organisation for the Persian Government gendarmerie, which I have received from Colonel Hjalmarson. Colonel Hjalmarson has also communicated to me various proposals in regard to the financing and distribution of the gendarmerie, of which the following are the more important:— The estimate for the first twelve months amounts to 55,0001., and for the succeeding nine months to 70,0001. The budget only provides for the establishment of permanent posts along the following main roads :— In the north, (a) Enzeli-Kazvin-Tehran-Kum.; (b) Kazvin-Zinjan-Serehend. In the south, Bushire-Shiraz-Yezdikhast. In Pars it is proposed to raise a battalion, 1,500 strong, with head-quarters at Shiraz, for the protection of the Bushire-Shiraz-Yezdikhast road. It is hoped that by the end of the first twelve months posts will have been established from Shiraz as far as Kunar Takhteh (35 miles south-west of Kazerun) to the south, and Bagh-i-Khan (12 miles north of Shiraz) to the north. During the succeeding nine months the intention is to extend these posts south ward to Bushire and northward to Yezdikhast.61 (Translation.) ARTICLE 1. The gendarmerie will be organised—- (a.) Into groups forming a stationary force of gendarmerie, and (b.) Into mobile corps. Art. 2. The gendarmerie is attached to the provinces and to their sub-divisions. In certain provinces the entire gendarmerie, mounted and unmounted, constitutes a single regiment; in others there are several regiments. In the small provinces the gendarmerie only constitutes a battalion. (Even in the large provinces the gendarmerie only constitutes a battalion at first, but latter it will form a regiment.) Art. 3. The stationary force is composed of groups of gendarmes, of varying strength, stationed along the roads and maintaining permanent communication with each other. For the purpose of the organisation of this force the roads are divided into sectors. Each sector will be watched by a section or a half section, the strength of which is divided between a head-quarters and a certain number of small posts. The strength of the section (half section) is of three degrees. Different degrees are utilised in accordance with the difficulties expected in the various provinces. Several sections or half sections are combined into a company-district; one of the section head-quarters, generally that of the central section, is also the head-quarters of the company. Several company-districts form a battalion-district having a battalion head-quarters. Battalion-districts form the regiments mentioned above. Where all the battalions of a province form a single regiment, the regimental head-quarters is generally situated in the town in which the governor of the province resides. Where the provincial battalions form several regiments, the regimental head quarters will be in different parts of the province. Art. 4. The number of sections and half sections is variable, and depends on the size of the company, the extent of its district, &amp;c. The number of companies in a battalion, and the number of battalions, are also variable, and depend on the same conditions as those which determine the number of sections and half sections in a company. The arrangement of the sections and half sections in small posts is the basis of the whole organisation of the stationary force, since the entire service of an efficient gendarmerie rests on the institution of these posts. Art. 5. The mobile corps will be employed in making expeditions to the localities in which the stationary force is unable to bring about order and tranquillity. The mobile corps are composed of— (a.) Gendarmes (including officers and non-commission officers) taken from one or more districts to form provisional mobile corps; or, (b.) Permanent mobile corps of gendarmerie, organised and trained just like soldiers. The provisional mobile corps may serve outside their province only in exceptional cases and by the order of the Imperial Government. In organising these provisional corps a sufficient force will always te left to ensure the adequate performance of ordinary duties; thus neither the head-quarters nor the small posts must be entirely deprived of their whole strength. The permanent mobile corps of the gendarmerie will be quartered at central points. They will not serve outside their province except by order of the Imperial Government. It depends on circumstances (the extent of the undertaking, the object of the expedition, the distance, &amp;c.) whether the provisional or permanent corps are to be employed. The stationary force must, as far as possible, be left intact.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received February 2.) (Telegraphic ) Tehran, February 2, 1912.

JOINT proposals. Your telegram of 31st January. . v The state of affairs in Persia makes it very important that no time should be lost by the two Governments in authorising their respective Ministers at Tehran to submit to the Persian Government proposals as follows :— 1. The two Governments will together advance 200,0001. (100,000Z. from each Government^ to the Persian Government. Of this sum, which is designed to meet the most pressing needs, the 100,0001. advanced by His Majesty s Government is to be assigned to the organisation of the gendarmerie force in Southern Persia^ The treasurer-general is to supervise the expenditure of the whole advance. His Majesty s * Government have no objection to each Government advancing 200,0001. instead of 100,0001. if the two Ministers consider it advisable. 2. A communication, the wording of which may be arranged by the two Ministers as proposed by the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be addressed to the Persian Government informing them that neither Government will in any way assist or encourage the ex-Shah or any of his followers, and that the ex-Shah himself will he asked to leave Persia. His pension is to be of the amount already decided upon, and its grant is conditional on his undertaking never to re-enter Persian territory unless the Russian Government first give their consent. 3. The two Ministers will suggest the proclamation of a general amnesty and the dismissal by the Persian Government of the fedais as soon as Mohamed Ali is out of Persia. 4. The question of the formation of a small Persian army may be discussed with the Persian Government by the two Ministers. 5. The Persian Government to be asked to undertake to make their policy conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian Convention. A formula to be drawn up to this effect, the w r ording of which is left to the two Ministers. If all the further questions relating to Cossack brigade, large loan, and Senate are discussed before the Persian Government receive, any help, the state of Persia will, in the meantime, deteriorate even further, so I hope you will be able to persuade M. Sazonof to instruct M. Poklewsky at once to proceed on the lines above indicated. * * No. 155. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received, February 3.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 3, 1912.

(In this connection please see my telegram of the 2nd instant.) I therefore question whether it would be wise to insist on 100,000^. being allocated lor the gendarmerie in the south. I would suggest that the Pussian Minister and myself should be allowed to decide on the allocation of the advance in consultation with the Acting Treasurer-General. No. 158. Foreign Office to India Office. Si r? Foreign Office, February 3, 1912, I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer to previous correspondence relative to the proposed advance to the Persian Government by His Majesty’s and the Pussian Governments of a sum of 400,0001., and particularly to the last paragraph of your letter of the 29th July, 1907, stating that there would be no difiiculty, should occasion arise, in providing at a very few days’ notice any sums which it may be decided to advance on this account in pursuance of the agreement with the Russian Government. The Marquess of Crewe is aware, from telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Peters burgh and Minister at Tehran, that the present financial situation of the Persian Government and the state of affairs in the country generally, have once more brought this question prominently forward, and that the advisability of an immediate advance to Persia is under the consideration of both Governments. I am to transmit to you herewith copy of a telegram* which Sir E. Grey has addressed to Sir G. Buchanan on this subject, and to inform you that, as soon as the assent of the Russian Government is received to the suggestions therein contained, a further letter will be addressed to you asking that half of the British share of the64 advance, whicli may amount to 200,000£. in all, or to 100,000Z. only, may be accepted as a charge on Indian revenues in accordance with the arrangement already arrived at.

Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 4.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 4, 1912. CONVEYS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 1th February: — Sir, On the receipt of your telegram of the 2nd instant I called by appointment on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but as his Excellency was too pressed for time to be able to discuss in detail the various points to be comprised in the joint communication to be addressed to the Persian Government, I left with him an aide-memoire embodying your proposals, of which a copy is enclosed. M. Sazonof, however, told me that he had already instructed M. Poklewsky to concert with Sir G. Barclay the text of a joint communication to be addressed to the Persian Government, advising them to enter into negotiations with the ex-Shah with the object of inducing him to leave Persia in return for the grant of a pension and the proclamation of a general amnesty. He could not, he said, accept the condition which you proposed to attach to the grant of a pension, namely, that the ex-Shah should promise not to return to Persia without Russia’s consent. On my reminding his Excellency that he had already (as reported in my telegram of the 24th January) accepted this condition, M. Sazonof replied that as the Russian Government were not going to allow the ex-Shah to settle in Russia they could not assume the responsibility which such a condition would entail, more especially as they did not wish to expose themselves a second time to being accused of conniving at hrs return. Referring next to the question of the proposed advance, M. Sazonof informed me that the Minister of Finance had refused to advance so large a sum as 200,0001. to the Persian Government. M. Kokovtsof, his Excellency said, contended that he was not empowered by law to authorise advances of this nature. The Russian Bank at Tehran had, moreover, been losing money, and M. Kokovtsof was averse to running any further financial risk. I urged on M. Sazonof the necessity of our coming to the assistance of the Persian Government, who were absolutely penniless, and reminded him of^ the agreement arrived at between the two Governments in the year 1910 to make a joint advance of 400,0001. to the Persian Government. His Excellency assured me that he was most anxious to do all that he could to help them. He had, he said, already instructed M. Isvolsky to sound the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas as to whether they would be prepared at an early date to make any advances to the Persian Govern ment in connection with the projected large loan ; as, were they to give a satisfactory assurance on this point, M. Kokovtsof would consider it a sufficient guarantee, and would agree to advance the sum required temporarily. I pressed M. Sazonof to write at once to M. Kokovtsof, and to endeavour to obtain his consent to an advance of at any rate 100,0001. to meet the immediate requirements of the Persian Government; and this his Excellency promised to do. M. Sazonof was at first inclined to insist that no advance should be made to the65 Persian Government until the latter had accepted the various conditions which the Russian Government piopose to attach to their future co-operation with and support of that Government. I pointed out that the discussion of all these conditions would occupy weeks or months, and that something 1 ought to be done at once to ease the financial embarrassments of the Persian Government; and his Excellency finally agreed not to make the first advance dependent on the acceptance of these conditions. He would, however, hedeclaied, have to insist that an agreement should be arrived at with regard to them before any further advances were made, and before the arrangements for a large loan should be carried through. Enclosure in No. 160. Aide-memoire. IN view of the present situation in Persia, His Britannic Majesty’s Government consider it of great importance that the Russian and British Ministers at Tehran should be authorised without delay to make the following proposals to the Persian Govern ment :— 1. In order to meet the immediate requirements of the Persian Government, Russia and Great Britain will advance conjointly the sum of 200,000L, the expenditure of this sum to be supervised by the Treasurer-General, and the British share of 100,000L to be devoted to the organisation of a gendarmerie in South Persia. His Britannic Majesty’s Government would not object to an advance of 200,000/. by each Power, should the two representatives at Tehran consider this necessary. 2. That the two Ministers should inform the Persian Government that Mohamed Ali will be requested to remove himself from Persia, and that neither Russia nor Great Britain will afford any encouragement or support to His Majesty or to any of his adherents. His Britannic Majesty’s Government agree to his Excellency M. Sazonof’s suggestion that the drafting of the text of the communication on this point might be left to the two representatives at Tehran, the amount of the pension to be fixed by arrangement between the Persian Government and the ex-Shah, and the condition on which it was granted being, as already arranged, that His Majesty should promise not to enter Persian territory without the consent of the Russian Govern ment. 3. That the two Ministers should propose to the Persian Government the proclamation of a general amnesty and that the Persian Government should dismiss their irregular forces when Mohamed Ali has left Persian territory. 4. That the two Ministers should express to the Persian Government their readiness to discuss with them a scheme for the creation of a small Persian army. 5. That the two Ministers should request the Persian Government to give an engagement to conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian convention of 1907. The form of this request should be left to the discretion of the two Ministers. His Britannic Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the situation will go from bad to worse unless support is given to the Persian Government without further delay. They therefore earnestly trust that the Imperial Government will consent to send instructions to M. Poklewsky, explaining that all other questions, such as that of the Cossack Brigade, the Senate, and the conclusion of a loan should be left for consideration later on.

Poklewsky to urge the Persian Government, in concert with me, to open negotiations with Mohamed Ali Mirza, with a view to inducing His Majesty to leave Persia, on the understanding that his pension will be renewed and that his adherents will be granted full amnesty. _ Russian Minister is authorised to inform the Persian Government that these negotiations will, n they so desire it, be carried on through the Russian consul at Astrabad, who will be instructed to advise the ex-Shah to agree to the terms proposed, pointing out to His Majesty that his cause is hopeless, and that he will never be recognised by His Majesty s Government, and that both England and Russia will afford the Persian Government their material and moral support. Should these arguments not prove sufficient, Russian consul would endeavour to remove the Caucasians in the service of Mohamed Ali, and to persuade the Turkomans to accept the amnesty and submit to the Central Government. As it is very important that some pronouncement should be made as soon^ as possible, I venture to hope that I may be authorised, should any delay occur in obtaining the acquiescence of the Russian Government to the proposals set forth in your above- mentioned telegram, to concert with Russian Minister in the communication he has been instructed to make to the Persian Government. M. Poklewsky’s instructions, however, contain no mention of any undertaking on the part of the ex-Shah not to re-enter Persia without the consent of the Russian Government. I understand that the amount of the pension would be settled by negotiation between the Persian Government and Mohamed Ali Mirza. No. 164. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 5.)

THE Russian Ambassador called on the 30th ultimo to enquire on behalf of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs the views of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the proposed loan to Persia. Sir A. Nicolson said that discussions as to a large loan could very well be deferred for the moment; what was really pressing was that the two Ministers at Tehran should be authorised to place before the Persian Government this modest programme of urgent reforms, and especially the warning to the ex-Shah. Moreover, it was urgently necessary that the Persian Government should be provided with some funds, and for that object His Majesty’s Government had suggested the revival of the original joint offer of an advance of 200,000L from each Government. These advances could be repaid out of a future loan, but Sir A. Nicolson trusted that the Russian Government would agree to the two Ministers at Tehran setting to work without delay on Ihe above lines, and that the Russian President of the Council would sanction the advance of 200,000L on the part of the Russian Government. Count Benckendorff said that he would telegraph to M. Sazonof. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 168. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 6.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 6, 1912.

No. 171. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 7, 1912. YOUR telegram of 5th February: Communication to Persian Government as to ex-Shah. Russian Minister and I made yesterday to the Regent and the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggestion indicated in my telegram of 5th February, leaving aide-memoire with Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Highness and his Excellency expressed the gratitude of the Persian Government for the suggestion, and accepted the intervention of the Russian consul at Astrabad. Minister for Foreign Affairs at first proposed 36,000 tomans as amount of pension, but we pointed out that a more generous offer would facilitate negotiations. Finally it was decided to offer a maximum of 50,000 tomans, and Russian Minister is instructing consul to negotiate on basis of this amount and of a full amnesty, and to act as generally indicated in my telegram of 5th February. Minister for Foreign Affairs pressed hard for a guarantee from the two Powers that they would never recognise the ex-Shah, but, finding that we were not authorised to give this, and realising that reference to our Governments on this point would entail delay, he refrained from insisting on it as a sine qua non for negotiations, while expressing the earnest hope that the two Governments would consent to give such a guarantee. The treatment of Shoa-es-Sultaneh and Salar-ed-Dowleh was also discussed. Minister for Foreign Affairs wished to maintain the confiscation of the former’s estates, and to give him a small pension. But we pointed out that this would not accord with grant of a full amnesty, and, moreover, that as Shoa-es-Sultaneh was with the ex-Shah, and had great influence, it would be well to treat him generously. His Excellency agreed to revoke confiscations of his estates instead of small pension. It was decided to negotiate with Salar-ed-Dowleh, offering him revocation of confiscation of his estates, and, as he is very poor, to grant him and his family pension of 12,000 tomans, provided that he maintains order at Kermanshah till the governor arrives, and then hands over to the latter and leaves Persia. Minister for Foreign Affairs asked that our consuls might negotiate for Persian Government on these lines.

CONVEYS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 7th February :— On my calling on M. Sazonof this afternoon to execute the instructions conveyed to me in your telegram of the 6th instant, his Excellency informed me that he had obtained M. Kokovtsofs consent to a joint advance of 200,000L on the condition that the Russian share of 100,000Z. should not be paid in until His Majesty’s Government had advanced their share. He would, he said, attach no conditions to this advance beyond those included in the five proposals recorded in my aide-memoire of the 3rd February ; and he had already informed M. Poklewsky by telegraph that he considered those proposals quite acceptable, though he had requested his views with regard to them as a matter of form. It must, however, he said, be understood that an agreement would have to be come to with regard to those conditions which Russia still wished to put forward before the arrangements for a large loan were completed. In the course of our conversation M. Sazonof informed me that orders had been already sent to withdraw the Russian troops from Kazvin to Resht. No. 175. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received February 8.) Sir* t India Office, February 7, 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 3rd February, 1912, regarding a proposed Anglo- Russian advance to the Persian Government, amounting to 400,000Z., or 200,000Z., as may hereafter be settled with the Russian Government. In reply I am to inform you that in view of the undertakings given in the past in somewffiat similar circumstances the Secretary of State in Council is prepared to participate in the moiety of the advance to be made by His Majesty’s Government which, as he observes, is of a temporary character and to be repaid as soon as a larger loan is arranged by the Persian Government. The main object of this moiety of the advance is stated to be to put the Persian Government in a better position for maintain ing security on the roads of Southern Persia. On learning that the sum of 100,000Z., or 50,000Z., as the case may be, has been paid by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, the Secretary of State will cause a like amount to be transferred to the Imperial Bank of Persia, through whose agency, he presumes, the advance will be made as on former occasions. In view of the exceptional circumstances on account of which the advance is proposed, the Secretary of State in Council is willing that the questions of security and interest shall be postponed until His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government have had the opportunity of considering them further.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 8.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 8, 1912. CONVEYS the substance of the following despatch, dated the Sth February :— Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a communique from the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as published in the “Official Messenger” to-day, stating that it has been found necessary to send troops to Astrabad, Barfrush, and Meshedesser to protect the lives and property of Russian subjects in these districts. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 178. Communique. THE Russian consul at Astrabad has notified an outbreak of serious disorder in the province of Mazanderan, which has given rise to the committal of murders and acts of pillaging. The local authorities appeared to be helpless and unable to take any measures, and absolute anarchy commenced in the district, being further increased by the locality in question being the arena of the struggle between the ex-Shah Mohamed Ali and the supporters of the Government. Much disorder and indiscipline prevails amongst the forces of the Shah, and the Turkomans and other adherents of the Shah are only with difficulty restrained from pillaging the towns of Barfrush and Sari. The result of this state of affairs has been a complete cessation of local trade and wholesale bast by merchants, in fear of their lives, at the consular agency in Barfrush. In view of the evident danger for the lives and property of Russian subjects, and also for the interests of our institutions there, the consul, considering the troops at his disposal (two sotnias of Cossacks with two machine guns) insufficient, begged the urgent dispatch of reinforcements. Simultaneously, representatives of several large Moscow firms carrying on trade with Mazanderan telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soliciting the defence of their interests. In view of the above, the necessary instructions have been given for the dispatch to Astrabad of two companies of infantry with two machine guns and two mountain guns, of one company with two machine guns to Barfrush, and one company to Meshedesser.71 No. 179. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. F 4 [565] (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 8, 1912. YOUR telegram of 7th February. I agree to proposal to negotiate with Salar-ed-Dowleh through consuls at Kerman shah. No. 180. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. Sir, Foreign Office, February 8, 1912. COUNT BENOKENDORFF told me to-day that the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Kazvin would soon be accomplished—half of them would be returned to Russia and the other half would go to Ardebil and Resht. I said that I was very glad to hear this. It was also a relief that a warning was to be given to the ex-Shah to leave Persia. His incursion had drawn away the Bakhtiari forces from the south ; the whole resources of the Persian Government had been taken up by the struggle against him, owing to the fear that his return to the throne would be followed by a series of reprisals ; and one result had been the blocking of the southern roads and the stopping of British trade. We therefore had good reason to resent the action of the ex-Shah. As long as there had been in Tehran a Government not favourable to Russian interests in the north, I had felt that I could not support that Government, or expect Russia to do so. But now that this obstacle had been removed, and there was a Government who realised that they must respect Russian interests in the north and accept advice, the Government ought to be encouraged and supported. It was only by showing that such a Government could keep upon their feet, and would receive goodwill and support, that their authority could be maintained in Persia. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 181. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received February 9.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 9, 1912. ADVANCE to Persian Government. Please see telegram of the 7th February from His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh. Russian Government have informed my colleague that they have no objection to a joint advance of 200,0001. on the conditions indicated in the five paragraphs of your telegram of the 2nd February to St. Petersburgh, but they insist that the advance shall be made in portions, according to the requirements of the Persian Government. I understand that they also insist that no portion of the Russian share of the advance shall be paid until the corresponding British share has been paid. They also look to obtaining 8 per cent, interest. The method of payment of the advance in small doles 'pari passu by the two Governments appears to me to be a clumsy arrangement. Russian Government also insist that the expenditure of the advance be controlled ; they do not say, however, who is to exercise this control. Their intention presumably is that the two legations should do so, but my own view is that it would be sufficient if the treasurer-general supervised the expenditure on the lines of a programme elaborated by himself in consultation with the two legations. ■72 No. 182. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 9.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 9, 1912. MY telegram of the 8th February. I told M. Sazonof that I regretted that it had been thought necessary to dispatch another Russian force to North Persia, and his Excellency replied that the Government had been forced to take this step in consequence of the urgent appeals of Russian subjects. Incidents such as those which had occurred at Tabreez must be prevented at all hazards, as in the event of any disturbances of a serious nature occurring he would be powerless to resist the pressure in favour of a permanent Russian occupation of certain districts. The maintenence of order must somehow be secured, and the best way to secure it was to send small bodies of Russian troops to the places where trouble threatened, and to withdraw them as soon as there was no longer any necessity for their presence. He did not know exactly the number of men that was being sent to Mazanderan, but he believed that it did not much exceed 300. The figures given in my telegram of yesterday were much exaggerated, as the companies sent were not at war strength. No. 183. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 9.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 9, 1912. I SAW the Persian Minister yesterday. He asked whether it would not be possible for me to urge the Russian Government to join His Majesty’s Government in giving a guarantee that, in the event of the ex-Shah returning to Persia, neither Government would recognise him. He considered it most important that His Majesty should be discouraged from making any attempt to return. I explained to the Minister that M. Sazonof had already refused more than once to give any such guarantee, and had even declined to attach to the grant of a pension to the ex-Shah the condition that His Majesty should give a written engagement that he would not return to Persia without the Russian Government’s consent. I said that the Russian Government might view the matter in a different light if the Persian Government were themselves to extract from the ex-Shah an undertaking not to return without the consent of Russia and Great Britain. At the same time I pointed out that an engagement of the nature indicated was scarcely likely to prevent His Majesty from breaking his word again. I saw M. Sazonof this morning and repeated to him the substance of the above conversation. He said that he would have no objection to the ex-Shah giving such a promise, but that it must be clearly shown that the Russian Government had not intervened in the matter, and that the Persian Government had induced His Majesty to give it by their own unaided efforts. No. 184. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, Februanj 9, 1912. SIR G. BUCHANAN’S telegram of the 7th February. A sum of IOOjQOOZ. is being placed to your credit by His Majesty’s Government to-day at the Imperial Bank. This sum forms the British half of the joint advance, and so much of it as can reasonably be spared should be assigned directly to the organisation of the gendarmerie in South Persia. I propose, subject to the concurrence of the Russian Government, that interest on the whole 200,000Z. should be at 5 per cent. The advance should be secured as an additional charge on the southern customs or on any other revenues available. It should eventually be repaid out of the first proceeds of the large loan which it is proposed to arrange.The Russian Government having now signified their agreement with the five points of my telegram of the 2nd February to St. Petersburg!], you may, in conjunction with M.

My telegram of last night will show you that the making of an advance is regarded by the Russian Government as conditional on the points indicated in the five paragraphs of your telegram of the 2nd February to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh; we may have some difficulty in obtaining compliance with the fifth. The wording of our communication to the Persian Government must depend on whether this view is maintained, or whether it is intended to treat the questions of dismissal of fedais, army, and recognition of the convention as separate from the advance, and to make the advance subject only to conditions regarding security, interest, and proper expenditure. My Russian colleague and I propose, as regards the formula for point five, to request the Persian Government “ to undertake to conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian convention,” and I think that we ought at least to make this or some other undertaking in the same sense a precedent condition, although there may be difficulty in obtaining it.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 12.) g[ r Tehran, January 17, 1912. IN continuation of my despatch of the 21st ultimo, I have the honour to report that the force of the ex-Shah, which was stated in that despatch to have advanced as far as Semnan, has been compelled to retire. It was defeated at Damghan on the 2nd January by a force of Mujaheds under Momtasser-ed-Dowleh, who are now reported to have reoccupied Shahrud. From the west the news is confirmed that Salar-ed-Dowleh has reoccupied Kermanshah. His Majesty’s consul reports that he has about a thousand men with him, and that he intends in the spring to collect further forces and to make another attempt to reach the capital. Shuja-ed-Dowleh has taken advantage of the Russian occupation to enter Tabreez. He made his entry on the 2nd January with 200 men, and is now apparently de facto governor. It is satisfactory to note that Shuja-ed-Dowleh has been prevented by the Russian consul from proclaiming Mohained Ali. Russia seems to be loyally acting up to her assurances that her military measures in Persia have no connection with Mohamed Alls aspirations to the throne. In my despatch above referred to I reported that the Persian Government had information that Shuja-ed-Dowleh had sent a force to Ardebil whence it was threatening Resht. That force, consisting of 150 Shahsevans, arrived at Enzeli on the 13th instant under a certain Reshid-es-Sultan, but the Russian consul at Resht, under orders from St. Petersburgh, caused them to he disarmed and shipped back to Astara, whence they had come. Reports, too, from Meshed show that recruits enrolled by Mohamed Ali’s agents at Askabad are now being stopped by the Russian authorities from entering Persia. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 190. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 12.) Sir, Tehran^ January 19, 1912. EXCEPT for one or two trifling demonstrations immediately following the dissolution of the Medjliss on the 14th ultimo, the past four weeks have been a period of unusual calm in Tehran. My apprehensions and those of the Cabinet as to the effect of the execution at Tabreez of Sikat-ul-Islam on the 10th of Moharrem—the Good Friday of the Mahometan year—have proved to have been exaggerated. The Government appears to have the situation in Tehran well in hand, and no particular effervescence as a consequence of this prelate’s execution has made itself felt in the provinces, a fact due doubtless to the rigorous fashion in which the Government have recently suppressed inflammatory telegrams. I gather that the Government intend to postpone the elections for the new Medjhss as long as possible, and indeed now that Tabreez, the centre of nationalism, is so completely in Russian hands, there seems little likelihood of any irresistible pressure being put upon the Government to facilitate the meeting of Parliament.

MR SHUSTER was informed by the Cabinet on the 26th December that the Persian Government having accepted the Russian ultimatum his services were no longer required. Mr. Shuster left Tehran on the 11th January, and M. Mornard, the administrator-general of customs, was appointed as acting treasurer-general, to date from the 6th January, though he did not actually take over until the 11th January. The treasury gendarmerie was transferred to the Swedish officers on the 9th January. Mr. Cairns and the other American officials formerly under Mr. Shuster are still in Tehran, but they are not likely to stay. The Cabinet. The Cabinet, which is so far unchanged, seems to have the situation well in hand. The news of the execution of the chief priest of Tabreez by the Russians on the 1st January seemed at one moment to threaten the resignation of the Cabinet and a recrudescence of disorders in the capital, coinciding as it did with the 10th of Moharrem, the great Moslem day of mourning, but nothing of the kind occurred. The Press. The local press has practically all disappeared since the closure of the Medjliss. The democratic organs were suppressed owing to their criticism of the Government, and eventually the “Medjliss” newspaper was suppressed for reproducing an inflammatory telegram from the ulema of Nejef, urging the tribes to resist foreign aggression. An official organ called the “ Aftab ” has now appeared. Tabreez. During the fighting from the 21st to the 24th December the Russians made little headway against the revolutionaries, who had taken up a position in the citadel. The Russian consulate-general was practically isolated throughout, and was frequently attacked. There was no firing on the 25th, and communication was established between the Russian consulate and the military commander. On the 26th December Russian reinforcements, strength about 800 men with four guns, arrived, with the result that on the following day the fedais evacuated the citadel and dispersed. General Yoredonof arrived with two regiments of infantry on the 30th Dee'ember and took possession of the town. On the 1st January seven leading nationalist and the Sikat-ul-Islam, a greatly revered Mujtehed, were tried by court-martial and executed, and on the 20th January a prominent Armenian, Petros Melik Audressian, of Tabreez, met with similar treatment. At the time of writing the Russians are in complete possession of the town, the bazaars are open, and the population who took no part in the recent fighting are showing a general desire for peace. The Russian consul-general reports one officer and thirty-nine men killed, and five officers and forty-five men wounded, and accuses the fedais of mutilating the dead and torturing the wounded. The charges of general inhumanity brought against the Russian troops by the Persian authorities are false. To avoid further responsibility, Zia-ed-Dowleh, the acting governor, has taken refuge in the British consulate. Shuja-ed-Dowleh arrived in the town on the 2nd January with some 200 followers.The inhabitants welcomed his arrival as there was no one else capable of carrying out the duties of governor. The approximate strength of the Russian troops in Azerbaijan is as under :— At Tabreez ,, Marand „ Ardebil 3.000 men with 14 guns. 1.000 „ 4 „ 1,000 men. Total 5,000 men with 18 guns. Ghilan and Mazanderan. Since the 21st December there have been no further disturbances at Resht. His Majesty’s vice-consul at Resht reports that the ex-Shah, with a following of 350 men, is still at Khoja Nafas. At Resht the bazaars are gradually opening, but all Government offices, excepting the post and telegraph offices, are closed. The search for arms and for persons wanted by the Russian authorities continues. About a dozen Persian notables were arrested and deported to Russia, but the Russian authorities sent them back to Resht to be tried by court-martial. Reshid-es-Sultan, an adherent of the ex-Shah, arrived at Enzeli on the 13th January with 153 Shahsevan sowars. They were disarmed by the Russians and subsequently sent back to Astara, whence they had come. The Russian troops at Enzeli and Resht have been reinforced from Kazvin, and now number about 2,000 men with fourteen machine guns. At Kazvin there are 2,500 men with eight guns. Meshed. The town is reported to be quiet, but the feeling against the Russians and ourselves still continues. The ex-Shah’s followers were defeated at Damghan on the 3rd January by a force of 900 nondescript sowars, and fell back to an entrenched position midway between Damghan and Shahrud. The Government troops advanced from Damghan towards Shahrud on the 9th January. Recruiting for the ex-Shah has been proceeding at Askhabad. He also has agents at Krasnovodsk, but according to latest information the Russians are turning back recruits. In addition to consular guards, there are some 2,500 Russian troops with eight guns and fifteen machine guns in Khorassan. Ispahan. The anti-foreign demonstrations have had little or no effect on foreign trade. Several robberies are reported in the environs and district. The number of villagers who have been driven by their misfortunes to take to the road is increasing. Sardar Zafar has been appointed Governor-General of Ispahan, but has not yet left Tehran. Sardar Ashja, the retiring governor, left Ispahan on the 14th January for Chaharmahak. Sardar Fateh (Moin-i-Homayun), Sardar Ashja’s brother, arrived on the 25th December with 200 men and two mountain guns. He informed His Majesty’s consul-general that he had failed in his efforts to catch Naib Hussein, who had escaped to Biabanek, where he could not pursue him. Sardar Fateh left Ispahan with his brother on the 14th January. Yezd. Amir Azam, the Governor of Kerman, proceeded to Taft at the end of December to punish the “ lootis ” who have been responsible for so many robberies in his district. He inflicted some loss on them and pillaged their quarters in Taft, but the “ looti ” leaders managed to escape. The financial situation is most unsatisfactory. Owing to the insecurity of the roads the Imperial Bank of Persia has been unable to obtain cash from outside for some months, and its reserve has fallen so low that it has been obliged to restrict business.80 Shiraz. On the 24th December a party of fifty men of the Central India Horse, under Major Birdwood, proceeding from Shiraz to Kazerun to meet a similar party escorting Mr'. Smart from Bushire, was attacked near Kotal Dokhtar and lost one man killed and one man wounded. On the 26th December these parties met near Rahdar caravanserai, and were leaving the precincts of that place when the caravanserai tofangchis opened fire on them. The troops had to fight their way into Kazerun, armed men coming out of the villages en route and joining in the attack. Mr. Smart was wounded early in the engagement, and it was only discovered that he was missing when his horse came galloping in to join the convoy. A hospital assistant who was wounded was also left behind. Mohamed Ali Khan Kashkuli, in charge of the Kazerun section of the road, had Mr. Smart and the wounded hospital assistant taken to his camp at Shahpur and attended to by a Persian surgeon. He brought them into Kazerun on the 29th December. The casualties in this action were : killed, two followers ; missing, one follower; wounded, Mr. Smart, the hospital assistant, seven sowars, and one follower. On receipt of the news of the first affair Colonel Douglas dispatched a party of fifty men to Dashtarjin, and on hearing of the second attack he himself left Shiraz on the 27th December with 100 men for Dashtarjin and Kotal Dokhtar. On the 2nd January Major Birdwood’s party, with all its wounded, joined Colonel Douglas at Kotal Dokhtar, and the whole force returned to Shiraz without any further incident, arriving on the 5th January. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has been appointed Governor-General of Pars, but has not yet left Tehran. In the meantime Kawam-ul-Mulk continues to be deputy governor, and order has been maintained at Shiraz. Seistan. The crisis in Northern Persia has not affected Seistan and Kain. According to latest reports the roads were safe as far as British merchandise was concerned. Kerman. The town of Kerman is reported quiet. Rifat-i-Nizam continues in his attempts to alienate men employed by the telegraph department. Recent reports state that the roads are in an unsatisfactory condition, and that officials of the telegraph department are frequently robbed when on tours of inspection. Kermanshah. There has been no fighting in the town since the arrival of Salar-ed-Dowleh on the 15th December, and the town is now quiet. Since Salar-ed-Dowletfs arrival, Azem-ed-Dowleh, the representative of the Central Government, has been a refugee in the British consulate. Ahwaz. Reports state that unrest in the district continues. Although caravans arrive from and leave for Ispahan, the Bakhtiari road^ cannot be said to be satisfactorily guarded. The Bakhtiaris have arranged for the appointment oi Amir Mujahid as Governor of Behbehan, which should tend to ensure the safety of the road. The present inactivity of the robber bands is said to be due the severity of the weather. Lingah. Some 400 merchants and others, with their families, came into Lingah during November from Lar. They say that as trade has been at a standstill for some time past at Lar they have left the place for good and intend settling at Lingah and DebarSir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 12.) Sir, _ _ Tehran, January 23, 1912. SINCE writing my despatch of the 24th December, respecting the state of the southern roads, I have received no reports of any robberies of British goods between Shiraz and Ispahan, though certain sections of the road were considered too unsafe for the inspections of the telegraph employes, and brigands still infested the neighbourhood of Abadeh. The cold weather, however, appears, as usual, to have driven off the larger number of the robbers, and several caravans at the beginning of December took advantage of the passage northwards of the squadron of British Indian troops to Ispahan to hurry through their journey. Except for the attack on our troops at Kazertm, I have no information as to the state of the Bushire-Shiraz road beyond a report from the telegraph agent that it was fairly safe, but that the road guards were exacting very heavy dues. The road between Ispahan and Tehran is in a most deplorable state, owing to the operations of Naib Hussein and the depredations of wandering Bakhtiaris. All postal communication between the capital and the south and central portions of Persia was suspended on account of the refusal of the contractor to continue the service in face of the continued losses he sustained in horses, &amp;c., and of the reluctance of the Government to indemnify him. The service has lately been resumed, but the Belgian director of the posts tells me he fears it will again fall through unless he succeeds in coming to a direct pecuniary arrangement with Naib Hussein. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 195. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.-—(Received February 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, Fehruai'y 12, 1912. RUSSIAN troops at Kazvin. Russian Minister informs me that he has heard nothing of any recent orders for the withdrawal to Resht of the troops at Kazvin (see last paragraph of Sir G. Buchanan’s telegram of the 7th February). It is possible that the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs was alluding to the reported to me since then have been rather from Resht to Kazvin than vice versd. movement of troops reported in my telegram of the 1st ultimo. Movements of troops Now that the ex-Shah has been advised to leave Persia, one objection to the presence of the troops—that they encourage hopes of his restoration—has disappeared. I doubt whether it would be wise to press the Russian Government to withdraw the troops from Kazvin for the moment, and think that we had better wait until the fedai have been removed. No. 196.

Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 12, 1912. I PRESUME that the dispatch of the further troops to Northern Persia, referred to in your telegram of the 9th February, must be considered as necessitated either directly or indirectly by the disorders caused by the presence of Mohamed Ali. I am sorry that this step has been forced on the Russian Government, but, on the other hand, I welcome the withdrawal of the troops from Kazvin as showing clearly that the Russian Government are anxious that order should be maintained and the authority of the Persian Government upheld without the intervention of Russian troops wherever this is possible, provided that the Persian Government show a disposition friendly to Russian interests in the north. You may speak to M. Sazonof in this sense. No. 199. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 13.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 13, 1912. KERMANSHAH. Please see my telegram of the 22nd December last.* According to a telegram just received from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah, Salar-ed-Dowleh had fled on the arrival of a Government force there on the 8th February. The late acting governor, Azem-ed-Dowleh, has left His Majesty’s consulate, where he was in bast. No. 200. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 14.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 14, 1912. I WAS informed to-day by M. Sazonof that instructions had been sent to the Russian consul at Astrabad to impress upon the ex-Shah that his cause was quite hopeless, and to tell him that if he would leave Persia at once the Russian Govern ment would do their best to secure a pension for him, and that the only advice which they could give him was to accept these terms and go. At the same time M. Sazonof told me that the Russian Government had agreed that Sipahdar should replace Shuja-ed-Dowleh at Tabreez, and that the latter should be given another post. No. 201. Sir G.

Kokovtsof still thinks that we should not accept a lower rate of interest than 8 per cent. He promises, however, to persuade him to reduce it to 7 per cent., as he considers it important that both Governments should adopt the same rate of interest. He is accordingly instructing M. Poklewsky to work with Sir G. Barclay with a view to arranging this question on the basis suggested by you. At the same time M. Sazonof said that it must be understood that this advance would only be made on condition that the Persian Government accepted the five proposals recorded in your telegram of the 2nd February, and especially your fifth proposal with regard to recognition of the Anglo-Russian understanding. From the first his intention had been that the advance should be conditional on the acceptance of these proposals, while he had only deferred the consideration of other questions, such as that of the Cossack brigade, Senate, &amp;c., until the question of the eventual large loan came to be discussed. I regret if in my previous telegrams on this subject I did not make M. Sazonof’s views sufficiently clear. No. 203. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 15, 1912 ; I HAVE received the following telegram dated yesterday from His Majesty’s acting consul at Tabreez :— “ Shuja-ed-Dowleh, the Acting Governor-General, has called on me, and I have returned his visit. He is, I understand, antagonistic to the present Government, but if Sipahdar were Prime Minister would obey orders. Secret meetings, I am informed, are taking place to discuss the possibility of re-establishing the ex-Shah ; the leading member of these is said to be Beshid-ul-Mulk. They are attended by the clergy and notables. It is also widely rumoured that a large deputation of clergy and notables has left Tehran to bring back the ex-Shah. It is said that Mujallal has joined the ex-Shah, and that he was sent by Shuja. Troops are also reported to be collecting at Mianeh, and I hear that horsemen were recently sent to Besht. “ The head of the clergy in Tabreez, whom the Nationalists had exiled, returned with Shuja.

Mornard as acting treasurer-general, keeping the definite appointment in suspense, and to my adding that, if the Persian Government object to M. Mornard, it lies with them to put forward another candidate. You should also ask M. Sazonof if he would agree to my stating that the Russian Government have no intention of permitting the ex-Shah to take up his abode in Russia, and that they are not prepared to guarantee that he will not return to Persia or give any undertaking which might afford ground for an eventual charge of having connived at his return. (See your telegram of the 4th February.) No. 206. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edibard Grey.—(Received February 16.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 16, 1912. CONVEYS the substance of the following despatch, dated the 20th February :— Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the aide-memoire setting forth the conditions on which the Russian Government consent to join His Majesty’s^Government in making an advance of 100,000L each to the Persian Government. The Russian Government consider that, although some of the conditions stated in your telegram of the 2nd instant are practically fulfilled, the British and Russian Ministers at Tehran should nevertheless address a joint note to the Persian Government, recording all the conditions laid down by the two Governments. This note should, in their opinion, more especially demand an undertaking to the effect that the Persian Government will in future conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian understanding, leaving it to them to propose a formula that will be acceptable to themselves. The aide-memoire adds that in thus agreeing, in view of the desperate financial position of the Persian Government, not to connect the question of this advance with any further conditions than those above referred to, the Imperial Government reserve to themselves the right to make any further pecuniary assistance dependent on certain demands, of which they wdll in due course inform His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 206. Aide-memoire. (Translation.) THE Imperial Government agree to make, jointly with the British Government, an advance to the Persian Government of 100,000k from each Power, on the conditions expressed in the aide-memoire from the British Embassy of the 21st January (3rd February), omitting, however, from the second point of these conditions the phrase “ without the consent of the Russian Government,” as has been already verbally intimated to the British Ambassador by M. Sazonof. At the same time, the Imperial Government consider it necessary to insist on a higher rate of interest on this loan than that which was mentioned in the embassy aide-memoire of the 28th January (10th February), namely, on a rate of 7 per cent. The considerations which impel the Imperial Government to this decision have already, on a previous occasion, been fully explained to the British Embassy.'' As * Namely, that Persia would be obliged to pay interest at the rate of at least 7 or 8 per cent, on an eventual foreign loan.regards the control over the expenditure of this advance, it appears desirable that the distribution ^ of the money should be approved beforehand by the Eussian and British missions in Tehran, in agreement with the acting Treasurer-General, who would then see to it that the money was in fact spent on the objects determined. The security foi the Russian share of the loan should be the surplus of the northern customs receipts, and, m case of their being insufficient, any other sources of revenue of the Persian Treasury which may be agreed upon with the Persian Government. The whole advance must be repaid out of the first proceeds of the impending large loan. Although some of the conditions stated in the aide-memoire of the embassy of the 21st January (3rd February) are already in fact fulfilled, it appears, nevertheless, desirable that the two Ministers should address a joint note to the Persian Government, setting forth all the conditions laid down by the two Governments. In particular, this note should demand from the Persian Government a simple undertaking to make its policy in the future ^ conform with the principles of the Anglo-Bussian convention, leaving it to the Persians, if they so desire, to propose some other formula on this point more acceptable to them. While _ bringing the above to the knowledge of the British Embassy, and while expressing its readiness to furnish the Russian representative m Tehran with instructions in the sense above indicated, the Imperial Ministry considers it necessary, at the same time, to stipulate that, though now agreeing, in view of the desperate position of the Persian Government and the necessity of coming rapidly to its assistance, not to connect the question of the advance with any further conditions than those stated above, it reserves to itself the right to make any further pecuniary assistance to the Persian Government dependent on certain demands, as to which it will not fail in due course to inform the British Government.

SAZONOF consents to your making a statement in regard to Mohamed Ali in the sense proposed in your telegram of the 15th February. His Excellency agrees to the following announcement as regards the Russian attitude in the question of the Persian treasurer-general:— “ Russian Government have expressed concurrence in the proposal that the two Governments should acquiesce in temporary appointment of Mornard as treasurer- general, while keeping question of definite appointment in suspense. They have at the same time stated that, if within two or three months’ time Persian Government could show reasonable grounds for not retaining him permanently, they would not raise any difficulty, provided that really good candidate could be found to take his place.” No. 208.

His Excellency said that the post of Governor-General at Tabreez was one that required a strong man, adding that he was not sure that Sipahdar possessed the necessary qualifications for it.

You will notice that the proposal regarding the treatment of the ex-Shah is recorded, although the negotiations with His Majesty which are involved have already been begun. I should mention that the style given in the note to the ex-Shah—Mohamed Ali Shah—was due to the insistence of my colleague, who urged that his Government had always given him this style.

In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that the matter is urgent the Russian Minister and I are advising the Persian Government to allow the ex-Shah a pension of 75,000 tomans per annum, and to pay the sum of 100,000 tomans demanded. The Persian Government will bear one-half of this sum and the ex-Shah the other half. His Majesty’s pension will therefore be reduced from 75,000 tomans to 50,000 tomans for the first two years.

It runs as follows :— “ Animated by desire of establishing stable relations of friendship with the neighbouring Powers, Persian Government undertake to conform their policy to principles of the convention of 1907 in so far as such policy shall not be derogatory to (“ pas porter atteinte a ”) the fundamental principles laid down in preamble of the said convention, viz. : (1) independence and integrity of Persia ; (2) her peaceful development; and (3) equal opportunities for commerce and industry of all countries.” No. 221.

Sazonof that he had received a telegram from Tehran in which M. Poklewsky expressed the opinion that the withdrawal of the whole Russian force from Kazvin at the present moment would be most inadvisable. M. Poklewsky added that he believed that the Persian Government themselves, in view of the prospect of the disarming of the fedais, would be glad to have a Russian force at hand that could reach the capital in three days. M. Sazonof said that he had been enquiring whether it would still be possible to postpone the departure of the force from Kazvin, but feared that the authorities had already made all the final arrangements for withdrawing them.Sir G.

No. 224. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 23.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, February 23, 1912. MINISTER for Foreign Affairs has communicated to me telegram from Russian consul- general at Tabreez stating that acting British consul had telegraphed to Sir G. Barclay that it was in every way desirable to recognise Shuja-ed-Dowieh, who was popular and possessed influence among nomads, as Governor-General. Acting consul was opposed to appointment of Sipahdar, who was surrounded by fedais and Armenians, and whose arrival might give rise to fresh disorders. M. Sazonof further told me that, although he had no desire to force the Persian Government to appoint Shuja-ed-Dowleh, it would in his opinion be very much wiser to keep him on as Governor-General—at any rate, for the time being; for he could not answer as to what effect might be produced on Russian policy if disorders were to break out at Tabreez again. No. 225. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 23, 1912. SIR G. BARCLAY’S telegram of 22nd February: Joint note to Persian Government. Persian formula appears to us objectionable because it places in opposition the principles of the convention and those of the preamble, a distinction which the two signatory Powers could hardly admit. Moreover, the principles of the preamble are incompletely summarised in the formula, “maintenance of order ” being omitted. I would propose to omit all words in Persian formula from “ convention of 1907,” and substitute following words : “ and gladly recognise (or take note of) the assurances implied in the preamble of the said convention.” You should suggest this to Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and enquire whether Russian Government have any other proposal to make.

As the agitation is increasing, His Majesty’s consul-general has requested me to authorise him to comply with the request of the Governor-General. I have telegraphed in reply that he may inform anyone he pleases, in writing, that the ex-Shah is being urged by the two Governments to leave Persia, and that the only matters in this connection awaiting settlement are those relating to the amount of pension to be accorded to him.

I was asked last month by the agent at Kasr-i-Shirin of the oil company whether an escort of Indian sowars could be sent to protect the property of the company until the Persian Government should have restored order. I replied that I did not see my way to advise that further troops should be sent from India, nor could I authorise the use of the consular escort at Kermanshah for the purpose desired. I have made representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as instructed in your telegram. His Excellency states that the Persian Government wish Farman Farma, the new governor, to proceed to Kermanshah with some Government troops, but that they have not the necessary money. As reported in my telegram of the 13th instant, Salar-ed-Dowleh and Daoud Khan have already fled from Kermanshah. No. 229. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 24.)

You are reported to have stated on the 21st February in Parliament that the British share of the joint advance would be utilised for the restoration of security on the southern roads. It would seem, in my opinion, quite unnecessary, and would starve other urgent needs, to_ earmark so large a sum. as 100,000k for the portion of the gendarmerie to be organised in the south (please see my telegram of the 2nd February). In view of your telegram of the 5th February, I have discussed with the acting treasurer-general a draft programme of expenditure which provides for 420,000 tomans for the whole gendarmerie. This is in accordance with Swedish colonel’s estimates, and is thought to be enough to finance the organisation for six months. Do you regard this as satisfactory, or would you Avish me to insist on the sum being expressly divided between northern and southern gendarmerie ? No. 230. Foreign Office to India Office.

No. 233. Note communicated by Count Benckendorff, February 26, 1912. DANS notre opinion, le Gouvernement persan ne fait que retarder le depart si rirgent de Perse de Mohammed Ali par les difhcultes creees au sujet de sa pension, d’une avance destinee a couvrir ses engagements envers ses adherents Turcomans et autres et de Pamortisation de cette avance. Nous chargeons M. Poklewsky de s’exprimer dans le sens qu’une defalcation de 20,000 tomans d’une pension de 70,000, somme de la pension projetee, reduction centre laquelle nous n’elevons pas d’objections, est trop considerable. Cette deduction devrait etre reduite a 10,000, Quant a 1’avance, elle devrait etre suffisante pour couvrir les necessites reelles, le contraire ne poucant que faire prevoir des troubles et des rapines de la part de ces memes Turcomans et adherents. M. Poklewsky est charge d’appuyer sur ces conclusions. La question la plus urgente etant le depart de I’ex-Schah, il serait extremement desirable que Sir George Barclay fut muni destructions qui le mettent a meme d’appuyer M. Poklewsky en cette demarche. Ambassade Imperiale de JRussie, Londres, le 26 fevrier, 1912. (Translation.) IN our opinion, the Persian Government are only delaying the so necessary departure of Mohamed Ali from Persia by the difficulties raised respecting his pension, an advance intended to meet his engagements to his Turcoman and other followers, and the repayment of that advance.We are Instructing M. Poklewsky to express the view that, while we do not object to a reduction, a deduction of 20,000 tomans from a pension of 70,000 (the amount of the proposed pension) is too much, 'this deduction ought to be reduced to 10,000. As leg aids the advance, this should be sufficient to provide for real needs, otherwise we must expect disorders and raids on the part of these Turcomans and followers. M. Poklewsky is instructed to lay stress on these considerations. As the most urgent question is the departure of the ex-Shah, it is very desirable that Sir George Barclay should be furnished with instructions enabling him to support M. Poklewsky’s action in the matter. Russian Embassy, February 26, 1912. No. 234. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 26.) ^ Tel&lt; SHUJA-ED-I)OWLEIi. FehrUary 26&gt; 1912 ‘ Your telegram of yesterday. The telegram from acting consul at Tabreez to which M. Sazonof refers is dated the 16th February, and is as follows :— “ I venture to lay before you the following considerations: Persian Government, however justified they may be in holding the view they do, would do wrong to forget that the only man able to maintain order in Azerbaijan is undoubtedly Shuja-ed-Dowleh; he is greatly feared by the numerous lawless tribes, even though these say openly that they have nothing to fear from the central authorities. I am informed that Shuja has some secret pact with the chiefs of the tribes, and the Sipahdar, if he is appointed, would require Shuja s co-operation as long as the latter is allowed to remain in the country. “ On the other hand, Reshid-ul-Mulk and Rafi-ed-Dowleh, Shuja’s subordinates, who exact money from rich and poor, are the curse of the town and of the province. They should not in any case be permitted to have anything to do with the local authorities.” The opposition of the Persian Government to the appointment of Shuja as governor is as strong as ever. The following telegram which has just reached me from the acting consul at Tabreez confirms my own strong doubts whether he could be trusted to remain loyal to the Persian Government :— “The Khan of Maku has been appointed by Shuja-ed-Dowleh Governor-General of Khoi, Salmas, and Urmia districts. Shuja has taken this step in order to assure for himself the khan’s co-operation. The principal chiefs of all the tribes, including Kurds, have received titles. I am informed that all this is part and parcel of a programme in favour of the ex-Shah. In order to try and force the return of the ex-Shah, a general rising of the population of Azerbaijan will, I hear, be brought about in the spring. We may expect trouble very soon unless steps are taken by the Persian Government to thwart such intrigues.” No. 235. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 26, 1912. RUSSIAN troops. Your telegram of yesterday. So far from the Persian Government’s strongly urging that the Russian troops should be retained at Kazvin, they occasionally request my support^to obtain their withdrawal. Their presence near the capital is not essential, in my opinion, for the safety of foreign lives and property. Nevertheless, as the removal of the fedai’ is more likely to be accomplished without bloodshed fif they know that Russian troops are within easy reach of Tehran, I still think it would be wiser not to press for their withdrawal for the moment.98 No. 236. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 26, 1912. MY telegram of this morning. I am informed by my Russian colleague that the Russian troops at Enzeli and Resbt are to be withdrawn to Russia ; the Kazvin force is also to be recalled thither, with the exception of one regiment of Cossacks, two battalions of infantry, and four mountain guns, which will stop at Enzeli and Resht. Orders have actually been received for the above movements and also for a considerable reduction in the force at Tabreez. No. 237. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 26, 1912. MY telegram of the 26th February. Russian consul-general at Tabreez has been instructed by my colleague to discourage Shuja from making any appointments whatever, as, should he do so, it will be more difficult to return to a legal situation, i.e., government by a Governor-General appointed by the Central Government. While it is certainly desirable that, until Sipahdar can be sent from here, Shuja should continue to be de facto governor, it would be well that the Russian Government should give him the strongest injunctions to abstain from intrigues. When the Sipahdar has taken up his post, the Persian Government would, I understand, be quite ready later to reinstate Shuja in his former post as Governor of Maragha. No. 238. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 26, 1912. MY telegram of the 22nd instant. The ex-Shah has requested the Russian Government to lend him 6,000 roubles which he promises to repay on his arrival in Odessa. He has also asked them for a ship of war to take him away. Arrangements are, I understand, being made with a view to meeting his wdshes. He now states that only 70,000 tomans are needed to pay off the Turkomans and Caucasians ; he begs that this sum be provided partly by the Persian Government. He has also again requested the Russian Government to obtain for him a renewal of his former pension. While adhering to a pension of 75,000 tomans, and to the ex-Shah bearing the expense of paying off the Turkomans and Caucasians, the Russian Government consider that the sum required for the purpose should be paid back to the Persian Government by annual deductions of 10,000 tomans and not of 25,000. My Russian colleague is pressing the Persian Government to agree to this, and I am giving him my support in view of the urgency of the matter. In the opinion of the Russian consul the 70,000 tomans should be distributed before the ex-Shah leaves Persia. I understand that the Russian Government concur in this view. I do not see how this sum is to be paid unless it is advanced by the two banks. Could the Imperial Bank of Persia be urged to advance it on current account as a first charge on the joint Government advance ? Delay would be involved by the Russian Bank being obliged to obtain the necessary sanction to bear its share.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received February 26.) (Telegraphic.)

In consequence of an appeal made to me by the acting treasurer-general, I spoke to the manager of the Imperial Bank this morning with regard to the former advance, hut my Russian colleague, whom I have since seen, wishes the advance to be withheld until the attitude of the Persian Government towards the amended formula for the recognition of the Anglo-Russian Convention is seen.

He hopes to be able to guard half the road from Bushire to Yezdikasht in six months after their arrival. He has not yet made up his mind which half it is to be—whether it is to extend somewhat north of Shiraz and stop short at Kazerun, or to be the portion between Bushire and Shiraz. His scheme, as far as the south is concerned, aims only at guarding the road from Bushire to Yezdikasht, and whatever the prospects of the success of the Swedish officers may be in this limited sphere, it would be rash to rely on Persia’s ever being able to undertake the great military effort by which alone order in the south could be restored.

To-day white flags have been hoisted over a considerable number of shops ; these bear the inscription, ‘ Long life to Mohamed Ali Shah ! ’ The same thing is said to have taken place at Ardebil, Urmia, and Khoi.” No. 264.

Kashkuli and Farsimeidan Khans came in to greet him. Ho is counting for certain on the Shishbuhikis, whose chief, Ahmed Khan, is his father-in-law. Sonlet-ed-Dowleh is said to be intriguing and bribing to detach khans from ilkhani. Soulet-es-Sultaneh has not yet come in to ilkhani, and is apparently reluctant to support either side, being desirous of becoming ilkhani himself. Hadji Mohamed Kerim Khan is intriguing actively in Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s favour with Soulet-es-Sultaneh and other khans. It seems unlikely that any of the three brothers can for the present establish himself properly over the whole tribe. Kashgais will perhaps sway from side to side, generally inclining to the chief who oilers them best guarantees for liberty to pay no taxes and rob with impunity.” No. 265. Sir G.

FOLLOWING received from acting consul, Shiraz, to-day “ Large consignment of cases for Indian troops, after long delay on Bushire road, has at last arrived here. Many cases had been opened and sundry effects stolen. Muleteers state that tufangchis all along road, having been wrongly informed from Bushire that con signment contained arms and ammunition for Indian troops, made dead set for our cases, which were frequently opened and searched. Khan of Kamarej, who also opened cases, appropriated sundry articles. Sardar Ihtesham, on his way to Kazerun, also opened one case in search of arms near Khanehzinian. We are about to make necessary representations in competent quarters, and will put in claim when loss accurately determined. All reports indicate bad feeling along road against us, and much exultation among tribesmen at what they consider their victories over Indian troops. “ Dixon’s Armenian mirza coming up road at first tried to pass himself off as European, as was often done formerly, but soon found it much more prudent to feign to be Persian Mussulman.” No. 266.

MINISTER for Foreign Affairs this morning visited Russian Legation by appoint ment to discuss with my Russian colleague and me terms of answer to joint note. He brought with him a draft which was unsatisfactory as regards certain points mentioned below, though after discussion he modified objectionable passages subject to approval of the Cabinet. He promised to submit it to us in a revised form before signing it to-morrow: — L In draft Minister for Foreign Affairs said nothing about approval of two legations for programme of expenditure of advance. 2. Draft stated that Persian Government would carefully conform to principles of the Anglo-Russian convention, but the remainder of formula was vague, and appeared again in some measure to place principles of convention in opposition to those of preamble. 3. Paragraph regarding army said nothing about discussion with two legations, but merely stated that Persian Government would look to their effective assistance in choice of foreign officers from minor Powers, and for armament of force. After discussion we agreed as regards these three points as follows :— 1. Programme of expenditure is to be described as a programme of which two legations have already had cognisance. 2. Latter part of formula is to run as proposed by two Powers except that “ takes official cognisance of” is substituted for “ takes act of,” there being in Persian no exact equivalent for latter, and that word “ gladly ” is omitted. 3. Wording is as follows : Persian Government will inform two legations of their programme for formation of an army, in order that an exchange of views may be effected on necessary points. Draft deals very briefly with question of ex-Shah’s pension and expresses the hope that the two Governments will lend their help to the Persian Government to prevent His Majesty from ever returning. Details of pension arrangements are to be embodied in a separate note. These are to be as already reported, except that in addition to ex-Shah’s pension (1) 6,000 tomans are to be given to a son of His Majesty who lives in Tehran, and (2) a pension of 25,000 tomans is to be continued to ex-Shah’s family on His Majesty’s decease. These two last points were not dealt with in our joint note, but they are reasonable, and Minister for Foreign Affairs has promised to submit them to Cabinet. Draft concludes with hope that two Governments will now facilitate a loan without other conditions than those regarding security, &amp;c., and that question of presence of foreign troops will soon be decided in accordance with hopes of Persian Government.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, March 8, 1912. FOLLOWING received from British consul-general, Bushire, 8th March :— “ On 10th February navy captured dhow attempting smuggle large consignment arms from Arab coast to point on coast 80 miles to the west of Lingah. Arms proved belong to inhabitants of hinterland district of Tarakumah. Latter have been since endeavouring to raise force for attack on Lingah generally, and customs and British vice-consul in particular. “ British vice-consul now telegraphs force hold Tangi Khirjal pass, 30 miles to the north of Charak, which pass is key of the road to Lingah, and that general advance on town may be expected forthwith. Inhabitants uneasy, and local authorities express inability to offer any assistance. Sheikhs of Shibkuh ports have taken sides: Mirghu and Mukani are endeavouring to oppose raising force, while Charak and Chiru are in collusion with it.” No. 278. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received March 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, March 8, 1912. LINGAH. Refer to my preceding telegram of to-day. His Majesty s consul-general at Bushire telegraphs that 150 men are being moved from Task to Lingah by senior naval officer, who considers that further advance on Lingah would probably be checked altogether by the demolition by His Majesty’s ship of Sheikh of Chiru s towers, which would in any case have a salutary effect. Vice- consul at Lingah concurs in this view. British consul-general at Bushire recommends the following action :— His Majesty’s vice-consul at Lingah should warn the Sheikhs of Chiru and Charak through His Majesty’s ship that, if they permit raid on Lingah to take place, we shall assume their complicity, and His Majesty’s ships will, without further discussion, take punitive action against them. Sheikh of Chiru has given trouble for a long time. In October 1910, during a similar raid, Ids attitude was unsatisfactory, and a dhow laden with British goods, when passing island of Hindarabi in his jurisdiction, was fired on recently. British vice consul asked for redress, and has just received an impertinent reply from the sheikh to his letter. Sir P. Cox advises that we should take this opportunity to exact reparation for this incident, and that we should call upon the Sheikh of Chiru to deposit at once 5,000 rupees on board of His Majesty’s ship, or else give a satisfactory hostage as surety for the settlement of the case, and that the sheikh should be warned that his towers will be at once demolished failing compliance within forty-eight hours. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s consul-general that I approve his action asregards bringing up the 150 men to Lingah; if he considers protection of British life and property demands that they be landed, I have authorised him to issue the necessary mstiuctions. I nave also expressed concurrence in his recommendations as to the manner m which the two sheikhs are to be treated. . It appears that our insisting on the Persian Government’s undertaking to discuss with the two legations the formation of an army has aroused suspicion of the Cabinet. Minister for Foreign Affairs visited us yesterday and entreated us to accept the omission of any mention of an exchange of views, intimating that the Cabinet might resign sooner than record this in an official note, though they were quite prepared in practice to discuss their army scheme with us. He said that our objection to his original formula, which mentioned engagement of foreign officers from minor Powers, lent itself to the constiuction that we should insist on Pussian officers m the north and British officers in the south. He pressed us to state what were the points we wished to discuss, and, in particular, he wished to know whether our intentions were really what might be suspected from our objections to his formula. We said we could not specify points to be discussed until the Persian Government had communicated to us their scheme for _ organisation of an army. My Kussian colleague reminded the Minister for Foreign Affairs that his Excellency was well aware that the Russian Government desired_ an increase in the Cossack brigade, but he had no instructions regarding their precise requirements. I said that I also was without instructions, but what I knew my Government desired was the organisation of a force capable of restoring order. _We assured the Minister for Foreign Affairs that our reason for desiring a discussion was that we wished to ensure that the force organised should be really effective, and that if in course of discussion we gave advice which the Persian Government considered inacceptable, the mere words of formula which we had induced him on 7th March to submit to the Cabinet would not commit the Persian Government to accepting such advice. We strongly urged his Excellency to bring the Cabinet to accept this formula. His Excellency promised to submit what we had said to the Cabinet. MY telegram of 26 th February, last paragraph.

Sir, Tehran, February 8, 1912. 1 HAVE the honour to report that the question of the indemnity to be paid to Mr. Shuster’s American assistants on vacating their appointments, which has been engaging the attention of the Persian Government for some time past, has now been settled. Mr. Shuster had been requested by the Persian Government to hand over the office of treasurer-general to a committee appointed ad hoc, which it was intended should in its turn hand over to M. Mornard, the acting treasurer-general, the idea being that it would be easier for Mr. Shuster’s amour-propre if the committee acted as an interme diary than if he had to hand over direct to M. Mornard. There was, however, some delay in the committee’s getting to work, and as the date on which Mr. Shuster had arranged to leave—the 11th January—was approaching, he handed over to Mr. Cairns, the American next in seniority, leaving it to the latter to hand over either to the buffer committee or to M. Mornard. Mr. Shuster having left on the 11th January the raison d'etre of the buffer committee had disappeared, and it therefore dissolved, and Mr. Cairns handed over the office of treasurer-general to M. Mornard on the 12th January. On this occasion Mr. Cairns, on behalf of his American colleagues, made it clear that they would not consent to continue to serve under any foreigner but an American citizen, and shortly afterwards a claim was presented to the Persian Government by the fourteen American assistants for payment of the emoluments to which they would have been entitled, provided they had served the full three years for which they had contracted. These emoluments included not only the salaries to the end of the three years, but also a bonus of one half-year’s salary and travelling expenses back to x\merica—amounting in all to upwards of 25,000kA 111 After considerable discussion it was agreed, at M. Mornard’s suggestion, that the three Americans who had arrived in Tehran at the same time as Mr. Shuster, and had done eight months useful work, should receive payment on this basis, but that the others who had recently arrived should be paid only one year’s salary from the date of their vacating their posts, together with their travelling expenses and the bonus of one half- year’s salary. In this despatch I have spoken in general terms of the “ American assistants.” As a matter of fact, two of these have agreed, with the consent of the two legations, to continue to serve. They are Colonel Merrill and Major Preuss, who were engaged by Mr. Shuster for the Treasury gendarmerie, and are now serving under the Swedish colonel of gendarmerie. Colonel Merrill had done much valuable gendarmerie service in the Philippines, and Colonel Hjalmarsen is glad to have him. Major Preuss was originally in the German army. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 286. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 11.) Si r &gt; Tehran, February 17, 1912, SUBSEQUENTLY to my despatch of the 17th ultimo, the insurrection seemed for a time to have taken a more serious turn. The Persian Government learnt that Shuja-ed-Dowleh from Tabreez and other agents of the ex-Shah in Azerbaijan were planning the dispatch along the Tehran road of a combined force to attack Mianeh. Russian reports from the provinces of Astrabad and Mazanderan showed that these provinces were entirely in Mohamed Ali’s hands. His Majesty himself was in Astrabad, and his forces were said to number 3,000 men, including a large contingent of Caucasians. The reports added that his forces were contemplating an attack on Shahrud, and that they were confident of victory. At the same time, a serious agitation on behalf of Mohamed Ali was reported from Meshed. It was therefore high time for making the pronouncement against the ex-Shah upon which the two Governments had agreed, as suggested in the identic telegram from the two legations (see my telegram of the 10th January). As will be noticed in a subsequent despatch, the Russian consul at Astrabad was instructed on the 8th February to convey this pronouncement to Mohamed Ali. The final result of the ensuing negotiations with His Majesty is not known at the moment of writing. Instructions had already been sent to the Russian consul-general at Tabreez to warn Shuja-ed-Dowleh that as Russia had declared that so long as Russian troops were near Tehran the ex-Shah would not be recognised His Majesty’s cause was hopeless, and expeditions in his name were aimless and were disapproved by the Russian Government. The Russian consul-general at Meshed also was given peremptory orders to do his best to still the agitation in that town. These instructions have so far borne fruit that Meshed is reported calmer, and nothing more has been heard of the advance of Shuja-ed-Dowleh’s forces on Mianeh. Telegraphic communication with the west is still interrupted, and the intelligence which reached me of Salar-ed-I)owleh’s movements is fragmentary. When last heard of on the 8th February, the Prince had been .driven out of Kermanshah by a Government force under a certain Yar Mohamed Khan, a prominent Mujtahid. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 287. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 11.) Sir, Tehran, February 20, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit copy of the aide-memoire which my Russian colleague and I left with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the occasion of our representations respecting the ex-Shah, reported in my telegram of the 7th instant. As reported in that telegram, the Minister for Foreign Affairs accepted the inter-112 vention of the Russian consul at Astrabad for the conduct ot the negotiations with the ex-Shah with a view to His Majesty’s leaving the country, on condition that he should receive a pension of 50,000 tomans and that a complete amnesty should be accorded k his adherents. On the following day, the 8th February, the Russian Minister telegraphed to hh consul at Astrabad the necessary instructions with a view to negotiations on these lines. The consul was to point out to the ex-Shah the hopelessness of his case, as he would never be recognised by His Majesty’s Government. He was also to inform His Majesty that the two Powers would give their moral and material support to the Persian Government. If these arguments failed, the consul was to do his best to remove the Caucasians who had recently come to Astrabad in the ex-Shah’s cause. On the 9fch instant the consul reported having carried out his instructions. Mohamed Ali seems to have been greatly surprised by the communication made to him. He said he had hoped for Russian sympathy, and intimated that if he had regained the throne he would have been guided in his actions by the requirements of Russia. Nevertheless, he expressed his willingness to leave Persia if the Emperor desired it, and said he would await orders from the Emperor and an adjustment by his Imperial Majesty of the question of the pension, as he considered the amount offered by the Persian Government inconsistent with his dignity. On the 15th February the Russian consul was instructed to tell the ex-Shah that the Russian Government’s decision was final, and that he had letter seize the present opportunity to secure a pension and amnesty, and that he could hope for nothing better. To this message the ex-Shah replied that he was willing to leave, but he repeated that the pension named was insufficient, and that he must have the same sum as was granted to him at the time of the revolution, i.e., 100,000 tomans a-year. He further demanded a sum down of 100,000 tomans in order to pay off his Turkomans and Caucasians, who would otherwise create disorders. Before we make further definite proposals to the Persian Government my Russian colleague is enquiring of the Russian consul at Astrabad whether he considers this latter sum necessary, and whether he could himself ensure its employment for the purpose indicated. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 287. Aide-memoire. NOUS sommes venus ce matin, le Ministre de Russie et moi, pour suggerer au Gouvernement persan, par ordre de nos Gouvernements, que le Gouvernement persan entre maintenant en negociations avec Mohammad Ali Mirza afin de lui persuader de quitter la Perse k condition que sa pension, dont le montant serait determine par le Gouvernement persan d’accord avec I’ex-Schah, soit renouvele et qu’une amnistie complete soit accordee k ses partisans.

THE Russian Minister and I have come this morning to suggest to the Persian Government, by order of our Governments, that the Persian Government should now enter into negotiations with Mohamed Ali Mirza in order to persuade him to leave Persia on the condition that his pension, the amount of which would be determined by the Persian Government in agreement with the ex-Shah, is renewed, and that a complete amnesty is granted to his adherents. We are instructed to add that, in the event of the Persian Government desiring that the negotiations for the departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza should be conducted through the Russian consul at Astrabad, the Russian Minister will send instructions to the consul to emphasise the necessity of the acceptance by the ex-Shah of the Persian Government’s offer.

The question o/their maemmhcation has been settled, as reported in a separate despatch fy\Russian Proposals.—On the 7th February the British and Russian Ministers a led together on the Regent and Foreign Minister and made proposals with a view to the eventual departure of the ex-Shah from Persia. The proposals having been avourabLy received, the Russian consul at Astrabad made the necessary communication o the ex-Shah regarding the hopelessness of his attempt to regain the throne, and the pension the Persian Government is willing to allow him if he leaves the country. v • n ivF 3 - 18th Eebruai T the two Ministers again called on the Regent and foreign Minister to present a joint note laying down the terms on which the two Governments are prepared to advance 100,000L each to the Persian Government. General Situation. —There has been almost complete calm at Tehran during the past lour weeks. The Government continues to maintain order and the democratic party has shown' no activity. Some excitement was caused by the action of Amn Mufakham, the Bakhtiari Khan, who on the 18th February caused the Minister ol the Interior to come to his house, and there detained him for four hours and threatened to have him beaten, in consequence of the arrest of certain persons who were accused of making a demonstration in favour of the ex-Shah. The Press. At the end of January an official organ called the “ Aftab” (“ Sun ”) commenced to appear, and has since_ published a series of political articles, evidently inspired by the Government, which display moderation and a true sense of Persia’s real interests. Tabreez, There have been no further disturbances in Tabreez during the last four weeks. Zia-ed-Dowleh, who has been a refugee in the British consulate since the 26th December, 1911, committed suicide on the 5th February. . Mr. Consul Shipley left on the 9th February, and Mr. Stevens is acting for him during his absence. Shuja-ed-Dowleh, who has been acting as governor of the town since the 2nd January, led Mr. Stevens to understand, in an interview he had with him on the 14th February, that he was opposed to the present Government unless Sipahdar was Prime Minister. r It is reported that secret meetings, attended by the clergy and leading local Persians, are being held to discuss the possibility of re-establishing the ex-Shah. Ghilan and Mazanderan. Of the Persian notables who were deported to Russia and sent back to Resht by the Russian authorities to be tried by court-martial, four were found guilty and [565] ' X114 hanged on the 31st January. Two other persons were executed at Enzeh by the Russians on the 2nd February. n ^ . General Genikh, commanding at Baku, has been placed m command or the Russian troops in Ghilan. The Russian garrison at Resht was reinforced by 400 infantry from Baku on the 30th January. _ . In consequence of alarmist reports received by the Russian Government legal ding the alleged danger to Russian subjects and trade in Mazanderan and Astrabad, it was decided at St. Petersburgh at the beginning of February to send two companies of infantry with two mountain guns to Astrabad, one company to Barfrush, and one company to Meshedisser. Meshed. Major-General Redko, who is in command of the Russian troops in Khorassan, arrived in Meshed with 400 infantry on the 12th_ January. Early in February an agitation was started in favour of the ex-Shah. On the 5th February the situation became most serious, as a large mob commenced parading the streets and defying the police. Eventually, however, the mob dispersed. The province is generally disturbed, owing to the presence of large raiding parties of Turkomans and Kurds. Ispahan. The town has remained quiet, but the environs continue to be subject to burglaries. The boycott of foreign goods is ended. Owing to the severity of the weather there has been a decrease in the number of robberies in the province. M. Mornard has confirmed Mr. Haycock in his appointment as local agent to the treasurer-general. Sardar Zafar, the newly-appointed governor, has left Tehran for Ispahan. Naib Hussein, the notorious brigand, has now come to terms with the Persian Government, and his son, who was a prisoner at Tehran, joined him at Kashan on the 8th February. Yezd. The town is reported quiet, but the financial situation continues unsatisfactory. Shahab-ed-Dowleh, the governor (Assadullah Mirza, the former deputy and Cabinet Minister), is reported to be displaying more energy in meeting the unrest than most of his predecessors, although complaints of his avarice and pan-Islamism are rife. Seistan. The acceptance of the Russian demands caused general satisfaction. The news of recent events in Tabreez has reached Seistan, but His Majesty’s consul considers that disturbances are improbable, as the principal mullahs are well disposed towards us, and as Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the governor, is opposed fco any anti- foreign demonstration. Kerman. The news from northern Persia caused considerable excitement in Kerman. The bazaars were closed, inflammatory speeches were made, and the drilling of “national volunteers” was commenced. However, on the arrival of Amir Azam, the new Governor-General, on the 15th December, the bazaars were opened, the drilling of the “national volunteers” ceased, and the town resumed its normal state. Sardar Nasret (the former acting governor of Kerman) left on the 6th February for Tehran, where he had been summoned to give an account of himself and of the money supplied to him for the troops. Kermanshah. On the night of the 16th January shots were fired at the British consulate, where a considerable number of persons have taken refuge, including Azam-ed-Dowleh, the former acting governor. On representations being made to the Persian Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Salar-ed-Dowleh was responsible for the firing, and that he had done this in consequence of the continued presence of therefugees at the consulate. He added that the Persian Government were unable to take any steps against Salar-ed-Dowleh beyond pressing Farman Farma, the newly- appointed governor, to proceed to Kermanshah as soon as possible. Telegraphic communication with Kermanshah is interrupted, and various conflicting repoits have reached the legation as to the situation there. It was reported on the 8th February that Salar-ed-Dowleh had fled, and that the refugees had left the consulate, but it has been subsequently reported that Salar-ed-Dowleh has re-entered the town.

W11H reference to my despatch of the 23rd January respecting the state 0 . the southern roads, I have the honour to report that, as usual in the depth of the winter, few if any robberies have been reported. ^ telegram from the acting British consul at Shiraz states, as regards the Bushire- Shiraz road, that one caravan reports from Bahdar that it is delayed owing to the insecurity of the road, while muleteers who have reached Kazerun refuse to proceed owing to excessive blackmail at the hands of the Kashgais. Two bales for British officers are reported to have been robbed by Kashgais at Tangi-Turkan, where the muleteers complain that Kashgai road guards are continually pilfering from caravans, and two further bales were robbed in Tangi Bulaki. Mr. Smart adds that he is arranging for the dispatch of a special “ memur ” to treat for the protection, and if possible for the transport to Shiraz, of British goods scattered along the road. A camel caravan travelling from Shiraz to Ispahan was attacked and sixty camels with loads were carried off, but on the whole, according to reports from His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan, from the middle of January up to the 3rd February, caravans seem to have been passing freely along the Shiraz-Ispahan road. The danger point is in the neighbourhood of Abadeh, hut Major Petersen, the Swedish gendarmerie officer, on his way to Shiraz has passed that locality unescorted in safety. Near Dehbid Major Petersen fell in with a donkey caravan which had just been looted, and he and his three or four companions followed up the robbers, who fired upon him, but he wounded and secured two of them.

A further draft of the Persian Government’s reply to the joint note of the two legations was submitted to me yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs through Moin-el-Vezareh. Document in question differs in many respects from the previous draft as amended during our discussion of the 7th March (see my telegram of that day). Principal point of divergence is with regard to the formula for the engagement to discuss the formation of an army with the two legations. This is now worded so as to bind the Persian Government only to submit the choice of officers to discussion (they are already bound to do this), and to obtain necessary men only from amono’ the subjects of a minor Power. I find M. Poklewski naturally disinclined to commit himself so far as to exclude Russian officers, and I have therefore, after consultation with him, informed Moin-el-Vezareh—although the latter, in communicating to me Minister for Foieign Affan s diaft, stated that it was Persian Government’s last word—that there is so much divergence between the new draft and that discussed and amended on the 7th March that we are unable to agree to it. I gather that the Persian Government are not altogether unwilling to accept a moderate increase in the Cossack brigade, but the Cabinet and also the Regent are [5G5] K116 strongly averse to taking upon themselves the responsibility for giving an undertaking which they now fear forms but the prelude to the introduction into the main army of Russian and possibly of British officers, and the employment of this army in separate zones.

AS the Persian Government have just consented to pay the compensation demanded in connection with the escort incidents in December last, the present moment seems especially fitting for a declaration from His Majesty’s Government with regard to a reduction of our escorts, but of course such a reduction should be made dependent on the arrival at Shiraz of the new Governor-General. The Persian Government appointed Mukhber-es-Sultaneh Governor-General weeks ago, but lack of funds has hitherto prevented him from proceeding to take up his post. He is, I believe, as good a choice as any that could be made. No. 297. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, March 12, 1912. KERMANSHAH.

In a telegram dated the 29th February, but only received to-day, His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah confirms the news furnished by the Persian Government to the effect that Salar-ed-Dowleh had recaptured Kermanshah. Mr. McDouall reports that a great deal of looting then ensued and that the late acting-governor and other officials were executed. He adds that Salar attributes his previous defeat to the presence of bastis in His Majesty’s consulate; he is therefore exceedingly irritated against our consulate and also against the Imperial Bank. Five of the Government force appear to have taken refuge at our consulate.

There is no question of sending any of the Kazvin force to Tabreez ; as far as I can discover no troops have yet left Kazvin for Russia. My Russian colleague tells me that the position is now as follows:— If the Russian Government accept his proposal (see my telegram of the 8th March), which was made after consultation with the Russian general at Kazvin, two regiments will be withdrawn from Resht to Russia, and three battalions and two batteries from Kazvin will be also withdrawn to Russia. If, on the other hand, the Russian Government do not accept the proposal, and118 the evacuation of Kazvin is to he completed immediately, the impending withdrawal will amount in all to two regiments, two batteries, and five battalions. Russian Minister is unable to give me the precise figures as regards Tabreez ; he says that some battalions have already been sent back to Russia. It is clear that these are the 1,500 troops mentioned in my telegram of the 9th March. Two regiments now remain at Tabreez, and the 1,000 new-comers are recruits joining these. No. 300.

Sazonof to your suggestion that we should inform the Persian Government that the interpretation they put upon our rejection of the first formula is erroneous. At the same time his Excellency reserves his right to demand that the Cossack brigade should be increased, and I gather that his idea is that when the Russian troops are recalled from North Persia the Cossack brigade should he employed in their stead.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. _ Foreign Office, March 13, 1912. THE Persian Minister called here on the 6th instant and was received by Mr. Mallet. He enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would not accept the formula proposed by the Persian Government on the subject of the recognition by them of the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 (see your telegram of the 22nd ultimo), and abstain from pressing for the acceptance of the amended version as put forward by us. Mr. Mallet pointed out, in reply, that the formula of the Persian Government appeared to His Majesty’s Government to be objectionable because it placed in opposition the principles of the convention and those of the preamble of that incident, a distinction which the two signatory Powers could hardly admit. Moreover, the principles of the preamble of the agreement were summarised incompletely in the Persian formula, which omitted all reference to the u maintenance of order.” He accordingly urged Mirza Mehdi Khan to advise his Government to accept the version proposed by the two representatives without further delay.

WITH reference to my despatch of the 17th instant, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copies of two despatches from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah, reporting the recapture of the town by the Government forces and the consequent flight of Salar-ed-Dowleh. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 304. Consul McDouall to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Kermanshah, February 9, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that, on the evening of the 7th, reports were received that Yar Mohamed Khan, commanding the Government forces, had occupied Mount Bisitun. During the night there was a skirmish at the Karasu Bridge, four miles from town, and the Kalhurs from there passed behind the consulate in flight towards Mahidasht. About ten mujteheds were killed at the bridge, one an officer, Hussein Khan Kermanshahi. At 5 a.m. on the 8th there was some firing, and soon after Yar Mohamed Khan came alone to consulate and asked permission to see Azem-ed- Dowleh, who might have some plan to prevent bloodshed. I agreed, and he came in for a few minutes only. Fighting continued all day, the Government forces gradually advancing, and by sunset they held nearly all the town up to the gates of the palace, which is an extensive block of buildings. They sent twice to ask Azem-ed-Dowleh to join them, and two officers called with the same message. I held him and his associates in bast to their promise not to go to the town until it was in the occupation of Government, in accordance with what I had told Salar-ed-Dowleh. After dark the palace was entered, but Salar-ed-Dowleh and Daoud Khan, Sardar Mozaffir, and others had fled. They had left by a gate on the outskirts of the town, and are reported to have gone to Darband, on the Kurdistan-Kerman shah border. Their further movements have not yet been reported. The majority of the prince’s forces do not appear to have ventured outside to withstand dhe soldiers. Sharaf-el-Mulk Kurdistani is known to have been killed, but there were not many casualties on either side as far as I have yet heard. [565] L120 This morning a guard of honour with a flag came to the consulate and conducted the bastis to the palace, after formally thanking me. Azem-ed-Dowleh is now acting governor, and has issued a proclamation that any looting will be punished by death. Owing to the advance of the Government forces the Russian Cossacks were detained, hut leave to-morrow, and I send this by favour of my Russian colleague. I have, &amp;c. w. McDouall. Enclosure 2 in No. 304. Consul McDouall to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Kermanshah, February 13, 1912. I HAVE the honour, in continuation of my despatch of the 9th February, to inform you that Sharaf-el-Mulk Kurdistani was not killed in the fighting. He was at the house of Aga Mahmud, brother of Aga Mohamed Mehdi Mujtehed, and the morning after the fighting was shot, with his nephew and two servants, by mujteheds. The Kurdistanis in Kermanshah have written a deposition stating that he was killed by mujteheds and the townspeople are innocent, and sent it to the tribe to prevent them killing any Kermanshahis. Aga Mahmud was arrested, also Aga Rahim, Haji Aga Wali, Aga Seyyid Reza Qumi, and Sheikh-el-Islam of Hersin, all mujteheds. The whole of Salar-ed-I)owleh’s corre spondence was found in the palace and Aga Mahmud’s despatch-case was brought from his house. The extraordinary commission of Government enquired into the case against them. There was no doubt of his (Aga Mahmud’s) guilt. The commission decided that he must pay 4,000 tomans and be sent to Tehran with the others. During the night Yar Mohamed Khan Sardar ordered his execution, and he was hanged at daylight on the 12th. Yar Mohamed informed the commission that he acted on orders from Tehran. The others will probably be sent to Tehran, but there is some doubt if Aga Rahim will escape death. On morning of the 9th two officers of the Zangineh regiment, two executioners, and one or two others were shot. Salar-ed-Dowleh took his wife, a local princess, with him. On the 9th they were at Mahidasht and looted neighbouring villages for supplies. Salar Mas’ud (Hussein Khan Guran) and Samsam-el-Mamalek Sinjabi went to their homes and refused to assist Salar-ed-Dowleh further. He has with him Sardar Mozaffir and Salar Humayun and their followers, amounting to about 300 men and one gun. From Mahidasht they have moved to the Crown lands, about 12 miles from Kermanshah to the north-north-west, and are said to have sent to the Kalhurs, to Kurdistan, and Luristan for reinforcements. The Government forces consist of about 200 mujteheds, 100 Kuliaii horse, and local soldiers and volunteers—perhaps 1,000 in all. They are well supplied with ammunition. They have telegraphed to Farman Farma for reinforcements. Ihe town is quiet and people in terror. Two akhunds have taken bast at the consulate, named Seyyid Mohamed Rauza-khan and Naib-Sadr. They are accused of political offences, but say they can prove their innocence. I have, &amp;c. W. McDOUALL. No. 305. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 14, 1912.

Foreign Office to India Office. gi rj - Foreign Office, March 16, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Marquess of Crewe, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran enclosing the scheme, elaborated by Colonel Hjalmarson, for the organisation of a national gendarmerie in Persia.* It will be seen that, so far as the province of Ears is dealt with, the idea is to establish the head-quarters of the force at Shiraz, and it is hoped that by the end of the first year posts will be stationed southwards as far as Kunar Takhteh, some 120 miles south of Shiraz, and northwards as far as Baghi Khan, 12 miles north of that town. During the succeeding 9 months posts would be extended to Bushire in the south and to Yezdikhast in the north. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the arrangement at present in contemplation is open to a grave objection in that it leaves unguarded for at least 12 months a broad stretch of country—some 55 miles, in fact—between Bushire and Kunar Takhteh, at the mouth of the main channel of British trade into the interior, while no such omission is contemplated on the northern road from Tehran to the coast. While this stretch remains unguarded the fact that the section between Kunar Takhteh is safe will be of no benefit to British trade, since goods will be liable to robbery as soon as they leave Bushire, and I am accordingly to enquire whether, in Lord Crewe’s opinion, it would not be desirable to instruct Sir C. Barclay to urge the Persian Government to pay attention in the first instance to the whole road south of Shiraz rather than to any part of it, such as that leading to Baghi Khan, to the north of that place.

I I am to state that on the information now before him, Sir E. Grey is disposed to share the views expressed by Sir G.

India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received March 21.) Sir, India Office, March 20, 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 16th instant, regarding the scheme prepared by Colonel Hjalmarson for the organisation of a national gendarmerie in Persia. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be preferable that provision should be made first for the protection of the whole road between Shiraz and Bushire. But Kunar Takhteh is apparently the last stage in the hilly country, in which caravans are most likely to be attacked, and shortly after it the road crosses the Kotal-i-Malu and drops to the plain; and it is probably Colonel Hjalmarson’s view that with a post at Kunar Takhteh the road as far as Dalaki, at the foot of the hills, would be sufficiently protected, and that the plain might be left to such a force as the Governor of Bushire may possess. Lord Crewe would deprecate any avoidable interference with the Swedish officer’s discretion, and he would suggest that His Majesty’s Government might acquiesce in the proposal on the understanding : (1) that the post at Kunar Takhteh patrols as far as Dalaki; (2) that the Governor of Bushire is made personally responsible for the safety of the rest of the road to Bushire. It will be remembered that in this last section is the village of Borasjun, a dangerous place, the khan of which is a notorious evildoer. Sir E. Grey may like to consult the political resident, Persian Gulf, before arriving at a decision. Lord Crewe observes that no provision is apparently made for the protection of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road, which, already disturbed, is likely to become more so as raiding ceases to be profitable between Bushire and Shiraz. Representations have repeatedly been made by His Majesty’s consul, Kerman, and by the firms whose property has suffered, and his Lordship would suggest that the Persian Government should be pressed to take measures for the restoration of order on this road as well.

FOLLOWING # is Persian Government’s reply, dated 20th March, to our joint proposals:— M. le Ministre, J’ai eu 1’honneur de recevoir la note que votre Excellence a bien voulu m’adresser en date du 29 safar (18 fevrier) dernier, d’accord avec son Excellence le Ministre de Russie, au sujet de certaines propositions tendant a etablir sur une base solide de [565] L 3; 2. Pour que 1 evacuation clu territoire de la Perse par les troupes etrangeres s accomplisse dans le plus bref delai possible conformement aux souhaits du Grouverne- ment persan. (Translation.) M. le Ministre, I HAVE had the honour to receive the note which your Excellency was good enough to address to me on the 29th Safar (18th February) last, in conjunction with his Excellency the Russian Minister, relative to certain proposals with a view to establish on a solid basis of confidence and friendship the relations between the Persian, English, and Russian Governments, and to assist the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah in their task of re-establishing and maintaining order and tranquillity in the country, ihe Imperial Government, deeply sensible of the good intentions of the two neighbouring Powers and animated by the desire to carry out these proposals in their entirety in the most satisfactory manner, have the honour to inform you as follows :— A. —1. In regard to the question of the sum of 200,000L for which the Imperial Bank and the Banque d’Escompte will open an account in the name of the Persian Government, representing an advance on the first loan which Persia is about to contract, my Government agree that this sum shall be repaid out of the first proceeds of that loan. In the meanwhile, interest will be calculated at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum ; and the surpluses of the northern and southern customs revenues will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of and to the payment of interest on the present advance. 2. In order to secure that this sum shall be wholly employed to meet expenditure already decided upon by the Government, and known to the two legations, the officer in charge of the treasury-general will be entrusted by the Imperial Government with the duty of controlling the expenditure defrayable out of this account. It is understood that a considerable part of the advance will be assigned to the organisation of the Government gendarmerie with the assistance of the Swedish officers. B. As regards the four points in the last part of the joint note, the Persian Government, convinced that the integrity and independence of Persia, as well as her peaceful development, are the object of the sincere solicitude of the two friendly Governments, welcome with pleasure this favourable attitude and reply thereto in the following terms :— 1. In order to prove their earnest desire to establish on a solid basis of friendship and confidence the relations between Persia, Great Britain, and Russia, the Persian Government will take care to conform their policy with the principles of the convention of 1907, and they take note of the assurances contained in the preamble of that convention. 2. In accordance with what has been decided in the programme of my Government, after the final departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza and Salar-ed-Dowleh from Persian territory, the mujahids will be dismissed and the other irregular forces will be disciplined and gradually incorporated in the regular forces, as the military organisation is developed. 3. With a view to the maintenance of order and security in the country, the organisation of a regular and effective army constitutes one of the fundamental points of the ministerial programme. It is evident that the army to be organised will be proportionate to the needs of the country. In order to convince the two Powers that they consider the organisation of this army as one of their most pressing duties, the Persian Government will inform the two legations of the programme of this organisation with a view to a friendly exchange of views on the necessary points. 4. As regards the departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza and the grant of a pension to him, in deference to the proposals of the British and Russian Governments, an agreement, which will form the subject of a separate note, has already been arrived at. In order to remove every obstacle to the pacification of the country and to the -re-establishment of order, and to ensure that the measures taken by the State for the maintenance of public security shall be effective, the Persian Government are confident that the two neighbouring Powers will not fail to render them every assistance, so as to obviate all danger of a fresh attempt by the ex-Shah to enter Persia. Desiring to act upon the proposal of the British and Russian Governments, the Imperial Government [565] L 4126 will grant a general amnesty to the followers of Mohamed Ali Mirza. This measure will of course only apply to events and acts previous to the date of the amnesty, and will not extend to those subsequent thereto. C. Having in the preceding paragraphs given proof of their friendly intentions towards the two Powers and of their sincere desire to re-establish order and security in the country, the Persian Government are anxious to obtain the effective assistance of the two neighbouring countries on the two following points : 1 For the immediate conclusion of the loan necessary for the realisation of the reforms, the conditions attached to such loan to relate only to the rate of interest, amortisation, and guarantee. 2. To effect the evacuation of Persian territory by foreign troops within the shortest possible period, in accordance with the wishes of the Persian Government. No. 317. Sir G.

In a report dated the 15th instant His Majesty’s consul states that the advice tendered by himself and Russian consul has been rejected by Salar-ed-Dowleh, who not only declines to consider the terms which the Persian Government offer him, but puts forward a claim to rule, under the Shah’s suzerainty, over the whole of Western Persia. No. 323. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 25.) - (Telegraphic.) Tehran, March 25, 1912. MY telegram of to-day. My Russian colleague and I informed the Minister lor Foreign Affairs yesterday of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s reply to the communication of the two consuls. His Excellency said that Salar’s pretensions were clearly inadmissible. They violated the integrity of Persia, and were thus contrary to the interests not only ol Persia, but also of the two Powers. Minister for Foreign Affairs assured us that the Government were preparing an effective expedition against Salar, and he begged us to repeat our representations in a stronger form and to instruct the consuls to make these representations widely known. We propose, subject to the approval of the two Governments, to comply with Minister for Foreign Affairs’ request and to instruct the consuls to urge Salar most strongly to leave Persia, pointing out to him that his present attitude is contrary to the interests of the two Powers, that the Persian Government are assured ol our full sympathy and of our support in the action they are taking against him, and that if he does not leave Persia the two Powers will take no further action to secure lor him a pension nor will they afford him any protection. The two consuls would be instructed to make their communication as public as possible. No. 324. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 25, 1912. SIR G.

I HAVE been in communication with the India Office in regard to the scheme, reported in your despatch of the 14th February, for the organisation of the Swedish gendarmerie.* The Secretary of State for India considers the scheme generally acceptable, but considers, and I agree, that, in view of the danger to which caravans are exposed on leaving Bushire for Shiraz, one of the first steps should be to provide for the protection of the whole of the road between those places. We desire to avoid any further delay, and to leave matters as far as possible to the colonel’s discretion, and we will therefore accept his scheme provided that (1) the G-overnor of Bushire undertakes personal responsibility for the security of the road from Bushire to Dalaki (including Borasjun, which has on two occasions been the scene of robberies), and (2) that the gendarmerie force stationed at Kunar Takhteh patrols the road up to Dalaki. As regards the road between Bunder Abbas and Kerman, Lord Crewe fears that the present insecurity of this road wdll be increased in proportion as the state of road via Shiraz becomes better, and thinks that the Persian Government might be urged to take steps to obviate this. I doubt whether this would be within their power until they obtain the necessary resources from the projected loan. You should consult consul-general at Bushire and let me have your views by telegraph. No. 326. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (lelegraphic.) ^ Foreign Office, March 26, 1912.

I have on several occasions received from Persian Government an assurance that they are making every endeavour to get a sufficient force despatched without delay. As a result of further enquiry I ascertained to-day that Farman Farina, who has been appointed governor, had been entrusted with the levying of the greater part of the force—the intended strength of which seemed to me inadequate — and I have begged of the Persian Government that some of Yeprim’s fedais, who have acquitted themselves so well on previous occasions, may be despatched against Salar-ed-Dowleh.

While the Marquess of Crewe concurs with Sir E. Grey generally in the proposal made in your letter under reply, he desires to lay great stress on the necessity of requiring from the Persian Government—since His Majesty’s Government cannot undertake it themselves—the summary punishment of those who are well known locally to have been responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort. His Lordship would also suggest that a condition of ultimate withdrawal should be an undertaking by the Persian Government to support the Swedish officers by all means in their power in organising the force of gendarmerie.

We consider that we should continue to press Persian Government to inflict punishment on those responsible for attacks, and that payment of compensation by them should not relieve them of duty of doing so. We agree with Sir G. Barclay, in regard to question of retaining Shiraz and Ispahan consular escorts, that practical proof in near future of friendly attitude on part of tribal headmen along road should be the condition of reductions of consular guards.

As you are aware, surpluses of northern and southern customs receipts are to be employed respectively in their entirety for interest and repayment of Russian and British shares in joint advance of 200,000k After consultation with manager of Imperial Bank of Persia, I would suggest, subject to your approval, that surplus of southern customs should be remitted monthly, beginning 1st May, by bank to London, on account of His Majesty’s Govern ment, until British share is paid off.

FOLLOWING is extract from telegram from acting consul at Shiraz 24th March, and seems to show that there is good chance of tribal migration passing off quietly:— Bushire road has been slightly disturbed owing to tension between Kazerunis and Kashgais, and there have been several petty robberies from caravans, and one total robbery of post from Bushire. Governorship of Kazerun has, in deference to Kazerunis determined objections to Kashgai Governor, been transferred from Mohamed Ali Khan to Muntesir-ul-Mulk, commander of Malayer regiment. Kashgais are deflecting traffic after Ramanj to Shapur, and thence to Dashtarjin via Nandan, leaving out Kazerun altogether. Kawam and merchants have been forced to acquiesce, but Kawam assures me at first detente he will strike for reversion to high road. Ilkhani is at Jirreh with Government force, 250 horse and foot and 2 guns and flints and Kashgai riflemen, said to number about 2,000. Kashgai, Shishbuluki, Farsimedan,Sefikhani, and Namadi chiefs are with them. Soulet-es-Sultaneh has been hitherto maintaining neutral attitude, but by latest reports from Kazerun he is now expected to. come into Tekhani; Soulet-ed-Dowleh has left his family behind, has moved up with one section of Darashulis, and is about 20 miles distant from ilkhani; other sections of Darashulis are said to be for ilkhani. Chiefs and Mohamed Kerim Khan, who are with ilkhani, have been talking for some time of arranging peaceful compromise between two brothers. Chiefs apparently are not keen on shedding blood for any ilkhani, their growing independence rendering ilkhaniship no longer matter of vital importance to them. Talk of peace has not yet assumed any practical shape. Nasr- ed-Dowleh is at Fesa, where Arabs are collecting ; tribes are now all in motion, and should be entering Shiraz Valley in fortnight. Kawam, who has been hitherto main taining excellent order in Shiraz and environs, is anxious, mainly owing to entire lack of money, and for some time has been telling me that, unless Persian Government send him money, he cannot carry on. It is desirable that Persian Government should send Pars Government some money immediately to pay police in town and guards in vicinity of Shiraz. With money local authorities think the} 7 can tide over safely critical moment of tribal passage and prevent incidents.” Acting treasurer-general has promised to remit 30,000 tomans from joint advance to Shiraz for payment police and guards. * I No. 335. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 30.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, March 30, 1912. GENDARMERIE scheme. Please refer to your telegram of the 25th March. I have explained to the Swedish colonel your wishes as regards the road between Bushire and Shiraz. He realises that it is desirable to provide for the protection of the whole of this section from the outset, and he had originally intended to propose this. He felt himself obliged, however, to abandon the idea on its being represented to him that the hostility of the Kashgai tribe would be increased if they saw that the gendarmerie were employed exclusively on their section, while no attempt was made to check the depredations of the tribes between Shiraz and Ispahan. Before deciding definitely, he wishes to await a report from the officers who have already left for Shiraz. I propose not to press him further in the matter, unless you instruct me to do so, as I should prefer to leave it to his discretion as far as possible. I have consulted Sir P. Cox in regard to your telegram. Not having yet seen the colonel’s scheme, he is imable to judge as to the probability of its proving successful, but he thinks it right to point out that it is not based on experience of the local conditions since none of the officers has yet passed along the road.^ He considers it most desirable that the scheme, even in its initial stages, should extend to the whole of the road between Shiraz and Bushire. He does not think we ought to agree to any proposal under which the control of any part of the road woidd be left in Persian hands without the road being both patrolled and financed under the supervision of the Swedish officers. There is not, in his opinion, ^much ground for thinking that the security of the road from Bunder Abbas to Kerman would be endangered as a result of an improvement on the Shiraz-Bushire road. This would more probably be the effect of stopping the disorders immediately north of Shiraz. The Kashgais do not extend their operations as far as the Kerman roads ; the only tribes of Ears which do so are some of the Arab tribes, who, so far as the Ispahan- Bushire road is concerned, do not go further south than Shiraz. He sees no objection, however, to making the suggested representation to Persian Government in this respect, but I am averse to doing so, as, until they have obtained a loan, I do not think we can expect them to take energetic steps to stop the disorders on the Bunder Abbas—Kerman road. All we can hope for at present is that the necessary action will be taken to carry out the limited proposals of the Swedish colonel.132 No. 336. Sir G.

These grave outrages resulted in the killing of three men belonging to the two escorts and the disappearance of another, in the wounding of Mr. Smart and of ten other persons, and m loss of property to the value of 944/ I am now directed by His Majesty’s Government to present a claim for compensa tion tor these attacks, and to demand the punishment of those responsible. ^ His Majesty s Government are well aware of the serious financial straits of the ersian Government, and being desirous to refrain as far as possible from embarrassing the Persian Government they have assessed the damages on a moderate scale, and the sum I am to claim is 4,744/. This sum is made up as follows : - For the wounding of Mr. Smart, 1,000/. For tlle f ou r men killed or missing, and for three men who are likely to be permanently disabled by their wounds, 3001. each, equals 2 100Z ' for the seven men less seriously wounded, 100Z. each, equals 700Z. ihe value of the lost property, 944/.
