If so, Nakhudas who keep proper accounts and keep their divers properly informed of the state of their account and treat them decently need never be interfered with by the State, or their financial posi tion, etc., become public. The drawback to the suggested arrangement of having a special Pearl ing Department of State seems to me to be that it involves an excessive amount of State interference and makes the financial position of the Nakhudas public property, which in certain circumstances may easily affect them adversely. Enclo. of Serial No. 295. —Memorandum to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No. 122-S. of 1924, dated Bushire, the 15 th February 1924. In their telegram No. 315-S. of 8th February (Serial No. 285). Foreign stated that Government are awaiting my proposals about the reform of the diving rules. As you know, I am rather of the opinion that the reforms outlined in para. 5 of your memorandum No. 208-C., dated 17th December 1923 (Enclo. of Serial No. 260) and repeated to Government in my Express Letter No. 712-S, dated 21st December 1923 (Serial No. 259), are too drastic and, in point of fact, lead to too much interference by the State in the Pearling Industry. Apart from this I do not know that there is sufficient time to in troduce it before the pearling season. In a communication some little time ago I myself outlined a scheme which mav or may not be feasible, and I repeat it somewhat amplified below. Perhaps something on these lines might be tried this year and if it is not successful the other scheme of creat ing a separate State Department to run the Pearling Industry might be tried. The scheme I suggest is roughly this: — Shaikh Hamad should issue a proclamation stating that for some time past it has come to his knowledge that grave abuses exist in the pearling in dustry in Bahrain, particularly the slackness of the nakhudas in keeping accounts, the result of which is that divers cannot obtain their just dues. He therefore orders that all nakhudas should keep regular accounts which should be^in with 'Guffal' 1923. The accounts should be drawn up on the lines of the sample account attached to the notification and should consist of a general account for the whole of the Nakhudas transactions, together with separate accounts for each diver and hauler; each of the latter should be given a small book containing a certified copy of this account. The amounts carried forward on to these accounts should be verified either from his previous account or by oath before the Qazi or by agreement between Naknuda and diver. The proclamation might go on to say that ignorance of letters or figures on the part of the Nakhudas will not be accepted as an excuse for incorrect or improperly made out accounts, that Nakhudas must engage clerks if they cannot do the accounts themselves, a big Nakhuda a special clerk and the small nakhudas a share of a clerk. Finally he could say that a diver asking to have his account settled before the Salifah or the L XI—8B9 / W- • i &gt; 1i- Qazi has the right to call upon the nakhuda to produce his accounts for the information of the Court, and that any nakhuda refusing to produce his .accouDt will be non-suited and the case given against him, that is to say, the diver will be held not to be induebted to the nakhuda and will receive a clear 'barwah' from the Joint Court, which will see that divers with such barwahs are not debarred from getting employment. Rouf-h specimen forms of accounts are attached. They are possibly quite unsuitable but might be modified to suit the circumstances and the business. The main thing is to have an intelligible form of accounts and to insist on the Nakhudas keeping their accounts up in it and producing them when called upon to do so by a Court. Please consult Shaikh Hamad and the Qazi and other experienced per sons and see whether something of this sort cannot be done forthwith in time for the coming Pearling Season. A }7^- A. ^ Serial No. 1. —Express letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, No. 27-T., DATED THE 13TH (RECEIVED 17TH) MARCH 1924. Subject :— Bahrain Reforms. Pearling Industry. My endorsement No. 124 -S. of 15th February (Serial No. 295 in file No. 480-X.:) Political Agent has consulted Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla and all agree that accounts on the lines I have susf^ested can be introduced, and that it would be advantageous to do so forthwith in time for this season. Accordingly 1 am telegraphing to Political Agent to get Shaikh Hamad to issue the necessary orders. The Shaikhs consider that the nakhudas will not like sharing actual sale value of pearls for fear they should be taxed proportionately — a diver's share being taken as tax in most states. To obviate the chance 9f fraud and collusion between nakhudas and drivers to falsify the sale value of pearls the Shaikhs have decided to charge a regular license fee on pearl boats based on the average diver's share gained by such boats, but a great deal less. The average for a good sized boat in Kuwait is considered to be about Rs. 5$0 and the Shaikhs propose to levy license fees in the grades according to the size of the boats, commencing at lis. 250 for the large boats. This will be much less than charged by other Shaikhs, but a clear gain in Bahrain where for many years no regular tax has been levied on pearling boats. In anticipation of sanction T am authorizing the Political Agent to agree to Shaikh Hamad proceeding with the licenses for the coming season. 2. As another reform the Shaikh proposes to start .a H ospital Dhow to te«iir round the pearl banks, and requires a Sub-Assistant Surgeon to be in charge. The expenses of this boat have been entered in the budget: the only difficulty is the Sub-Assistant Surgeon. Could Government aid the Shaikh bv ajppoijjtmg^aL regular Sub Assistant Surgeon for foreign service in Bahrain for this duty ? He should be a Mohommedan, and must be a good sailor, preferably a man who lias served on ships. He should be prepared to stay at least two years, as it will take him some time to learn the language and get into the work. Salary proposed Rs. 150 per mensem plus Rs. 25 per mensem when out with the Pearling Fleet. This man to be any use this season should be nominated at o ice. In the off season the Sub-Assistant Surgeon would assist the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital who has now a good deal of work. The Shaikh proposes to make him the Official Doctor and pay him a fixed retaining fee for this duty, as well as his salary for Quarantine work. Thp Residency Surgeon considers the scheme for a Hospital Dhow a very good one and entirely approves of the suggestion that the Assistant Surgeon should be the Official Doctor and supervise the Hospital Dhow as well as the Victoria Memorial Hospital. As mentioned above I am authorizing Major Daly to get Shaikh Hamad to proceed with the new system of accounts and the licensing pearling dhows at once in anticipation of sanction in order to bring the system into operation this season. \\ r ith the same object in view in the case of the Hospital Dhow will Govern ment be pleased to select a Sub-Assistant Surgeon as soon as possible ?li'U- lESIOEMOt.

Pearling Castoms Recently 3h&amp;ik Heraiii deputed iiheik Abdulle bin ^se to convene s Majlis of the leading Nakhudts &amp; to explain to them the new lic«n3 : ng ^ules. The Wskhudas agreed to accept the situation,but brought up various points for consideration.The most important of these was the question of interest. Since the commenceiaent of the reforms &amp; the cessation of the ielifeh Court from inanition .cases regarding accounts hsve been sent to the Sh^ra'. : coounts have been so bfcdly kept in the past, or not kept at all,that Shaik Hamad s court .or the Joint Court, could not possibly deel with them.The accounts^ of%4n^requted going in to 'btfoY* a decision could be retched.In the llr r- court a compromise of some sort is usually errived r t. The ihar* 1 does not however r dmit of interest being cherged.lt has been the custom in the past for the owner^fcf the boats to take a large advrnce of grain from a merchant et about 20^ interest,repayable after the end of the next ul' season. This gr^in the IJakhudf sells to convert into cash with which A he pays ^isqam 1 to the divers for the following season.On each advance he ciitorges 2o £ interest in the diver's account. Similarly when the season is «bout to commence, the Ka .-chuda takes another advance (&amp; custom s it that he must take it from the seme merchrnt who sdvrnced him ^or the Tisqam) also at 20^ repay^ible et the end of the season, 'ith this he pays the divers their '3Plaf T . The Nakhuda buys grain &amp; converts it into c»sh(o- sometimes pays the divers in kind &amp; they have to sell it at a loss to get cash) because merchants will not advance c^sh,which would be 1 ram T according to the Shara' but they ere able to satisfy their consciences pockets) by selling grain at exhorbitant interest, which they do not consider to be money-lending. At the end of the season the advances are recovered from the divers ' r I - i -shr re of tho proceeda.Tho divor thoroforo pays 20* on hid Tisqem (which in addition he often receives in kind ^t an exhorbitrnt price-) which •• he had advanced to him a year before,and also 20^ on his salf f which he received only at the beginning of the season^'y five months before the settlement .On the 3al£f he therefore pays something dtiMP 40^ per big annum. The vicious circle starts with the Merchants, of v hom th'ire - re a few only , like Yusuf iCanoo,Yusuf Fakroo &amp; some half dozen others, who are sufficiently wealthy to be able to 'sell' the grain on credit. .Nakhudas who ; re short of cash to pay the advances, ha ve no other souree from which to borrow,&amp; have to pay them large interest,which in turn they debit to the divers.It is in fact * system of money lending by a few vealthy merchants. It is not difficult to see that by the time he h. r 's repaid the two annual r dv? nces ( amounting generally to about Hs 3oo or li s 400) plus the interest thereon, the diver seldom has anything left from his share t or is often still indebted to the Nakhnda &amp; becomes still further so when he takes his fresh 'Tisqaa'. Many Nakhudas have been in the habit of charging much more than 2o ' interest,but they now say that they could manage if they were allowed to chrrge up to 2o ' r ny excess being in^ dmissable ,but that m£ ny could not r*-ise money at less^&amp; could not carry on if this interest be not per mitted. In shorty the divers have to ccept the advances at any fancy rate of interest the Wakhudas please to ch' rge them. In all probability the big Hakhud--s do not take advances from Mer-h'nts at ? 11,but them selves ? ct as money lenders to their divers,although some of the less wealthy are obliged to / &amp; probably havfl to pry heavy interest,which s ■oassed on to the diver v/ho has no in the matter. The nuestion has now arisen as to wh-t rr te of interest c^n be admitted as rnasofe^- by the civil court - the ihara will of course dmit no interest-, xis soon ^ s th« new system of accounts comes into ^orce disputes,which c;. nnot then be very plentiful,except as reg rds old accounts, can easily be settled in the civil courts, ''t it is nace; s r that some reasonable limits should be set to the amount of interest which can be admitted. The Nakhudas besides their shr re of the pearls count on ft king good de^l from this torm of money lending,v.'hic h more over, oractically enslaves the diver % makes it impossible for him to1 Gflasfl diving for thorn yasr rftor ye^r,however br-dly he may be treated. It is fear o -45 ' this matter being subjected to some regulation v/hich h*-s made the ite khud^s so strenuously oppose reforms in accounting.They now realise thny there is no escape &amp; hf. ve themselves brought up the question &amp; as/C ' h? t interest they wiJj be allowed to charge,They are pressing for a decision on this point before they make their financi 1 arrangements for the pr^sont se son which will begin soon after Ramsdhan. I discussed the matter with them myself A pointed out th r t ex^en if 2o ^ were allowed as regards the ^isqam,which the diver receives or a yer -r in advance,it seemed quite unresaonabl ■ to charge 2ot on the ialaf which he receives only about 5 months before the fihal settlement 0 which works out to over 4.0 ! per annum. I further s - id th&gt;. t it w? s a matter on which could not personally give a decision but would have to write f^r ly to you# They replied that the merchants charged them high interest^ 0 they could not charge less than that to the divers. 1 f m personally of opinion that 15^ on the Tisqam &amp; 7 1 - fo on the sslff (being for less than six months) would be l fair interest to a] low &amp; that such Ha khudas as have to borrow could raise the money without difficulty at those r tes .The majority of the Uakhudas : inance them selves^ ©ct as money lenders to the crews &amp; see -going Unkhldas who serve under them.Of course it would to some extent curtail the quite indiscriminate amount of advances m^de,which would be all to the good. In the past itekhud; s hi ve urged divers to take advances * t high rates of interest, in or-'er to make money out of them( apart from the actual pearls) &amp; to get them in debt / so that they could not afford to leave.I have ex- i^ined that such a system will no longer be necessary^ as the court will in future{provided accounts 1 re properly kept in accordance with instruc tions) assist them to recover their debts^or failing that,compel the divers to fulfill their contracts by diving,as long as t ny d^bt,however senil is satisf ctorily &gt;rov;c^ not paid off / ^ that it will no longer be necess'ry for them to fake enormous debts aginst their divers,which they could never hope to recover, mere ly to hold them to their contacts. Once they have clearly understood the orders of Governmflat in the % matte r i 4 p a nearly all the divers are British protected p rsons, be ing Foreigners,Governmnet has some oblig tion to protect their nterests) H &gt;. mMk /c Os.I do not think there will be tny very serious opjiosition. I am in- * clined to thinka that reasohable rate of interest is f ir, since the •m divers get their money before they actually earn it,but on the other h; nd they cfnnot object to some limit being put to the amount of interest cte) rged^egpecir lly as no interest whatever is permissible according to their own &gt;h;ira^&amp; this is ^ form of m^'lcing extra money which has only crept in since they have b d matters entirely their own way^c refused to h ve their cases decided by the ihs.ra.It is noteworthy that although in all other casea,particularly criminal cases,the same ^akhud-s he ve ■ Iways been loud in dent nding the Bhfra'.they re by no means agreeable to disputes in recounts being so settled I The matter is of consider! ble urgency^ I should be glad if you would put me in r position to advise -the \h ik ; s to the iiiegula tions, if any, which he should introduce.lt is very commonly known that the interest hitherto charged ha 3 been quite unreasona ble &amp; r great hardship to the divers.It can be argued that the divers cou d go without adv nces if they chose,bnt they re ignorant &amp; improvident people,h^ ve hitherto almost always been swindled of their f- ir sh re in the pearls * compelled A from sh; de stitutdon, to teke adlvances at any rate of interest,to provide themselves with food. The diving difficulties would be very considera bly lessened, if some rival industry, such as oil develop ment, capable of providing labour,could be started in Bahrain.Then Nakhudas would h ve to tre t divers better or go without them.

Your meinorandiim 89-0 daied 51et larch 19^4. I think that interest at a good high rale is legitimately chargeable by merchants to Nakiiudas, as the Pearling Industry is a hazardous and risky business - if the season is a bad one or if there is a slump in the pearl markets the lenders may have to wait for years for iheir money / or at all events to get complete repayments. ihen again Kakhudas when making advances to divers may reasonably expect interest at a good high rate; as you say, the divers have not earned the money; death, sickness or wilful absence may prevent their ever earning it. '-he •tisqam* is purely and simply something for the divers to live on in the off season. ' heoreti^ally they should be able to in live during the off season by their earnings durijtg Jie diving season ( but of course they never can / and the last thing the Nakhudas want is for them to do so. .»ith a view to ascertaining the practice in other places I tele- -graphed to the Political Agent, Kuwait, to ascertain and let me know the usual rate of interest on such advances in that place, but i^ajor -lore says it will take some time so 1 cannot wait for the information; I am asking him to send you a copy of his letter,direct. I agree with you in thinking that the interest on * Salaf 1w* p A 'Palaf 1 should be less than that on ^isqam 1 , and in view of the relative time before it is possible for the advance to be repaid - i.e. at ^affal - I think the interest might well be double. ^-f the interest charged at Kuwait comes to about the same and if the Nakhudas can show no valid reason why a higher rate should be charged, I think the rates suggested by you viz. 15% for ♦Tisqam* and 7^% for •Salaf 1 would do very well, but if the Nakhudas prove they cannot get advances at this rale perhaps it might be arranged to charge lk% per mensem up to'guffal'on these advances, i.e. on say 11 and 5 months which ^ould come to about 16^ and 7i%. Is it proposed to h ve a reformed Salifah Court or Mejlis to de^-l with disputes over accounts or will the ordinary courts decide such cases. ? -'Vfl Lieut-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.t' p COKFIPEHTIAI.. lTo/^/9/5, The Political Agency, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. 12/7/24; From, The Political A ^ent,Bahrain.

B. Prideaux, C.£.I., C.I.E., Eon'ble the Political Heeident in the Persian Gulf, B u £ h r e. Reforms in the pearling industry . Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a petition from a number of influential diving nakhudas of Bahrain, setting forth some grievances in regard to conditions prevailing at present in the pearling industry as a result of the measures instituted in 1924 for the Reform of the industry. These measures comprised:- (l) The abolition of the old Salifah Court. •t ——i jb /f/n//' ^ (2) Rules regulating financial relatione between pearling nakhudas and their crews contained in the proclamation issued by Shaik Hamad in 1924, a translation of which was forwarded to you under this office letter No. 170/9/5, dated 12th July 1924. The signatories of the attached petition pray for re consideration of two points only in connection with the above measures:- (1) The abolition of the Salifah Court. (2) The sale of pearls with the consent of 2/^rds of the crew. The remaining points dealt with in the petition are matters on which no definite decision has yet been made either by K. M. Government or by Shaik Hamad himself by proclamation, although the general line taken by the Court in cases which havehava corae before Ifcc /v^Vw' In view of Ma jo tu iW^y ^ ffc^. lor Daly^ imninent return to Bahrain, I am not in a position to venture any detailed commente on neaBures of reforn which have already 'been instituted in the pearling industry during his incumbency as Political Agent. It may not however be out of place for me to submit for your consideration one or two points which have become apparent to me during my experience of this years pearling season in Bahrain. In regard to the abolition of the Salifah Court, I will venture only to remark that my experience of the diving cases with which I have had to deal is that the restitution of a reformed kind of Salifah Court is a necessity, both from a point of view of equity and also from the fact that public opinion will sooner or later demand it. I do not think that it is within the power of the ordinary Court of Justice to deal fairly with some of the complicated differences which arise between diver and nakhuda, &amp;■£ nakhuda and nakhuda and nakhuda and Tajar, without the assistance and adiice of a body of men who enjoy universal respect in Bahrain, and wbo are well versed in local diving custom. If it v/ould be possible for H.M.Government to define the main principles by which these men should be guided in their decisions, and if the Political Agent and Sheikh Hamad were given all the powers of appeal and revision from those decisions in cases of necessity, I do not think there would be any serious danger of the old oppressions and malpractices creeping back into the industry. At the same time much discontent among l the nakhudas and Tajars, who after all control the industry, would be removed and the Salifah body would be in a position to advise the Government in regard to further measures for the smooth working of the industry. The sale of pearls with the consent of 2/^rds of the crew, though /~\ ■JV'-r though theoretically unasBailafcle, ie in practice a consi derable hardship on the nakhuda. In the pearl trade bargains can only be made by IWtoa astute 'haggling' with a would-be purchaser and by closing suddenly with a favourable off^r. If the nakhuda is hampered by having to consult 2/^rds of his crew, who are mostly ignorant of the market value of the pearls, he is precluded from making a good bargain. On shore, when the diving season is over, the divers scatter almost atonce to their homes and nakhudas have to my knowledge in many cases had the greatest of difficulty in assembling 2/^rds of their crew for a sale of the pearls, and in many cases thev have lost valuable opportunities in doing so. i I venture to think that there is in the present petition a suggestion which is well worth consideration. If at the beginning of te diving §§ §§§ season, the crew were to elect by a majority vote a limited number of their own fellows to represent their interests in the sale of the pearls throughout the diving season, much of the difficulties now experienced by the nakhuda would be alleviated, and the interests of the crew would be adequately protected. I would suggest that one representative for every 10 or fraction of ten of the crew would be sufficient. In regard to the renaining points raised in the petition I would suggest that the duties of the diver towards the nakhuda on shore and at sea, during the diving season and immediately before and afterwards be defined in a proclamation by Sheikh Hamad. Questions such as the arrest of tilii runaway divers and the postponement of ordinary disputes till after the find of the diving season might be similarly dealt with in the same proclamation. I submit the above suggestions merely from a desire to record my impressions and experiences during the late diving with season and,/no object of embarasslng Major Daly whom you will no ino doubt consult before coming to any decision in the natter.

Jus statement that the measures of reform introduced included the abolition of the old Salifeh Court is an error. The Saliieh Court had died a natural death a long time before the re forms started. The &lt;Court- had consisted of one very venal old man, who received no salary for his duties^ depenued for his- livlihood on subsidies paid him by the Kaichudas themselves. Prom my arrival in January '21 till the introduction of reforms in 1924 I do not \ recollect a single case in which a diver obtained redress in the o-diieh court. In iac1,xa at that time,accounts when kept (generallv t^ere were none) by Kakhudas,were so completely unintelligible that even had the Salifeh Court been reasonably just-which was notorious -ly not the case-it would have been incapaitle of arriving at any decision. As a result of this state of affaire for a year or more 7 before the institution of reforms.divers who were protected ptr- sons &amp; whe appealed tol the agency for redress,when informed that the onl_v .nachinery J or dealipg with their cases was the 'Salifeh*, invariably dropped their cases, as the result was a foregone con clusion,,. the fact that they had complained^antagonised the Kakhud*.who sutjectod tnem to worse treatment tlian 'before o WJatn the reforms started there virtually existed no tribunal for tne settlement of diving uisputes. In 1924 a system was started whereby all Kaidmdas v/ere required to keep two accounts-a ^eneral account-and an individuat account for tach diver.The difficulty then arose of startin^ the in dividual accounts. Many divers had dived for years with their Uaichuda or had passed through several hands. There were cases in v/hich they had never had accounts for twenty years ana sometimes more,&lt;l!f. wntn some sort of account existed the diver had never had acc^esa to it &lt;Sc did not know how he stood. T o start the new systems/hen a case came io court, a compromise had to he effected 'between the partie s, failin^ this the case went to the radh'i in resptct of past accounts^- he contrived to make a compromise which was always accepted. In tue majority of cases the amount the diver was alleged to 'be in deht was based on pure surmise^ as no human 'bein^, could check the chaotic accounts outstanding over a long term of years. An analysis of a lar^e number of accounts any reasonable brought to light that had the divers been credited with^earnings they would generally have been in credit not in aebt. However a start had to be made as best we could &amp; with the new sysytem properly enfor -ced it was anticipated that the majority would work off their debts in the course of a few years / ,and that new divers would be protected in the future. \ As can be imagined this involved a prodigious amount of work in 1924 ( for most divers applied for adjustment of tiitir accounf^ kallam during his uerm here came in for a Certain number of the re maining cases, but as t£.e season was on &amp; the court in order not to delay the work does not take accounts disputes auring the diving,ue missed the thick of the work, Je have been gettin^ through most of the old accounts^ not disposed of in I924,durin ii the present cola weather• Coming into this work without previous experience / loallam must not unnaturally have found it difficut &amp; confusing,which I think accounts for his supposition that no ordinary court can ad--equately deal.with divin t disputes. Had ^allam been here sufficiently to ieaj.ly study tae diving question &amp; to take tlie measure ef Uxe local people, he could not have failed to come to tae. conclusion that there exists in Banrain no bsdy of men capable, or sulficiently disinterested ,te form a tribunal fit tadeal with diving disputes^before the new system has had full effect on the whole diving kZ-N T.ue Diving rules are not ; as i-allam appears to think, intricate in any ...,y dillioult,nor has there been / in introducing the reformsy any attempt made to alter the rules long established by custom. The mtrxaaitas of the situation arise from the appalling abuses which have been allowed to creep in during Shaik &lt;jsa&gt;s negligent rule,and it is the gradual elimination ef these abuses which necessitates,far some little time,diving cases being taken in a oeurt whicii is impartial,* which from the knowledge it derives from the many caees which come before it, is in a position to gradually frame rules which will prevent recurrence of the abuses, kallam must have nad extreme difficulty in distinguishing between customary rules,* what one may call customar; abuses,by which I mean abuses which in late years had become well ni to h customary^ut which knov^ to be a breach of the original rules . The customary diving rules are well known and can be clean. fr\su \s ' stated in a new 'code' of diving rules would cause an uproar and is quite unnecessary,all that is now required is ioiowledge^ combined with action, to put a stop to abuses of the well known coae, ^thas the court is rapidly effecting * the spade work has already been L ^ ne * Car * is essential for a few years to guard against backsliding. I have studied this particular Branch of the reforms ' 0re tlian an - / as it is by far the most important .The benefits of the reforms are already evident^and are mest encouraging^ there is Utile doubt that in a few years, if the system oe persevered in,almost all tiis aivcr^ will oe out of debt Jc the accounting system will then ^ SUOii a £illple fom tlle few disputes which could arisf would be immediately settlod.The most encouraging part of all this is, that there is a very distinct change in the attitude of the Kakhudas ' themselves,who are slowly realising the advantages. If they could revert-7h ^ oo the old ays t«m of no accounts and a mocK court, tiiey would probably prefer it,for in these cirtumstances the diners were slaves &amp; the Kaidiudas could not be called to account .But if the refoma are to continue they undoubtedly prefer that the casits be taken as at present in a court which they know to be unbiassed^ which is able to quickly dispose of thsir cas.es,- which all atree would nevei be in any I orm of Salifeh court which could at present 'be devised. Tiie Slate is at present aiming set tiie gradual eliminati.n of the system whereby the divers are kept pernanintly i&gt;^ d«bt.3y regulating the amount of advances made ,Lhi» is being rap idly achieved. It is interesting to note how this system na* arisen i become so abused.It has always been the custom for divers to recieve certain advances,such as the'Salaf when the season start!,to enable them to provide lor families while they are away, &amp; the 'Khanjieh' during the season,&amp; finally the 'Tisqam' after accounts have been settled for the season,which is by nature of a contract to dive with the same Ka^diuda next season. Kept within reasonable bounds ( as is the case in many places in the Gulf wnere the I.akhudas have bot acquired such a hold over diverse advance only sums which are reasonably covered by the seasons earnings) jthi there is nothing very harmful in this system,but of late years the prices of pearls having risen * the wealth of the Islands greatly increased,there are many wore persons engaged in the industry ae Kakhudas^ a shortage of divers arose. Avar^iciois Kakhudas started bribing the clivers of others, to tr ansfer their services,by paying off the alleged debt to the first Naidiuaa (generally much le a s than the diver nimself was told;) &amp; offering larger advances. In this way competition started^ up went the advances made,that is, the advances lor i i:e first few years e ach man dived . It might be sup posed that this was in favour of toe divers,but this is not so,the Ivakhudas continued the high advances in each case only sufficiently long to get the diver heasily indebted so that he could not buy himself out,&amp; there was li„tle danger in another K„khuda risking so much A lo take him away. Then tiu Hakhuda by swindling the diver out 01 iiifc earnings contrived to keep him steaaily in uebt.-&gt;7 All that had really happened was that the original coat of en- wlavin fa a diver for life had risen^ .wing to competition,teut the divers v/ere hopelessly tied up.&amp; in reality^ worse off than formerly, when occasionally, an energetic man could work in the off-seaoon «k the debt &amp; free himself. Of course the Naxhuda did not al ways have it his own way-sometimes the diver aiea aftefe\. k 4 easons / fclien he had genuinely, f or t he time being, * got awa^vith* the advances. Sometimes he bolted ( &lt;lc the Nitkhuda in either case lost his money. ^unavvays 1 have greatly increased of late years,^ many Nakhudas have been ruined inconsequence. The methods now being gradually introduced will decrease the risks of the ^akhudas, ic stop virtual enslavement of the divers. Most Nakhudas now realise that it will have advantage^ for them in lessening risk, &amp; as advances are limited by the State the only means of attracting another Kakhuda's divers will be by fairer treatment, that is by paying the diver his fair earnings. An abuse which had sprung up in this connection^was tnat ^akhuaas had begun to swindle one another by inducing divers Lo come to them without paying off the original debt and recievin^; a 'Barwah' . The first result of improved conditions will be for divers to tend to come to Bahrain,where they can _eta square deal. This is, in fact alrady becoming noticeable,A: herein lies the 'effect created in other chief ships 1 '.It is not a question of what xjpi form of court exists^ or does not exist^in Bahrain,which interests other chiefs,but the knowledge that the best divers will come to Bahrain.This is so, &amp; th^ natural consequence is that in ti e course of time-the divers must be better treated ir thi r~st of thw Gulf / we shall have achieved a more widespread improvemBHt th^n could kx have been at first fores«en. It is quite impossible to set forth all the details in a letter-I have nade no mention of th% various systems of diving- Khammas, T Azal, Madyan, t Ar v iil etc all of whic:. have their peculiar- -ities &amp; their individual abuses of their rules. To expiiin the full ramifications of tha abuses which have arisen ^ their alfect both on the industry &amp; on trade,it would require an extremely icn Jiy . I have collected infon ation with a vi v; to writing. it (g) such a treatise,but pressure of othsr werk ha. made it impoasitl- to ^lojuce it. [ i laj.i; en v:.« adviser has taken over some of ths vork J now deal with ( I shall he able to ^et on with it. I have tone into the questien of a Salifeh Court thoroughly a«d iun convinced that at this Juncture,it would be impossible to find anyone capable of doing the work. (I refer to the work as it is -i; the transition stagejduring which abuses are being eliminated i past accounts straightened out) &amp; that if we could patch up some thing ,the improvements effected would be doomed,^ great labour wasted. In two years I estimate the new system will be in full swing &amp; then any court / ' iJalif eh' or otherwise ; would be able to deal with the situation. Then however,when the abuses have been checked, &amp; accounts are on a simple basis,&amp; large debts practically non-exist- —ant,you will not find anybody wanting a •Salifeh' court. Han. of the enHghtened I.-khudas already say this - a 'Salifeh' is no use te them unless run on the old ( unjust lines, jjl - petition xiresented just before my return was an effort or the die-hards among the old type of Nakhuda ,&amp; its unreason ableness is patent. It sunounts to a demand fertile divers to be com pletely under their control &amp; for them to be able to imprison * punish at will. This being so'^it mky be assumed that the desire for a ' Salifeh' court is not for a reformed 1 Salifeh;werking or. '■■ e ' U '* s -P rohi l =iting abusea-but for the old 'Salifeh', which means no court at all.

Shaikh Hamad's proclamation to which you refer by no means covers all the diving rules which as a metter of fact are matters of custom rather than rules, and as such to be found in no proclamations either of Shaiicn Hamad or his pre- utcessors. The matters of custom have never been coded ana one gradually oictcs up bits ol information about them as one goes along. , ^ think the best account of the diving system will be found in ijaly f s 0,0. 53/9/5 dated the 20th February 1926 to your address. He had toearly 5 years experience behind him when he wrote this letter. Please turn to page 4 of this letter and read 1 rom the words 'The State is at present mining at the gradual elimination of the system whereby the divers are kept permanently in debt'. This will shov; you why the system of limiting Tisqam was started. Last year the rate of Tis( A am was Rs.100/- for the diver and Rs.80/- for the puller. This year Shaikh Hamad delayed 1ixing the Tisqam and on my asking the reason he told me that the delay was due to the absence of Belgrave, whom he wished to consult. Belgrave triea diving cases. Just before the return of Belgrave the Nakhodas petitioned Shaikh Hamad for certain reforms in the divin^ rules, ohaikh Hamad sent their petition to me and also gave me a list of 22 persons connected with the diving industry, and asked if I would like to consult them, as I told him frankly that I had tried no diving cases and did not consider* myself ^competent adviser on the customary laws relating to diving. Finally 1 selected 5 Arabs and after going through the KaJtiiodas T petitionii. with them I informed Shaikh Hamad of the advice preferred by these persons adding that I myself considered the limitation of Tisqam by executive order should continue so that the object desired i.e. the release of the divers from the bondage of debt should finally be achieved. I advised Shaikh Hamad before fixing the amount to consult 4 or 5 men of experience. One or two other matters which worked badly in practice were also discussed such as the right of a diver to hold up all diving woric and bring a pearling boat to Bahrein in order to settle a squabble v/ith his Nakhoda. I told Shaikh Hamad that I saw no reason why minor ad justments should not be made provided nothing was done which might lead in any way to the virtual enslavement of free men or the cheating of the divers by neglect in keeping up their accounts A** 4 whieh were the main points I wished to watch. One of the points to which objection was taken was the rignt of a two thirds majority of the crew of a pearling boat to veto the sale by the Nakhoda of their catch. The right which was conceded by Daly seems to have worked very badly in practice. The actual divers have never had any connection with the pearl trade and icnow nothing regarding the value of their catches. It was proposed tnat the former practice of leaving the sale wholly in the hands of the Nakhoda should be revived, and that the crew should have no knowledge of the transactions and no right of interference. I objected to this on the ground that it would revive the old scandals which resulted from the wnolesale cheating of the crews. I suggested as an alternative that the right of veto should be cancelled but that no sale should be valid unless made in the presence / or ; with the knowledge,, of 4 men elected by the crew, who should sign or impress their thumb impressions as witnesses of the sale. I explained that the object of this was to ensure that all the proceeds reached the persons who were entitled to them instead of sticKing to the palms of tne Nakhoda. Belgrave came back the day after I sent Shaikh Hamad this CLrrvourV-t reply but still the question of of Tisqam hung fire. About a fortnight ago Shaikh Hamaa sent me a further commu nication which contained a list of articles which the Najchodas ■ i3. CL*t 0^ (X propooed shoulbj guide #»if- Cam-tB. The first on this list v/as that Tisqara should be free 'but that Sallaf should be limited oy the orders of the Bahrein Government. Shaikh iibdullan at Shaiich Hajuad' s request came to discuss these articles witn me. He agreed with me that there was no differentiation between Tisqam and Salxaf. I asked Shaiich Abdullah to tell Shaijch Hamad to proceed with the fixing of the amounts of Tisqam, setting if he liked a maximum below which the UaJthoda and his crew would be at liberty to come to an agreement, but 1 said that something should be done as the crew and their families had to live and they relied on Tisqam for maintenance. Shaikh Hamad appears to have conferred witn the merchants and^then went off hawking. Three or four days ago Belgrave informed me that the Tisqam had been fixed at Rs.SO/- for divers and Rs.60/- for pullers, and that these amounts were considered by the divers to be very low. I informed Belgrave that 1 also considered them too low. The next move was that on Thursday 30th December about ^00 divers marched out to Sukhair where Shaikh Hamad was hawking to asK him to increase the amount of the Tisqam. Shaijcn Hamad appears to have promised to give the matter consideration, and fixed the divers up with some sort of accommodation for the night. Yesterday nothing happened. This morning being Lew fear day Shaikh Esa, who has also been out hawking for the past week, came in to call on me bringing a large number of his family including Shaikh Hamad, ^fter the departure of Shaiich Esa for Vuharraq, Shaikhsjllamad and Abdullah, who had seen him off, returned to the Agency and told me about the visit of the divers to Sukhair and asked me if I thought the Tisqam was too low. I said that the divers and their families relied on the Tisqam for maintenance and to pay past debts and that it was certainly too low. They then agreed to raise it to ris.100/- and 80/), being the same as last year and also to arrange, in the case of men, the whole of whose money went to repay past debts, that the merchants should advance them rice until the Sallaf. They said that before giving this out to the divers they wished to inform4. the merchants v/ho would make the actual payments, and would arrange for a deputation consisting ot 6 divers to meet them on konday to hear the dicision. Bel^rave was present at the latter end of this interview and he and Shaikh Hamad departed together for the Customs House, where they had some work. On arrival there thej 1 ound the iiOO divers assembled waiting for their answer. Instead of speaking to them himself Shaikh Hamad who was anxious to leave for his hawking sent them a message bji some saying that he would meet 6 of their representatives on Monday and give them his reply. He himself drove off in his motor for Bukhair. ^.fter his departure the 200 divers walked into the kanama market and commenced a little very looting. I have not got an estimate of the damage done, 'but it does not appear to have been very serious. As soon as Belgrave got to know of what was happening he sent word to Robinson who marched a squad of his men into the bazaar whereupon all was peace. In the meantime I was holding the annual majlis at the agency and in the middle of the congratulatory speeches ray Interpreter brought me news that 'the divers are looting the Bazaar'. Parke was present at the .agency and I told Shaikh Ali to inl orm him. He promptly went off to the Customs House and arrived in time to see the divers sail for liluharraq. It chanced that a guard ot his armed police intended for Muharraq was all ready to sail. He despatched them at once with orders to prevent mischief. The diners on arrival at Luharraq went to the house of an usurer, helped themselves to his rice and destroyed his records. They were on the point of marching down the bazaar when Parke's guard turned up, v«rhereu|)on they a'll ran away. Six were arrested and being foreigners have been sent to me for disposal. These are the facts so far as I have been able to ascertain them at present. The divers seem/ to have behaved lixe naughty schoolboys rather than men determined to be nasty, but I have no doubt that we shall obtain a large nuraoer of false claims as well as a few true ones. It seems to be the general opinion that if Shaikh Hamad had -' D.O.No.0.12, H . TE r v ' vT. ' ' '-n g) (i Political jigency/, Bahrejn, Dated the 9th January 1927. • iiJ .

The liuhaajraq raerhants were timid and shut up their heuses and placed guards on them, eleven of them c ^-irie to me as a Dexjutation on Monday saying that though they did not fear the o divers the,y feared the Bilastis or unemp^yahles who they stated were preparing to attack them that night. They asked for pro tection. I got Parke to increase th© numbers of his police in Muharraq and all was peace. On Wednesday the Jews came rushing to my office 10 arm. saying thty had shut their shops fearing attach and requested me to do something. I went down to the bazaar and found all the other shops open even those of Buniahs and everything as usual. I told the Jews to open their shops and not be such fools. It seems that some fellow had played a practical Joke on them by galloping past on a donkey shouting 'Shut your shops' We persuaded Shaikh Hamad to come to .Luharra^ for 3 days to talk matters over with all concerned and now things appear % to be in a fdUbfc. way to settlement. It has been decided to re-establish the Salifa Court about which Colonel Prideaux was keen, but with 4 members instead of the one Kakhuda who formerly had matters all his own way. Shaikh Hamad has agreed to my proposal to have a working diver dn the Court if we can find a suitable man. Belgravt thiks he can. Shaikhs Hamad and Abdullah have now gone off hawking again. Bustards are very plentiful this year and I think Shaikh Hamad considers it was a great concession to interrupt the most im portant business in the worl^ by coming to Lluharraq to settle m^re State affairs. 5 ^ in B.Stuart Horner, eta^M^ tJu. tU '3 . ^no. c/ i? 5 Confidential. fa®. /\lCrU~Ji — QjlOtJ, 9nA*i.

You will remember that last year the advances were fixed at Rs TOO for divers and Rs 80 for haulers, and ft that as a result of a demostration of divers at Kuharraq Shaikh Hamad very weakly gave way and allowed a fufcther advance of l \ s 30 for divers and 25 tor haulers. The only excuse for his weakness was that one of the leading nakhudc-s, Jabar bin rusal'am of Hide, veered round to the divers side after hav- supported thp other merchants and joined them in the demand for larger advances. It should be noted th t the divers have never realised that it is in their interests and to get them out of debt that these acv nces are controlled, but the merchants are more inclined tir n before to cut dov/n their ad vances as they are short of cash, and Jabar bin Jlusallam v/as probably actuated last year by a desire to embarrass his rivals who could ill afford the extra advances sanctioned, hen fi man owns five or six hundred divers it will be seen The object what a difference such an increase means. ist' of the ^rkbah advance is to .ceep the men's families while they are away diving. 3. This year the advances had been fixed at 80/- ?nd 60/- respectively, after consultation with the leading merchants, and the proclamation was published on the I4th ! T ay, after the Toint Court had risen, so that the Shaikh should not be involved in a similar demonstration and force our hands. t T ost of the foreign diver? were over at T'uharraq and Hiddpq (^u) Page 2. ^.nc 1 I had asked the '-dviser to send as many of the Indian Police over there as could be spared, together with Ca tain Parke, so that if any disorders as occurred three years ago should happen it would be possible to nip them in the bud. The foreign divers number in all several thousand men, many of them being little better than savages, particularly the Omanis and Fuscatis. 4. There was a considerable amount of excitement in a nam on the I5th, end 3ani as am Jews did their best to create a panic by closing their shops and hustling their gear aw: y to their houses. A deputation of Jews came round to see me in great alarm, and I told them that there was no cause for u- ■ T h e kept wel 1 in touch with the situation and as far as I could see there was no jus^tlicatior^any aixiai. excitement, out the incident shows what t]$ results of mass suggestion in a small place can be. 5. Since nothing had occurred by the I7th I hoped that the divers had made up their minds to take what they were given, but with complete unanimity they forged an entirely new v /eapon; none of then would go out , ; m dive at all. The Shaikh sent for Belgrave and talked so foolishly that I thought it better to take a hand and I asked higi to come and see me. T T e came in on the 20th, and Abdullah and Salman were also pre- , * sent. He talked very foolishly about the poor divers and the necessity of being generous to them. I told him that he was directly responsible for this years troubles by his unneces sary weakness last year, and asked him if he was going to pay the divers since the merchants had no money. He was, I regret a state of obstinate funk, and could not be brought to see that if the Government again altered their proclamation f-s soon as it was put up, simply because divers refused tto . o out, they were storing up trouble for the future. 6. brullah, ho lives in ah: ra - , was _ ■rehensive about the swarms of v/ild men who were hanging round it, and therevwere only two courses open to us.

The Bahrain Government had decided that they would not enforce decrees against the divers salafs, and I had agreed to this,but without enthusiasm / since it meant revising orders in over . hundred cases, and since almost all our divers had left their homes provided for and only vented their salafs to spend on new bishts and a final orgy of v/horing, but a new complication now arose. To accp^t a 1 tisqam 1 at the close of the year binds the diver to dive for that nakhuda in the en- j^i|, suing year, and men who had nearly paid off their debts did not want to bind themselves for another year by simply taking a loan of 20/*- This difficulty was tided over and next day a number of Bahrain boats set out and finally, to day, practically 1' tip rem inder of the fleet have &gt; hu '«**■«' . ^ 3.

Sir, I have the honour to say that I recently paid a visit to the pearling banks and 'boarded a considerable number of vessels almost all belonging to tfag Bahrain owners. The nakhudas and divers all appeared very glad to see me,but one or two were rather nervous that I might be interested in inspecting their diving licenses. I gave each boat a present of fresh limes and sugar to ward off scurvy and also distributed some medicine I had brought with me. Two divers who appeared to be seriously ill I brought back with me. One was found to have tubercolosis and cannot A live longer and the second was seriously ill with syphil/is. In spite of the conditions on the hanks,which to our minds appear appalling,the divers in general appear both healthy and contented. 7 saw no case of harsh treatment nor were any reported to me. I was everywhere informed that this year T s catch had so far proved extremely poor and was shown few pearls of any importance. There is a tendency,however,for nakhudas to conceal the discovery of fine pearls which they only show to those whom Am. they know to be in a position to buy them, 'the idea possibly being to keep prices dme*. CU ^sL The weather at the banks was very hot but calm^owing to the failure of the bareh and divers have been able to get in morework than is usual in the early part of the year and this in itself should produce a greater quantity, if of quality of pearls during this pearling season. I have the honour to be Sir, lour Most Obedient Servant, Political Agent,Bahrain.- Note by iir.TJelti ave, financial Adrlaer to the Bahrain Government, on Baiirain Pearl Fiohera. *♦*-*«***« 1 The ciivirj^ community in Bahrain conaiate of 3 catereriea; the ahore merchanta who do the bi^ buying and aelling and who either own or finance the boat a, tue nakhudaa or .'boat captains, and the large inarticulate mass of di'?«r», illiterate Arabs who were previously cueated and optreaned Ipy their employers, or rather their owners, the boat captains. / bout 15,000 local divers ^ out from Bahrain every aeaaon and it haa been eatimfited that nbout 100,000 men from the whole Qulf are employed on the banks every year. Attempta to improve the diving oyatem met with difficulties. The divers were auspicious and apathetic, the merchanta and captains ^ere violently opposed to cnan^ea that would looaen their hold over the men and until tne present l^naikh succeeded hi a father it was considered unpolitic to press for reforms. In 1924 Hia ixcellency shaikh Hamad in conjunction with :aJor Daly, who waa then political Agent, and with the aupport of tne (iovernment of India, took the matter in nand. Only a very few of tne more far ai r ^ited mercnanta, and the ihia and Sunnl Qjadia, supported the movement, but the reforms were finally pushed through mainly owing to the keen- nesa and energy of Vajor Jaly. The principal features ore aa followsi- X'he amount of the advance and the amount of intere.a permissible is If id down by law. Ko other charges may be do cited a^airst a diver. merchants and boat captains are compelled to keep regular accounts, which were octde out by a number of diving clerks who are authorised by the Covernment. Kvery diver keeps a small book issued by tne Government which aho^s his account with hie captain.

Note by The Hon , ble Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.3.E. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Pearl Diving Conditions (paragraphs 2 and 21 of Sir George's letter of 30th July 1936. In general the pearl diving conditions were much improved about 12 years ago by the Bahrain Government at the instance of His Majesty's Government and Sir George has been informed of this. 2. Sir George asks for H the terms of service of Bahrain pearl divers',(paragraph 21). Mr. Belgrave has sent inreport on the terms of service from time to time and there is a good deal about them in the Bushire and Bahrain files. When I return to the Gulf I will look up this point and see if it is possible to summarise the terms of service for Sir George's benefit. Id. T.C.P.Peraonsl Note. ~ a- ,Vith regard to the terms of service of the Bahrain pearl divers, there vvas one procedure which struck me as perhaps verging on slavery or indentured labour, as follows : 2. A» with a diver in his employ, who owes him R8 ,50/- is himself indebted to B for Ra.lOO/- A can transfer the divert services to B until the diver has worked off the debt of Rs« 50/- But Mr.Belgrave ejcplains that this is only possible under the following conditions 1. B must own diving boats, i.e. be in a position to emplcry and pay divers. 2. If the diver refuses to have his services transferred to B he cannot be forced to work for B by the Court, A can however,as in any other country, sue the diver for debt in the Bahrain Court who would give a decree if they find the claim proved. The procedure then is for the court to issue a 'Barva' (document) to the diver to the effect that he can dive for khom he pleases but that the new nakhuda with whom he works must pay into the court a percentage of the divert earnings which goes towards liquidating the diver's debt to his original nakhuda. In practice in such circumstances divers generally prefer to work with B as they are then sure of finding employment. Id.
