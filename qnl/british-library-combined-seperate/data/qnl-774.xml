This system forks on f.30 to form a third foliation sequence, which is out of step with the second sequence due to the fact the 1st folio marked with this sequence is labelled with a range; these numbers are also not circled, written in pencil and can be found in the same position as the other two sequences.Foliation Errors: 1A and 1B.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence related to tensions between Bahrain (and the Al Naim tribe) and Qatar concerning the ownership of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula that took place between March and June 1937.At this time, the Al Naim tribe were allied to the Al Khalifa ruling family of Bahrain who claimed Zubarah as a part of their own territory (the family had been based there before their conquest of Bahrain in 1783). The British authorities did not recognise the Al Khalifa's claim to Zubarah and mediated between the two sides. The file contains extensive details of this mediation process.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000156#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000156#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000156#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
