In Iraq the populations of Kojif, Kerbala and Kadhimian and Basra are popularly ; and probably rightly, supposed to have a large percentage, over 50p of persons of Persian origin. Ihe population of al Qatif, and some of the settlements nearby, in Saudi Prabia are said to be largely Persian in origin. On the other hand there are large numbers of •'Arabs' 1 * in Iran, both on the Gulf Coast and in in? ab is tan and inland, there are whole ''Arab' tribal confederations between Shiraz and Bandar Abbas. In point of fact, Kuwait is well known in the Kiddle East as an ' A.rab (I:e jdi)' 1 tov/n with a strikingly 'pure d.rab’' and 'unspoilt' appearance and population. In this, it is almost, if not quite, unique, as there arc no bigger towns than Kuwait in ^rabia, and the Hejaz towns population is much more mixed than that of Kuwait. The only town in Iraq which in any way resembles Kuwait is Zobeir, opposite the Kuwait frontier, where many of the population are lie jdi Arabs by origin. JIUKAIT POLICE . It has been reiterated in the Iraqi Press that the Shaikh of Kuwait employs Persian Police, with the alleged intention of cowing the ..rabs of Kuwait. Enquiry reveals tnat not a single man or even remote Persian origin is employed in the Police, or, for that matter, among the Body Guards and 'Fidawiya'. Until the late Mutassarif of Basra, Tahsin Ali, mentioned it m July 1950 to the x^olitical Agent, a 'Persian problem' 1 in Kuwait had not been heard of by the Agency. In any case emigration and settlement of Iranians in Kuwait has long been forbidden/(2) ? 3. forbidden by the local authorities* and the present Kuwaitis of distant Persian origin* if they were to leave Kuwait would disturb the life of the 'Arab‘ 1 community to which they now belong* and of which they are a part. 54-.

This Brigade* it is understood* is to be the Brigade at present stationed at Basra* i.e. for the defence of . aora. Reasons given out for the move arc (a) health of the tr )ops (b) erpense of continuing to rent land at Basra* but neither of these seems a very good reason* because the Iraqi Government is quite capable of acquiring the land it wants (as the Shaikh of Kuwait well knows) and the soldiers of the Iraq . rmy are fully inured to the malarial valleys of Kurdistan and the insect-invested marshes* towns and canals of lower Iraq* their homes. Pear of the might of Iran is said to be prevalent in the Higher Iraqi Military circles* and if there is not some other reason for this move* it can only be supposed that their fear of Iran has reached such a point that it is intended to abandon the defence of Basra if attacked* (since Zobeir is for military purposes practically cut off from Basra .every time it rains/i 4. rains at all hard or the floods rise, and is fifteen miles from it.) • The British Military Hission in Iraq may of course have full information as to the real reasons for this move. (h) On the 9th and 10th of ^pril reports were current in official circles in Basra that delegations r'ere arriving from Kuwait and ITejd to join in the Basra mourning for the late King C-hazi. It was said that the iiutassarif had waived all visa regulations for coming or going and that free transport was to he provided hy Iraq. Later the newspaper :i hl Karkh'' of Baghdad of loth April reported that the Kuwait delegation; some 500 persons? had bee turned back by the Kuwait olice at Jahra by order of t he Kuwait au thoritic s. In fact no delegation? and no individuals? left Kuwait for Basra for this purpose. Hot even a small' : delegation came from Kuwait ? or as far as is known from Kejd? or intended to do so. (c) The Basra fort authorities have erected posts on Kuwait territory? along the shore of the Bahai tin Bay and the Xhor Subiya? without permission from or intimation to the Kuwait authorities. This is understood to have been done under the direction of hr. Coster (who was involved in the cutting of date trees on the Shaikh’s estates without permission last summer) who? it is said in Basra? has been engaged on a survey 'at the request of the Foreign Office'. (d) The Kutassarif of Basra had denounced to the Shaikh’s son the activity” of the Political Agent in Kuwait? and according to the Shaikh’s son he added that all their difficulties came from adhering to the British and their policy? and that more difficul ties would? therefore? come to them in the future. (e) According to rumours in Basra the rutassarif of Basra has offered to facilitate the making of a settlement at Umrn Qasur on the Khor Zobeir, by the uonulrtion of Kuwait.Cm) |o 5. (f) The press campaign from Iraq against ICuv/ait, which continues, reached far afield. The Arabic newspaper 'A1 Sayan'' edited in I7ew York, published, on the 23th February, a letter from a correspondent in Beirut. The letter purported te descri e the situation in Kuwait, and said that the Amir refused to ratify the Constitution, under pretence that it was detrimental to his family. The letter also says that the 'nationalists' are hunted out by the British authorities that all the civil servants are foreigners, and that Arabic is scarcely spoken now. 57. Germany . One Kurt Lori, a German subject, electrical and wireless engineer, with wife and two children, arrived here on thellth from Kao in a top heavy looking 3 ton sailing canoe with auxiliary engine without visas for anywhere, but having been permitted to clear for Kuwait and Bahrain by the Basra Port Officer and for Kuwait via Abadan by the Collector of Lrcise (Hr. kingrow) on Larch 20th. In the course of an interview, he requested the Political Agent to obtain for him a visa for Bahrain 'in order to obtain work there*'. The visa was subsequently refused by the Bahrain authorities. He cleared on the 15th for al patif, Saudi -Arabia.. but in the direction of mao whither he had been advised to return. He writes and types Bnglish and speaks Arabic . There is reason to believe he may now try to go down the Iranian coast via Bushire. The Iraqi Customs authorities (hr. Kingrow) said they heard that the man had been arrested, in Kuwait, and asked the British Consul, Basra, to intervene on his behalf. 58. hote oroloyical .

Tehran, January 21, 1937. ’ HIS Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, in his despatch to you No. 605 of the 22nd December, referred to the belief entertained by the chiel of the Ir aqi Heneial Staff that an attack by Iran on Iraq was a menace sufficiently real to call loi notable increase in the military forces of Iraq. . ^ .i • 2 The military attache to this Legation has prepared a report on tins subject, which I enclose. His conclusion, with which I agree, is that an attack on Iraq would be so dangerous to Iran at present, and in the foreseeable futuie, a. It is^verv difficult indeed to forecast the policy of the Iranian Government in the event of any serious crisis in world affairs. The Shah is the Government, and no one is inclined to prophesy what will happen when his complete control of all the activities of the State comes to an end. Most foreign observeis heie think that one of the main features of his policy is so to order his relations with neighbouring States as to secure that the succession of his son shall at any iate, not be endangered from outside. This is a sensible policy and, His Majesty ben g fundamentally a sensible man, it seems natural that he should continue to follow it 7 The Shah, or, indeed, any firmly-established Government in this country, would none the less be subjected‘to certain obvious temptations if it should ever appear that His Majesty’s Government were so deeply engaged elsewhere that they could safely be ignored in the Persian Gulf, fn such an event the Iranian Government of the time might well try to realise their well-known ambitions m the Gulf and the Shatt-el-Arab. In this way a dangerous conflict of interests between Iran and Iraq might well come about. This is the contingency which the Prime Minister of Iraq contemplates, and it is perhaps not unnatural that the Arm} Command should take steps to guard against it. At the same time the Persian Gulf is, I suppose, one of those regions the fate of which is more Ji kel y&gt; m , the event of war. to be settled in accordance with the general result of the war than bv the efforts of the States of the Middle East. , , , 5 x am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s Ambassador at Bagdad, No. 7. j have&gt; &amp;c .

It requires, besides, information not m , \ easily obtainable. Intention. . ,^ T &gt; . j In my opinion, there exists in Iran no intention to ^ hostilities against Iraq. This opinion is based on the following leasons . (i) Iran is preoccupied with industrial development. • , om&gt;ces ii) The Iranian Government itself must realise that the ^^Hm without of the country would not permit the waging ot a war of any long ‘^ 'dion with a complete cessation of all expenditure on public works and State-aided comm^cialmiterpnseSn ^ m betome a comparatively weak State situated between two strong ones, of one of which she stands in consideiable awe, and the other of which she still believes to be imperialistic. , • k (iv) Iran is busy in making a new model army and would piefei not to its defeat by employing it in its present imperfect state m any duties othei tha those of internal security. , . . ,, , , ^ Q t (v) The higher military and financial authorities would be loth to expend, at the rate demanded bv modern warfare, the comparatively small amount () ammunition and other war material which they have bought at high prices and which, with true oriental short-sightedness, they have laid up in cotton-wool m their arsenals. ^ , Against this, but not so strongly as to nullify it, may be set a contrai} tendency on the part of the more junior ranks to relish war as an opportunity to try out all their new toys and to “ see how they work. .... (vi) The Iranian army, though not inconsiderable in size, is, m the present state of the country, no more than adequate for its main role, which is to preserve order in the capital (as an ever-present instrument of the k^hah s authoiity) and in the provinces where, as in Meshed recently, need for its employment is occasionally felt, and chiefly on its borders. ... „ . . As has been frequently stressed by me, the tribal situation confronting the Iranian General Staff is not a simple one. The circumference of Iran is, approxi mately, 3,500 miles, and about 2,500 miles of this is tribal territory inhabited by hardy and intrepid hillmen who, for centuries, have supplemented the scanty living they win from their flocks and fields by plundering caravans and making forays into the richer valleys. Thus, the Iranian Government has 2,500 miles of potentially hostile frontier to cope with, as against a length of approximately 450 miles in the case of the north-west frontier of India. Moreover, the dangerous section of the Indian frontier lies in one main line of advance from the centre. l e north-west, whereas the lines of advance to the Iranian danger zones radiate like the spokes of a wheel and it is possible, though not probable, that the Iranian army might, in the case of a concerted rebellion, have to wage war in seven different directions at once, i.e., against the Turkomans, Baluchis, Arab tribes, Qashgais, Bakhtiaris, Lurs and Kurds. The Iranian Government may be considered extremely fortunate that in the past lack of cohesion, common interests and ethnographical unity has prevented tribal insurrection from spreading from one tribe to another, if not right round the rim of the country. If, in India, eighty years after the mutiny, it is still found necessary to maintain such a large British garrison, surely the Iranian Government would be foolhardy to denude the capital of troops or to concentrate on its western frontier troops actually engaged at the moment in quelling insurrection on its eastern boundaries. (vii) As far as I can judge, I can find no trace of any bellicose spirit pervading the whole Iranian army. Junior officers in all armies are prone at times to express themselves unguardedly, and the Iranian, with his conceit, is no exception. Without doubtthere are many young hot-heads who think and say that, given the chance, they could mop up Afghanistan or Iraq in a few days, but such ebullient utterances must not be taken as indicating the Iranian army as spoiling for a fight. The idea that the authorities might favour a little blood-letting in order to keep the savage Iranian soldiery quiet is too extravagant to merit attention. ^ Bacon’s theory that “ great perils commonly demand great pleasures is hardly tenable here and to swagger up the Lalezar ogling the women and shouldering the odd civilian into the gutter is, probably, the most, by way of a Thursday evening’s fun, which the average Iranian officer demands. (viii) Does a casus belli exist 1 ? The Iranian is admittedly a bad neighbour, and Afghans, Turks, Iraqis and British alike can testify to the lack of co-opera tion shown by the Iranian frontier commissars. But petty acts of annoyance and removing their neighbour's landmarks seem, hitherto, all they have attempted. (ix) To what extent is this Iraqi fear of Iran justified? Have they .my information, or is it just a figment of Bekr Sidqi s brain? I he Ambassadoi suggests a very good reason—that of a political move to maintain a large force under his control, or a lever to extract by intimidation enough money to enlarge and re-equip the Iraqi army. ... . . I submit that this bogey man has been present in Iraqi imagination for a long time before Bekr Sidqi took office. On several occasions I have been asked r\ Air Force Intelligence to refute rumours told them by Iraqi observers to the ettect that 10,000 men had been concentrated here or the status of that brigade raised to a division. In each case the rumour turned out to be absolutely without foundation. Means. Owing to paucity or non-existence of supply and transport services and the fact (stressed above) 'that troops engaged in internal or frontier security duties cannot be taken away from those duties, I believe that the 3rd (Western Azerbaijan) Division will remain immobilised on the line Khoi-Maku-Kezaieh Sauj Bulagh. Similarly, the 5th (Senneh) Division will remain immobilised on the line Sanlasht-Merivan-Nausud. Similarly, the 6th (Khuzistan Division will remain immobilised on the line Khurramabad-Ahwaz-Khurramshahr. By wholesale commandeering of civilian motor transport (of which the bulk is to be found in the capital), one division of the Central Garrison could be mobilised as a field force for employment against Iraq . , The strength of this force (supposing that all units were up to strength and that conscripts under elementary training could be replaced by drafting) would be 1,465 cavalry, 8,000 infantry and 64 guns, which may be said to represent, roughly, one cavalry brigade, two infantry brigades and five brigades of artillen ton a four-gun battery basis). . , « ^ i Supposing that fighting on interior lines, a superior system of road anil railway communications, the possession of transport and supply services and the more tranquil state of the country (as compared to Iran) would enable Iraq to nlace hei entire army in the field, it is seen that the one cavalry brigade, two infantry 1 briqadef and five artillery brigades of Iran will be confronted with one cavalry brigade, two infantry division* and three artillery brigades of Iiaq, not the Iranian air force could take the air, I fi l machines of varying types (including a high percentage of training seventy-five ma f t ed w ith the fifty-five aircraft at present shown as the machines) would be confiontedmtn tn^^ • deranw in favour of Iran is disimuited iy he nature'of the terrain, lack of training in bombing and machine- uisLOunteu pnuinment of the Iranian air force. g ' n Thi^cakulation, it must be noted, is on the basis of Iraq's present strength and d(*s not take into account the expansion reported as being undertaken m the very near future. . , T , , , , i a™ tWpfore that I can draw is that Iran would not, and I he only c °nclub , j at present, and that in the future the could not, take the vjW • f or ces are likely to exceed those effected m the toices oi i q D pYBUS, Military Attache.7^ In any further communieution on I his subject, please quote No. /^. and address —not to any per “The Under-Secretary of State r*. , .k .. ■ 44 ^ Af/ i i KO ion by name, Kut/to— B I J j ite,” Foreign Office, London, S.

Si ri Bagdad, December 22, 1936. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a note(') by General Hay on the military policy of the new Government. 2. Iraq, like the rest of the world, is strengthening her defensive forces. Bekr Sidqi, the new chief of the General Staff, has decided for the present to concentrate on completing the establishment of the two existing army divisions, on modernising their armament, and improving the efficiency of their personnel. He aims at doubling the strength of the Royal Iraqi Air Force during the coming year. • • j 3. This will necessarily involve the Government m recurring and non recurring expenditure, and I am sending, under a separate despatch, a revised estimate of the requirements of the armed forces totalling £1,500,000. I under stand that the period over which this amount is to be spent has not yet been decided 4. The chief of the General Staff has spoken to the Cabinet a great deal about the menace of an attack by Persia, and has impressed them by his argu ments. He also appears to have convinced the Prime Minister that it is urgently necessary to carry out the new programme in order to keep the army quiet. For these reasons. Hikmat Sulaiman has several times pressed me to do my utmost to ensure that there shall be no delays in obtaining from the United Kingdom the arms and munitions which the chief of the General Staff requires. 5 . General Hay does not comment in his note on General Bekr Sidqi’s fears of Persia. The Prime Minister has, however, told me that what his Government are afraid of is that, at some not very distant date, Great Britain may become seriously involved in difficulties in Europe or in the Far East, and that Persia may seize the opportunity to attack or threaten Iraq, and that, in these circumstances, the Iraqi Government might have to face Persia alone. 6 . Other observers here take the view that the Persian bogey is only General Bekr Sidqi’s bluff to cover his plans for consolidating a strong and mobile army amenable to his personal control. There are several arguments which can be put forward in support of this view, and I think that the situation might be made clearer if, provided you see no objection, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran could be asked to appreciate the possibilities of the Persian army being able to take the field against Iraq. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. 1 have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a short law amending the National Service Law of 1934, which was recently passed by t ie Chamber of Deputies^ 1 ) The purpose of the first two articles is to make it lawful for conscripted men to be assigned, for their colour service, to a gendarmerie as well as to units of the regular army. . „ 2. There is at present no gendarmerie in Iraq, but a joint committee or military and police officers is now working out a scheme for the creation of a of this kind. It is intended that this new force shall be trained and commanded by army officers, and that it shall take over much of the work now done by the police, including the patrolling of roads, the rounding up of brigands and armed highway robbers, and operations to deal with minor tribal disturbances. It is proposed that the strength of the gendarmerie shall be about 6,500 men, and that the police shall be proportionately reduced. Their present strength is about 498 officers and 8,646 other ranks. . 3 The supporters of the gendarmerie scheme argue that it will produce a better trained and more efficient organisation than the police to keep order in the provinces, and will at the same time bring about considerable economies, since, through the National Service Law, the rank and file of the force will be paid fai less than the policemen whom they are to replace. They also believe that, by relieving the police of the semi-military duties which they now carry out, the new scheme will lead to an improvement in the normal work of the force. 4 . It seems to me doubtful whether these arguments are sound. On the face of it, it is improbable that raw conscript recruits, who are strangers to the country in which they are working as gendarmes, will be able to carry out at all effectively the tasks which they are to take over from the police. At the same time their military training is likely to make them far less mobile than the police. In the matter of economy also it is doubtful whether much is to be gained, since the additional expenses of maintaining and rationing a military force in barracks is likely to absorb most, if not all, of the saving effected by reducing the pay of the men from dinars to half a dinar a month. 5 . The present proposal is that the gendarmerie should be under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, but I suspect that the sponsors of the scheme (which originated with the Chief of the General Staff) are aiming at the ultimate capture of effective control for the army. If they succeed, the authority of the Ministry of Defence will be very widely extended, and the influence of the army greatly enhanced. . . , ., , ^ ^. Q Nor can I feel confident that there is not considerable danger that this power will be abused. The conduct of the army, in the several internal punitive operations which it has undertaken since Iraq entered the League of Nations, has shown that it is distressingly prone to bullying and highhandedness. And as their numbers and influence increase I hear more and more of the adoption by Iraqi officers of what has come to be known as Prussian methods. 7 Until recent years the army was not a factor in internal affairs. But, since the Assyrian troubles of 1933, it has begun to develop political importance, and, during the past year, the several tribal operations, followed by periods of martial law which took place both in the north and the south of the country, gave the army commanders wide opportunities for influencing the internal policy of the Government. The introduction of national ser\ice has also gi\en new power to the army over the lives of the people in all parts of the country. If, in (9 Not printed. [656 z—2]addition to this, the army obtains control over the new gendarmerie, the civil executive may become virtually subordinate to the Ministry of Defence, and the consequences may be serious and far reaching. 8. I therefore view with considerable misgivings the changes foreshadowed by the amending law to which I have referred above. I have discussed the scheme with Mr. Edmonds, the adviser to the Ministry of Interior, and i am glad to find that he is urging his Minister to safeguard for the civil authorities effective control over the new force. He is also drawing the Minister s attention to the practical difficulties and disadvantages inherent in the chief of the General Staff s proposals. It is possible, therefore, that he may succeed in bringing about modifications in the scheme which will rob it of some of its dangerous potentialities. I shall, nevertheless, watch this matter with particular care, and shall not fail to keep you informed of all important developments. 9 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

This clause was deleted from the Bill in the course of its passage through the Chamber#, but the plans for conscription which are now submitted are intended to apply only to the inhabitants of towns and/and settleaie»t tribes, and no effort will 'be made to enforce it in the more difficult districts. The troubles in the Euphrates District in the Spring of this year demonstrated the necessity of some re-organisation of the army, hut the general staff do not intend to allow their hand to he forced and the new measures are to he introduced gradually. 3 (U —' J— L - (- r /t 17 SFP c °toMJTT ?9*c es.Copy .

Luring the past year plans have been elaborated for the application of conscription to certain sections of the population of ^raq. So far as is known this will only apply to the inhabitants of the towns and to the settled tribes for it is understood that no effort will be made to deal with nomadic tribes or with Kurds in the mountain areas* normal procedure * 2. 'The Regulations for Calling up Conscripts' are to be put in force from 1st July, 1935* 3* Under these Regulations two sets of lists of all men liable for service, i*e. those of 19 years of age, are to be submitted to the Recruiting Staff - the first set compiled by mahallas or villages is sent to the District Recruiting Officer, the second list compiled by Liwas is sent to the Director of Recruiting at the Ministry of Defence* 4* Each such list, Jmown Executive List No.l, after examination by the Recruiting Staff assisted by a census officer and the local muichtar or head of village is to be posted up publicly and will state the time and place at which each man on the list is to present himself before a Recruiting Board for Preliminary Examination* 5* The Recruiting Boards consisting of:- President:/President: A senior administrative officer of his representative# Members: (Recruiting Officer (Census Officer (MuJchtar or head of village (a selected member of the (2 Medical Officers will carry out the Preliminary Examination of all men on List Ho#l and will prepare 'Executive List No.2' showing men considered fit for service# all men in this List No.2 will be issued by the Recruiting Board with a Service Book for whose custody they are personally responsible# These preliminary examin tions will take place during 1st April and 3otn June# 6# The Final Examination for all men on List No.2 will take place during September and October as ordered by a Royal Iradaho At this examination the identity of men called up will be definitely checked and the medical examination will decide the category of service, combatant or con-oombataut, for which the accepted conscript is considered fit* 7# Further detailed arrangements are raaue for postpone ment of service of men temporarily unfit, for exemptions, and for punishment of those who fail to present themselves for examination or otherwise infringe the National Defence Law* 8# The men approved at the Final Examination will undergo the training period of the arm for which they are selected (see para#10 below) and at the completion of training those required for drafting into the Army for Colour Service will be selected by Ballot, the Colour Service of the remainder being postponed# Specia l arr a ngements for 1936* 9# During the first few years of application of the National Defence Law the above procedure will be varied in that4 classes are to be taken into consideration viz:- ages census likely to be in 1936. figures available for service. 1914 class 22 33,000 16,500 1915 «« 21 28,000 14,000 1916 n 20 16»vjo0 8,0 00 1917 n 19 14,000 7,000 91,000 45,5o0 The census figures for these classes are interesting and are considered to shoa that there has been extensive falsification of ages in the hopes of avoiding service. Of the above census figures it is estimated that b0°jb only will be eligible for service the remainder being medically unfit or exempted on cash payment or for other reasons - vide Chapters 1 &amp; II Articles 11 to 19 of the above quoted law. 10. During 1936 it is proposed to train the whole of the 1917 class calling it up in two batches, in January 1936 and September 1936. The period of training will vary according to the arm of the Service e.g. Infantry 3 months Cavalry A artillery 6 months Engineers, Signals &amp; M.T. 6 months These training periods are not included in the period of Colour Service laid down in article 3 of the Law. It is expected that during 1936 about 4,000 men will be required for drafting into units of the ^raq Army; the balance will be sent direct to the Reserve, and are liable for the annual training periods not exceeding 6 weeks according to Article 8 of the Law. 11. It is also proposed to call up a proportion of the 1914 class for shorter periods of training, (6 weexs to 2 months) ana on tne conclusion of these periods they will be drafted to the Reserve. The remainder of this class will rasato the Reserye quite untrained and will remain liable to be called up unaer Article 8 of the Law. It is hopec to train from 10,000 to 14,000 in this way. 12. During 1937 and possibly 1938 it is understood that a proportion of the 1915 and 1916 classes will similarly be given short nerxods of training before passing to the Reserve. 13. It is realised that men subjected to such re stricted training will not be fitted to take their places in the ranks of combatant units, but they could be used either for such incorporation after a further period of post-mobilization training or for labour battalions and other work on the Lines of Communication. 14. Thus while the short training of the older classes may not be highly effective it will on paper at least produce a considerable Army Reserve, and it will catch many of tnese persons who nave resorted to age falsification to avoid their liability to serve. 15. It is too early to make any close estimate of the number of reservists that will be produced,but the following forecast at end of 1936 is offered as a guide 16 .

They will form a reservoir for the prouuction of H.C.O 1 a in all arms ana a stiffening of b tter trained men in the mounted anu technical arms* Thus it is expected that the proportion of long service volunteers will be 33#l/^ in the cavalry and artilery, and 50^ in the engineers, signals and M#T# but this question i.s still undeciued. However these proportions are lively to be exceeded during the next few years until the present enlisted men have become time expirea# British Military Mission, 24th July, 1935#Memorandum on the aupans ion o £ tft e * Ira ^ Army 1955 - 1936 1* In March 1935 the * Iraq Army consisted of:- £ regimenta of cavalry 3 batteries of field artillery ^totalling £4 3 batteries of mountain artillery)guns &amp; hows# 12 battalions of infantry 3 frontier battalions and various other units and services For 1935/1936 it had been proposed to increase the army by 3 battalions of infantry and 2 batteries and £ sections of artillery, giving a total of 36 guns and howitzers* £• Tne troubles in the Euphrates in March ana May 19t5 showed up the shortage of troops in ’Iraq as, in order to furnish sufficient units for the south, the north and east were practically denuded. 3* Consequently the formation of the three proposed battalions was accelerated anu the raising of a fourth was oruered, while the artillery were to be increased to 48 guns and howitzers by raising all batteries from a 4 gun to 6 gun establishment. The programme for the succeeding years was also revised. 4. Plans had already been drawn up for the organisation of the army during the year 1936/1937 into 2 divisions, each of 3 infantry brigades of 3 battalions and 2 artillery brigades of 3 batteries (24 guns and howitzers per division) and one cavalry brigade of 3 weak regiments but considerable pressure was now applied by the Government for the speeding up this programme anu for an immediate expansion to 3 divisions. Over this matter the utneral Staff took up a firm stand pointing out that the grave shortage of officers ana the time required for the purchase and delivery of the necessary arms and equipment woulu not allow of any such precipitate action5* (a) The plan non adopted is that aurin^ 19^6/1937 sufficient formation and units will be raised to allow of the organisation of 2 divisions, each of 12 battalions (and this includes the three existing frontier battalions) and 36 guns and howitzers (with the exception of one battery which will not be formed until the following year) and of a cavalry brigade of 3 weak regiments* The divisions are to be complete with engineers, signal units, and a cadre of M.T* and medical services. One of these divisions is to be located in the Southern District ana the other distributed between the Eastern and Northern Districts* (b) In 1937/1938 further gradual expansion is to continue (including the formation of a second frontier brigade of 3 battalions to be stationed between MaITDaLI and AMaFU) with a view to reorganisation of the army by 1939/1940 on a basis of 3 Divisions ana Army troops* 6* (a) The divisions will eventually be located as under let Division - Southern District at BAGHDAD and ^ARAGHAN with H.Q. at Baghdad* 2nd Division - Eastern ana Northern Districts with H.Q. at EIHiOiA* 3ra Division - Southern District between EILLAB ana BASRaH with at BIWaHIYaH (b) Each division to consist of:- 3 infantry brigades of 3 battalions 2 artillery brigades each of 3 batteries of 6 guns or howitzers* Signal battalion M.T.

The above organisation has crystalised out after much discussion and after consideration of various alterative schemes. It is unlikely that it will be adhered to integrally but it shows the sound lines on which progress is being planned. 9.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 338 oiLthe 19th June, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the regulations which have now been published for the conscription of proportional quotas of recruits in areas where census operations have not yet been completed.! 1 ) This system of recruitment was provided for in article 38 of the National Defence Law of 1934 and the regulations now published lay down in detail how it shall be brought into effect. 2. As Sir Francis Humphrys reported in the fifth paragraph of his despatch No. 19 of the 10th January, 1934, it is chiefly in the tribal areas that the census has not yet been completed, and the purpose of the provisions of article 38 of the National Defence Law is to facilitate the application of conscription to the tribes. Under the arrangements which have been made for the recruitment of a proportional quota, it will not be necessary to go through the elaborate procedure of calling up the yearly class and of casting lots for the annual quota of men required for colour service. Instead, the special local committee will fix the quotas on the basis of the estimated population and the local sheikhs will then produce the number of men required. For some years the annual quotas called to the colours are likely to be relatively small and it is not anticipated that there will be any serious difficulty in obtaining the necessary men from the tribal areas in the manner which has now been prescribed. 3.

I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss with Yasin Pasha the immediate plans of the Iraqi Government, but I gather that they intend to proceed slowly, and that the first quota (article 14) is not likely to exceed 1,000 or 1,500 men. These will be drawn mainly from the urban population. 4. For some years the cavalry, air force and mechanised units are likely to be maintained on the present voluntary basis. 5.

The local press in publishing this notification have not been slow to point to it as an indication that the new Cabinet intend to devote themselves seriously to the task of putting into effect the National Service Law, which has formed the subject of correspondence ending with your despatch No. 82 of th e 5th February. 3. It is in fact true that the new census operations are being carried out as a preliminary to conscription. But Sir Kinahan Cornwallis informed me, as long ago as last July, that serious operations would be started with this object during the month of September, so that the present Cabinet cannot with justification claim credit for this step. Nor can it be regarded as an indication that they intend to take any hasty measures regarding the introduction of conscription. EASTERN (Iraq). September 17, 1934. ' CONFIDENTIAL. V. Section 1.

The Ministry of Defence anticipate that it will be possible, under this law, to create a force of some three thousand trained men during the first year of its operation. 4. The law will be repealed as soon as the National Service Law has been brought into force and has created an adequate reserve for the conscript army. 5.

WITH reference to my despatch N o. 797 of the 20th December, 1933, I have the honour to report that the National ServiceTLaw was read for the second time in the Chamber on the 4th January. 2. The occasion was heralded in the local press with a crescendo of ebullient jingoism coupled with perfervid appeals to the nation to arm which seemed completely to ignore the principles of the Kellogg Pact (to which Iraq acceded only two years ago) and to be sublimely oblivious to the efforts at present being made elsewhere to effect some measure of disarmament. In the Chamber there was equal enthusiasm and the importance of the occasion was marked by the presence of the King in the Royal gallery. It is unnecessary for me to comment in detail on the speeches of the Deputies, most of whom were clearly speaking for effect, and with little sense of responsibility. I enclose, however, a summary of the speech made by the rapporteur of the Military Committee when presenting the Bill^ 1 ) and also of the speech made by Ali Mahmud,^) a well-known Bagdad! lawyer, who made the most forceful speech of the debate. 3. These two speeches were echoed by most of the other speakers and their sentiments sufficiently indicate the general attitude of the Chamber towards the Bill. That many Deputies secretly entertained very different views may well be imagined, but no discordant voice of criticism was lifted to spoil the perfect harmony of approbation. 4. ' The important article 38, to which I referred in my previous despatch, was severely criticised in the Military Committee on the ground that it set up an unjustifiable discrimination between different sections of the nation, and this view was heartily supported by a number of Deputies. The Government accordingly proposed the following alternative article, which was referred by the Chamber for consideration :— Article 38. (a) The Government may, should the public interest so require, apply the proportional quota system in localities where no census of the population has been made in accordance with a special regulation. (b) Such proportional quota shall be equivalent to the quotas ordered in localities where a census of the population has been made. (c) The proportional quota system shall be applicable in such localities as may be indicated by Royal irada, and its application shall cease when a census of the population has been carried out in the locality concerned. 5. Nuri Pasha has explained to me that, generally speaking, the census has not yet been taken in those areas (such as the Pizhder districts of the Suleiman liwa and steppes of the Shammar Bedouin in the Northern Jazirah) where the application of the law might prove difficult, and that under the provisions of article 38 as now redrafted, it will be possible in such areas to satisfy the requirements of the law by calling up a small fixed quota through the local chiefs without going through the form of conscripting all men eligible for service. : The present plan is to proceed very gradually with the formation of the conscript army, beginning with not more than one regiment of three battalions. In conse quence, for a number of years to come the required quota of conscripts for the whole country will be very small. Nuri Pasha feels confident that this device will enable the Government to avoid the dangers of trying to enforce a general conscription of the tribes and at the same time is proof against the criticism which the original draft of this article has incurred. He has further explained ( 1 ) Not printed. [6 ff — 2 ]4 2 to me that it is not at present proposed to put the law into force until 1936 or 1937. and this explanation is borne out by the draft of article 40 (incomplete in the copy sent to you with my previous despatch) which the Government have now put before the Chamber. It provides that the law shall only come into force from such date as shall be fixed by Royal irada. 6. My talks with Nuri have satisfied me that the present GovernmeipL. realise the necessity for acting with caution in carrying out their plans fc introducing national service. On the other hand, there is a risk that if a Govern s ment with extreme nationalist leanings were to come into power, the law might be prematurely brought into force in the tribal areas and invite serious opposition. In any case, there is a possibility that as soon as it is known that the law has been placed on the statute book, an agitation may be started, especially in the Middle Euphrates area and in Kurdistan, which would seriously embarrass the Government. I propose, with your approval, to continue to warn the King and his Ministers unobtrusively of the dangers of precipitate action. 7. Several other small amendments were introduced during the second reading, but these are not of sufficient importance to call for separate comment at this stage. 8. The third and final reading of the Bill has been put on the agenda of the Chamber for the 10th January, and I will report to you in due course any further action of interest w 7 hich may be taken concerning it. 9.

(H) * oOo PriiTic r IniBter i-ifonus me that Cabinet has decided to increase fighting strength of Irag as soon as possible _by one squadron of air force (IS Audax Harts) and three battalions of infantry and to introduce national service bill in Parliament in November.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT YOU are aware from my despatch No. 20^of the 30th March last that, according to the published programme of the new Cabinet, consideration is to be given to the question of strengthening the armed forces of Iraq by the introduction of a system of National Service. 2. As I regard this matter as one of primary importance, both in regard to the internal administration of Iraq and in relation to the Alliance, I have been at some pains to ascertain the intentions of the Iraqi Government. I find that in July 1931, at the time when it was first being mooted, the Inspector-General of the Iraq army, Major-General Rowan-Robinson, drew up a tentative scheme for the formation of a National Service army in anticipation of a possible demand for assistance by the Ministry of Defence. 3. Major-General Rowan-Rohinson found that his predecessor had already put forward two schemes, but had advised the Iraqi Government that it would be militarily unsound to introduce National Service until the various martial elements in Iraq had become amenable to the control of the Central Government and the country could be considered as being on a sound administrative footing. 4. The first of General Loch’s schemes envisaged a corps of two divisions with corps troops, costing in its first year 161 lakhs (£1,208,000) and in its tenth and succeeding years 140 lakhs (£1,050,000). The second provided for an army of one division, costing in its first year 151 lakhs and in its tenth and succeeding years 116 lakhs. The position in 1931 was that the second scheme had found favour with the Prime Minister, but as the military budget had been considerably reduced it was thought unlikely that it would be possible to vote the sum necessary for putting the scheme into operation. 5. Major-General Rowan-Robinson therefore proposed for consideration two fresh schemes : The first provided for the ultimate formation in ten years of a corps consisting of two divisions with corps troops, while the second envisaged the formation of a single division, plus six garrison battalions at the end of six years. The general plan of the first scheme was to retain six of the existing nine battalions and so to organise these battalions that on mobilisation they could be expanded to brigades of three battalions; each company, plus a machine-gun platoon, being capable of expansion to a battalion and each platoon to a company. 6. The second of his schemes was similar to the first, except that instead of a battalion expanding to a brigade, three of the existing six battalions should belong to a covering force. This force would not be capable of expansion, but on the outbreak of war they would take up their covering dispositions and would form part of a division on mobilisation. The three other battalions would each expand to two battalions and between them would furnish two brigade headquarters. 7. In November 1932 the Minister of Defence informed Major-General Rowan-Robinson that the Council of Ministers were again seriously considering the introduction of National Service and asked for his advice. He therefore handed his scheme to the Minister and explained that as, since it had been drawn op, the Iraqi army had increased from nine to twelve battalions, the National army should, in his opinion, contain eight battalions instead of the six suggested in his scheme, while divisions should contain twelve battalions instead of the nine proposed. 8. I had intended to send Major-General Rowan-Robinson’s proposals in full, but I now learn that the Council of Ministers have evolved a more costly scheme of their own which, presumably, will form the basis of their future EASTERN (Iraq).

[ 795 a—1]deliberations I will endeavour to ascertain the nature of their proposals as soon as possible. 9. I have not ceased to warn King Feisal and several of the Ministers in the new Cabinet that they must proceed with the greatest caution in the introduc tion of a measure which is likely to prove very unpopular, especially with the Kurds and the tribes of the middle Euphrates. 10. I understand privately that the National Service Bill will not be drafted at the earliest before the next session of Parliament begins in November next, and that a necessary preliminary will be the taking of a new census.
