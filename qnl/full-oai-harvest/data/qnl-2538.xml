An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-203; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence about supplies of wheat and barley for importation and local consumption in Dubai, Sharjah and the other Trucial Coast sheikhdoms, during and after the Second World War (1939-1945), when food grains and wheat in particular were in short supply worldwide and subject to Government of India export restrictions and import quota arrangements in all the Arab States of the Persian Gulf under British protection. The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire; the Political Officer for the Trucial Coast and the Residency Agent, both Sharjah; the Middle East Supply Centre (MESC), Cairo; the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation (Iraq) Limited (UKCC), Baghdad; Gray, Mackenzie and Company, Bahrain (acting as Crown purchase and shipping agent). The main topics discussed are MESC allotments and UKCC shipments of quota wheat and barley from Basra to the Trucial Coast ports of Dubai and Sharjah; the monitoring of stock levels of wheat, barley and rice in the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms and estimates of future requirements; the introduction of reductions to wheat quotas, against imports of rice from Persia (Iran) and elsewhere, in view of the difficult worldwide supply situation.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited, shipping agents</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Middle East Supply Centre</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Supply Mission (Middle East)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Food</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>United Kingdom Commercial Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Wheat</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rice</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c9#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c9#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
