I have the honour to address the Government of India on the subject of the communication if any to be made to Foreign Consular Officials at Bushire of the establishment of lights at various points in the Gulf. 2. In 1905, the Commander of the E. I. M. S. ' Investigator ' after readjust ing the buoys in the Shatt-al-Arab, asked me to notify Foreign Consuls at Mascat, Bushire and Busreh by telegraph, of the new positions. I required the Govern- . _ , -p, . , , , ^ A nr ;i iqfvi ment of India to give me instructions Resident to Foreign, dated 14th April lyuo. o Foreign to Resident, No. 1642-E.B., dated OU this point, and was mtormed that 2nd May 1905. there seemed to be no objection to copies of the notice sent to Agents of British Steam Ship Companies, being communi cated to Foreign Consuls. These instructions, however, did not reach me in time and accordingly, as explained in my letter No. 285, dated June 18th, 1905, I took no specific steps to acquaint my Consular colleagues, but the Notice to Mariners had already been shown informally to the Agent of the Russian Steam Ship Line and the Director of Customs. The position has considerably developed since then and it therefore seems best to ask for fresh instructions. 3. Notices to Mariners regarding the establishment of lights will have to be issued shortly in respect of the following items of our scheme :— (1) Tamb light-house. (2) Bahrein gas buoys. (3) Shatt-al-Arah gr.s buoys. (4) Bushire and Bunder Abbas gas buoys. I will deal seriatim with each of the above. 4. Tamb light-house. —In this case we are establishing a light on territory owned by the Chief of Shargah, with his express permission and consent. There seems, therefore, no objection to our communicating, when the time comes, a copy of the notice regarding the light-house as issued to British Shipping Com panies, simultaneously to Foreign Co nsular representatives at Bushire for com munication to their nationals. 5. Bahrein lighted buoys. —The special position which His Majesty's Govern ment occupies in regard to Bahrein is generally recognised by Foreign Govern ments, other than Turkey and Persia, and there therefore seems no objection to the Political Agent, Bahrein, notifying the establishment of gas buoys both to British and Foreign Shipping Companies in his jurisdiction. 6. Gas buoys on Shatt-al-Arab Bar.~~Om position here is as stated in the note of His Majesty's Government of July 18th, 1912 to the Porte, and it therefore seems reasonable that we should adopt the same line of^action as in the case of Tamb light-house. 7. Gas buoys at Bushire and Bunder Abbas. —Our position in regard to these buoys is still somewhat indefinite ; should His Majesty's Government decide to seek a general recognition of our prescriptive right to control buoyage and light ing in the Gulf, as suggested in my letter Forwarded to His Majesty's Minister under 2575, dated 13th October 1912, it No. 69-2576, dated 13th October 1912, seems reasonable that we should adopt, in the case of these lights also, the action suggested in the previous cases discussed ; C623 FD Iss&amp;mas mi. and, in addition, an intimation of Vide Memorandum enclosed with Residency jji the past, when buoys ^ ere laid 111 despatch.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I .E., C .S.I. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to recall that one of the items, which, in a personal communi cation to you when in Calcutta, I included in a list of desiderata which, I considered, should be sought from the Persian Government by friendly means as opportunity offered, was the general recognition of our prescriptive right to control buoyage and lighting in the Gulf. 2. On the one hand, it seems possible that a suitable opportunity for obtaining this recognition (which we have already sought from the Porte) may occur in the early future in connection with the grant of a fresh loan to Persia ; on the other hand, there are some grounds to fear that if we are not sood in the field with a friendly demand in the direction referred to, we may be baulked from making it by some pretentious communication from the Persian Government on the subject of lights or buoys in their waters. 3. I have specific reasons for this apprehension in that at a recent meeting with the Governor of the Gulf Ports (Mowaqqer-ed-Dowleh), His Excellency asked me the facts regarding the reported erection of a light-house at Tamb, and the location of lighted buoys at Bushire; he enquired, at the same time, what decision had eventually been arrived at in the case of the proposed light-house on Shaikh Shuaib. None of these topics had previously been touched upon between us. As regards Tamb, I informed him that, with the concurrence of the Shaikh I of Shargah, we were about to put up a light there to facilitate navigation. The only remark His Excellency had to make in this connectioox was to say that there was no doubt that the island properly belonged to Persia and that they had to j thank the blatant action of the Customs in 1904 for spoiling their case in regard! thereto. I rejoined that we considered, on the other hand, that it was beyoncL| doubt that the Shaikh of the Jowasim of Oman owned the island, and, as in dealing ; with this question we had to reckon with patent facts, it seemed waste of time for! us to discuss the question now. As regards the lighted buoys, I informed him that I understood that our Marine authorities did intend to place gas buoys at the two anchorages, in order to improve the facilities for ships making the harbour. He then asked who was going to pay for their cost and up-keep. I replied that we should do so as we were doing and always had done in the case of other buoys laid for the benefit of navigation in the Gulf. As regards the proposed light for Shaikh Shuaib, I said that I had heard no more about it and supposed the idea had been given up, for the present at all events. He said 'What would such a light-house cost to erect, only about £2,000 I under stand ? ' I replied ' Nearer £9,000. Then we went on to other subjects. Judging from the above conversation, I think it possible that the Governor may, in order to earn merit with the central authorities, suggest their asserting themselves in connection with the location of buoys in Persian waters. 4. I have thought it advisable to place Government in possession of the pre cise local position fully by letter, and have forwarded a copy of this communication to His Majesty's Minister, but if the Government of India endorse my view as to the advisability of obtaining formal recognition from the Persian Government, and if loan negotiations are current, they will perhaps see fit to deal with the question by telegraph.

Please see para 3 of my letter rto» 2575 dated 15th October 1912 to the Government of India (enclosure to my des patch No.69) for nature of my conversation with the Governor. He mentioned to me more recently in private conver sation that he would have to make a reference on the subject to Teheran. I answered that that was his , affair, but that the ownership of Tanb was not open to \question as far as I was concerned. I would also invite reference to my letter No.3314 dated December 13th to the Government of India regard ing the lighthouse(forming enclosure to my despatch to you No.95 of same date). Since the corr spondence of 1905 the subjects of the Cheikh of Shargah and his flag have remained es tablished on the Island undisturbed, and I would strongly urge that we should decline to reopen the question of ownership now. No doubt if we did we should revive the question of Sirri (vide warning referred to in Sir A.Hardinge's despatch Ho.Ill dated 20th July 1904 to His Majesty's received under Foreign Department No.O _ .. . 267S-E.A. dated 17th Auguet 1904 0 1 ' or0i ^ n ' i:Lce * I venture, however,to think that a flat refusal to reopen the question would best meet the case now.

Mtm On th© 22nd July 1 received yo.ur letter No.216 dated 25th May on the subject of the Tunb Island about which you desired fresh particulars. I beg respectfully to submit 1 • » 1 the following details. &lt; 1. According to information I have obtained from elderly men of Ras-ul-^haimeh, at the time the persian Cuif was &gt; insecure and the inhabitants of both Persian and Arab Coast; ^ committed piracies in the sea and there was no peace on the sea, the Qawa^sem were well known for plunders and breach of maritime peace. . 2. During the chieftainship of shaikh sultan ben Haqar al- Qasemi ? i.e. the time of the utmost power of a Qawasem Chief on the Arab Coast, from the village of LIumzar to Khatm and Datineh, and the islands of Tunb, Bumusa and Sir -Bunair and Lingeh on the persian Coast were under Shaikh Sultan ben Saqar il-Qasemi. d 3. Shaikh Sultan 's capital was Ras -ul-^haimeh until he die dt Ras-ul-^haimeh. ... / 4. During ohaiich Sultan's chieftainship at Ras -ul -Khaimeh, i he appointed his brother, Shaikh Saleh ben oaqar, as the Shaikh of Shargah which was in those days a village, shaikh i • .s; Saieh built the present Government irous'e at Shargah. A tort of it is called 'Vahluseh' and the other jjoshref. 5. Whan shaikh uultan : s sons were grown up, he appointed his son, named saqar ben Sultan,as the Shaikh of Shargah. - A 6. After Saqar was killed, his son, LIuhammad ben Saqar, became the Shaikh of shargah. . 7. One of Shaikh Sultan's sons, called J^haled, killed Kuhamad ben Saqar, his n eph and proclaimed himselfShaikh of Shargah. In the meantime, 3haikh oultan hen G^q a r d ied. 8. Shaikh ^haied hen Sultan consiituted his nephew, Uunaid ben Abdullah hen Sultan ? as the Ghaiich 01 P^as-ui~}'haimeh, 9. After Shaikh ^haled ben Sultan was murdered, the present . Shaikh salem ben Sultan became the Shaikh of Shargah and sent an expedition by sea to T?as-ul-rhaimeh with the view rr dismissing shaikh Humaid ben Abdullah. The Resident in • 1 the persian Gulf then was Col. pelly. He visited Ras-ul- Khaimeh with two men-of-war and drove Shaikh Saiem ben Suitan away, and made Ras-ul-£haimeh and its dependencies, including the Tunb Island, independent for Shaikh Humaid ben ibdullah. . 10. Shaikh Saqar ben whaled expelled shaikh Salem ben Sultan from ^hargah and became its Shaikh. 11. When H u naid ben Abdullah, the shaikh of Ras-ul-Khaimeh,j died, Shaikh Saqar ben rhaled, who had married Humaid^s . daughter and had a son from her named J[haled, sent his son to I^as-ul-T'haimeh to be the shaikh, at the request of his \yife,in place of her father. 12. After the death of Shaikh ^kaled,- the cheiftainship of Ras-ul -rhaimeh devolved on Shaikh Salem ben Sultan. ■ 13. In the meantime there ar^se a dispute on the question • •. ■ ■ ■ of the red oxide mines which Shaikh Salem ben Sultan had Cd Co • ) leased to Hasan ben Aii Somayyeh/before his accession to the chieftainship of Ras-ui-^haimeh,and th6 intervention of the German Wonckhous through Hasan ben Aii Sobayyeh.- 14.. The Resident then thought it advisable that the Qawaseia flag should fly on the Abu-Musa and Tunb islands. 16. Shaikh oaqa^r sent flag staffs to AbuHTusa and Tunb, 1 . and ordered the ohaikh of Ras-ul-rhaimeh to have the flag hoisted when Government men-o^-war visited ^unb. 7he officii 1 T1G. From the above particulars (it is understood that) during the, lifetime of Shaikh Gultan hen Canar, nas-ul- fhaineh was the chief Kxpi seat of Qawasem government and all the dependencies of the Qawasem were then/under ^as-ul- rhaimeh. The prosperity of Ghargah began from the tine that Shaikh Gultan 1 s sons grew into men. After his death the islands and inland territories were divided the Tunb Island being made a part of Ras-ul-^haimoh district. rn 1 hese are the particulars regarding the Tunb island.) y • ■ Ho• 256. British Legation, Tehran, May 29th 1923. % My Lord., I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship with reference to my telegram No. 152 of to-day and my Despatch No. 220 of May 18th copy of a note from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs asserting Persian rights over Tamb and Abu Musa. I Y /as extremely Indignant on reading the contents of this communication, but after reflection I came to the conclusion that the Minister for Foreign Affairs could not have been aware at the time he wrote it of ray communication to Hostaufi-ul-Mamalek and that its despatch was probably due rather to ineptitude and stupidity than to wilful naughtiness. This view seems in the light of subsequent events ta have been correct. In any case I decided to send the Acting Oriental secretary at once to see the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to hand to the former a letter of which copy is inclosed herein. -I directed Mr* Monypenny to say that I regarded such a note as the one I had received as deliberately provocative and as quite incompatible with the professions of the Persian Government of a desire for friendly relations with His Majesty's Government; to warn the Ministers that if I had to take up this matter myself, I should not fail to make myself extremely disagreeable: that they had better therefore put an end to the question rapidly and that the best way of doing so was to withdraw the note which had given me such offence. I inclose ie Most Honourable The Marquess Curson of Kedleston K&lt;.G.&gt; etc*, etc., etc*, Foreign Office.I inclose likewise herein an account by Mr- Monypenny of his interview with the two Ministers, from which Your s Lor^iip will see that he followed out my instructions and left with them the Persian text of the Note. The Prime Minister has aslred to see me in connection with this question, but as I shall not have time to write a further report after that and before the closing of this bag, it seems preferable not to delay the despatch of the present report• / I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and to His Majesty's Acting Consul-General at Bushire• I have the honour to be with the highest respect, My Lord, Your Lordship f s most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) Percy Loraine*&lt;10 : i Tranglation From the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs * To His Majesty's Minister* No* 1635• Dated Jowza 1502 (May 23rd 1923) i Excellency, According to information received, His majesty's Oonsul-General at Buahire. has attempted to hire the Red Oxide existing in the Island of 'Tamb' and 'Ahu Musa w from the Sheikh of Shargah• V Owing to the right of sovereignty (proprietorship) of the Persian Government in these two islands, of which notification was made to His Majesty^ Legation in the year 1321 (1903-1904),'I request Your Excellency to be so good to cause the proper authorities to abstain from meddling with this proposed illego.l lease• I avail etc., etc., (S igne d) Zoka-ul-Mulk•Resume of Interview of the Acting Oriental Secretary with ii±3 Highness the prime Minister and His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 26th May 1925• After a brief exposition of the friendly attitude main tained by Breat Britain towards Persia - an attitude which, judging from the tenour of the Persian press and the actions of the Persian Government, appeared to be one-sided and not reciprocated by the present Govennment, I handed His Highness I the Persian Note received on the subject of the Islands of Tanb and Abu Musa, together with the personal note from His Majesty^ Minister to His Highness, and the Aide-Memo ire * previously shown to him on the subject* I added that His Majesty^ Minister considered that the receipt of such a Note, which was deliberately provocative, rendered the'maintenance of friendly relations between His Majesty^ Legation and the Persian Government well-nigh impossible# His Highness read the documents carefully and sent for His Excellency Zoka-ul-Mulk, who also read them, but said little beyond remarking that the question had been raised occasionally in the past* The Prime Minister stated that he would examine the dossier, and thought it best that he should see ^is Majesty's Minister and discuss the matter personally with him* He hoped to be able to come to the Legation on May 28th or May 29th and would let me know as soon as he could appoint a definite hour* His Highness appeared to be unaware that the above- mentioned note had been sent to His Majefety^ Legation and ■ apparently had not warned His Excellency Zoka-ul-Mulk of the views of His Majesty's Government regarding the Islands - views which His Majesty^ Minister had made clear to His Highness, only a few days previously - and did not know that the question had been provoked in this manner.I ropeated that the receipt of this note so soon after His Highness t interview with His Majesty f s Minister had caused a very painful impression, and reminded Hi s Hig^Qgg that the Persian G-overnment had repudis.ted, in 1904, an attempt made by its official to place the Persian flag on the Island; hud disclaimed it as an unauthorized act, and had ordered him immediately to remove the flag. His Highness was well aware of the views of His Majesty Government on this subject and therefore I thought it would be better, as Hig Highness ha.d himself suggested, for him to visit His Majesty^ Minister at the Legation.

Little Ii.; L. on uninhabited and waterless island one mile long by mile wide, eight miles to the ((test of Tamb, was agreed by the Governmen t of India, the India Office and the / Foreign Office in 1908, to depend from that island.

A lighthouse was erected on it by His f/ajesty'e Government in 1913(800 parugrticiis 24 to 28 below), it is sparsely inhabited and almost waterless. It appears probable that deposits of red exide isre to bo found both in it laid in Little Iamb. Abu fluaa is a larger and more thickly populated island, a few miles nearer to Bhargah in Xrucial Oman than to Lingah in Persia, with good supplies of water, and valuable deposits of red oxide which have been under exploitation for some years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of Shargah. -irri. 40 miles 3. by W. of Bustaneh, the Loriraer ii. 1830. nearest point on the Persian Coast, is more prosperous LorZler ii. 1275that, in view of ttie Sim incident of 1887, he was aprrehenelve lact tha result might De the advancing of a territorial claira to this island by Persia. The Reairtent stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikh of Bhargsh, that the Jowasitnis did not, however, fly a fl ag on the island, and that it tnlght be well to advise the Bheikh of Ohargeh to do so as a sign of ownership. Thle course was approved and action taken accordirigly. 17. low qutsation havinK arisen of acivising the aheiKh of Has-al-Khaima (a sheikhdom at that t-r- time and now dependent from the heikh of ihargah) to adopt a similar course; in regard to the island of Tarab, which belonged to the Ras-al-Khaima section of the JowHSirais, the Resident reported that so far as he was aware, sovereignty over that island had never been asserted by Persia, that the uheikh of harguh in his existing capacity as ruler of Ras -al -Khaima claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasimia of the Arab coast, and that he was in possession of documentary evidence in the shape of letters from two former Arab Chiefs of Lingtii fidmitting the claim of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast to those islands, aa against the claim of the Jowasimis of Lingah. It was decided that the 'hief should be advised to hoist his fleg on iamb as on Abu Musa, and this was done. 18.

Secondly. There has 'been consider- -ahle infiltration of Persians on Trucial Coast in last year or two mostly due to economic conditions. I am watching this developement and certain indica- -tions of late have given me an uneasy feeling that Persia is taking an undue interest in Trucial Coast. $ Thirdly. Shaikh of Has al Khaimah came to Dehai hut failed at the last moment to come on hoard for Durhar. He should of course come on hoard to pay customary call on Senior Naval Officer when lat- * -ter reaches Has al Khaimah.

'Shoreham 11 on 21st October in company with the 1st Division of the First Destroyer Flotilla. 2. As usual, the ruling Shaikh (Sultan bin Salem) did not appear on board, but almost as soon as 'Shoreham' anchored 'and before the Residency Agent arrived) his brother Shaikh Mohamraed-bin-Salem came off and informed me that the Shaikh v/as not coming on board as he i/cis in fear of 'being seised. He v/ould, however, like to meet me ashore. 3. I replied that I had promised him when I met him at Sharjah that I 'would come as a friend. I had done so and he had nothing to fear. I had mentioned the matter he spoke of to the Hon'hie the Political Resident who had given me a letter which I would like to give to the Shaikh personally as well as a verbal message. I added that if he did not receive me in the same friendly spirit and call on me, as he should do, he could not expect me to go and meet hi i ashore. 4. After a somewhat lengthy interview, the brother departed saying he vould give my message and try to induce the Shaikh to come on 'board, but as he had already tried and failed, he could hold out no hope of success. 5. The Residency Agent called and 1 sent ray inter preter ashore with him to see whether the Shaikh had changed his mind. I also arranged to land with the Captain of the First Destroyer Flotilla to meet the Residency Agent and give him your letter for delivery in case the Shaikh did not come off. We also wished to see the aerodrome and the petrol dhow, which seems to have been the cause of so much trouble. 6, that tip Before leaving, the Residency c Shaikh would not come off. lie Agent assured me - was not really afraidSHAIKH OP RAS-AL-KHAIMAH: Letter No. 519, dated 26th October, 1931;, from The Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf. afraid to corae.

He has already derived some local pre^fcLp froia sucli refusals to call on Political and ifavca Off!cars aid was ::opiD- to a.dc to 'it if any of them ever went to see him ashore first. Thj Residency Agent liad also gathered that the Shaikh was jealous of his formerly impoverished kinsman, the Shaihh of Sharjah, TO had, accordinc to tne Araos, received an 'enormous' sum for his aerodrome on 'V/orthlessland' in addition to all the advantages accruing from the Imperial Airways Service and the visits of British India ships, whilst he himself could get nothing 8. Captain C.Harris and I landed at 1530 and after rather a long run through the lagoon, were met on landing hy the Residency Agent. We entered his house on his invitation and were entertained with coffee. 'Mist there a large crowd gathered and announced the arrival of the Shaikh who had. come to see me. I sent a message out to say that I had no desire to see him there and had come for another purpose. If he wished to see me he could do so on hoard. He, however, forc ed h is way ii^a ccoapani edJby his brother. ' i ignored him completely acting as though he v/as not present and making any remarks for his benefit to the Residency Agent, This was of course necessary in order to remove any impression his followers had (clearly intended 'by the Shaikh) that I had come ashore specially to visit him. It was obvious to those who saw that he had arrived uninvited and unwanted. ]# d M ^ (fuM + fy 1 ^ | ,, f - r -|- 07 I gave your letter to the Residency Agent and asked him to deliver it to the Shaikh together with your verbal j i c-'S oag , adding that I was sorry th a t he was unable to call on me. 10. As far as I can gather his griev ances werej- (a) That we had used TUHB ISLAND for a long period without paying him. (bj He wanted compensation for loss through confiscation of his dhows and proper payment for the use of his territory and lagoon for aircraft. He intimated that he is prepared to go on board one of H.M.Ships and proceed to any place where these claims couldS^AIhn OP RAS-AL-KHAIMAH: Letter No.619, dated ^tn October, 1933, from The Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf, could be heard byji Court of Law. . I also informed that he would call on hoard if I would guarantee his safety in writing and listen to his grievances. I intimated that I was prepared to do this- I was then infonied that no saia 1 already knew his grievances and would come if I guaranteed in writing to grant all his requests, i-ls of course was out of question as he well knew. I helieve he thought that his first condition would prohaoly he refused. -2.

K.- said 'Yes, he had received a letter 5 ', but sliowed no inclination to discuss it. Under the circumstances it v /as inadvisable to pursue the subject. The Residency Agent said he would be able to find out shortly whether the letter did really exist or not. li. 1 am inclined to a^ree with the Residency Agent that his statement about the letter is'incorrect and only made in order to create an impression - possibly to see what value we placed on TUHB. 15. The Residency Agent, who knows that Persia n propaganda has been at. work at .Ras-al-Kha imah^ considera that Persians have taken advantage ol his grievances and cupidity as fertile soil for sowing the seeds of trouble. I certainly agree that someone has been putting ideas into his head, 16.

' Tehran, October 27, WI1H reference to my telegram No. 274 of the 22nd October, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the note that I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of the visit paid to the lighthouse at Tamb on the 23rd July by officers from the Persian warship Palang. 2. The argument used in the third paragraph is logical to a certain extent, but only on the assumption that the oral engagement undertaken by the Persian Government not to disturb the status quo cannot apply to the Island of Tamb. The reason given in the fifth paragraph for excluding the island from the scope of this agreement, that 1 Persian officials have always gone there,' has no basis of fact of which I am aware, apart from the incident of August 1928 (see annual report for 1928, paragraphs 147 to 155). 3. The refusal to admit a comparison with the Island of Sirri has no rational basis, inasmuch as His Majesty's Goverment equally claim that Tamb is the property of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, both de facto and de jure. The quotation from the Legation notes of the last three years regarding the visits of H.M.S. Ormonde to Sirri is not quite correct. What was said in each case was that mention was made of the proposed visit because the island was in the de facto occupation of Persian customs officials. 4. The reply to the charge of discourtesy takes no note of the fact that all the visits to lights on the Persian coast took place before any reply had been received from His Majesty's Government to the request for assistance and guidance. 5. Unless previous developments have rendered any further communication to the Persian Government regarding the status of Tamb superfluous by the time this despatch has been considered, I suggest that I should reply reiterating the view of His Majesty's Government that Tamb is de facto and de jure the property of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah; that at the time of the incident the Persian Government, whatever their own views as to the status of the island might be, were bound by a ' gentleman's agreement,' which they had not until then repudiated, not to take any steps to alter the status quo at places like Tamb; that the Persian contention that there has been no violation of this agreement because the island is regarded as Persian territory de facto is palpably absurd, and that it was out of respect for this agreement that His Majesty's Government did not at any time during the last three years send H.M.S. Ormonde to Sirri without notice, notwithstanding the fact that they consider it to be de jure the property of the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Sharjah and Ras-ul-Khaimah. 6. I have dealt in a separate despatch with the question of the status quo agreement. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 181). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires. (Translation.) M. le Charge d'Affaires, October 21, 1933. ONE of the questions alluded to in your esteemed note of the 1st Mehr (the 23rd September, 1933), which I promised in my note of the 16th Mehr (the 8th October, 1933) to reply, was the inspection of the lighthouse on the Island [971 x—11] E H- t I i't I f: iila of Tamb carried out by the officials of the Imperial Government, which had formed the subject of your note of the 31st Murdad (the 22nd August, 1933). 2. In your note of the 31st Murdad (the 22nd August, 1933) you have alluded to and made protests in respect of two points, namely, one in respect of the visit of the ship Palang to the Island of Tamb, and the other in respect of the fact that you considered the visit and the inspection of the lighthouse in question to be at any rate discourteous. 3. In respect of the first point, taking into consideration the information which you have as to the views and statements of and the proofs (adduced bv^ the Imperial Government regarding the ownership of the said island, no objection can be taken to the visit of the Palang to that place, since at a time when the officials of the Imperial Government were engaged in inspecting all the light houses on the Persian coasts, they could not rightly abstain from inspecting the lighthouse on the Island of Tamb, which they consider their indisputable propertv and an integral part of their territory. ^1 4. The question of the visit of the survey ship Ormonde to the Island of Sirri, which you quote as an example, cannot be compared with this case since the Persian Government consider the Island of Tamb de jure and de facto to bp their property. as your esteemed note makes clear, the British Government recognise to be Persian territory de facto but in regard to which they consider the de jure rights of Persia open to question I iina it my duty to inform you that my Government have always considered and still consider, this island as their property de jure and de facto. 6. As regards the observance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf thp interpretation which you propound in this connexion is not agreed to bv the Persian Government nor does it apply to this case, since the officials of the Persian Government have always gone there and have always considered and still consider, the said island as Persian territory de facto.{ 1 ) i- i-T' With legai d to the fact that, as you consider, the visit made to the lighthouse in question without previous information being given was at any rate discourteous I find it necessary to inform you that, in connexion with all light- houses and buoys, representations have recently been made to His Britamiii Majesty s Legation^ with the request that necessary instructions mav be X™ to the competent officials to afford the required facilities to the naval exnerts of asrewscr ■ * ~ - msssz t&amp;m I avail, &amp;c.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7112/1329/34 November 21, 1933. S ection 7. No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir- John Simon.—{Received November 21.) (No. 503.) Sir, Tehran, October 30, 1933. THE sixth paragraph of the note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the visit of a Persian warship to the Island of Tamb, of which I sent you a translation in my despatch No. 498 of the 27th October, stated that the Persian Government did not agree with the interpretation of the status quo agreement advanced by His Majesty's Legation. 2. For convenience I quote the passage of my note of the 22nd August to which his Excellency was referring :— '4. Your Highness is, of course, well aware that the claim of the Imperial Government to the ownership of the Island of Tamb is not recognised by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and that the island is in the possession of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah. The Imperial Government are, furthermore, precluded from taking any action in support of their claim by the existing agreement for the observance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf so long as negotiations for a general treaty are continuing ''; as well as the actual words (in translation) of his Excellency's reply :— ' As regards the observance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, the interpretation which you propound in this connexion is not agreed to by the Persian Government, nor does it apply to this case, since the officials of the Persian Government have always gone there and have always considered, and still consider, the said island as Persian territory de facto.' 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me, on the 15th October, that he could not find any ' status quo agreement.' I replied that it was not a written document. It originated some four or five years ago between Sir R. Clive and Teymourtache. Since then, as treaty negotiations had never been broken off, but only from time to time suspended, there had been an oral understanding to maintain the status quo in the Gulf. This was a common-sense matter, as obviously negotiations would be impossible if either side were to attempt during the period of negotiations to better their position in the Gulf. His Excellency seemed to think this sensible enough, but he did not commit himself to any definite expression of opinion, perhaps because the question was new to him. 4. I have the honour to enclose a memorandum showing the information that it has been possible to glean from the archives of this Legation about the origin of the status quo agreement. I do not think its precise history is of gieat importance, because I fancy that both Leymourtache and Feroughi, in theii discussions with Sir Reginald Hoare, always accepted the fact that an unwritten understanding existed to the effect that neither side would disturb the existing position in the Persian Gulf, and that they accepted this understanding as one of general application to all matters and places in dispute. 5. This does not, of course, alter the fact that, when it comes to questions of detail, the Persian Government please themselves as to the inteipretation which they place upon the agreement, usually by pretending that some particular action on their part is in accordance with a practice in vogue before the agieement was made. This is, probably, what they are attempting to do in the piesent case, rather than to deny or repudiate the agreement altogether. Moreover, as I have already suggested in my telegram No. 279 of the 23rd October, it is most unlikely that the Persian Government would have embarked upon this controversy at the present stage except as the result of extreme irritation at the arrest of the Mudir of Customs at Basidu. It is therefore possible that this declaration [971 x—7]I .'I has been made in a fit of spleen and is not intended seriously. But if the Persian Government do indeed intend in future to disregard the agreement altogether, a serious clash in the Persian Gulf will become almost inevitable. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 185). I have, &amp;c. V. A. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. IN May 1928 Teymourtache told Sir H. Clive that the Persian Government would do nothing to 'brusquer ' Persian Gulf questions pending negotiations for a general treaty (see annual report for 1928, section 152). 2. On the 9th September, 1929, Teymourtache told Sir Robert Clive that &lt;c instructions had been sent that difficulties were not to be raised about Bahreinis pending the conclusion of treaty negotiations ' (see 375/2-15/1 of 1929, and minutes at 375/2-4 of 1930 and 375/1-8 of 1931). 3. In October 1930 an attempt was made to obtain a written guarantee that the 'status quo agreement' would continue during the suspension of negotiations (see annual report for 1930, section 108). Assurances were, however, given orally at the time by Teymourtache and Feroughi. 4. It is probable that on various occasions Teymourtache gave oral assurances regarding the maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf, but no precise record of them is available, or could be made available without going through the archives with a tooth-comb. In any case, there appears to be no written, or even recorded oral, authority for an understanding of the extensive nature that we now claim in regard to the status quo. 5. Nevertheless, the Persian Government have never themselves disputed that there does exist an understanding that neither side will do anything to disturb the status quo during treaty negotiations. They have even appealed to it themselves over restrictions on visits by Persians to Bahrein (see minutes at 375/1-14 of 1932). But the extent of the status quo has never been defined—the Foreign Office demurred to a suggestion by His Majesty's Minister that an attempt should be made to define it—and, when it comes to details, the Persian Government please themselves as to its interpretation (see 375/2-4 of 1930).

I have the honour to inform you that having heard that Persian officials had recently frequented the Tam'b Island, I sen^on the 22nd May / a man to the official of the Ruler of Ras-ul-Khaimah stationed at tU- Island to make enquiries from him and find out what conversation they had held with him. I now 'beg to submit herewith a statement giving details of the enquiries made from the official of the Shaikh at the Island as also a letter from the said official to my address. The Shaikhs official in his letter states that the 3haikh does not pay attention to the Tamb Island nor he pays him any wages. He states that he is a poor man and intends going on diving to earn some living 'but as Persian officials now-a-days frequent the Island he does not know who will work in his place in the Island and send reports to the Shaikh, if he goes on divings Me informs me that the Persian officials hold that the Tamo Island 'belongs to the Persian Govern- -ment and that he gives them replies repudiating their contention. In fact the Ruler of Ras-ul-K^aimah does not look after his official at the Island. I conversed with the Shaikh respecting his official's statements and he told me in reply that he does not get any income from the Island and that should the British Government desire I U [ ,vh? IN, to lease it from htm he will have no olajection to fall in with their wishes. Decision rests with the Hon'ole the Political liesident in the Persian Gulf; his view in the matter is supreme U.E • &gt; P.3., A copy of this letter and one ot the statement to vuhich it gives cover has 'been sent to Colonel G.Looh Political Agent,Bahrain* C7^/. »0$ Tne following are tiie news received. Trom the Taifl'D Island:- ^ 26th April 1934 a Persian G-ovemment launch called at the Tam'D Islands % * Four men disem'barked rrom the launch and proceeded to the house of Mahinud an official represent* ing the Ruler of Ras-ul-Khaimah at the Island. He met them outside the house and having taken them inside put them up in his drawing roonuOut of the party three were officials and the remaining man was an Interpreter caled Shaikh Saleh inhabitant of the Qishm Island• 3. Having rested a while one of the officials enquired from Mahmud as to which of the Oman Rulers the flag flying at the Island 'belongs. 4. Mahmud informed him in reply that it is the Qawasims # flag and belongs to the Ruler of Ras-ul- Khaimah namely .Shaikh Sultan bin Salem al-Q,asemi. 5. Mahmud asked them to introduce themselves and to say to him what their object was in making such enquiries about the flag. 6. The Interpreter informed Mahmud that one was the G-overnor of Bandar* Abb as; another he said was the Rais-i-Amniah,Bandar-Abbas and the third the Director of the Customs of that port. 7. The G-overnor told Mahmud that the Island belongs to Persia and that none of the Rulers of Cman has the right of flying a flag there. 8. Mahmud replied stating that the Island belongs actually to Bas -ul-Khaimah from old times and that the Shaikh has inherited it from his father and grandfather. He added that being a subject of the Shaikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah he is living in the Island. 9 a The G-overnor replied H ^ell a few days * ^ later on it will become known to whom the Island* * belongs 1 * •10» The Crovernor then enquired from Mahmud as fi to what he gets as wages from the Kuier of Has-ui-Khaimah J or from the British Governments ,|l 11. Mahmud informed the G-overnor that the British Governor and the Ruler of Ras-ul-Khaimah do not fail j to look v/ell after him. 12. The Governor told Mahmud that if the Island 'beoomes to he a Persian property then he will 'be kept in his present station and in the same duty and that the Persian Government would pay him double the wages that he is now reoeiving from the Ruler of Ras -ul-Khaimah. ^3^ The Governor then asked Mahmud xor permission to visit the Light House and see it®. 14. Mahmud refused this and tried to prevent them from visiting the Light House saying that they had no 'business to goi^ to that place.They however insisted upon this point and proceeded towards it. Seeing that he oould not prevent them Mahmud accompanied them but he sent a man privately to the men in the Light House telling then to prevent the visitors from entering the crew , s lodges and ascending the Light Hoube► ^5^ 'Then the visitors ascended the mountain the Chief of the men in charge of the Light House met the party on the way and prevented them from going to the Light House * xhe visitors therufore came 'baok, went to the sea shors and emtarlced. their launch which sailed.

Shaikh Sultan bin Salem however does not look after me nor ho pays any attention to the Island, ^e does not pay me any wages nor he compensate^ me in any other way^ As you are,no doubt, aware it is hard times now and I am a poor man but being known in the Island all the Arabs who come there call at my place and I have to entertain them in my house not withstanding the fact fhat I get nothing to-suffice my living..

I, further have tne nonour to state to Your Honour that I forwarded a letter to the High Government at the hands of the Khan Bahadur, the 'Residency Igent, Sharjah, explaining the situation regarding our Island of Tanb and its lease and that if the Government wanted to have it on lease they were more entitled to* priority of right? hut if they were not so disposed then requesting them kindly to give A the permission to lease it to whosoever desired it. A reply to it came from the Hon'hle Colonel Fowle reminding me of the treaty and its terms. I, indeed, do not deny it and am rather steadfast to its contents, and that is why I expounded the situation to the Government. I hope that, were the Government reluctant to do so, they would not prevent me from (exercising) my rights in such matters after I have intimated them ahout it. u.a. &amp; M l /ly.

The ^at)tain enquired as to what were the merchandise carried oy tae ooat from ^ohai to Persian territory. I reolied taat I did not know. Then he aslceri if the Shaikh knew any tiling about the boat, and I again admitted my ignorance but suggested that^should he intend so, I oould . • . . IF enquire from tne Shaikh, and the Captain asked me to do so. i n 2. I took his leave and tcot off the 'boat. It was niffht. Therefore in tne morning the Shaikh and I got in a launoh in order to go to tne Snip.

T le revealeri that v/ith four .lolly 'boats he was going from Dobai to Tanh to carry stones from there to De'bai. Durine the early stages of their /journey from ^ehai to Tanb there was no wind and so only three Jolly 'boats reached tne destination. The 'boat in question,on account of no, wind, was drifted away 'by the water towards Mamlahah (?) on the Persian Ooast and^when the wind Isusiew in favour of the 'boat, it came 'back to the Island of Tanb. Tnen it reached the Point where stones are shipped, it laid anchor.Tlie (Peisian; sloop 'Palang' oame and a launoh was elided off the siiip, uae Nalmuda of trie 'boat was seized and taken to Uie sloop. men the launah returned to the jolly boat and a searon started. Tne Captain of the sloop asked the Naknuda as to v /nat oarso he had and what he unloaded on the Persian loast. The Nakhuda replied that he had neithei oar^o nor landed anything, 'but as there was no wind the 'boat did not oatoh the Island, was deviated 'by the water to the vioinity of Kami ah ah and (ultimately) when the wind 'blew, oame 'baok to the Island of Tahb.

The Captain (of TI.M.3. Lupin) heard this reply (of the A Nakhuda). 5. The Gnaikh and I got off tne Man-of-^ar and she left Dehai in tne afternoon, ohe again called at Debai on Jeptember 2, 19.54, and tne Oaptain sent for the Nakhuda and some of nis sailors, took their statements and left w on the 4th. 4. The Shaikh of Dehai says in reply that it cannot he that the 'boats of his people go on 'business to the Islands situated on the Oman 1oast and the sloops of the Persian Government interfere with them. He cannot tolerate this sort of thing. This jolly 'boat whose Nakhuda was caotured hy tne sloop 'Palang' 1 had no Arah in it.

Our present warning combined with need for notification [which they would probably have been unwilling to give as it would have admitted Arab sov ereignty) might well have kept them, away which is what is wanted. If Persian Government adopt Ministers suggestion, it will be difficult to stop Persian ships going to these islands quite frequently and Arab opinion will not understand it. I have not commented official- -ly as I am not sure whether you take same view in which case you might prefer to mention matter informally in London.

Hoare {Tehran). (No. 482.) Sir, Foreign Office, September 28, 1934. I ASKED the Persian Minister to call to see me this morning and recalled a conversation I had had with M. Kazemi at Geneva on the 12th September, when the latter suggested a resumption of Anglo-Persian negotiations with a view to improving relations between us and removing all points of dispute. I expressed my pleasure at having heard this from the Persian Foreign Minister and said that I would in the ordinary course have awaited a further communi cation from Persia. But on returning to London I had been disquieted to learn that almost simultaneously with the Geneva conversation a Persian warship had paid another visit to the Island of Tamb without notification through the diplo matic channel. I reminded M. Ala that the Persian claim to l amb, which His Majesty's Government regarded as quite unfounded, had hitherto been one of the matters to be settled by treaty. Tamb had for many generations been in the effective and peaceful occupation of its Arab ruler, for whose foreign relations His Majesty's Government are responsible. Yet there had been several cases in which Persian warships had, without prior notification, paid visits to the island during the past fifteen months, e.g., in July 1933, when the Government of India's lighthouse was officially inspected; in April 1934; on the 28th August, 1934. when an Arab dhow was searched in territorial waters, and on the 11th September, 1934, when I was informed that the Persian commanding offi^ei had landed, interrogated the inhabitants and had told British naval officeis that he regarded Tamb as Persian territory. In view of the occupation of the island by the Arab ruler, these naval visits without prior notification and these attempts to exercise jurisdiction could only be regarded as an attempt to jump a claim to the island, and we could not acquiesce in any such procedure. The visits could only mean one of two things—either the Persian Government wished to invent a fictitious value for their claim in future negotiations, or else they were u nwii ing to make use of the peaceful and legal methods by which it is open to them o make their claim, if they think there is anything m it, and were attempting to achieve their object in a manner quite incompatible with their position as signatories of the Covenant and of the Kellogg Pact. His Majesty s Government I said, could not possibly acquiesce in such a situation and felt compelled to make it plain that the total cessation of such tactics is the essential P rel1 ^ 13 ^ to the resumption of negotiations. It was our earnest hope that the Persian Government would recognise the justice of this view and, if they do, m fact, desire to resume negotiations, would avoid such action as made resumption impossible.^ to tell the Minister thatj in view of these incidents, His Maiestv's Government had found it necessary to frame instructions to British naval officers in the Gulf as to their course of action m the event of further visits^ T JpnH tn M Via textuallv paragraphs 1 and 2 of my telegram to you No. 93 f 9fif&gt;r&lt;Wpmber His Maiesty's Government had at first intended that of the 26th September.

You, therefore, negotiations with the i is . p j Minister the instructions which had Lltnt « ^r the Geneva conversation, they [215 ee—1]2 would have been communicated officially and that we should communicate them officially if further unnotified visits to Tamb or Abu Musa took place at any time. His Majesty's Government were most anxious not to have to send in such a note, and I trusted that the question of Tamb visits would not arise again. It was our sincere desire to promote friendly relations with Persia and the communication I had made was made with that object. 3. M. Ala listened attentively to what I said and subsequently saw Mr. Rendel in order to make sure of the details. He expressed the strong hope that it would be with him that we might hereafter settle our differences with Persia and undertook to report what T had said to his Government. T am, &amp;c.

The main correspondents are the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf; the Political Resident Persian Gulf; Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, ruler of Ras al-Khaimah; H.M. Minister, Teheran; H.M. Secretary of State for India; H.M. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The correspondence discusses how the Persian Government claimed these islands and the British maintained they were defending the rights of the sheikhs of Trucial Oman. Also discussed is the building of a light house on Tanb Island and the presence of red oxide on the island. The majority of the correspondence is in English but the file also includes letters in Arabic. These carry the stamp 'British Agency Trucial Oman'. Most of the correspondence is in the date range 1933-1934. One letter describes how in 1933 a Persian man-of-war
                           Palangvisited the island without prior notification and correspondence discusses correct protocol to be followed; correspondence also discusses how the behaviour of the Persian Government was not compatible with their position as signatories of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellog Pact; also includes a statement of a 'Nakhuda' on the seizing of a boat by Persian ship
                           Palang. The file concerns the British defence of the rights of the sheikhs of Trucial Oman and rights to mining of red oxide. One letter reminds the ruler of Ras al-Khaimah that he is not to lease any part of his territory without permission of the British government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Abu Musa Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Greater Tunb</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lesser Tunb</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sirri</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ferric oxide</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000dc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
