No.C/581. v N \..' 1 '/ Dated the 4th of June, 1946. ( \ Reference correspondence ending with Residency printed Letter N0.449-S dated the 19th May, 1944. 2. On the 23rd of April the U.S. Navy tanker 'Cacapon' left Sitra, Bahrain, and at about 2 o f clock on the 24th morning struck the shah Allam shoal. She ran right over the shoal and did not stop until she was in deep water on the other side by which time she had ripped off a good deal of her bottom. She fortunately was saved from sinking, and was eventually brought back to Bahrain for repairs. I only heard of the accident when the United States Consul, Dhahran, told me of it on the 3rd June and suggested that he and I should co operate and arrange for a temporary light to be placed on the shoal. I was unable to agree to this, and said that I would report the incident and suggest further investigation of the need of a light on the shoal. The matter will presumably be taken up through diplomatic channels. 3. The accident has caused American oil interests in Bahrain and Dhahran again to consider the need of a light on the shoal and BAPCO and ARAMCO have addressed the American Consul at Dhahran informing him that requests have been repeatedly made for the establishment of a light on Shah Allam shoal since 1936, and that for this and that reason one has not been placed. 4. The fact that a naval vessel equipped with the latest depth sounding devices fouls the shoal calls for an investigation, but in addition to that because of the great increase in the use of the port of Sitra (Ras Tanura tankers are routed via Sitra where they pick up and drop pilots) I suggest that the desirability of placing a red light buoy on the shoal be very urgently examined.

M. S. Jufair, regarding the placing of a light on Shah Allum Shoal which you will find of interest. This letter was sent on the under standing that this subject is under further discussion. Yours very truly. jrt, m • .onuwn CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Confidential.Dear Sin In view of the recent grounding of the U.S.S. CACAPON on Shah Allum Shoal, it Is understood that consideration is being given to moving the light presently located on Stlffe Bank to Shah Alluin Shoal* This Company, as well as our friends the Arabian American Oil Company, has always considered that Shah Allum Shoal was a serious hazard to navigation particularly with respect to vessels proceeding to and from Arabian and Bahrein ports, and the mouth of the Gulf end that the Shoals should be lighted. This view is also taken by the majority of the Ceptains of ships calling at Bahrein whose opinions the Company has taken. With respect to the moving of the light from Stlffe Bank to Shah Allum Shoal, the Company does not wish to make a recommendation which could be interpreted that we wished to benefit the navigation to Bahrein and Arabia at the expense of the navigation to Northern Gulf Ports and we l»ve the consideration of this point to the appropriate officials* However, the Company does strongly recommend the moving of the light if it is considered that the moving of the light would not be detrimental to the navi gation to Northern Gulf Ports. In any event, the Company strongly recommends that a light be installed at Shah Allum Shoal to mark this serious danger to navigation. Yours very truly, ORIGINAL SIGNED BY JP-J n * r-% \ \ \ J R.

Since vessels arrive at all hours of the day and night Information of their arrival is usually not received until after they have anchored, and a considerable time therefore usually elapses before the ^larantlne edical Officer goes on board. 2. To avoid delay in future, and to assist the quarantine helical &gt;-&gt;ffleer generally it is requested that pending th« Introduction of more effective quarantine iieasures in Bahrain you instruct the masters of ail freighters and/or tankers with which you are concerned, which intend to call at Sitra, to repeat radiograms of their expected time of arrival to the quarantine eileal Officer direct, informing him also whethor their bills of health from th-Jir last port of call are clean or otherwise and whether there are any cases of ivfectioua or other diseases on board.

Dear Colonel Hay, s 6 Will you please refer to your fteml-offlclal letter No. 712-S dated the 7th September, 1946 and your Note on the question of the recovery of lighting dues at Sitra* J?. I agree that arrangements should be made to recover port dues from vessels visiting Sitra, and that these dues should cov )r lighting^ quarantine^ and any similar services. 3. ilelkle informs me that Gray : ackenzie and Company could undertake the recovery of such dues, and would hand over to us the total sura collected, with a detailed account, at the end of each month. The actual scale of dues payable can be fixed when we have detailed figures of the expenditure to be incurred under each head, but as far as quarantine measures are concerned 1 think that a minimum charge of Ks.25 per vessel would be about the right figure. This is similar to that charged in Basra, and should produce an Income here of between o %l f 000 and 1^2,000 a month to cover the cost of the Sltra quarantine ' elical Officer and his establishmenta 4.

A \X Dear Sir: In my letter No. C/PA-382 of August 3, 19A9, I outlined a program of proposed changes to the lighting in Sitra Anchorage arusTchannel, giving details of the proposed changes and the time schedule of the work involved. Due to unforeseen difficulties in connection with the work, the schedule was delayed somewhat, also it was necessary to install some of the beacons in positions slightly different from those originally outlined. Furthermore, when discussing the program with Captain Skelton, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, he made some suggestions as to characteristics of the Channel Lights, and these have been accepted for incorporation in the program, subject to confirmation from the Basra Port Directorate that the necessary adjustments can be made to the lighting mechanisms, wnich it is reasonable to suppose can be done. On the basis of the above changes in some of the details of the original outline, it is considered desirable to submit revisions of the pertinent details. For this purpose I am attaching Revised Exhibit II, 'PROPOSED NEW ARRANGEMENT OF LIGHTING FACILITIES- SITRA CHANNEL AND SITRA HARBOR - BAHREIN', which cancels and super sedes the Exhibit II which was attached to my letter No. C/PA-382 of August 3, 1949.

Dear Sir, i qaq ledge your letter No.6/P6/27/1307 of August 28, If 49, on the subject of harbor lighting at Sltra and regret the long delay In answer In;. Howevr, some of the Infornatlon you requested was no', available here and has only recently been received, and i'urth. r, due to difficulties In driving piles. It was necessary to shift the locations of two of the beacons substantially froa those given you originally, hence It was felt ieslraile to complete the work so that the positions could be accurst el. charted. This has now been done, and the altered locations together with proposed new characteristics of the channel lights a' indlcsted In Revised Fxhlblt II attached to our letter No.C/PA-393 to His Britannic Majesty's Political Afent, copy of which Is enclosed herewith. The points raised in your letter will be discussed below* '* s ^ rou n0 * doubt have been informed, construction work on the leacons was unavoidably delayed, hence 'Beerchus' was unable to carry out the work outlined on her last trip. Tverythlnr is readiness now, and we suggest 'Nearchus' carry out the necessary work during her next visit, which we understand will be in early November. v Xoul ' cogent regarding the stability of the beacon structures ibs b( en noted, and our engineers assure us that the structures are stablee ■ e appreciate your advice and comments regarding the malnte- nance and characteristics of the light buoys, and are entirely agree- able to modifying the characteristics to suit the desired malntenanci .ro : r Ir answer to one of the questions later in your letter* we wish to have Persian Gulf Lighting Service take care of thp maintenance and servicing of North and Middle Sitra Li ;ht Buoys and also the light on the new south Sitra Beacon. P GeL.S. are already servicing the channel buoys, bence the only change in pro- cedure is the addition of the new beacon. The light on the n«w ooutb Itra Beacon is an acetylene light, purchased from American t ? s /vec Uiinjlator Co., and we are informed thet the equipment and parte are interchangeable with those at present in use on the Sitra Channel tuoys and other lights maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. The beacon is equipped with four acetylene cylin ers, and we confirm that we desire you to rech6r,»e the cy linders. As to the harbor beacon lights, namely North and Sruth ange and c:outh Sh.als beacons, these pre electric 11 'Ms and we will service and maintain them ourselves. Referring again tc the characteristics of the channel lights. Captain Skelton. Senior Kaval Officer, Persian Gulf, has recommended that the three lights have distinctly different characteristics, and we ere in agreement with this. On this basis, and havin - in mind your suggestion regarding adherence to the 1/6 cycle, we recommend the following: NOKTli SITRA LIGHT BUOY - Plashing White Light Flash 2 seconds Eclipse 10 seconds. Middle2 middle sitra light buoy south sitra beacon Group Flashing White Light Flash 1 second Eclipse 1 second Flash 1 second Eclipse 9 seconds Flashing White Light Flash 1 second Eclipse 5 seconds. The above requires a change from the previously outlined characteristics of Middle Sltra (present South Sltra) Buoy and a so south Sitre leacon, and It Is assumed that the adjustments to the mechanisms can be made without difficulty, nve would appreciate your confirming this point and also that the above characteristics tre satisfactory. If it is Impossible to change the cbop cUristics, or, if for some; reason tie proposed characteris tics, ere unsuitable, we will appreciate your comments and sugges- ^ ey bearing in mind the requirement that the three channel lights be of different characteristics. foe note your question regarding the use of green lights and also regarding the purpose of the Range Bencons, We realize that g • an ^ th€ red &amp;s w e 11 &gt; visible a shorter distance ' j -ey vere white, but since they are located Inside the harbor, long range visibility is not required. The purpose of the ^ange Be cons is to mark the banks at the approaches tc the No.2 (New) Wharf, principally to aid in berthing and unberthlng at night. South Shoal Beacon marks the bank on the southern limit of the hare or. All three of these lights have unrestricted arcs of it uminatlon, that is, they will be visible through 360 decrees. Further pertinent data on these lights are tabulated below: Color Size lantern Type Visibility Focal sea ailes plane ♦ feet. South Sitra Beacon White 300 m/m South Shoal Beacon Green 200 m /m North Range Beacon Green 200 m/m South Range Beacon Red 200 m/m Acetylene Electric Electric Electric 8 ii 46 , 6 W la'e' 13»6 W 13 % 6* are based on a transmission fact or of,80. Regarding the question of inspection and lighting of South bitra se con by your Lighthouse Engineer, if you consider this ne- ces?arv ancj desirable, we are agreeable to have him come to Bahrain by air xOrthis purpose. However, we are wondering whether your personnel on L.T. 'Nearchus' could make the inspection and light the Beacon, in which case it would be unnecessary for your Engineer tc ne '&lt;e t re trip. A further thought in this connection is that if yo ;r Lnglneer will be coming to Bahrein for the meeting of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service, local section, which we understand is to beheld here on November 7, 1949, the inspection could be made at that time. The question of timing also enters, since the Beacon should be lighted at the same time as M Nearchus n relocates South Sitra Buoy to Jtoiddle Sitra and changes the characteristics, so the;t the channel and harbor lighting program can go Into operation all at one time.. ... r ~ ■ -We will be pleased to receive any further comments you may have in connection with this program, but believe the above information covers the questions you raised in your letter of August 3, 1949. We would appreciate receiving your confirmation that it will be satisfactory to complete the program previously outlined for 'Nearchus', during her next visit here, that is, relo cation of South Sitra Buoy to Middle Sitra, change the characteris tics of the light on the re-located buoy and also on the new South Sitra Beacon, placing all three channel lights in operation, and lifting the present Middle Sitra Dumb Buoy for delivery to our Sitra Causeway. If for some reason it is not feasible to complete this program in the near future, we would apprecipte your advising the earliest date this can be accomplished.
