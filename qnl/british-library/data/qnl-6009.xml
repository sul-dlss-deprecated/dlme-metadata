Dear Hay, Your letter No.126/11/48 dated 15th November, 1948 enclosing correspondence with Galloway about British Advisers for Kuwait. 2. We are far from convinced by the Shaikh*s arguments against th^employment of British Advisers. There is no doubt that with the expansion of oil interests the deficiencies of the State administration will become both more apparent and more the object of criticism inside and outside the State. That criticism will fall not only upon the Shaikh but upon us, and neither we nor the Shaikh will have any adequate defence to offer. There is no question of financial strigency. As to internal criticism it seems probable that, by putting his house in order, the Shaikh will silence at least as much of it as he arouses. As regards external criticism, 7/e very much doubt whether, if his fears are genuine, they are substantial. In any case, the overriding consideration in our view is the need for efficient administration, and if we allow the Shaikh to carry his point about external criticism now we can resist it progressively less as other Arab states follow the natural course of gradually dispensing with British Advisers. But if the example of non-Arab but Muslim states may profitably be held up to the Shaikh, reference might be made to the employment of scores of British or American advisers by Pakistan and Iran. 3. If you agree with our opinion that the Shaikh's fear of criticism is no more than a pretext for procrastination, I suggest that, if you see no objection, you should indicate firmly to the Shaikh that the situation requires, and our responsibilities entitle us to ask of him, the employment of British Advisers without further delay. As to what Advisers, we suggest, as a matter of tactics and as an earnest that we are serious, you should ask for both Financial and Police. If the Shaikh is permitted to accept one only at first, his deficiencies or opposition to him, real or alleged, may be urged against the appointment of the other. For this reason, as the Financial Adviser is the more important, we should give him first priority and, failing simultaneous appointment which is the most desirable course, ensure that he is appointed first. In the hope that your representations will have a favourable outcome we are pursuing enquiries confidentially regarding possible candidates for the post of Financial Adviser.

Mr. Burrows thanked His Highness for this and continued that, efficacious as action on these lines was, it was not in itself enough. Mr. Burrows then reverted to the subject of improve ments in the Administration designed to to raise the standards of living of the workers and suggested to His Highness that, while it was clear that large sums of money were being expended, it was not certain that His highness was getting results commen surate with the expenditure involved. He continued that it was the feeling in t,he Foreign Office that expenditure of capital and income should be planned over a number of years and reserves accumulated in such a way that, if the price of oil were to fall or any ocher circumstance arise to limit His Highness’ income, the standards of administration at that, time actained could be maintained out of income from reserve funds. At this stage his ^ighness intervened to ask whether we were discussing Communism or money. Mr. Burrows indicated that Communism and improvements in standards of admin istration were, in H.M.G’s experience, parts of the same problem. His Highness replied that all his life he had de voted his energies to improving the lot of his people, and, when one considered how small Kuwait was, how it lacked many material resources, and yet how prosperous it was, he thought that we shouldrf- Mr. Burrows thamced him for his expression of loyalty, but continued that Gommunism was not quite the same thing as Nazism. That while Nazism had rergdc relied on force of arms; Communism, in the present stage at any rate, relied on influencing the minds of men and that it was by influencing His Highness T own subjects that Communism might gainjk footing in Kuwait. police action and demanded what was behind fcfcx all this talk: of improving his administration. Hitherto he had been left to run it himself. He had been well looked after by His Hajesty T s Government abroad, but left alone at home. If His Majesty T s wanted his money they should say so. Otherwise, it arose from oil resources which belonged to Kuwait and was their own to dispose of. ion of His Majesty’s Government at all; that they had no desire 10 criticise what had been done but rather jointly to tackle a common problem. His Bigness thanked Mr. Burrows and assured him that he v/ould always be glad to have His Majesty’s Govern ment’s help, and that hB would always turn to His Majesty’s Political Agent when he wanted it. If His Majesty’s Govern ment had any specific advice to offer they could always offer it through the Political Agent end he would be gald to consider His Highness then reiterated his assurances about Mr. Burrows explained that this was not the intent- it. Throughout the interview, while being quite forth- coming and cooperative about police action against Communists, His Highness\ His highness did not or would not grasp the connection between standards of administration and the development of Communism in Kuwait. Whenever the expenditure of State funds was touched he was ready to draw a herring across the trail; and appeared to regard the connection between internal administration and Communism as a bogey introduced to persuade him to surrender some of his autonomy. In closing the interview Mr. Burrows asked His fiigness whether he had any points to refer to His Majesty’s Government, to which he replied that he had nothing to conceal and nothing to asx for. n e was absolute ly satisfied with the treatment he had received. asr. y$\ 6'.Jonflaenui^l. ::o.J/237U/Jb) Kuwb i December Political Dear 31r supers 4 ib ember of the Kuwait Oil Company v/hom I &lt;new formerly in Rumania asiced me recenwly if it were true that &amp;he Shel £th of ^.u eit was loo king for a financial adviser* hen as ved why he said that six months a£° he had he~rd from a Lr.

The Shaikh asked why I was bringing up this question so often* Was it the wish of His Majesty's Government that British advisers should be appointed? If so he would comply if he received an order to do so* I told him His lajesty's Government were very anxious that British advisers should be appointed but that we wanted the matter arnfttfged not ^ by order but with his concurrence* I said that if he did not like the word *adviser ,, some other term could be employed, and that in any case we did not want a second Belgrave in Kuwait but only to provide him with experts to assist him in Improving the administration of his btate* Amongst other things I referred to the necessity for improving the traffic control in the town and the efficiency of the police generally* He replied that he was doubling the strength of his police and that he had engaged two British-trained police officers from alestine.

In ray opinion our policy should be, as Galloway indicates, to N use our established and accepted position to encourage the Kuwait Government from behind the scenes to put their house in order**.

I note that you are of opinion that the aultan 4 ^ fear of criticism is no more than a pretext from procrastina tion. This may be so to some extent and I doubt if criticism in the Iraqi press or elsewhere would really deter the Shaikh from appointing British advisers had he made up his mind that the step was desirable, fthat he really fears is the opposition of the Aulad Salim and other vested interests in Kuwait who would lose many perquisites if a really sound administration were introduced. 5. My view is that we should continue to press the Shaikh every few months to employ British advisers or technicians, but that we should refrain from issuing anything in the nature of an ultimatum until there is such a breakdown in the administration as to make this course imperative. 6. If, however, you are of opinion that the time has come when we must issue some thing in the nature of an ultimatum to the Shaikh, I would suggest that I should be authorised to do this in writing. On hearing from you to this effect I will submit a draft for approval. 7.

NOTE ON MH. 3UHHDW3 T INT3H7IEV/ WITH HIS HIGHNESS. M r. Burrows saw His Highness on the morning of Saturday the 14th May and after the usual exchange of greetings explained to His Highness that His Majesty’s Government had been for some months past particularly exercised to combat Communism, ^hey had found from their experience in other parts of the world that this could most effectively be done by action on parallel lines: by vigorous police action against agitators and other Communist agents, and by social reform designed to remove conditions of poverty, squalor, and inequality of opport unity in which Communism had been found to take root most easily. lie explained that Communism had already got a hold on other countries in the Middle East and he hoped that steps could be taken now to prevent Kuwait becoming another fertile field for its propagation. Mr. Burrows continued that he was impressed by the building activity and many schemes of improvement of which he had heard and indeed seen something - in Kuwait, as well as by the large sums of mgfoey that had been placed at the disposal of the various Departments of His Highness’ Government for the improvement of the administration. At this stage His Highness interrupted to say that as regards police action against Communism he had recently strength ened his Police Eorce by the employment of personnel from the former Kshould have to admit -uhat he had not been wholly unsuccess ful. He continued that His Majesty’s Government had always protected him from interference from outside and had refrained from interfering in his internal affairs; and that he hoped it was not His Majesty’s Government’s intention to change their policy. Mr. Burrows continued that the presence of large sums of money in a small State liKe Kuwait [in the midst of a world racKed by poverty and insecurity would give rise to an increasing volume of criticism and jealousy fro^Kis Highness’ neighbours and others, unless it could be shown that His High ness was making exemplary use of his money on social and other services designed to better the lot of the ordinary man. His Majesty’s Government would always do their best to put the Kuwait case in the best light possible, but they could only successfully argue a case in which they themselves believed. At this point His Highness interrupted to say that he had in the past dealt with Nazism although in Kuwait it had been supported by powers outside his State; and, God willing, he would, with His Majesty’s Government’s help and advice, deal equally ruthlessly with Communism by expelling its exponents. He had always received help and advice from His Majesty’s Government in ample measure in dealing with his external relations, but he had always conducted his internal affairs himself. /hile internally he was Ruler of Kuwait; he was, externally, not just a friend of His Majesty’s Government but, like all of us, an actual servant of His Majesty’s Government.

His Highness agreed and said that he vas a rich man out that his riches were sometimes a trouble to him. I therefore suggested that he should seek advice, and His Highness replied that he felt he would quite soon have to get a British Object to advise him financial ly. His Highness made no definite request, but from what I know of him he would not make such a statement lightly, and would expect me to take it up in the right quarters. It would slit us if His Highness would accept a financial adviser nominally, as this person would, in fact, perform the functions of an Adviser. An appointment of this sort is what we have been wanting for some time - c.f. your letter No. C/693 of the 9th November, 1939, to Hay - and would meet with approval from the great majority of the merchant class. 5. It may seem premature to discuss personages to fill a post not yet created, but as the case was dropped for want of a suitable person and as a name has suggested itself to me I will mention it now. This person is Hogg who vas until recently financial adviser to the Iraqi Government. His services were dispensed with in connection with the ''ard - Iraqi railway dispute, and he had no job when I• last heard of him, i.e. H'raas last year. I have never met him, but I know his family which is approaching something like Legion, and this might possibly induce him to accept an appointment here, despite the fact that it would be inferior in status to his past post. H&lt;fcgg is, of course, fully conversant with Arabic. 6 . Beyond His Highness' mentioning the matter, I think now is a good time to take up the question again of an adviser, for, from His Highness downwards, Kuwait is pretty bewildered by currei\ events. A man like HOGG who knows the ramifications of the \rab mind in financial matters would be of immense value, and would fill tihe bill as I now see it excellently.Hi Original in file No. 4/13-A - Technical 'Sducation.

D,0.No.C/360-4/25 My dear Houstoun-Poswall, The guestion of an 'Adviser' for Kuwait has again arisen in a mild form, and the name of Hogg (late Financial Adviser to the Iraqi Government) has been suggested. As we do not know if this suggestion is practicable could you kindly let me have any particulars you may have concerning Hogg, the salary he drew, previous service etc? He was probably getting a higher salary in Iraq than he could hope to get here as his duties would not be particularly technical. Nevertheless it is possible that he is now looking for something. I know he was when I was at home. 2. If another name suggests itself to you perhaps you would let me know though there is, of course, no question at this stage of inviting applications.

As for Hogg, I should hardly think you could do worse. He was agreeable in a donnish sort of way, but a most contemptible ’’yes' man.

Please refer to my telegram No. 606 dated the 25th July, 1945. As the same question will almost certainly arise this summer I think I should let you know what happened last year. 2. I mentioned the matter to His Highness who told me that he would personally supervise the Revenue and supply Departments in Shaikh Abdulla Salim’s absence. If he did so at all, his supervision must have been purely nominal and ijtehad as Salim did in fact step into his brother’s shoes. I even received a letter (which I ignored) from flahad on the Supply Department’s business. However, Abdulla Salim reassumed his post on his return and Pahad as Salim has since been officially unemployed, although I believe he interests himself to a certain extent in the work. 3. I fancy that the position this year is different, pahad as Salim, I hear, is keen to regain his position: Abdulla Salim’s health appears to be failing; and it is unlikely that he will oust Pahad should the latter be allowed to officiate. If a change is avoided this year I am afraid it will only be a postponement, for Pahad is much younger and more energetic, and intelligent and ambitious into the bargin. He is also fickle and easily swayed, and this, together with his association with the anti-ShaiKh party makes him, in my view, an unsuitable person to take over a post of such importance. If he is once allowed to take it over, it will probably be exceedingly difficult to have him removed again unless we can point to some grave misdemeanour. The Hon’ble Lt-Colonel W.R. Kay, C.S.I., O.I.S., Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, BUSHIKk2 . \*2r 4 # By local custom the senior posts in the administration are only held by the 'A1 Subah', and the Revenue Department has become the perquisite of the 'Aulad Salim'* If Abdulla Salim is allowed to relinquish his post there is no member of the 'Aulad Salim' , or of the 'Al Subah' for that matter, with the necessary qualifications and capabilities to replace him except Fahad as Salim* I should like your permission, therefore, to impress on His Highness the desirability of retaining the services of Abdulla Salim until an outsider can be found to fill his place. 5. From next month the Revenue Department will be receiving some Rfl 4,00,000/- monthly as oil royalties and the necessity of proper finance and budgetting will become more than ever necessary, and I am sure that His H5.ghness would agree tnat tne duties are beyond the capacity of any member oi his family* At the same time he has not the courage to incur the odium of appointing a foreign adviser on his own initiative, and would much rather it were done in such away that he could explain to the 'Aulad Salim' that it was due to British pressure. It is my opinion that we should take the initiative in having o.n adviser appointed. 6* The objections to the appointment of a British Adviser seem to be (a) A man with a considerable knowledge of finance would be required. The Kuwaitis are astute; and it would be damaging to our prestige if the man appointed at our instance were not a real expert. (b) He would have to know spoken and written Arabic. (o) He would have to be prepared to live more or less in Arab style as no European accommodation is available. This would probably confine the choice to a bachelor. (d) The appointment of a British Adviser would be likely to be seized upon by the press of Iraq and other Arab countries as an act of veiled imperialism. Under the circumstances I think that our interests, and those of Kuwait, would best be served by the appointment of an Egyptian or Syrian provided we could find one who wqs truly pro-3ritish as well as having the other qualifications required. Should heI not be satisfactory it would be easier, at the end of his contract, to appoint a British Adviser in his place than it would be to insert one ab initio . 7. If you agree I will impress on His Highness the importance of not allov/ing Bahad as Salim to obtain control of the Revenue Department and will obtain his reactions to the idea of an Egyptian or Syrian Financial Adviser. Should Abdulla Salim’s health continue to fail the matter will become one of some urgency. Yours sincerely, M.B.confidential.

His Highness* reaction was interestingt he asked no to speak to Abdullah Salim about it. This I accordingly did, and I heard before leaving that Abdullah Salim had abandoned his intention of aestivating in the levant. He may since, ofbouree, have changed hia mind again as he la notoriously fickle. 2. The conversation naturally led on to the question of the mismanagement of the State Finances, and Hia Highness asked me to apeak to Abdullah Selim strongly about the necessity for a budget. This I did on the same occasion as I spoke to hi® about Ms brother, and he replied that it would be done. 3. In the course of the conversation, it appeared that Hia Highness was convinced that the *Aulfid Salim** habitually misappropriated State funds, and that he would to only too glad to have someone independent of them, and whom he wild trust, in charge of the finances.

We are doubtful, however, whether it would be wise that the adviser should limit his activities strictly to financial matters, but feel that he should be competent also to advise on the economic development of the State as well as the invest ment of its. funds. I do not think that v/e should favour the idea of a Syrian or Egyptian national being engaged by the Sheikh as an adviser and I am glad to see from Tandy’s letter of 3rd August that the Sheikh himself volunteered that a British officer was the only solution. H.i.G. would, however, be in a much better position to forestall any proposal to appoint a foreigner if we v/ere ready with the name of a British candidate of our own who could be recommended to the Sheikh for this purpose. V/e would, therefore, propose to keep on the look-out for possible candidates. 3 .

Letter No.R.6.3288 dated the 2nd November, 194 6 from the Ruler of Kuwait. will be seen that th( Supply Department have no adequate explanation to offer for the discrepancy which has come to light. Consumption at the average rate of 230 tons per month could not be reached at the then ration- scale without a population of from 1,70,000 to 2,00,000 souls. 3. The real explanation is, of course, that sugar has been stolen or sold from the warehouses for smuggling out of Kuwaiti and it is said that Shaikh Fahad as Salim has had a major hand in this. Abdulla Salim I believe to be innocent of complicity, and this is the general belief. . 4. The action already t^ken to remedy the state of affairs — the dismissal of a clerk and the invocation of Divine aid— will not in my opinion be adequate. His Highness* attitude is that he has known all along that there was mismanagement in the Supply Department and that he has repeatedly exhorted Abdulla Salim to improve his organisation — what more could he do ? Privately, I believe, he has voiced the opinion that the British put the Aulad Salim into positions of influence and it is for them to get them out. I consider that this occurrence might provide a power ful lever with which to prise fin opening for an Adviser if a suit able candidate could be found, and am therefore reporting the facts to you before talcing any further action. M.B. Major. Political Agent, Kuwait. ^ .CQNr'IULNTIAL . Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, NO.1066-G the 23rd Rovember 1946. Please refer to the suggestion made in the last sentence of your express letter No.598 dated the 11th November 1946. I think there is little doubt that suitable candidates will be available for the appointment of Financial Adviser Kuwait as soon as the Indian Services are dissolved but v/e might have considerable difficulty in finding one now. We have been trying for a very long time to find a Financial Adviser for Muscat. The only persons who have offered themselves up to date are Thesiger of the Middle Bast Locust Organisation and Ingrams of Mukalla fame. We are not much in favour of the latter as he is rather old and really too big a noise and it remains to be seen whether Thesiger will be acceptable to the Sultan or not. 2 . I see no reason however why you should not suggest to the Shaikh that the scandal which has come to light gives him an opportunity of pursuing his proposal to appoint a British Adviser and ask him whether he would like us to be on the look out for a suitable candidate. If he shows signs of accepting this suggestion you might inform him that it may take us a considerable time to find a really suitable man as we do not wish to recommend anybody unless we are confident that he will make a success of the appointment. 3. So far as the sugar scandal itself is concerned if you see no objection would you please inform the Shaikh that in view of the great shortage of sugar in India and elsewhere the wastage that has been allowed to occur in Kuwait is extremely regrettable and that unless more efficient arrangements are made the local population are likely to suffer severely when the quota is reduced vide Residency telegram No.1185 dated 25th October 1946. Further I shall not feel inclined to recommend that Kuwait should receive her proper share of such sugar as is available if I know that it will not be properly distributed. 4 . Mould you also make it clear to the Shaikh that I must naturally hold him responsible for the doings of his Supply Lepartment and that I am somewhat surprised that he should merely forward a letter from that Depart ment to you with no comment on the very large figures for consumption.

In discussing the subject with me he used the A A A ^ words 'Ana mu Khain li ’Ibilad:' and there is, no doubt, an influential body of opinion which would stigmatise the appointment of a British adviser as a betrayal of Kuwait to the British.

Major M.P.O’C Tandy, Political Agent, Kuwait.SECRET Copy of Mr. Donaldson's letter No. Ext. 2317/47, dated the 27th October 1947 to Sir Rupert Hay, P.R.P.G. Would you please refer to correspondence on the subject of the appointment of a Financial Adviser to the Shaikh of Kuwait, resting with your letter No C/35, dated 13th March 1947 ? S3/ 2. We have been giving further thought to this question and have been considering whether the time has not now come for us to take more active steps to secure the assent of the Shaikh of Kuwait to the appointment of a British Financial Adviser for his State. As I think you are aware oil royalties at Kuwait are estimated to reach the figure of £.3i million per annum by 1950, rising to £.5 million per annum by 1955; and in addition to this there is a substantial income which the Shaikh will derive from oil rights in the Neutral Zone.’ It seems clearly desirable that a large proportion of these revenues should be 'ploughed back' into the State to provide improved administration, public amenities and services and other benefits. This would call for large scale development, which the Kuwait Government might find impossible to undertake successfully without the guidance of a capable administrator possessing a sound knowledge of finance. Further, the disastrous consequences which might ensue from this sudden acquisition of wealth, should the Shaikh remain without the assistance of an adviser of integrity and experience are obvious. 3 t Other considerations bearing on this subject which appear to stress the importance of the early appointment of a Financial Adviser are:- (a) The avoidance of maladministration, expecially corrupt or v/asteful practices, which might lead to a revival of agitation against the Shaikh, and perhaps to the activities of communist agents in the territory; (b) The importance of the Shaikh being able to stand on his own legs and of his not becoming more and more dependent on the Kuwait Oil Company for advice and assistance in the internal affairs of his State; (c) The influx of foreign labour on a large scale mdty demand a substantial improvement in some branches of the administration, particularly in police arrangements. It may V'-ell become necessary for the Kuwait Government to employ British personnel in their Police Force as was the case at Bahrain. . 4. Local difficulties, in particular the opposition which might be encountered from Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim and from certain sections of the public to such an appointment, are fully appreciated. We feel, however, that it might be possible to obtain Shaikh Abdullah's co-operation by some arrangement which would preserve his position in the State; he might for instance be^allowed to continue as Minister of Finance, though it would be eseential for the British Financial Adviser to have access to the Ruler wheneverhe considered this necessary. So far as public opinion is concerned, ve rould welcome more information on which to assess the degree of opposition which might be encountered, anu to what extent thii would be outweighed by those in favour of the appointment. 5. I shoiild therefore be grateful if you would examine the ouestion further and let me know in due course how you consider the paimM ground might be prepared for a further approach to the Shaikh. Provided the appointment is not delayed too long and the terms are generous the chances of finding a suitable ex I.C.S. officer for the post are reasonably good, though it may not be possible to secure such an officer who has had experience in the Finance Department either of the Government of India or of a Provincial Government.i n &gt;3/113 S I/am (CYPHER TELtiGHAii OTP • SECKET) Political Resident, at Kuwait.

My dear Sir Rupert Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/152 dated the 16th November f 1947• 2 # It is my opinion that Abdullah Salim will not raise any serious eprosition to the appointment of a Financial Adviser y and that the Shaikh f should he be whole-heartedly in favour of the appointmentjuill be able to overcome any opposition on the part of the public* 3. I think it unlikely that the Shaikh will agree to appoint an Adviser whom he has not met and interviewed personally! and also improbable that he will gladly pay the fare of prospective candidates from the United Kingdom to Kuwait. It would therefore facilitate matters if likely candidates serving in the East could visit Kuwait should an opportunity occur when travelling to or from the United Kingdom, 4, The arguments in the last three sentences of paragraph 2, and in paragraph 3 f of Her, Donaldson&lt;8 letter No.FTTfe317/47 dated the 27th October, 1947 to you seem so compelling and so we11•put that I should like to translate them and read them to His Highness in order to strengthen his new-found conviction that an Adviser might be of use to him. May I do so ? \ Yours sincerely, The Hon«ble Lt»Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.B,, C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.

It is exceedingly difficult to foretell what would be the reactions of the public to the appointment of an adviser as so much depends on how the appointment is introduced by the Shaikh. The members of the Subah family who take their cue from His Highness would no doubt feel that their interests were being protected; but the Aulad and the opposition party would have much backing from the following classes should they wish to arouse tne public against the appointment. (a) The politically-minded and the students who could be persuaded to see in the appointment an inroad of British Imperialism ana an insult to the administrative capacity of Kuwaitiea. (b) The officials and others who are in a position to profit from corrupt and lax raimini strati on. (c) The opponents of the Shaikh who do not wish to see his authority increased,. * i 3. Of these I regard (a) as the most important but they are unlikely to be effective unless they are given an authorit ative lead. The general puolic would probably be largely indifferent: although they might feel that they would get fairer treatment f this would be off-set by the thought of having tu deal with an uncomprehending ana uncomprenensible foreignar, and by the injury to their conceit. Vithout a lead there is unlikely to be any serious opoosition although it is equally unlikely that the public will openly welcome the appointment.

If I visit Kuwait myself before I go on leave I will if possible speak to the Shaikh on the lines suggested by Burrows. Meanwhile if a suitable opportunity occurs you might speak to him again about the appointment of a Police Adviser. I do not think there is any question of shaming the Shaikh out of his present attitude. He does not, I think, fear criticism in the Iraqi press on his own account, but because of the effect it may have on his subjects and the encouragement it gives to those who are opposed to him. R.M. Andrew, Esquire, Political Agent, KUWAIT •LB’CONFIDENTIAL PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN No.62 the 18th May, 1948 Dear Dundas, Please refer to your s4mi-official letter No.(E 5589/ 848/91) dated the 11th May 1948 regarding a Financial Adviser to the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. As pointed out in my letter N 0 . 6 OO-S dated the 20th March to Gibson, I should prefer Woods-Ballard to Harrington- Hawes for Kuwait. I have heard from the former and in replying to him pointed out that it may be some time before the Shaikh of Kuwait accepts an Adviser and suggested that he is willing to be considered for the Muscat appointment which is to b4 filled as soon as possible, he should let the Foreign Office know. I spoke to the Shaikh on a recent visit to Kuv/ait and he said that he still had considerable opposition to overcome but hoped that he would be ina position to ask us for an Adviser 'at no distant date'. 3. I have a very high opinion of Woods-Ballard and if he is not willing to wait for the Kuwait job which may take a long time to materialise, I suggest that we should if possible obtain his services for Muscat. If he accepts it, it will be necessary for him to come out and see the Sultan and then if he is approved, to spend some six months learning Arabic at the School of Oriental Studies. 4. With regard to Harrington Hawes' questions, the cost of living at Kuwait is very high and I have already suggested that pay of the appointment there should not be less than Rs.30(y- p.m. tax free c.f. paragraph 3 of demi-official letter N 0 . 6 OC-S feated the 20th March 1948 to Gibson. It will be for us to recommend to the Shaikh the pay and other conditions of the appointment. Free furnished accommodation and a suitable car should certainly be provided but mntil the Shaikh can build a special house the incumben will probably have to put up with rather inferior accommodation. Regarding leave passages, I think we should recommend to the Shaikh a three-year contract which should include six months leave with free passages for the incumbent and his family at the beginning and end of the contract and free return passages for leave once during the course of the contract.

I also enquired when he intended to address the Political Agent about the appointment of a British Police Officer c.f. last two sentences of paragraph 5 of my despatch under reference. He replied that he had not pursued the matter as news of the proposal had somehow reached Iraq and some of the newspapers had published articles strongly condemning It* One such article has come to notice In a paper called 'Istiqlal'• I have the honour to be Sir With great truth and respect Your most obedient humble servantn We agree we must leave it to you to time your next approach to the Shaikh of Kuwait about a Financial Adviser. It may however be worth mention ing tohim that the men we have had in mind for this job have all got other irons in the fire and, owing to our inability to. make them a firm offer, are gradually being absorbed into other employment. As regards Customs and Police Advisers, if the appoint ment of a Financial Adviser is going to hang fire much longer, there would appear to be no harm, in \ view of the fact that it was the Shaikh himself who suggested them, in pressing for the appointment of at least a Police Adviser first. Perhaps you may be able to shame the Shaikh out of his present atti tude that he cannot appoint one because of Iraqi press criticism. We presume that a knowledge of Arabic will be essential for this appointment and would be glad to hear whether you feel there would be any special objection to our making enquiries aboit candidates from the former Palestine Police, which would of course be the most fruitful source if a knowledge-of Arabic is regarded as essential.'

The only fresh point which emerged in the course ^ x of the conversation was that he thought that Ibn 3aud might criticize him if he employed a British Adviser and that at present he was not ready to face local criticizm. He drew a picture of success only being achieved by steady stages,^ and that one must not try to fly an aircraft before being able to ride a bicycle. He said that he was preparing the ground. 4.

I enclose a copy of subsequent correspondence with Galloway on the subject of the appointment of Bri tish Advisers for Kuwait. As you will see, tie position is still unsatisfactory. I intend to have a talk with the Shaikh ayself during a visit which I hope to make to Kuwait next month, but I am afraid it is unlikely that I shall make any progress. In the circumstances it is perhaps only fair to Middleton to inform him that there does not appear to be any likelihood of his being re quired for the Kuwait appointment in the near future. Sgd.

The Shaikh asked why I was bringing up this question so often. Was it the desire of H.M.G. that British Advisers should be appointed ? If so, he would comply with this desire if he receiv ed an order to do so. I told him it definitely was the desire of H.If.G. but that it was not a matter in which we wished to issue any order, or take any action without his concurrence. I said that if he did not like the word 'adviser” some other term could be employed. We wanted to assist him in improving the administration of the State in view of the great developments that were taking place and provide him with experts for the purpose. I referred particularly to the necessity for improving traffic control, and for an expert in accountancy in view of the large revenue now accruing to the State. He replied that he was doubling the strength of the police and that he had engaged two British trained Palestinian police officers who were expected to arrive shortly, in order to improve their standard. He recognised the need for expert assistance in financial matters, but the time was not yet ripe to ask us to provide one, and when it was he would ask for one. The same applied to Customs. He asked me to wait until we received a request from him. I told him that we would wait, but that I would bring up the matter again during my future visits to Kuwait. \ i ltd. W.R.H. 16/12/48.

Nothing to be Written in this Margin,R/7 ( The Politicsl Agency, Kuwait. As I promised I am sending you a sketch of the background against which an Adviser would have to work. ?. Kuwait is an autocracy ruled over by the Shaikh almost despotically for nearly 30 years, and on the whole with great success if not with efficiency from the western point of view. Some fifteen years ago at our instigation a 'Majlis' was instituted to operate as a safety valve for airing the viewsof a faction of the merchants desirous of obtaining more power for themselves and a greater say in the local administration. It was strongly supported by Shaikh Abdullah Salim, broadly speaking inimical to the Shaikh, and his followers the Aulad Salim (Abdullah Salim’s father was Mubarrak’s second son who succeeded as Shaikh on his elder brother’s death. On his death the succession reverted by public choice to the senior line. The democratic movement was strongly supported by the then Political Agent with the result that the Shaikh was nearly unseated in a revolt which he nut down only with difficulty. From then onwards the Shaikh was given closer support, and the Aulad Salim took second place retaining authority in some jcIjcek of the branches of the State’s administration and over which the Shaikh exercises no detailed control. He shows a general interest and allots monpplies for expenditure. In return for our support the Shaikh gives us co-operation within the limits of the Treaty. Outside these limits he js inclined to become difficult. 3. The Shaikh is supported by Abdullah Mubarrak, the youngest son of the late Mubarrak, a man very friendly to us and his rather fanatical public secretary who controls the office they mis-spell as the 'Secretariate' on the Government note paper. His father was public secretary before him from his youth upwards, while the family has been in this public position almost since the days of the foundation of modern Kuwait. There is also Ezzat Jaffar a power in the Palace, who can be described as the 'favourite', and who is the influence behind the pushing of American interests with the Shaikh. Incidentally it may not bepwell known that Ezz at Jaffar obtained much of his power from his friendship, association and influence over the Shaikh's sons r living in the Palace. These are the men who direct policy and political matters. 4. The Aulad Salim are immensely powerful in their sphere, since their authority is closely supported by the merchants whose interests are allied to theirs. They control the details of finance, customs, supplies and police, and with this backing they work in a manner not wholly acceptable to western ideas, but, nevertheless, they do work, and the town of Kuwait prospers to a degree comparable with the success the Shaikh has brought to his share in the management of affairs. 5. Their respective snheres, to which both parties adhere rigidly refraining from interference jn each/ H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident , Persian Gulf, Bahrain.each others affairs may be likened to Whitehall — the Shaikh’s department and the Cjty of London — the Abdullah Salim department. 6. In their respective spheres each party is all powerful and jealous of its authority. They give nothing away and only co-operate when their common interests and authority is threatened. Both parties are equally satisfied with their own methods, jealous of their own authority, proud as Lucifer and strut about like pouter pigeons in their own importance. In their eyes Kuwait borders on Utopia and they dislike the thought of possible contamination from outside influence. Foreigners, when employed, must as far as possible come from the Middle East and be Moslems. They are anxious to adopt and absorb western ideas and inventions which they think nay be beneficial to Kuwait while rejeetingany but strictly technical guidance on how this may best be done to Kuwait’s advantage. This Xenophobia extends to the merchant class — the backbone of Kuwait — but probably not beyond to the poorer classes. 7. I do not know why the Shaikh broached the subject of an adviser in the first place, though at a venture I suggest he wanted, with H.M.G’s backing, to frighten the Aulad Salim whose mismanagement at that time was probably bringing the State into public obliquy. It is clear today that, for whatever the reason may have been, the Shaikh has changed his mind and is only prepared to emnloy an adviser under the strongest pressure from H.7.G. This threat of employing an adviser has had the effect of stimulating the Aulad Salim and the ’’Whitehall” party into greater co-operation with us and with the Shaikh and also in the employment of more foreign assistance from the Middle East in various branches of the administration. 8. There is, however, plenty of room for improvement. The Shaikh has loaded Abdullah Salim with the difficult and responsible post of Director of Finance. Beyond native Kuwaiti wit he has no qualifications and is not even industrious, neither does he employ experienced men and if he did he could not supervise them to any degree of efficiency. As it is he is obliged to overlook deficiencies of which he is aware but cannot remedy. 9. The Police, another branch of administration under the Aulad Salim is most certainly inefficient, and quite unable to cope with the rapidly increasing number of foreigners pouring into this 'iold-rush” State, and the rapid change from slow animal transport to the onslaught of ill-trained drivers of high powered American cars. ^'he distribution of rations and the arpalli^gly high cost of living will also need to be remedied. 10. Both parties work for their own advantage which they consider to be the advantage of Kuwait and as it is, except the distribution of wealth is very uneven, but not more so than in any state with which I am acauainted. Generally speaking the poor have benefitted as well as the merchant and Shaikhly classes, and the opportunities for them to improve their positions are eoually increased. It is an undoubted fact, however, that the rise in prices has outstripped the rise in wages and that the cost of living spiral still revolves. 11 There is/3 Ft) 11. There is practically no Government enterprise as such, since what public utility services there are, are owned by private companies, the shares in which are owned by merchants and by members of the Government but in what proportions it is quite impossible to find out. ^'he Chaikh lends money to merchants for enterprise and therefore while in fact owning - say - a new building is only the owner as ultimate creditor. This system extends to electricity, water etc. and is responsible for the poor state of development^ of services in Kuwait. Successfully to break it down, however, would be a task of Hercules. 12. That is a brief sketch of the Government of Kuwait as I see it today. The state is prosperous but its administration not organised on a western basis and whether we are to impose an adviser on the Kuwait Government against their will who would have to function without any backing and in the fact of opposition or use our established and accepted position to encourage them from behind the scenes to put their home in order is not for me to say. o conform w r ith the demands of westernization might mean the introduction of technicians but it would preserve their amour-propre and might be less unacceptable to them.
