Justin Sheil informs Samuel Hennell that he wrote to Hajee Mahomed Jaffer, requesting an explanation of the circumstances by which he came to possess Mr Tasker's watch. Sheil states that Hajee Mahomed Jaffer's reply is neither an admission nor a denial of his having disposed of the watch to the Agent at Shiraz, Meerza Mahmood. Sheil states that he also asked Prince Ferhad Meerza [Prince Farhad Mirza Mo'tamed ed-Dowleh] to write to Hajee Mahomd Jaffer, in order to ascertain the nature of the transaction that passed between him and the Agent. Sheil concludes that Hajee Mahomed Jaffer neither bought the watch nor disposed of it; he suggests that Hajee Mahomed Jaffer lied on behalf of the Agent, following the supplication of Meerza Mahmood's family. Sheil argues that there remains no doubt of the Agent's criminality and instructs Hennell to remove Meerza Mahmood from his post. The letter is followed by copies (in Perisan) of Hajee Mahomed Jaffer's replies to Sheil and Prince Ferhad Meerza respectively.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000047#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
