N0T3 ON THE DHUJAH PaOVINCE . SOUTHjiIgl »BI.. . TOPOG1U.EHY. The Diiufar Province, situated in the western extremity of the Sultan of Muscat's Southern Arabian territories, is enclosed by the Indian Ocean on its southern side and by Jibal Qara, a semi-circular formation of mountains running into the sea at Ras Hamar and Murbat, which shut it off from the mountains and deserts to the North, East and West. South-west monsoon clouds driving up from the Indian Ocean are here met by winds from the North and East and buffeted and depressed until they are entrapped by the mountains over the Dhufar plain. Dhufar is thus unique on the Southern Arabian coast in that it enjoys monsoon rainfall for some three months of the year. The Province contains three distinct physical tracts, a cultivated coastal belt, Alhafa, divided from the mountains by a desert plain some 40 miles in length and up to 9 miles in depth. The mountains enclosing the western end of the plain are precipitous and inaccessible while those to the East rise steeply with many sheer cliffs and deep gorges but are capped by rolling grassy uplands and interspersed with wide park-like valleys well v/ooded with wild fig, tamarind, acacia, sycamore and extensive groves of 'mishat' and 'metan' 1 , unidentified local trees the latter of close grained black wood too hea^yto float in water. Varieties of evergreen, privet, babul, wild olive, jasmine, camel thorn, tamarisk and an abundance of wild flowers and grasses provide ample grazing during the summer for herds of milch cattle, camels and goats numbering many hundreds. For shade there is a remarkable evergreen known locally as 'lathab' of which the spreading branches reseed themselves to grow smaller trees round the main trunk giving a vaulted effect. A 'lathab' found in Wadi Darbat provided shade for an entire camp sufficient for a small tent, guards, camels and visiting bedouin, some thirty persons in all, to be accommodated separately. The uplands rise gently to a height of between 3000 and// - 2 - ^ and 4000 feet at the top of the watershed and thence slope away *From Mr. t0 1:116 draining into V/adi Mugshin* on the southern edge Bertram Thome's* o: ^ Khali, Flying over the monsoon clouds it can be map in Arabia seen that the cloud formations are entrapped over the enclosed Felix* 1 . n ^ Mr.Thomas* Pl a i n an(i on southern slopes of the mountains, the reverse spelling of place slopes draining to the North being practically free of cloud and names has been foil- devoid of moisture. It is in these wadis that the frankincense, owed thr oughout for which the mountains have been famous through the ages, grows this note. wild. The dryness of the air determines the quality of the frankincense, the resin of similar trees growing on the southern slopes being spoilt by Lhe rain. Although the southern slopes enjoy a good rainfall the ground soil does not retain the water. Underground rivers drain the waters of Jabal Aram into V/adi Darbat the mouth of which is sealed by a sheer limestone cliff 500 feet high. The accumulated waters fill a lake two miles long, situated at a height of 1000 feet, and overflow during the rains to form a picturesque waterfall. Other underground rivers feed perennial springs at the foot of the hills. There are six of these springs; Jerzeez, the best of them, producing an estimated flow of 40,000 gallons of water an hour. These waters, if unharnessed, again disappear underground in the foothills and reappear to feed extensive fresh water creeks in the coastal belt divided from the sea only by narrow sand bars. Fresh water is easily obtainable from shallow wells at a distance of a hundred yards from high water mark and up x&gt;o a distance of one mile inland, beyond which the increased depth of the water discourages prospective cultivators. CLIMATE. Shade temperatures are moderate rarely exceeding 96° Fahrenheit and seldom falling below 60°. Monsoon clouds keep the summer cool if sticky while the winter months are warm except for periods when cold winds from the northern deserts cause heavy and prolonged dust storms and a sharp fall in temperature. PEOPLE. The people of the Province are as varied as the landscape,/(}) ^ *Sir Arth ur Keith and Dr. Wilton Marion Kr- ogman not ing in Appendix I of Mr. Bertram Thoma s' 'Arabia Felix 11 . - 3 - landscape, the Southern Arabians of the hills being distinct types considered by some* to be Hamitic in origin. They are a small limbed, dark skinned race v /ith well chiselled features, still in a nomadic and troglodytic state. Living in their sylvan hills they have left no mark on them. Only those who occasionally visit the few towns speak any Arabic and they observe the forms of Islam only during their brief visits. In their own hills they do not pray on the flimsy plea that there is no water for ablutions. To Islam they prefer pre-islamic rites to propitiate the jinn, of whom they go in perpetual dread; rites which their more orthodox Moslem rulers have so far been unable to eradicate. A bedouin of the 'Bait Katan' section averred to me that travelling at night he was once dogged by an old hag who, when threatened with a sword, retired growing larger and larger until she was transformed into a tree. Another said he had heard jinns in the running streams at dusk while a youth who was produced before me, alleged to be possessed of a jinn, appeared from his father's descriptions of his actions to be a somnambulist. The bedouin have no irrigated cultivation and they do not labour. Such cultivation as ^hey have is quite unsettled, a suitable patch being broken up before the rains if the whim takes them or necessity forces them. They live as parasites on the camel, the cow and the goat and barter incense for grain because collecting the former is easier than cultivating the latter and well fits in v/ith their migrations in search of grazing. The town of Salala contains a community of settled hillmen of the Kathiri tribe; a long established community of Saiyids hailing from the Yemen, mostly engaged in trade; a few artisans; some former slaves of East African origin and fishermen. The Hindoo festival of 'Diwali', until prohibited by the present ruler's father, was regularly celebrated by many professing Moslems of Salala. It is said to have oeen introduced by a Brahmin who was shipwrecked on the Dhufar coast and remained to initiate alien rites which found a ready acceptance among the lower classes who had been but imperfectly assimilated by/k) 11 by Islam. loomm and Frankincense growing wild, the milch cattle on the hill grazings and the riches of the sea provide the clue to the economics of Dhufar. Vast shoals of sardines frequent these waters during the winter pursued by tunny and other species, in their turn preyed upon by sharks, and provide a catch of up to ten thousand bags of sardines round the town of Salala alone and smaller catches along the coast. These are dried in the sun and form the staple diet of all draught and milch animals and even of the bedouin themselves in times of scarcity. It is not now an uncommon sight to see bedouin women and children carrying dried sardines from the beaches on their pack animals sharing the latter^ diet of uncooked sardine. The tunny provide one of the main items of the Dhufar townsman f s diet. The sardines are caught by professional fishermen using a type of surf boat of which the teak planks are sev/n together with coir rope to give added flexibility to resist the buffeting of the surf. They are sold to the merchants in return for grain, cloth and other necessities. The merchants pass them on to the bedouin as forage for their herds during the dry months of the year. Without them the lactations of the milch animals dry up. Last year the sardine catch was very poor and grain was almost unobtainable so that distress among the bedouin was widespread. Bedouin met with in February of this year said they had had no solid food for two months and less than their usual supplies of milk. They were certainly very emaciated. This distress was the main reason why so many labourers were available for work on the aerodromes and also one of the reasons why the labour was so poor. In normal years the bedouin do not labour. Sales of sardines were until recently made in terms of Maria Theresa silver thalers, but cash seldom passed hands because it was not available in sufficient quantities. Payment in cash earned a reduction in price of up to 150%. Settlement was usually made in terms of the milk of one cow for one month to be collected in the following summer. Cash transactions have/* /* fe) have this year, however, become general because the large sums Ox money brought into the country to pay for labour working on the aerodromes and the curtailment of imports have made cash more plentiful than goods. Merchants of the town who advance sardines in the autumn remove with their families to the hills in the summer, when grazing is plentiful, and encamp with the bedouin to supervise the collection of their milk and its manufacture into ghi for export. They also purchase the yea^s accumulations of hides for the same purpose. They take with them quantities of Indian millet and indigo-dyed cloth sheets to advance against the frankincense which the tribesmen collect from the dry wadis on the northern slopes of the hills. The ghi, hides and incense go to India and grain and cloth for the bedouin, and tea, coffee, sugar, rice and luxuries for the townsmen, are purchased with the foreign exchange thus secured. AGrlil OULTURS . The coastal belt contains valuable groves of cocoa- nuts, a few date gardens, and open fields closely cultivated by the servants of the well-to-do shaikhs and merchants of the town. Sugar-cane, cotton and indigo were until recently the most valuable field crops grown but indigo has now given way to such food crops as maize, millet and sweet potatoes. The hills and desert plain, on the other hand, although their cultivation is comparatively simple, have in recent years been entirely neglected. Collecting incense and bartering it x'or grain was preferred by the bedouin; and, in return for their exports, the merchants could in peace time obtain ample quantities of rice and other food from India. The little capital available could be more profitably employed in this trade than in building irrigation works. Nov/ that these supplies have dried up efforts are being made to re-establish cultivation. Old water courses have been repaired and new ones constructed to bring the water of the Jerzeez and other springs/- 6 - springs to the plain, and wheat has been grown for the first are time in living memory. Water and good fallow land/now available but an adequate supply of skilled labour and trained draught animals has so far proved impossible to secure. ADMINISTRATION . The administration of the Dhufar Province is in the hands of the Sultan of Muscat himself. He appears to regard Dhufar more as a private estate than as a Province of his Sultanate and maintains a separate treasury. According to an article published some 65 years ago in the Nehla, a superior Arabic magazine of the last century, Saiyid Turki, the present Sultan's grandfather, established his rule there at the invitation of the Saiyids of Salala to forestall the unwelcome interest of the Turks. He entrusted the task of establishing Muscat authority to one Sulaiman bin Suwailim, a former slave, and supplied him with a small body of soldiers to secure the towns from the tribesmen. Sulaiman bin Suwailim built a fort on the site of the present palace which was later seized and looted by the Kathiri, but it was not long before Muscat authori ty was re-established. His father took little interest in the Province but Saiyid Said bin Taimur, the present Sultan, has now been in residence there for over a year, has a trained agricultural adviser and an engineer with him and is making great strides in developing the agricultural resources. His Government is based on overwhelming local superiority of force in the form of some two hundred partially trained soldiers, the offspring of former East African slaves, armed with modern rifles and made mobile with ponies and two light trucks. Neither the tribesmen nor the townsfolk are well armed and the former are too divided to be formidable. The Sultan^ Government is buttressed by the possession of possibly three fifths of the currency in the Province, over the expenditure of which the strictest control is maintained, by a comprehensive intelligence system and by control of much of the imported food. This strength is tempered by political marriages with/7 - uo with the tribes and by wise and sympathetic Govermnent. Such practical measures have assured him of the universal fear and respect of his people and of a state of unusual peace and security That the Sultan does not intend to have his palace looted again is, however, apparent from his heavy expenditure on arms and defensive fortifications around the town of Salala. Saiyid Said bin Taimur derives his income from customs duties, an annual levy on all local produce, payable in kind, together with a tax on gold ornaments. He also claims ownership of all land not proved to be in the possession of another and is letting the land now irrigable from the new Jerzeez water channel at rates of up to 25% of the produce, payable in kind. In addition he enjoys the produce of his gardens, is himself the largest and only progressive agriculturist in the province, imports goods for sale in the State shop and owns and runs the largest dhow plying from Murbat, the port of the Province. He is also the sole source of all local supplies and services required for the construction and maintenance of the air-port. With these funds he maintains order in the Province, has constituted regular courts, established a school and a dispensary and has built roads. He also supplies the initiative, technical skill and capital for large scale irrigation and agricultural improvement. AIRPORT . An airport has recently been developed from a former Royal Air Force emergency landing ground to become one of the links in the Aden - Karachi chain. It was first developed by the British Overseas Airways Corporation who have a station there. The Royal Air Force moved in later and were soon followed by a Air detachment of the United States Army/Corps under the auspices of the Royal Air Force. There is a good airfield suitable for the largest aircraft, ancillary buildings and accommodation for the permanent staff and for 100 men in transit. It is being used operationally by Air Headquarters, Aden, for the protection of convoys, by the Royal Air Force Ferry Command for reinforcements to/to India, by the Air Transport Command of the United States Army Air Forces for the transport of personnel and freight to India as well as by eastbound American reinforcement aircraft. The monsoon clouds make landing difficult from July to September, but aircraft continued to use the field without mishap throughout last summer with no blind landing equipment. Such equipmentjis, however, now being installed and it is hoped that aircraft will have no difficulty in using the field all the year round, SECURITY , The Sultan has himself undertaken responsibility for the safety of Allied personnel from local molestation and has supplied police guards for the purpose. Allied personnel are required to observe strict rules of behaviour designed to prevent incidents with the local people which have, during the last year, been remarkably few. A company of Indian troops has been posted for the protection of the aerodrome against external attack. of sci:^n?ic int2h2st . The area contains much of interest to the scientist. The Anthropology, Natural History, Botany and Music of Dhufar have been noted on in the appendicesto Mr. Bertram Thomas' book 'Arabia Felix'. Mr. Thomas had also written on the Philology of Dhufar but the area still presents, I believe, a virgin field for the palaeontologist, and there are some very fine caves to interest the speleologist. For the archaeologist there are the ruins of impressive stone fortifications and spacious villas at Balid and Robat. Those at Balid are moated and contain an easily distinguished basillica. sfoht . The sea off Dhufar offers unrivalled sea fishing during the v/inter months and excellent duck shooting is to be had on the numerous fresh water creeks along the coast.if THE SULTANATE OF MUSCAT AND OMAN, SOUTH-EAST ARABIA ' THE GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES OF DHUFAR PROVINCE, MUSCAT AND OMAN SIR CYRIL S.

Arabia. {This photograph has been pevmitttd at the Author's special request.)iii \ . FOREWORD At the time of my investigations in the Dhnfar province of the Sultanate of Oman the only detailed observations of the Arabian coast between Muscat and Aden, regarding its geology, were those of a century ago, restricted entirely to coast lands, including of course the strip from Ras Nus, facing Kuria Muria bay from the west, to Ras Dharbat Ali, at the eastern end of Qamar bay, roughly 150 miles. Similarly, the geographical features of the province, up to a distance of 30 miles or so from the coast, inland from Salalah, were fairly fully recorded, with a topo graphical map by a trained surveyor, half a century ago. Slight additions have been made, subsequently, both to the coastal geology and to the geography of Dhufar, about 20 years ago, by a geologist and an explorer separately. No geologist had previously traversed the Jabal Qara and crossed the Qarn Shaiba country beyond it. There was no published information regarding the economic geology of Dhufar. and, as it requires a field season for a good geologist to map 1 ,000 square miles of country, and the area concerned in Dhufar was not less than 4,500 square miles (there were no suitable topographical maps of reasonably accurate mapping), it was, in my opinion, best to have a preliminary or reconnaissance survey to collect data. His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, had desired to have a clear idea of the mineral wealth of Dhufar province as early as possible. It was thus evident that a well-arranged tour would yield information on both the structural and the economic geology of the region in question and allow the data to be the basis of an audit, a mineral audit, of the resources of this part of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, as desired by the Sultan. The accompanying Report, therefore, is to be regarded as a Mineral Audit of the Resources of Dhufar rather than as a Report on the Economic Geology of Dhufar. which is the title actually adopted. The Report has been specially written. I have been impressed by the possibilities of an oil-field in the Jabal Qara, as it would seem from the stratigraphical geology that both' source-rocks' and ' reservoir-rocks' are present, even if hidden, and that the lower Eocene limestones might be a possible second or upper 'reservoir-rock' if these strata are present. The middle Eocene might prove to act as'cover-rocks' for the lower Eocene 'reservoir-rock', but that the main' source-rock' and' reservoir-rock' are much lower in the geological sequence, and might be represented by the argillaceous and marly sandstones exposed in the southern slopes of the Samhan hills facing the Murbat platform. Almost everyone who has visited Dhufar has remarked on the advantages it possesses in climate over any other part of southern Arabia, and those who have crossed into the Jabal Qara have written in glowing terms of forests and herds and grand country. It is the only portion of southern Arabia which enjoys a dry and a wet monsoon, the latter yielding a rainfall of 20 to J inches, at least, on the Jabal Qara, and providing water for several springs whicn discharge on to the Dhufar plains, as well as sending floods down the wadis across the watershed of A1 Qutun into the bare lands of the Qarn Shaiba to the north. There is a landing ground near Salalah, where is the Sultan's Palace, and an anchorage in Risut bay, which was used during the war. 'TTh liinh has been the initiator of the investigations I have made, and incidentally provided me with the most reliable local information on the mineral discoveries and water-supply facts, thus showing a greater interest by a Ruler than I have previously met with. To appreciate the condition of affairs in Dhufar the reader should glance through the pages of Southern Arabia by J. T. and M. V. A. Bent (19 00 ) an( i those of' TK«, Arabia Felix by Bertram Thomas (1932), and then remember that I was accom panied by nearly a dozen Sheiks from different parts of Dhufar, largely from the hills and beyond, and that these men were each trying to do more for me than the other, always anxious to help and so to please the Sultan. It was a very enjoyable tour, and I am very grateful to all the tribesmen who so willingly and cheerfully assisted me. I have mentioned their names in paragraph 33 of the Report, but while all were attentive I should say that I am grateful to Sheik Sail bin Garwah for the extra trouble he took at Hanun, and that I shall always feel grateful to Sheik Hamad bin Salim Almarhoon for many kindnesses, the manner in which he organized the tour and attended to all details, from selecting camping places to collecting samples. There are so many to mention—Secretary Mohammad Amin Salim for assisting in many ways at Salalah; the ^Tovernor of Murbat, Sheik Ali bin Salim, for his nice attention while I was at Murbat; Khan Bahadur Ahmed Sheebaily, the Sultan's JChief Secretary, for accompanying me to the 'oil' locality at Murbat to elucidate the various reports by those who had seen or smelt the oil. I have to record the kind hospitality I received from Mr. W. M, Ivlewellyn and other officers, particularly Mr. M. Clapham, of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, during my stay with them at their hostel at the aerodrome at Salalah and my journeys to and from Salalah in their planes. I am also under an obligation to many friends for special assistance in connection with the Dhufar investigations and the preparation of the Report. Among these are Brigadier G. F. Heaney, C.B.E., Surveyor General of India, for so kindly securing and sending the valuable maps which I had with me. I have to thank Dr. A. K. Dey and Mr. P. N. Mukerjee of the Geological Survey of India for so generously checking and identifying my mineral and fossil collections. I find it difficult to express my appreciation for the analytical work which was done for me, as a specially urgent job, by Messrs. R, V. Briggs &amp; Co., 3 &amp; 4 Garstin Place, Calcutta. I have no words good enough to say how grateful I am to the Baptist Mission Press, 41A Lower Circular Road, Calcutta, for the speed and friendliness with which they have printed this Report and all the care they have given to make it clear-typed and handy. Finally, it is necessary to say that I am deeply grateful for all the consideration shown by Ilio Llighncss. I believe I broke every formality in my contacts with this far-seeing and great-hearted Ruler of Muscat and Oman, but my 'offences* were entirely unconscious and were due, of course, to the Sultan's great interest in all the work I was endeavouring to perform. As a special example of my indebtedness and to show how much I have appreciated all the kindness I have received personally from the Sultan, I have asked that I may be permitted to put a Frontispiece to this Report. This is a photograph of Hie-tiiglmsss x I trust that the Report will be of immediate value and will focus attention on the potentialities of Dhufar, not only as to its mineral resources, but to the other aspects of development which I have touched upon. 5 Loudon Court, Moira Street, Calcutta.

The actual meaning of a term appears to vary in different places or among different tribes, but it will be seen from the text of the Report, e.g. paragraph 36, that the name Ayun (the plural for Ain, a spring) is almost certainly incorrect as used as a place name, and that the correct term should be Gelti (particularly for the water in the wadi at Hanun camp as discussed in paragraph 38). The true springs or Ayun are those of the Garzaz. vSahnut, Rizat, etc. However, a glossary is always useful as the terms are often far more descriptive for local features and the like than any word in English (compare such words as Arq, Huqna, Qauz and Qoz, with regard to 'sand dunes', or Fula, Gelti, Ghadir, Khafs and Shaqa, in connection with water-holes).

VUl1 I. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS Introduction 1. In the middle of December 1946 the following message from the External Affairs Department, Government of India, New Delhi, was conveyed to me by the Home Department, Government of Bengal, Calcutta: 'Sultan of Muscat has asked for Geologist to survey Dhufar Area situated half-way between Muscat and Aden on South Arabian coast from December 1946 to June 1947 (or as soon thereafter as possible) extendable as experience shows necessary. Climate is temperate compared with other areas in Arabia. Geological Survey of India cannot spare Geologist and we are anxious to meet Sultan's request if possible. Grateful to know urgently whether you would be prepared to undertake survey and if so how soon and on what terms.' 2. My reply to the Government of India, dated the 17th December, 1946, stated: '. . . about seven years ago I went very carefully into the subject of the geology of Southern Arabia, parti cularly the areas of (i) the Samhan Hills, (ii) the coal-field 30 miles west-south-west of Ras A1 Hadd and south of Sur, and (iii) the region inland west-north-west of Mokalla. My opinion then was that if all arrangements were properly made such an area as that of Dhufar could be quickly assessed by an experienced geologist perhaps in five days or a week and a definite statement given on the geological structure and the possibilities of coal and oil, and guidance be given for a subsequent systematic geological survey and mineral exploration.' I indicated that I could do the work, as outlined above, between mid-January and mid-February 1947, '. . . otherwise I do not see how the investigation can be made, nor do I think that a systematic geological survey should be taken in hand until this preliminary mineral audit is carried out 3. There was already a considerable literature on travels and explorations in Arabia, and I was aware of the several papers by H. J. Carter, Esq. while Surgeon of the Honourable East India Company's Surveying brig Palinurus, between 1845 and 1857, and, of course, I knew of Dr. G. M. Lees' work as geologist with the D'Arcy Exploration Company Limited, during the winter of 1924-25. I had read the account by Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Bent of their travels in Southern Arabia (1900, see pages 227 to 277) and also those by Mr. Bertram Thomas (in his books. Alarms and Excursions in Arabia, 1931, and Arabia Felix, 1932). From these books and2 ^ y\\t Su\ v-a^ s papers it seemed evident that without securing the actual hospitality of the Sheiks of the area it would be impossible to work, and that this hospitality might not continue beyond a limited period. I had realized that the'Prince' mentioned by Mr. Thomas (Arabia Felix, 3rd sentence, 1st paragraph of 1st chapter) was no other than the present Ruler, Sultan Saiyid Said bin Taimur, and that^l-k^ Ilighuess' full support would be available, but I did not then know that the 'Sultan's writ' really did carry across the Qara Mountains of Dhufar into the Qarn Shaiba. 4. My real reason for advising against an immediate systematic geological survey, while influenced by the possibilities of tribal interference, was that, so far as I knew and could ascertain, there were no topographical maps available on a scale suitable for recording geological observations while mapping in the field. The only maps I have been able to procure have been on a scale of either 1 inch to 31-56 miles (1-014 inches equal to 32 miles) or at best 1 inch to 15-78 miles (1-014 inches to 16 miles). It is impossible to map geological details at all satisfactorily on a map even on the scale of 1 inch to about 4 miles, and a 1-inch-to-the-mile map is generally used. Mrs. and Mr. Bent had a surveyor, supplied by the Government of India, to accompany them merely on their traverses. A geologist must have a map to work with, and so the surveyor must work ahead of him, and the topographical and geological surveys would cover more than six months for an area of over 4,500 square miles. It is about 150 miles from Ras Darbat on the west to Ras Nus on the east along the coast of Dhufar, and over 30 miles in a straight line northwards from Salalah to Hanun, over the watershed of the Qara mountains.

Historical Consideration 8. In an economic report of this kind it would be unusual to discuss questions of ancient history and archaeology, but there are important details, relating to the past trade and industrial activity along the south Arabian coast, which apply to the province of Dhufar of today, and which may be useful in guiding the develop- %ment 6i this region in the future. The thread of the history of Arabia is the frankincense trade, which dates back almost to times immemorial. The use of frankincefise in 1500 B.C. is mentioned in Exodus (Chap. 30, v. 34), and, notwithstanding the Queen of Sheba's gifts, Solomon's imports through Hloth, near Bzion Geber, at the head of the gulf of Akaba, came from Ophir (I Kings, Chap. 9, v. 26, also Chap. 10, vv. 2, 10, 11 and 22). It is believed that Ophir corre sponded with some place on the coast of Malabar, India, and that the coastwise trade followed along the southern coast of Arabia (except during the monsoon period) about 1000 B.C. It seems quite certain, however, that the frankincense was obtained from the countries bordering the Gulf of Aden, largely from definite areas on the Arabian side, by export from certain ports only. This appears to have been established by H. J. Carter (1845-48), who found the limits to be from the Jabal Qamar to the Jabal Samhan, thus corre sponding exactly with the limits of the Dhufar province in the Sultanate of Oman of today. 9. Early in the Christian era, the second century, when Rome held Egypt, historians such as Claudius Ptolemy, Arian or the anonymous writer of the Periplus, and Theophrastus and Pliny, mention such ports along the south Arabian coast where markets existed for trading in frankincense and myrrh and other spices. These included the 'Arabia Felix' of the Romans (identified as the Aden of today),' Arabiae emporium' (recognized as the later Kane or Cana and identified as the site of Hisn Ghorab near Bir Ali, 60 miles south-west of modern Makalla), Manteion Artimidos (of Ptolemy, later occupied as Mansura, and now recognized in the ruins of El Balad near Salalah. The Diana Oraculum near there has been recognized by J. Theodore Bent as ruins of a well in the lower Nihaz below the cavern of Sahaur). The Abyssapolis of Ptolemy has been recognized as identical with Moscha or ancient Murbat in the ruins east of Takah. The name appears to have been coined after the famous precipice a few miles to the north in the Darbat wadi and known now as the Dahaq. Abyssapolis was subsequently Hisn Mirahadh, but it is all in ruins now. It is thought that El Balad to the west was the capital and Moscha to the east was the chief port of the frankincense country. 10. This 'frankincense country' of the Bents evidently agrees in position with the 'libanophorous region' of Ptolemy and the 'thuriferous region' of Pliny, and is the modern province of Dhufar. There is no question that there are ancient ruins at El Balad and other places on th^ coastal plain, Jurbaid, of Dhufar, and that these sites appear to have been used by more than one government— Sabian (sun-worshippers), Persian (fire-worshippers) and Arabian (Islam). In spite of this region being one of the most attractive in climate and fertility along the entire coast of Arabia, and the evidence —of successive periods of trading activity it has for the past few hundred years been a terra incognita to the civilized world. This is clearly due to the character of the tribes who inhabit the plains and the hills (Qara mountains) and the adjacent areas to the east, north and west. It has been the chief complaint of all explorers that, unless the hospitality of the Sheiks is secured, it is impossible to travel inland. In my opinion a great change is in progress, as I shall show later, and I think actual communications will be the main problem and not a very difficult problem. P7 11. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Hills and River System 11. A glance at any of the maps that have been referred to in paragraph 7, more particularly the A.A.F. Flight Chart, Salalah, Arabia to Jiwani, India, No. 108, 1 ; 1,000,000, and those of G.S.G.S., Asia Sheets, 1 : 1,000,000, of 1945, shows a strip of high ground, attaining elevations of upwards of 3,500 feet and in places roughly 4,000 feet, extending westwards from Ras Hasik (on the west side of Kuria Muria bay) for 150 miles beyond the longitude of Ras Dharbat 'Ali (roughly 53 degrees East). In the east this high ground makes the Jabal Samhan, the steep southern scarp of which overlooks the gneissic plain of Murbat from the north. In the middle the upland region is called the Jabal Qara, which rises abruptly from the 10 miles wide coastal plain of Dhufar, but falls away far less rapidly to the north into the Nejd. To the west, the watershed merges into the Jabal Qamar. Except for two re entrant valleys—one at the west of the Jabal Samhan and the other to the east of the Jabal Qamar—most of the rain precipitated on the elevated land mentioned above has a northern run-ofi. The rocks exposed along the watershed are limestones of bedded formations which appear to slope (dip) to the southward along the southern side and to the northward along the northern side of the Qara mountains in Dhufar. 12. According to the maps provided by Bertram Thomas and the Bents, the rivers or wadis flowing to the sea in Dhufar south of the watershed of the Qara mountains or A1 Qutun are, from the east, as follows: the Eulk north-north-west of Murbat; at least three unnamed wadis between Murbat bay and the Khor or lake of Rori near Takah; the Darbat into the Khor or inlet of Rori; next the Tabraq followed by the Hamran, and then the important Rizat wadi which continues south past Mahmulah to Rizat on the coast. West of the Rizat there is some confusion of names and courses (in the maps). Bertram Thomas recognizes three tributaries Sa'a Sakh, Raithot and Thidot—as coming together above a water- hole or pool at Sahalnaut, and some miles below this the stream (presumably as the Sahalnaut) is joined (from the west) by the Arbat. He also shows two tributaries from the north to the wadi Darbat, both joining the main river somewhat north of the lake of Darbat (in the valley above the travertine cliffs or abyss of Dahaq). The next wadi west of the Arbat is the Garzaz, and then, draining* ! m eastwards from west-north-west of Risut, is the wadi system of the Nagar Ghaiz. None of these streams is actually perennial, judged on a visible flow of water, but there seems to be a subterranean flow seawards in some cases. „ , . 13. The only explorer who appears to have travelled m the region north of the watershed, previous to my tour, was Mr. Bertram Thomas. He recognizes the following wadis westwards from about longitude 54° 30' E.: wadi Dhahibun from near Dhikur, with two tributaries—the Ingudan and the Ghazal; next the wadi from Hanun known as the Rakibit; then the wadi through Mughagha water-hole called the Dauka with its two west tributaries—the Istu and the Hauf; then comes the wadi through Ayun named the Ghudun with a tributary from the east—the Haluf, and another lower down from the west—the Ghara. All these wadis are dry in the cold weather and hot months. Although I visited the pool of Ayun and sat in the cave overlooking it below the dry waterfall, I was unable to get the name of the wadi (the Ghudun of Bertram Thomas). Then on my way to Hanun I crossed an important wadi known locally as Heelah (which may be Bertram Thomas Dauka). Again I could get no name for the important wadi in which Hanun (camp) occurs, but it is the Rakibit according to Bertram Thomas' map. I travelled eastwards from Hanun and encountered a large wadi in which is the Thenut spring but in this case not under the dry waterfall where there is a cave. This may be the wadi Ghazal. 14. Eastwards from the Thenut spring wadi there is an important wadi known as the Zaq, the rock-bed of which shows the scour of flood water. There is a pool in the bed which may be called Zaq and the wadi may have another name which I failed to discover. The next camp was at Har'at under the clifE of a wadi below a dry fall, but there was no water. It might be the Ingudan wadi (Bertram Thomas). Eastwards again is an important wadi in which there is a large pool under a dry waterfall and in front of a cave. The place is called Obet, but later was given as Leyath. It belongs to the Dhahibun wadi system. Finally, almost on the watershed, A1 Qutun, at Nissa (Na'Sah) camp the valley opens northwards. The most astonishing feature of these north-flowing wadis is the abundant evidence of flood discharges. Below the pool at Ayun across the wadi the width is 250 feet with flood water signs 4 feet above the bed, and I reckoned a discharge of over 45 million cubic feet in 12 hours only. At Hanun the evidence was similar and a 12-hour flood, on evidence there, indicated upwards of 60 million cubic feet. I have already remarked on the scour evidence of the Zaq, but the wadis of the Thenut and Obet camps also show that very large volumes of water have passed down their beds in flood. land i Junt the i restr very .hiffh'. • t ^in hea to I alio r«gi to ti lev* darj ncmr ,(wat&lt; from there and slope flat ; slope vaUe wate very wate subt into carri tufa the abo\ nort] iinde timethe ged low land the 3 - otF very om , . -r- gha stu •• years oj drc-cght, pometimes there may be no the v 'i n ter rain for two or three years, but the evidence her heavy floods in the courses of the vvadis are too clear r { n to be mistaken.

It is difficult to assess what proportion oi the rainfall iiosrs north, but assuming equality of precipitation on the A1 Qutun ^ e ^atershed) and the presence of deeper valleys into the mountains Lc |-from the south, my observations incline me to the view that, while there is a considerable run-off to the north, the losses by evaporation and actual percolation into the ground are greater on the northern ^slopes. On the other hand, seeing that the limestones are almost ec jflat and full of joints and solution cracks and holes; and that the slopes and hillsides carry grass or light forest, and also that the | valleys are deep and well into the highlands, large quantities of ^ water will sink into strata and re-appear as springs (that is without • very serious losses by evaporation and percolation). The percolating water, by dissolving the limestone and enlarging the cracks and j, subterranean channels, has converted the flat tops of the A1 Qutun , into a typical karstland. The emerging spring and seepage water e carries much carbonate of lime which is precipitated, as calcareous ns tufa or travertine, in almost every southern valley. The Dahaq in [^|the Darbat wadi is in fact a natural dam of tufa, and the valley 0 above it is now also filled up with this material, er r m 17. All the water-holes I saw in the Qarn Shaiba tract to the p S north, except the spring under the cliff at Thenot camp, are pools .jrunder dry waterfalls (and usually associated with caves). In flood time the hollows must be well scoured, and indeed at the dry waterfall er as Springs and Lakes or Khors isand cave at Thenot the hollow is seen but the water has evidently t h e leaked away under the wadi floor. The same is true also of Har'at san camp where there are tumbled masses of limestone below the dry re q waterfall (no cave there). At Obet there is a large pool (as well as 0 f a good cave) and a small spring feeding it, although the waterfall is a pj dry. I have no data as to the degree to which the pools shrink, but as t, at Ayun and Obet there are bulrushes and a little marsh suggesting on i that the pool in each case, while subject to overflooding, does not san greatly contract during the dry period from October to June even when the weather has become very hot. In these cases the pools a c are sheltered by the shade of the cliffs. The water was always cold or and usually without a trace of salt. Ayun and Obet gave a slight f a ll muddy taste, Hanun was definitely salt but still drinkable by a hui thirsty man. Zaq was slightly salt, but the Thenut spring was cold khc and sweet. At Hanun the bedded limestones on the sides of th( anc wadi tasted strongly of salt (along certain layers). tha 18. There are pools (evidently spring-fed) and springs in nearh f or j every large stream flowing seawards to the plains, Jurbaid, ol cit^ Dhufar, but only within or on the very edge of the hills or spurs if ] This was true of the Nagar Ghaiz west-north-west of Risut, but we san had to go nearly 8 miles up to find the pools within the hills. In the of j case of the Garzaz, about 9 miles north by west from Salalah and wa i almost on the edge of the plains, there is a fine spring. There is^l really more than one spring, but they emerge from the limestone at i n *- that point and, at the time of my visit the flow, into an aqueduct sub was somewhat more than 1-25 cusecs. This is regarded as a safe the average until the rains come and the place becomes a lake, due tc sid&lt; flood water, as was the case when the Bents visited the locality at an earlier stage after the rains than my visit. This 1-25 cusecs means tha nearly 30,000 gallons an hour or roughly 800,000 gallons a day lovely cool freshwater. It is enough for 32,000 people at 25 gallons its a head. At present it is led out for irrigation purposes in an open the unlined channel and must be subject to considerable loss, although ma: the leakage probably replenishes the water that is tapped in the the shallow wells between A1 Husti, Salalah and Hafa near the coast, is g 19. In the valley of the Nihaz, just before it enters the plains, The is the locality known as Ghaur Fazal, which was indicated as being (at the site of Dianae Oraculum, but even the Bents were not quite this convinced on this point. However, in 1895 he gave the hole a wit depth of 150 feet and a diameter of 50 feet, while Bertram Thomas the estimated 100 feet for the depth and 20 feet as the diameter. The the cave of Sahaur is up the hillside on the west, a mile away. I did not 3 c see the place, and neither the Bents nor Thomas mention water at led the bottom of the hole. From their evidence I should conclude evi( that it was a natural sink-hole which had been artificially shaped in 1 to the convenience of a well. It might quite easily overflow during mu; 10iHtly the rains and in doing so, the escaping air might emit sounds in the ar same manner as the ' oracle' at Delphi in Greece. Such places require study, not a few minutes' visit, perhaps at the wrong time of the year. However, neither the Garzaz^ior the Nihaz wadis all is appear to point in the direction of El^Bala&amp;, and yet there is an &gt; but astonishing freshwater pool or khor there close to the seashore and 3 t ln § only separated from the sea by a narrow strip of coastal (beach) 3 not sand. x even 20. The ruins of El Baiad were fully described by H. J. Carter, doo I s a century ago, but I do not think the full significance of this khor cold or lake of freshwater, at sea-level and influenced by the rise and light fall of the tide, has yet been thoroughly appreciated. My very W a hurried examination of the ruins led me to believe that the present cold khor was connected with the sea, and was used as a kind of sheltered th* anchorage as well as a moat for the fortified city. This would mean that the water was sea-water. The existence of wells within the ear ^ fortifications suggests that freshwater was secured, even though the I- 01 city was surrounded by a moat and ditches filled with sea-water, purs if this is true then in the years which have elapsed since a spit of we sand shut in the khor or inner part of the moat, the outward seepage i the of freshwater from underground percolation has so diluted the sea- an &lt;i water that no salt taste can now be detected in the water of this ;re is^El Balad lake. If therefore the Ghaur Fazal marks a 'sink-hole' at i n -the limestone, then this El Balad khor marks an emergence of ^luct subterranean water which has come from the hills, Jabal Qara, under saf( the plains, Jurbaid, for 10 or more miles, and come in very con- ie tc siderable quantity, ftpkueeiD by at 21. The next river system to the east of the Nihaz 'wadi is leans ^ that comprising the Arbat and the tributaries—Thidot, Raithot and iy ol which make up the Sahalnaut. The Arbat almost has lions its source in the spring of Khiyunt far into the Qara highlands, and oper the Thidot also begins at a place marked Ain which means and ougl marks a spring. At Fuzah on the western side above the Arbat i tht there is a spring (badly fouled by cattle) near the dwellings, but there st. is good water in the Arbat immediately below at the spring of 'In. iains There is a freshwater pool in the Sahalnaut wadi of the Bents' map Deing (at the outfall of the Thidot according to Bertram Thomas). I visited quite this place and should say it was a good spring in the big wadi, 3le a within the hills, between the Arbat (or Aqbat Sheik) gorge and omas the Rizat (Ar'Zat). There is a considerable loss by leakage, but The the flow in a cemented aqueduct near the pool was not less than d not 3 cusecs (nearly 2J times that of the Garzaz spring). It is also er at led across the plain for irrigation and a very considerable loss is elude evident, because, about 4 miles along from the pool, my measurement taped in the open channel gave little more than ^ a cusec. The leakage urin^ must travel in the general direction of Dahariz, so that, between the 11 H SVvfc* a Vi S Kloss from Arbat and the Sahnut or Sahainaut, there wouW be a pos- sibility of the percolation converging on the khor at 1U Kaian. 22 In the Rizat wadi there is a great spring which keeps a lartre cool fairly full and even overflowing just within the hills, i believe the place is called Mulwah Al'Aud or is just above it and south-west of the hill known as Jabal Nashib. Here the discharge, at the time of my visit, was no less than 18 cusecs or 6 tunes that of Sahnut. It is a true underground river, and the water is ledout or irrigation to ^Mahmulah and beyond in one direction and to Hamr j i in the other I checked the volume m one place near ^Iahmulah, 5 miles from the pool, and found the quantity less than 9 cusecs^ The loss of 50% includes the water tapped off for the cocoanut plantation 2 miles north of ^lahmulah: East of the Rizat wadl there are springs in the next two wadis—the Hamran and beyond the Tabraq—each said to yield one cusec m the hot dry months. All; these waters are fresh and'cool except the Sahnut or Sahainaut which takes the overflow of the pool, and the water was warm in com parison with the others. At Murbat water is obtained from shallow, wells in the wadi close to the town.^but the water is saline and Unat 23 Between Murbat and Rizat lies the wadi Darbat which drains the slopes on the north -western side of the Jabal Samhan as well as the southern slopes of the eastern end of the Jabal Qara. This important wadi discharges into the sea near Takah and has on its way out of the hills, an elevated valley with a lake nearly 2 miles long. The lake appears to lie in a valley which has been filled up largely by deposited calcareous tufa or travertme The natural dam of-this tufa is to be seen in the clifEs over 500 feet known as the Dahaq in the main valley, and the Murgha in the side va ey o the west. These clifEs—the Murgha abyss and the Darbat abjss of Bent— represent the precipitation of upwards of 50 million tons of travertine. At present, at the time of my visit, the discharge o water from the top is probably not more than 2 cusecs and the fa , SSO feet is largely fine spray by the time it touches the southern base of the precipice. There must be considerable percolatiou under the bed of the dry wadi between the Dahaq and the lake or khoi Rori (or Ruri) just before its outlet to the sea at Inqitat (Khatiya of Bent). Unlike the waters of khor El Dalad^^vhich are swee , the waters of khor ^Rori are slightly saline. . ^ . 24. According to the sketch-map accompanying Bent s pape of 1895 the khor El Rori is nearly 3 miles long, although its outlet to the sea west of Khatiya island is newly silted. During the last 50 years much has been altered. The khor is very much sma ei as a sheet of water, and the mouth of the estuary is now completely closed by sand along the beach. This is also the case with U Balad but there the khor water is fresh, although not fed by any visible 12 0 l n&gt; k lcc3&gt;OS-13 0, x £L wadi, but it shows that the underground flow must be strong at the latter place. Indeed the entire area westwards from Balad to - bevond El Hush appears to have seaward percolating freshwater as ' i is evident from the numerous shallow wells used for giymg water to md the groves of cocoanut trees (palms) along the coast at balalah. ihis ie might be a reason wh/B^Baladof old (and Salalah now) was selected of as the capital and Moscha as the ancient anchorage (now dis- fo appeared as such). I believe there are other freshwater khors of ran small size along this Dhufar coast as well as springs up the wadi ^ courses, such as the northern tributaries—Ajarthun and ^azot— &gt;cs' which make the Rizat (Ar'Zat). I was, however, assured that there iut were no springs in the Arbat other than Khiyunt at its head. j ; 25. A word must be said in regard to the landing ground at )n d Salalah, about 3 miles north-north-east from the Sultan s Palace, All and the tube-well installed there. There is no wadi, and the id! tube-well (with inch discharge pipe) is about 60 feet deep and m encounters water at 43 feet from the surface (which ^ approximately ow 43 feet above high sea-level). This water is very slightly but dis/ nd tinctly saline, perhaps due to the well being 17 feet or so below sea- level but I do not think there is any such direct connection with the id sea today. If the boring could have been put down to intercept the iar water known to be seeping to the sea, I am certain that a far better ra quantity and quality of water might have been obtained for the as requirements of the personnel and other purposes at the aerodrome t ' at Salalah. It is to be remembered that the rainfall on the Jabal led Qara watershed, taken as covering 10 miles by 80 miles, is roughly rfl 12 800 million tons or, say, 256,000 million cubic feet. Half of this is discharged northward to be lost in the Nejd, and the remainder tr southwards. Of this remainder, perhaps 25% is lost m evaporation ' and absorption, while another 35% goes underground to re-appear : n ; in springs. Thus 40% probably represents the flood discharge during nl the rains. This is about 51,200 million cubic feet as flowing water a i| down the wadis to the sea; much of it must reach the sea, but rvfj large quantities may be lost by absorption into the ground where ^ e! the wadis cross the plain of the Jurbaid. 101 [ya Climate and Communications 26. On the A1 Qutun or watershed of the Qara region there is )e . usually a cold day wind between November and bebruary, and the hts are colder even in the wadi camps in the Qarn Shaiba, ess sheltered from the wind. Along the coast plain or Jurbaid, th of the Jabal Qara, the climate is very pleasant, warm by day I cool by night in February.

It is very much better so in the hills, but there may be some winfer rain on the Jabal Qara sh( in the cold weather months of December and January. Dhufar is als the only section of southern Arabia to experience a typical south-west en monsoon of the kind normal to India, particularly the Western w£ Ghats and the Deccan plateau. 27. The reason becomes evident from a study of the coasts of ab the Arabian Sea and western Indian Ocean, namely, that Somaliland so shelters the Gulf of Aden on the south and so removes the possible ck conditions for a wet south-west monsoon for the area of the be Hadhramaut even though it has elevations up to 6,000 feet. East- it ward in the Sultanate of Oman there are two areas of highlands— nc the mountains of Dhufar including Jabal Qamar, Jabal Qara and of Jabal Samhan with elevations up to 3,500 to 4,000 feet, and the da mountains of Oman behind Muscat—including the Hastern and ex Western Hajar with Jabal Akhdhar rising to nearly 10,000 feet (in se the peak of Jabal Sham, 9,900 feet). Between the mountains of fa Oman and those of Dhufar there is a wide belt of low desert (the to south-eastward extension of the Ar Rimmal {the Sands), which 3( includes the Rab'al Khali [empty region), of south-east Arabia. th The coastal strip from the hills of Ja'Alan (40 miles south-west of gi Ras A1 Had) for nearly 375 miles (including the island of Masira 2^ and the gulf of Masira and Sauqira and Kuria Muria bays) has no pi highland behind it higher than 750 feet on the average, if that much. Ji Thus a strong moisture-laden wind from the Arabian Sea off the la Somali coast will encounter high lands only in the mountains of p( Oman on the one hand and on those of Dhufar on the other, and oi will yield moisture, as rain, in these two areas and not on the country ai between them. 28. In addition to the south-west monsoon, the mountains of Oman also have rain from a north-east monsoon similar to the eastern highlands of Madras. Part of this north-east monsoon may yield the winter rains of the Jabal Qara and adjacent highlands of Dhufar. It was due to the strong south-west monsoon that the coastwise traffic between India and Arabia was affected in earlier days, and this probably made waiting at some coastal port of southern Arabia necessary for sailing vessels. That such was the case in ancient times is now well known and was made evident in the case of Dhufar15 I 7 2 - or by the ruins of H Mad, etc. There seems to have been an inland )ed trade route also from Dhufar northwards from El Balad (and today as from Salalah) by way of the Garzaz wadi, but I am not aware of at any further particulars. On this Dhufar coast the bay of Murbat lid offers anchorage during the north-east monsoon, and the bay of ;—! Risut is a good anchorage during the south-west monsoon for steamers (as proved during the war). Risut bay would probably make a good landing place for flying boats and was, I understand, so used during the war. Khor El Rori might make an even more sheltered hydroplane base, if properly attended to. Mention has also been made of the landing ground near Salalah, and there is an emergency landing ground just east of ^lurbat (which fortunately was never found necessary). 29. While the Salalah landing ground is to be kept in a service able condition (and it has a long ' Run-way') the commercial traffic so far maintained by British Overseas Airways Corporation has been closed down. This' is perhaps a necessary proceeding if there has been little traffic by air between India and Aden and Abyssinia, but it makes Dhufar more difficult of access as there is, so far as I know, no regular steamer service to this coast. Arab dhows carry most of the little sea-borne trade that there is at present—Salalah imports dates and simple things required by a poor and wild people, and exports cocoanuts, frankincense, etc. The distance to Muscat by sea must be quite 750 miles for a dhow and take at least 3 days with favourable winds and weather (even by steamer). The Sultan, it is to be remembered also, possesses the port of Gwadur, with about 300 square miles around it, on the Mekran (Baluchistan) coast. It is the 'Calais' of the Omani possessions on the Persian side of the gulf of Oman. The flight distance from Gwadur to Muscat is about 250 miles from Gwadur. There is no landing ground at Gwadur, but planes flying into the Persian Gulf or to Aden from Karachi go over Jiwani (Ganz), 32 miles west of Gwadur. It is possible there is a landing ground at Jiwani, but in any case Gwadur East ba&gt; (or perhaps West bay) could be used as a hydroplane base (for Oman) on the one hand and facilities are also possible at Muscat for an air service in Oman aijd southern Arabia on the other.III. DETAILS OF TOUR Arrival and Halt at Salalah 30. Plans having been made for a Mineral Audit of Dhufar with the approval of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by mid- January, 1947, I left Calcutta by the B.O.A.C. flying boat 'Hanwell' (Captain Brand) on the 2nd February, from the Hooghli river at the WiUingdon Bridge, in a non-stop flight to Karachi. The course was over Surguja, Saugor and Udaipur, and then across Palanpur, along the northern margin of the Great Rann of Cutch to the air port at Karachi, where we arrived about 7 p.m. (I.S.T.). Next morning, leaving from the Karachi aerodrome in a Lockheed plane, 'Lake Mward' (Captain S. T. Beal), we flew south of the Baluchistan coast as far as the longitude of Jiwani and then turned south-west for Masira island (where we stopped for a short time after a 3J-hour flight over 674 miles), and then continued to Salalah (2|-hour flight over about 400 miles) and arrived there early in the afternoon. As we left the Indian coast from Cape Monze I studied the strike of the outcrops of rock and thought that the general trend was to the south-west with south-east dips. There is a small island at the tip of the cape. The strike of the beds is by no means steady, but is in curves, convex to the south and east. According to E. W. Vredenburgs map (Plate 12, Records, Geological Survey of India, \ olume XXXVIII, Part 3, 1909,' Report on the Geology of Sarawan, Jhalawan, Mekran and the State of Las Bela') the' strata from Karachi to Cape Monze are middle Miocene, Gaj beds (upper Aquitanian), overlying Nari hipper Nari or lower Gaj) beds of middle to lower Miocene (Aquitanian to Tongrian) which occur in a wide outcrop down the valley of the Hab river, and appear to swing westwards. The beds underlying the upper Nari are the upper Kirthar of upper Eocene age, so that the lowest Miocene and Oligocene are missing. Below these Kirthar limestones there seems to be another hiatus as the next beds below are upper Cretaceous (Campanian to Neocomian) in age. 31. On arrival at Salalah I was met by Mohammad Amin Salim, Assistant Secretary to the Sultan. He informed me that the Sultan, Saiyid Said bin Taimur, was already in Salalah and I gladly arranged to call at the Palace that evening. This I did and v His-Higlmess indicated his desire to have an accurate knowledge of the mineral resources of Dhufar seeing that its climate was so temperate and this fact with good mineral resources might encourage the opening17 up of industrial enterprise in this part of the Sultanate under his rule. It was thus evident that my suggestion to make an ' Audit' of the mineral resources was in complete agreement with what had been in the Sultan's mind when he asked for a geological survey of Dhufar. I was further informed that a number of specimens of minerals and rocks had been collected from various places in Dhufar and that this collection was at my disposal for examination. I took them back with me to the British Overseas Airways Corporation transit hostel where I was staying. On my way, both to and from the Palace, I noted the Miliolitic limestone at Salalah. These Pliocene to Pleistocene strata (of believed Eolian origin like those I had studied in Kathiawar in Okha, and previously very fully described by J. W. Evans in his paper ' Mechanically-formed Limestones from Junagarh (Kathiawar) and other Localities' in the Quarterly Journal, Geological Society, London, Volume 56, pages 559 to 589, 1900 (and first noted by H. J. Carter nearly a century ago in his paper' On Foraminifera in a fossilized state in Arabia, Sindh, Kutch and Kahttyawar' in 1849) are of considerable interest. The beds, in strata 12 to 18 inches thick, are from 12 to 20 feet thick and dip gently, 5 degrees or, say, 1 in 12, seawards (south). They are used as building stone and furnish excellent material (freestone) for this purpose. It is the stone found in all the ancient ruins, Ealad, etc. in the Jurbaid or plain of Dhufar along the coast. x 32. I spent the next morning, the 4th February, studying the various specimens of rocks and minerals which the Sultan had taken the trouble to have collected. These were, without exception, from the Murbat area and from the metamorphic and gneissic rocks of the flat country along the southern side and at the foot of the Jabal Samhan scarp. They are as follows:— _ (i) Weathered biotite (black mica) in pieces 2 inches across. (ii) Hornblende (amphibolite) schist. (iii) Garnetiferous granulite with small pink garnets and quartz. |(iv) Quartz with hornblende and biotite (but largely quartz). (v) Quartz granulite evidently from banded gneisses. (vi) Amphibolite schist resembling (ii) above. (vii) Chloritic schist with mica ? (viii) Argillaceous sandstone of sedimentary origin. (ix) Shale with carbonaceous laminae adhering; and (x) Lead ore, largely galena with some carbonate attached. Specimens (i) to (vii) clearly belong to the gneisses and schists, items (viii) and (ix) to much newer strata underlying the limestone along the southern side of the Samhan range. Sample (x) of about 10 pounds indicates a mineral lode in some limestone rock, but the exact locality of this or the other specimens was not recorded inI i 18 ■ writing on the labels. I had been prepared for specimen (ix) from the record of carbonaceous shales in the Samhan Hills in Hie 528, Reg. No. 1818/5-12-'07 of the Geological Survey of India, which I had noted several years ago (but it is not stated who brought the sample). In the afternoon I visited Risut bay with Messrs. M. Clapham and W. M. Llewellyn of the B.O.A.C. and in the evening I had another interview with the Sultan in order to discuss the tour I was to begin next morning into and across the watershed, A1 Qutun, up] of Jabal Qara. 33. I left the aerodrome hostel by car with Mohammad Amm Salim about 8-30 a.m. (5th February) to go the 8 or 9 miles across the plain northward to the Garzaz spring. Here I found half a dozen camels and about 18 men ready, with stores and equipment, to go into the hills. I made an examination of the spring (measuring the discharge at between 1-25 and 1-33 cusecs but noting that in the rains the place must become a small lake and a considerable flow must go down the wadi into the Jurbaid). By the time these observations had been made the camels had been properly loaded, and I was introduced to those Sheiks cm 111 iVuyiHr, into whose care I was being committed. They were as follows:— (i) Sheik Hamad bin Salim Almarhoon of Salalah (chief); fii) ,, Ali Bla'at bin Kathir; (iii) ,, Ganazil bin Musan; (iv) ,, Mesalim bin Said bin Qatan; (v) ,, Hamad bin Makthaith bin Tabook; (vi) ,, Hamad bin Zaidan bin Yaboob; (vii) ,, Hamad bin Said bin Mahavi Mahri; (viii) ,, Hamad bin Ali bin Azad bin Kashoob; (ix) vSaiyid or Said bin Masood Ali Badia; and | S K H (x) I Said bin Abdullah; also (xi) Sheik Sclil bin Garwah, the man who went off from Hanun to bring samples from Haluf Dhar, though the name given subsequently was ' Ath ' Air ? Between Obet and Na'Sat we were joined by three new men who replaced others, there relieved of their responsibility. Mr. Mohammad Amin Salim then left with me the Sultan s private servant Ra and two other negro servants (all excellent men) and took his departure to return to Salalah with Ibrahim bin Mohammad, headman of the Sultan's retinue, and we turned north on our first march across the hills really up the Garzaz wadi. 34. Around the Garzaz spring there is a great deal of tufa (travertine) and the rocks are bedded limestones lying almost flat, and slightly inclined to the south. After a short climb round a spur we returned to the wadi and continued along it for perhaps 5 miles, to Ak Rant, where we stopped for the Arabs and others to haveom their midday meal. Early in the afternoon we continued up the 28, wadi for perhaps a mile or two and then climbed up the northern h I slope for perhaps a thousand feet to a small spur, from which a the peep is obtained of Salalah in a south-easterly direction, barely M. 12 miles away, in a straight line. On the hillsides around occur g I horizontal beds of limestone. We continued north into flatter, ir I rolling country with fewer trees and shrubs, and finally into open un, upland as we went higher. We passed a small encampment (thatched stonewall shelters near some caves) and, perhaps an hour or so later, nin approached Kazmeem, where we were to camp for the night. It was :oss already dusk, but I noticed a change in the rocks at this highest point, [f a chalk}'-looking limestones for the first time. We camped just over a int, small saddle to be out of the cold wind, but it changed in the night ing and next morning, as we prepared to go on, the wind was from the the north, cold and annoying. low 35. On the previous day's traverse, except for the tufa at and lese around the entrance to the gorge of the Garzaz spring, the rocks all led, the way up to the high open upland were bedded limestones, often re I nodular, and frequently but not very conspicuously showing solution phenomena. When nearing the highest point at Kazmeem there is a beginning of curious white powdery or chalky limestones. I thought at the time they might be chalk, but similar material has proved to be pure dolomite. From Kazmeem our path or track lay north west and downhill, with trees still showing in sheltered places, but after about 5 miles the country ahead changed in appearance, and showed brown and reddish brown to khaki coloured strata. These rocks correspond to a bare countryside of rolling hills, which are composed of limestones and calcareous beds, dipping northwards and north-westwards in a great curve. They thus give the impression of overlying the whiter looking limestone in the higher ground to nun sou ^ (towards Kazmeem). When I got to these younger-looking, ame brownish coloured strata, I found they were limestones (probably impure) with associated clayey beds. The appearance of fragments who of chert and flint, also of fibrous and granular gypsum and of calcite v makes these formations appear entirely different from those facing the plains of Dhufar. It is to be noted that the exposures now seen an's (6th February) beyond Kazmeem are in the northern, arid drainage aen) area. As we continue north-west, descending slowly, there is more bin and more evidence of chert and flint and gypsum as debris on the orth surface and in the dry wadi bed. The strata appear to dip more steeply than the ground surface, but it is difficult to say if higher tufa beds are really being met as the dips are not regular and the beds nost roll about structurally. •und 36. It had been planned that we should go to Hilah (Heelah) ps 5 but Sheik | Salim (Almarhoon) had persisted in going first to Ayun lave and so we continued north-west and came to the gorge in which is 11 V 1920 the pool of Ayun. On the way and while among these brownish weI coloured limestones and shales I found the casts of several large ex ^ gasteropods, but they are poor specimens with little or no ornamenta- re p tion and useless for identification. The climb down into the Ayun ]^ e: gorge is quite 300 feet, if not more, and the beds appear to be wholly of j n \ limestone. The dips are southward. The pool is quite 200 feet 0 f ■ long and 100 feet across and deep, although the water is clear green s t 0 rather than blue. The drop along the wadi bed to the pool must ^iir be 150 to 200 feet (as a cascade when flowing). There was no flow car at the time of my visit, but there was evidence of flood water quite ^ 4 feet deep in the flat bottom valley below the pool. I reckoned, s to for a width of 250 feet and a depth of 4 feet and a speed of IJ feet jja per second, that a flood lasting only 12 hours would discharge at a rate of 1,500 cusecs. This means a total flood of about 64,800,000 the cubic feet in 12 hours less or more according to the velocity of the i e fi flood current. The cave on the east of the pool is large and not due ms to solution by the water, nor is it artificial, but probably due to Hs scour when the level of the wadi floor was much higher. I could be not get accurately the name of the wadi in which the Ayun pool th( occurs. This wadi flows northwards and might be the Ghudan of f ro Bertram Thomas' map. mi 37. From Ayun we retraced our steps for some miles and then camped for the night in a small sheltered valley. The place is 3 known as Ha'Khi. It is among the brownish beds (limestones with a s&lt; chert and gypsum) among which fragments of the rock show foramini- C u fera resembling nummulites. Again we had arrived at dusk. Early n e the next morning (7th February) we marched off (apparently to gp please me) in a hurry, then retraced our steps for a mile or so and struck east for about two miles before turning north and crossing a he line of hills to emerge on a wide and desolate plain, quite flat and th nearly 3 miles across (said to be Haklee). Then, after another b\ 2 miles, we descended quite 200 feet over flat-lying bedded lime- to stones into a wide wadi called Hilah (Heelah). The plain (Haklee) pi was lightly strewn with small fragments of chert and chalcedony. uj On the clrff side into the Hilah I saw casts of large lamellibranches pc but with only traces of ornamentation (also some large gasteropods), oc and unlikely to afford any specific identification. The beds are, I d€ think, upper Eocene (Kirthar), but their age will be dealt with fo later. There was also a certain amount of gypsum seen as veins of dc satin-spar and as granular gypsum in the cliff exposures. There is no It trace of tufa either at Ayun or in Hilah wadi. From the Hilah we m crossed another low line of hills and struck north-eastwards for Hanun across country differing completely from any encountered is so far. fr 38. It is an extensive, bare and flat plain with rocjc showing (t or just under the surface. At half-mile or greater distances there tlish were isolated conical hills of about the same height but of small rge ex tent, resembling earth-pillars somewhat and suggesting that each Lta - represented the remnant of a single formation, as so many outliers, mn Next the plain itself was bare but cut by flat-bottomed ravines, f in the sides of which almost horizontal beds were exposed. In most ee t of these exposures, usually 2 or 3 feet under the top layer of lime- een stone, there was an absolutely white bed resembling chalk, some- ust times' 3 feet thick and often of much greater thickness. And so we low cam e to a specially wide and deep ravine or wadi, in the sides of lite w hich there were successive beds of white, powdery or chalky lime- Lecl . stone. We descended into this wadi to camp at the water-hole of :eet Hanun, a pool in a deep channel of the limestone floor of this wadi. ■t a it W as'already dusk and cold with a wind up the dry wadi from 000 the north. Next morning (8th February) Sheik Sail bin Garwah the left for Haloof Dhar (Ath'Air?) to bring me specimens, while I due ma( ie an examination of the sides of the wadi in which lies the to Hanun water. It is definitely salt but not nauseatingly so, and would uld be appreciated by very thirsty people. The water is esteemed by )ool the people, but I could not show the same appreciation and drank 1 of f r om what' I had brought from Ayun (although that has a slightly muddy taste). , hen 39. The signs of flood water at Hanun indicated a stream over i is 3 feet deep and perhaps 400 feet across. This section with an nth assumed velocity of IJ feet per second gives a discharge of 1,800 ini- cusecs which if maintained for 12 hours represents a volume of irly nearly'72,500,000, cubic feet or 450,000,000 gallons, or somewhat to greater than that of Ayun. In the morning light the sides of the and wadi are a snowy white with the chalky strata well exposed. The g a height of the plain above the wadi is perhaps 120 feet, and near and the top the' chalk' bed (it is a pure dolomite actually) is characterized :her by containing irregular concretions of flints, separate but parallel me- to the bedding. Irregularly shaped flints also occur in the bedding lee) plane. In both cases the flints vary from 5 inches to large masses &gt;ny. up to 12 or 15 inches in length, and are closely associated with the :hes porous-looking granular-textured 'chalk' (dolomite) in which they ds), occur as segregations. They have all the appearance of secondary e, I development and, indeed, the dolomite itself seems to have been yith formed in situ from an original (fossil) limestone, after the marine s of deposit was exposed to weathering by percolating meteoric waters. 3 no It appeared to me that in this Qarn bhaiba region, the processes we might still be in progress under the surface. . x , . , for 40. The limestones below the 'chalk (dolomite) bed, which tred is 6 to 7 feet thick, are harder but with friable-looking surfaces from which casts of fossils, large gasteropods and echinoids, project nng (these are not easy to extract without damage). Associated with lere these fossils are numerous nummulites. In a lower bed of similar 21 \22 h limestone, also with many nummulites, I secured fragments which nex have a distinct salty taste. Below this again, well down the section stoi of these horizontal beds of limestone there is a particularly friable clin bed, even powdery, with loose small nummulites fallen out, strongly to : impregnated with salt. It is difficult to say if the salt is residual in froi the marine deposit, but so it appeared to me. It is the gradual Hil removal of the salt that seems to give the rock its granular structure sto: and powdery nature (by loss of cohesion). The salt in the water of difi the Hanun pool belpw is thus clearly accounted for. bee 41. The surface of the open, stony plain at Hanun is probably or ! no more than 2,000 feet above sea-level and therefore 1,200 feet or so below the watershed near Kazmeem. The top bed of the wadi is A1 a khaki-coloured limestone, 3 feet thick perhaps, but hard and so dip overhangs the friable chalk bed (the 'chalk' with flints included), am It also contains some veins of gypsum (and I found loose fragments It of vein salt). On the surface of the plain there is scattered a sli^ considerable quantity of flint and chert fragments, as well as an( blackened fragments of sandstone and limestone, together with th( pieces of fibrous gypsum, loose crystals of worn calcite and round- is 5 sectioned, geode-like crystalline quartz. The commonest material th( is flint and chert with now and then a little chalcedonic silica. This th&lt; debris continues on the plain for miles, and appears more conspicuous wi near the outliers of conical hills (some are flat-topped), which are so ba much a feature of the scenery. And so we travelled eastwards to ca Thenut, a wadi similar to that of Hanun, but there is here only a sc( great hollow below the dry waterfall and just below the cave. All the tri water has gone down into the limestone and left great blocks of stone Ai in the hollow where the pool should be. However, at the base of th the west (left) cliff, near a little show of green vegetation and a little ph downstream, there is a small spring hidden in the wadi side. This T1 water was not only cold but quite the freshest I had tasted since wl leaving the Garzaz spring. The beds are flat-lying bedded limestones w( (as at Hanun). 42. While examining the cave and beds at Thenut, the men uj (with Sheik Sail bin Garwah) from Haloof Dhar came bringing cli specimens of fibrous gypsum, fibrous rock salt, fine white 'chalk', bi and what looks like pure kaolin. We then continued east-south-east W( across similar country and crossed another wadi, the Zaq, with a gi scoured limestone floor (as evidence of strong flood action). It was ai dry, of course, but a little downstream below a dry waterfall there is to a pool of slightly salt water (which my party like). It is about n( 2i miles on to the next big wadi, Ha'rat. There is no pool under in the dry fall, and no cave, as all has collapsed and large blocks of N limestone cover the bed, and it is possible water could be found by A digging 50 feet down. There is no water there and Ha'rat is dry, w but cold at night, in early February. We continued south-eastward a]23 ich next morning (9th February) and in doing so gradually crossed the ion stony plains (with outliers of conical and flat-topped hillocks) and ble climbed slowly to a higher level (above the tops of the hillocks) on gly to younger strata of the same limestone series. After about 5 miles I in from Ha'rat we began to approach the northern edge of the Qara ual Hills (Qutun) and continued to rise slowly by steps and across bare ure stony plains and also across occasional wadis. These are always : of difficult, due to the steps made by the successive flat-lying limestone beds as well as to little pillars of limestone (which stand up 18 inches bly or so as a result of solution or erosion). £ or 43- We turned east, fairly close to the main northern slopes ot i is A1 Qutun, at a place known as Kach'um. Here the low northward so dips which have been present all the way from Hanun become flat id), and show a southward inclination along an east-west axis at Kach um. nts It is therefore a low arch or anticlinal trending east-west, with a I a slight overall inclination of the arched strata to the west. After as another 5 miles or so we came to a large wadi, up which we found ith the big pool of Obet (Lay'Ath). It is surrounded by tall reeds and [id- is at the base of a dry waterfall. There is a cave immediately above rial the pool on its south-west side, and a spring just beyond and below his the cave. The water is not cold and has a slight muddy taste but is 3us without a trace of salt. It was warm at noon and all the men had a so bath in the pool. We drew water from the spring. Here again the to cave is eroded out of a bed of limestone, evidently a part of the a scouring by the stream when in flood. We appeared to be among the tributaries of the Dhahibun wadi (see Bertram Thomas book )ne Arabia Felix, 1932, page 140, but his names do not agree with of those given to me by the same kind of people as those depicted m his tie photographs, notwithstanding that they are Sheiks and Saiyids). his There is a climb of about 500 feet out of Obet (Lay'Ath ?) southwards ice which leads on to open upland like that south of Kazmeem, and so les we arrived on the northern margin of A1 Qutun (or Jabal Qara). 44. The slope of this upland is to the north, so we continued len upwards in travelling southward. I should mention that, on the in a climb out of Obet, I found casts of large gasteropods and lameUi- k' branches similar to those on the descent to Heelah, and I feel sure ast we have the same strata in each of the cliffs referred to (see para- i a graph 37). In another 2\ miles over open upland with some grass as and a few shrubs now visible, we arrived at Niccha or Isissa (Na bat) . i s to camp at dusk. This is a shallow valley which drains into the jut northern system of wadis of the Qarn Shaiba which carry flood water ier into the Nejd. Next morning (10th February) we left Nissa or of Na'Sat and crossed a grass and scrub covered upland on to the real bv A1 Qutun or watershed of Jabal Qara. It is again typical karstland rv with limestone showing like the teeth of a miniature tank barrier ird all along the gently sloping surface, which now takes the run-otisouthwards as well as underground. We were now travelling west and south-west and had gone for perhaps four hours (nearly 9 or 10 miles), still largely on uplands of grass and shrubs before we reached' wooded valleys opening southward, and had a glimpse of Risut bay far away to the south-west. The vegetation on the slopes was never thick enough to hide the outcrops of the bedded limestones. These strata are seen to be undulating in gentle arches (anticlinals) and troughs (synclinals) as the curves of the outcrops are easy to trace. 45. And so about midday we arrived under some fig trees near a water-hole or spring well up the hillside at Otak (Othk). The water is dirty, due to cattle standing and drinking in the pool. 1 understood that there was water in the valley below, but I was unable to get the real name of the valley or the exact position of the reported pool or spring in it. From Otak we crossed the valley in a southerly direction and again emerged on open upland with grass and shrubs almost dangerous to walk on because of the irregular solution pillars of limestone, 12 to 18 inches high and spaced barely 2 feet apart in any direction. They are not at first visible because the dry grass is also about 18 inches high. Practically all the run-off rain must be trapped, or at least hindered, on such karstland and much of it must ultimately take an underground course through the worn cracks and joint planes in the underlying limestone. After perhaps 4 miles (from Otak) we began a long gradual descent south- south-east. In this descent of perhaps 1,200 feet I collected a few typical samples of the limestones. Some were fine textured and crystalline, others almost of the texture of lithographic limestone, and others with veins of silica (some quartz) and appearing siliceous. The analyses show nearly all the specimens to be very high grade (pure) limestones, with little magnesia or silica. 46. About 4 p.m. 'we had descended to the foot of the hills, then deflected eastwards and entered the valley of the Rizat a mile or so^ below the big spring. I believe the actual place is called Mulwa Al'Aud (but this may be a mile lower down the valley where I finally camped). The Rizat (or Ar'Zat) spring feeds a large pool and I was not able to see from where the underground water enters. There is an abundance of tufa around the pool and downstream along the Rizat wadi, and the water is conducted in a channel along the eastern side of the wide stream course. My measurement of the flow near the pool, in the aqueduct or prepared channel, gave about 18 cusecs (roughly 64,000 cubic feet or 400,000 gallons an hour). It is a river almost capable of providing 40,000 people with 25 gallons a head a day. At present this water is carried out to the plains for irrigation purposes and no use made of the fall from the spring to Maiinmlah which must be over a 100 feet and should yield about 120 kilowatts of electrical energy a^Mahmulah-fi.e. before the water is seriously used for irrigation). The above estimate is an all-the- 24 i f* ft m Co ft ft25 •-round figure. [During the rains the Rizat will carry floods of t magnitude ari3~ the wadi will have a stream for some weeks - the_end of September, but that is all excess and could be cBKervedJ 0 ve 47. Next morning (11th February) I went south to Mahmulah e J to meet the Sultan at his 'shooting camp'. On the way I noticed ln( ] that the aqueduct had been tapped to irrigate a small grove of cocoanut palms, which it did generously. I took measurements near &lt; ■ ee ' Mfthniulali and found the channel carrying less than 9 cusecs (or ^ half the amount that it takes off near the pool). Much of this loss )0 } is due to tapping for the cocoanut grove above Mahmulah, but an vas appreciable amount is certainly due to leakage. I gave His-j Highness a brief report of my tour and explained that I could not r i r go into details until my specimens were analyzed and properly • ass examined or identified. He was very interested and showed me Q a , some more samples that had been collected while I had been on tour. e u These I examined with the Sultan after breakfast, and then I drove us j to Murbat to continue my investigations there, particularly with . 0 fl regard to a reported occurrence of oil in some brownish argillaceous m A sandstone on the shore of the bay north of Murbat. The Assistant t i Private Secretary, Mohammad Amin Salim, came with me, but after r tei seeing me properly housed in the Sultan's guest house he returned t -L to Salalah, whither the Sultan had returned. I was not able to follow the geology while driven by car; I shall return to this matter , when discussing our return journey from Murbat on the 13th February. The Sultan's chief officer at Murbat is Sheik Ali bin Salim. He was soon with me and explained that the Galena (lead ore) locality was Garat Athetate, but it was more than a day's journey away and the man who knew the locality was ill of pneumonia. ii 48. We visited the 'oil' seepage, but the tide was wrongly _ S ? timed and the place was awash. However, I examined the rocks iJ and we calculated the best time for our further visit. This would be about 9 a.m. and we decided to come on the 13th. Meanwhile e I examined the low hills immediately north of Murbat and was very surprised to find metamorphic rocks—impure marbles, serpentinous material, amphibolite and some gneissose granite—very mixed up, ^ but having a general north-east to south-west strike and north- [f 6 westerly dips. Both the strike and dip varies in short distances. ^ South-east of these low hills (Jabal Ali ?), there is a wadi from which ! the people of Murbat get water in shallow wells less than 12 feet ir '' deep, but the places are dirty and the water is saline. Between this ? 1S wadi and the town, south and eastwards, there are exposures, f perhaps 8 to 10 feet thick, of Miliolitic limestones. These rocks are ° quarried for building purposes. The main part of the rocky plain D t east of Murbat, on which is the Emergency Landing Ground, consists of banded gneisses trending almost north and south and practicallyvertical or with high westerly foliation dips. There appear to be m alternations of mica schist and quartz granulite as well as 'sills' of uj pink to red medium grained granite. It is a worn-down gneissic plain, of but quite distinct from the metamorphic rock in the Jabal Ali hills Js immediately north of Murbat. •. st: 49. The view northwards from the Sultan's guest house at Murbat, over the Jabal Ali in the near distance, has the southern dc scarp of the Jabal Samhan as the most conspicuous feature. It is S£ quite clear that the bedded limestones which make up perhaps the sh upper 1,200 to 1,500 feet of the 3,600-foot scarps lie unconformably di on the reddish coloured strata below. The limestone bands have a or distinct tilt to the west, while the reddish coloured strata appear to cc be horizontal and the upper layers are gradually cut away westwards. of These reddish coloured beds are probably 600 feet thick and include T] sandstones and flaggy beds, and are underlaid by khaki to greenish m coloured shales and earthy, warve-like sandstones which together si* are quite 1,000 feet. I went about 4 miles along the road back to 7( Takah and at the first marked rise in the road encountered the bi greenish-buff shales (which resemble those of the Talchirs in being U splintery, but are not 'needle shales' which are the type rocks of the w Talchirs). Overlying these shales are massive slab-like limestones. al The strata appear to dip westwards but there is a definite south in component in this inclination, at least in the limestone as it runs in down to the first headland of Murbat bay (coming away from tv Murbat). Next I turned north to climb the face of the Jabal Samhan tt from a point bearing 130 degrees to Murbat and 145 degrees to the se cape south-west of Murbat. The view south-east looks across the al bay, and the compass bearings are practically true as there is very at little magnetic variation along this part of the coast of Arabia. lo 50. I climbed to the shoulder which forms the head of a large valley opening south-east and about 1,000 feet high, all the K way up on limestones which slope south-west. In the scarp facing oi the valley mentioned, the khaki-coloured shales are seen high up and in continuing round into the scarp of the main Jabal Samhan. This lii established the fact that both the limestones and the lower, dis- p; cordant, argillaceous strata occur in an anticlinal at the valley and 5 that this arched fold has a general tilt westwards. The samples are cc of the overlying limestone of the lithographic type but I could not oi find any fossils. H. J. Carter noted such 'lithographic limestones' se here a century ago, but he has also, in his revised paper of 1856 ai (published in 'Geological Papers on Western India' in 1857), recorded w several fossils, foraminifera, gasteropods, etc., from the limestones d( of the Murbat scarp, which make the basal limestones of Cretaceous tt (Senonian to Cenomanian) age and the approximate equivalent of tt the Pab sandstones and associated strata just south of Gadoni, th 28 miles north-west of Karachi. The impression I had gained from sc 26 3B/7 t my tour was that the limestones of the Jabal Qara were of middle to upper Eocene (not lower than Lutetian) or equivalent to the Kirthar of Sind. There would thus be a hiatus between the limestones on Jabal Samhan and those of Jabal Qara, which requires attention stratigraphically as well as structurally in the geology of Dhufar. 51. I concentrated my attention on the lower strata and came down the valley to the south-east from under the main scarp of the Samhan hills north-west of Murbat. The khaki-coloured splintery shales are underlaid by earthy sandstones and these beds appear to dip westwards and to belong to the same series as the sandstones on the shore of Murbat bay where the 'oil' was found. If this is correct then an anticlinal feature is present because the sandstones of Murbat bay definitely dip south-west into the sea at 5 to 10 degrees. There may be a strong fault between the sandstones and the meta- morphics of Jabal Ali near Murbat, since at the 'oil' exposure (north side of Jabal Ali) the sandstones trend north-north-east and dip at 70 degrees westward near their contact with the metamorphic rocks, but in a few yards the strike becomes north-north-west with only 15-degree westerly dips, and at the 'oil' locality, a few yards further west, the strike is north-west to south-east and the dips south-west at from 10 to 5 degrees. I found no fossils in any of the beds exposed in the Jabal Samhan scarp facing Murbat (the western part of this important scarp). Nor could I recognize more than the following two sets of strata—an upper series of limestones perhaps 1,500 feet thick with lithographic Hmestone in the basal section, and a lower series of brown to greenish coloured strata with an argillaceous facies above and earthy sandstones below (with some reddish gritty beds at the junction between the two series, but probably belonging to the lower and not extending to the westward limit of the scarp face). 52. On the morning of the 13th February, accompanied by Khan Bahadur Ahmed^Sheeb-Aii, I went to see the ' oil' occurrence on the shore of Murbat bay north of the Jabal Ali. The beds involved are argillaceous sandstones, brown in colour and with a little mica present, in beds 12 to 18 inches thick with thin shaly partings between the successive beds. The tide was out (and rises 5 to 6 feet when high). As may be imagined with such rocks, covered at full and exposed at low tide, the possibility of a slight oil seepage remaining at one spot for years is unlikely unless the seepage is strong. Those with me insisted that oil had been noted and found (by soaking up in a cloth and squeezing into a bottle) which smelt strongly of 'kerosene'. I was unable to detect any definite smell of petroleum, and from the position of the rocks and their structural and stratigraphical consideration I was inclined to the view that a tin or barrel of oil had come ashore and leaked on these rocks and left traces of oil which observant fisherfolk would soon notice. However, the case is' non-proven' and will be discussedG on a later page when dealing with the larger problem of oil in Dhufar. Before leaving Murbat I had made further efforts in regard to certain samples of carbonaceous shale which had been received in the Geological Survey of India 40 years ago, but no specimen was produced although the Sultan had shown me a few fragments at Salalah. The locality has probably been forgotten, but I feel certain that such material will be found below the limestones perhaps near the eastern end of the Jabal Samhan. 53. I left Murbat on the afternoon of the 13th February accompanied by Mr. Pradhan Singh, the State Civil Engineer, and Messrs. M. Clapham and W. M. Llewellyn of British Overseas Airways Corporation. I now had an opportunity to watch the rock exposures, and it was soon evident that the limestones of the Jabal Samhan were inclined gently westward and also dipped in a southerly direction (as would be the case in a tilted anticlinal). We went up the Darbat wadi to the Dahaq or wall of tufa. It is quite 500 feet high, and there is a similar though smaller' abyss' to the west where the Darbat had probably overflowed when dammed by the main deposit. We next climbed the western side and visited the 'lake', a long narrow sheet of water probably a mile and a half long and 300 to 400 feet across, and curving into the valley. On the way back we could see the Khor Rori sheet of water shining in the sun. It is not now as large as 2 miles long, but it is a good sized lake and could perhaps be improved, but the water is saline. Next I noticed the Miliolite at Takah resting on the older limestones, and so we continued to Hamran and Mahmuloh and then towards Dahariz and X H1—Balad- ^p^ooand Hafa and thus to Salalah and the aerodrome. There are exposures of Miliolite limestone almost all along the coast, but outcrops of the limestones of the Jabal Samhan are not conspicuous, and indeed after Takah it would be difficult to distinguish those of the Jabal Qara from those of the Jabal Samhan without close mapping and the evidence of fossils. y ^ 1 - 54. On the 14th February Mr. Pradhan Singh and I visited Risut and he pointed out the position of the salt pans between Augad or Okad and Risut on the edge of the bay. Next we went up the valley west-north-west from Risut. It discharges into the marsh at the west of the bay. We struck the Nagar Ghaiz wadi about 5 miles from Risut at a place where there is a 30-foot cliff of con glomerate of recent origin (showing that the streams are in a reju venated condition now). After going 4 miles up the wadi we enter narrow valleys and here is the first water. Just round the bend there are hard greenish trap-like sandstones and phyllites (slatey shales) trending north-north-west with a very high dip (75 degrees) to the west. Veins of fibrous gypsum 6 inches wide occur along the bedding of the phyllites, and a fault striking east wards with an almost vertical shear is seen at the same exposure. 2829 The shear zone is 18 inches across and is full of flaky carbonaceous shale, which suggests crushed coal seams or the residue of bituminous material (oil). The men with me stated that the Alum shale (which I had really come in search of) was only a little further on through the Ansarit gap, but they had been saying this for the past 3 or 4 miles and it was quite impossible to get an accurate idea and I decided to wait till some of them returned with more material. They were away perhaps an hour and came back with samples which were not all astringent in taste, and it was clear that the bed was less than a foot thick and definitely not coal. Analyses of this Ansarit carbonaceous material and of the fault shale show they are high in volatile matter and may be related to coal or lignite more closely than to oil. On the way back I was struck by the general resemblance of the country to that of the Hanun-Thenut-Ha'rat region, and I think they have the same strata. The limestones on this side frequently show low seaward dips (as between Murbat and Takah, near the Rizat spring, near the outfall of the Arbat, and other places). This had been noted by H. J. Carter also. 55. On the 15th February I ^e-visited the Garzaz spring with Mr. Pradhan Singh, and then after collecting data on the capacity of the aerodrome camp tube-well we went on to the pool in the Sahnut (Sahalnaut) wadi. The measurement at the Garzaz confirmed my previous figure of 1*25 cusecs, while the Sahnut channel was found to be carrying about 3 cusecs, and could probably secure more if precautions were taken against leakage from the pool. However, there is a great loss from the channel, since at a distance of 4 miles out from the pool the volume of water was barely \ a cusec. On the way back we had time to examine the lake atgMLeeli Bl-Bakd, and I was certainly surprised to find the water fresh, and to see it at about the same level as the sea (across a strip of sand), and to hear that its level rises and falls with the tide though not as much. The Sultan, whom I saw that evening, told me that many of the wells (used for irrigating the cocoanut groves along the coast) are also influenced by the tide and yet hold fresh water. These wells are from 12 to 18 feet deep and the water level in them should be slightly above sea-level. Next day, the 16th February, I examined more specimens that had been brought in and I packed up all those I decided to have further examined or analyzed, then in the evening I went to the Palace to explain matters to rlis Highness as I was to leave by the plane next morning. The Sultan understoo^everything and was most considerate. 56. I left Salalah on the 17th February by the British Overseas Airways Corporation's Speedboat (Dakota plane. Captain A. bpooner) at about 8 a.m. for Masira island and Karachi. This company is closing down its traffic along the south Arabian coast and with drawing from Ryan (near Makalla), Salalah and Masira, and this was30 I B the last but one journey (taking away gear and staff). The course was in a north-easterly direction so that we flew a little north of Darbat lake and the Jabal Samhan over the barren country near the headwaters of the Andhaur wadi system (where the hills are fiat- topped and strata evidently almost horizontal). At Masira island I procured a few pieces of the dark limestone (Eocene) and basic igneous rock (Semail Igneous series of upper Jurassic, Portlandian, to lower Cretaceous, Neocomian, age). From Masira we flew to near Ras Jiwani (near Gwadur West bay) where middle Tertiary (Miocene: middle, Tortonian to Helvetian) strata, the Fars series, occur and continue eastwards into Gwadur. We turned east, out to sea south of Gwadur, for Karachi, and I was able to check my previous observations (paragraph 30). Next day, the 18th February, I continued my journey, from Karachi to New Delhi, by a B.O.A.C. connection, on an Indian National Airways York plane. The course lay north-east so as to cross the Indus a little north of Hyderabad (Sind) and I was able to see the monoclinal folds, facing east, as we crossed the area of Bhula Khan (Thana), east of the Kirthar range, over lower Kocene (Laki) ana some upper Eocene (Kirthar) formations. My general impression from these observations and those along the Arabian coast and my knowledge of the geology of the coast of western India, south of the Great Rann of Cutch and Kathiawar and Guzerat, is that, structurally, the ranges of Sind and Baluchistan belong to the Persian and Oman system.31 IV. GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS Structurai, Geology 57. In his valuable paper, 'The Geology and Tectonics of Oman and Parts of South-Eastern Arabia', Dr. G. M. Lees has briefly discussed the controversial aspects of the views of Krenkel and Kober, and he considers that their '. . . explanations contain an element of truth, and that the true solution is more complex than either'. Broadly speaking and geologically, Oman, in my opinion, belongs, structurally, to Asia, while south-western Arabia is similarly a part of Africa (the separation from Somaliland, by the foundering of the land and the formation of the Gulf of Aden, is of comparatively recent date (Pliocene, perhaps), whereas the uplift of the Zagros and Oman mountains is slightly older (upper Miocene ?)). It would appear to me, also, that the faulting which is almost certainly present along the southern coast of Arabia continues into the Great Rami of Cutch and so has sliced or cut off any southward con tinuation of orographic axial lines southwards from the ranges of Sind (if these ever existed). However, these points are mentioned in passing as they cannot be properly established without detailed geological mapping (surveys) and this has still to be done. Dr. Lees map shows how disconnected have been the investigations in south eastern Arabia, and once greater fossil evidence is available for establishing a reliable basis for correlation his list of geological formations will reduce to half the number, as there are two or three formations of similar age. 58. In this connection the paper by Dr. L. Picard is also of considerable interest (see 1937, 'On the Structure of the Arabian Peninsula'). He speaks of the Oman mountains, including the Western Hajar, as follows: 'This mountain arc is a foreign element on Arabian soil. . . The Oman range . . . betrays a pushing move ment towards Arabia and belongs to the Iranian ISorth Syrian Alpine structure of folding ... one can assume from the descriptions of Lees... that here also, i.e. in the West of Oman, there exists a foreland of folds which pushes towards the depression of Rub-al-Khali. On the other hand these normal foldings follow the bend of the Oman nappes. South of Muscat near Sur one meets with a district of 'regular folds' (Lees) which abut on to the Indian Ocean . . .' ' The latest voyages of discovery of Thomas and Philby further show that the subsoil of the actual Rub-al-Khali is composed of Tertiary sediments quite analogous to those of the32 Mesopotamian depression . . . (Eocene, Fars series . . . salt occur rences). The 'empty quarter' is . . . the continuation of the Meso potamian geosynclinal trough which here suggests a folded structure in the subsoil concealed by the mighty dunes; this conception there fore accords well with the folded structure of Qatar and the Bahrein islands... It may be assumed that these Rub-al-Khali folds diminish . . . towards the South Arabian border land of Hadramaut. 59. In the case of Dhufar, whether it belongs to Picard's 'arabo-somali table' or is part of the 'foreland' south-west of the Oman arc of folded strata, it is only possible at present to say that ancient (pre-Cambrian and Archaean) rocks show up around the coast between Ras Nus and Murbat as a worn-down plain which appears to tilt towards the scarp of the Jabal Samhan. In the, strip between the Archaean plain of Murbat and the edge of the Samhan plateau sedimentary rocks, evidently unaltered by meta- morphism, are present. Their age is not known, but they are suspected to be upper Palaeozoic (Carboniferous to Permian) to perhaps Mesozoic (Trias to Jurassic) and possibly the equivalents of Lees' Hatat Phyllites. They are overlaid by brownish limestones with middle Cretaceous marine fossils, but this is at the western edge of the sedimentary strip. In the scarp itself the equivalents of the Hatat Phyllites (Lees' Murbat Sandstone) are overlaid, with a slight discordance of bedding, by unfossiliferous limestones which are, on the evidence of the Cretaceous fossils already mentioned, believed to represent upper Cretaceous to Eocene marine deposits. I was not able to discover any zones of shearing north of Murbat, but the Murbat sandstones dip very steeply away from the pre- Cambrian rocks of Jabal Ali (north of Murbat) and at the eastern end of the bay immediately 'north of the Jabal Ali. 60. Elsewhere in Dhufar, except up the wadi Nagar Ghaiz, 9 miles west-north-west of Risut, Eocene limestones are present, with a covering of Pleistocene to Pliocene Miliolite limestone along the coastal belt of the Jurbaid or Dhufar plain. These Eocene limestones appear to have a gentle overall inclination to the south west and also to be arched in the Qara mountains (Jabal Qara). Facing the plains and at either end, Takah and Risut, there is a seaward dip, well seen at several places between Murbat and Takah, and again at the debouches of the wadi Rizat and of the Arbat, etc. Within the Jabal Qara the dips suggest very gentle folding parallel with the watershed, but these details are visible in several places and have not been properly sifted. On the northern side of the watershed, A1 Qutun, in the area of Qarn Shaiba the limestones appear to dip gently northwards. There is thus evidence of a large, flat and extensive arch (anticlinal) along the trend of the Qara mountains, roughly east-north-east to north-east. This is in general agreement with Picard's ' arabo-somali' zone, and thus the questionri of an oil-field must naturally arise, seeing that the Eocene strata of Bahrein which are more or less on the same structural lines have become an important source of oil. However, this question will be dealt with in Section V, Economic Minerals. Stratigraphical Factors 61. In the list of formations on the geological map accompanying Dr. Lees' paper on 'The Geology and Tectonics of Oman and of Parts of South-Eastern Arabia' no less than 15 items are given, ranging in age from the Murbat Crystallines of Archaean age to recent deposits such as raised beaches. In the Dhufar area, however, he recognizes only five formations: (1) the basal crystalline rock of Murbat; (2) the Murbat sandstones next above; (3) a middle to upper Cretaceous limestone which is shown right across the Jabal Samhan, the Jabal Qara and the Jabal Qamer; (4) Eocene limestones which are shown as flanking the Cenomanian to Senonian limestones above mentioned, but undifferentiated themselves; and (5) recent formations largely in the coastal plain of Dhufar. 62. The stratigraphy of the Oman mountains region shows the following formations according to Dr. I^ees:— Taking the strata from the top (newest formation). 12. Alluvium including the Miliolitic limestone. Miocene (coal-bearing beds) of Sur syncline. Eocene limestones from Dhufar to the gulf of Masira and along the coast between Muscat and Ras al Hadd. Upper Cretaceous (Maestrichtian) beds of J abal Abyadh. Lower Cretaceous to Upper Jurassic (? Neocomian) Hawasina series around Jabal Akhdar. Lower Cretaceous to Upper Jurassic, Semail Igneous series of the Western Hajar and Masira island, w. Upper Jurassic (Portlandian) Musandam limestones. 5. Upper Triassic (Noric) Elphinstone beds. 4. Permian (?) below Jabal Akhdar. ^ Permian to Lower Carboniferous (Uralian ? Saxonian) of Saih Hatat and including the Hatat Phyllites. Cambrian of Qishm and other islands in the Persian Gulf. Pre-Cambrian or crystalline rocks showing as an mher near Kalhat. 63. To the south-west of Dhufar in the Sultanate of Makalla, Mr. O. H. Little recognized the following stratigraphical units. Recent and Pleistocene including wind-borne sand, alluvial deposits and raised beaches ; 11. 10. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1.34 n ■ Pliocene conglomerates which overlie Oligocene, Eocene, Cretaceous and Jurassic beds unconformably and may in some cases include Miocene strata and also perhaps sub- recent deposits; Miocene and Oligocene of Meifa, Neifa, Gizwal, Kanina, etc. ; Eocene (Lutetian) or middle Eocene limestone which caps the more conspicuous cliffs in the hinterland of Makalla and generally overlies Cretaceous beds; Cretaceous sandstone series (? Neocomian) of Asfal erAin, Kasai and 'Amuf el Dik, which include the lignite occurrences of Makalla and resemble the so-called' Nubian sandstones'; Jurassic (Corallian?) of Neifa, Hisn Baqirdan, Wadi Arus, etc. and includes the carbonaceous limestones and the oil shale horizon of Makalla; and Crystalline (Metamorphic) rocks of Wadi el'Arit consist of an igneous complex and exposed as a peneplain, and evidently include granite (near el Reish) at the base of Hisn Baqirdan and felsite porphyry at el Humar. Ras Makalla consists of dolerite and basalt into which veins of fine granite have been intruded. The exposures between Huta and Fakhida consist of mica-schist, talc- schist and chlorite-schist. These contain a little hema tite, pyrite and malachite in association with veins of pegmatite and calcite. • 64. In view of the rock formations of the Oman mountains about Muscat and the Hadhramaut in Makalla, it is of some impor tance to notice carefully what representatives of these occur in the intermediate area of Dhufar. The basal crystalline rocks occur in the peneplain of Murbat and these are the oldest rocks known in south-eastern Arabia. The next oldest rocks are believed to be brownish sandstones and greenish to buff-coloured shales which Dr. Lees has termed the Murbat sandstones and hinted at as Mesozoic in age (Trias to Cretaceous), and therefore the probable equivalents of the Hawasina series or the middle-upper (Corallian) beds of Hisn Baqirdan (Makalla). The nearest equivalent of the upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian) from near Murbat and the Samhan hills are the Maestrichtian beds at Jabal Abyadh on the one hand (Muscat region) and Little's lignite-bearing sandstones (lower Cretaceous: ? Portlandian) on the other (Makalla side). Neither can be correlated with the Dhufar upper Cretaceous. No lower Eocene (Laki: Ypresian to Landenian? or Ranikot: Landenian to Montian ?) have been found either in the Muscat (Oman) area (except perhaps some massive limestone overlying the upper Cretaceous near Kalhat) or in Makalla (Hadhramaut) region, so far as I know. The35 Eocene fossils collected by Bertram Thomas from the southern side of the Rub'al Khali were identified (by L. R. Cox) as 'all from a white limestone of Middle Eocene age'. As already shown (para graph 63) the Eocene is represented in Makalla by middle Eocene limestones. The Eocene of Masira island and again at Sireir (on the mainland opposite the island of Hamar an Nafur) on the gulf of Masira, on the fossil evidence, is middle Eocene. And Lees states (page 610 of his paper) : 'At Dhofar the Cretaceous limestone is over laid by Eocene limestone with small Nummulites and Alveolina. At Thaqa and Ras Risut chalky limestones crop out, containing abundant large Orbitoides, sensu lato. They have not yet been examined to determine whether they are Lepidocyclina or Ortho- phragmina.' &gt; 65. There has been some confusion about the Cretaceous (Cenomanian) limestone and the Eocene limestone. There is no village called Dhufar or Dhofar, so that the extract quoted in the previous paragraph is incomplete. And another extract *. The presence of Cenomanian in Dhofar was proved by Carter, whose fossil collection included Pecten {Vola) quadricostata, Salenia scutigCTd, Oyhitoliuu concuvu, and other typical Cenomanian species. The limestones rest directly, with a slight angular disconformity, on the Murbat Sandstone. The fossils occur in some marly deposits at the base of the 1400-foot limestone group which forms the summit of Jabal Samhan. The upper beds are of Eocene age, so probably the various stages of upper Cretaceous are also represented, but are unfossiliferous.' Dr. Lees does not claim to have found any fossils himself, and I did not find any fossils at all m the overlying limestones, particularly at their base. In his section (Fig.'5, page 622) Dr. Lees . . shows the ancient crystalline rocks overlaid by the desert sandstone formation and the Cenomanian- Eocene limestone series forming the scarp of Jabal Samhan . Isone r of the fossils described in Dr. Lees' paper came from Dhufar province, and I am therefore assuming that he has depended on the collection made by H. J. Carter. I have therefore re-examined Carter s con tributions (particularly his revised paper of 1856, published m the ^Geological Papers on Western India', 1857, pages 585 to 597, and including the section and the sketch from Marbat). o £ 66. Mr. H. J. Carter reckoned the scarp section at J,4UU teet (plus another 400 feet to the limestone of the summit northward on the Samhan hill plateau). He recognized White limestone strata.. •• •• ^' qaa ^ eet Argillaceous strata of a red colour •300 ,, Coarse micaceous sandstone, of a yellow brow msh colour, finer higher up •• •• 1,700 ,, Beginning from the bottom, the sandstones become finer as we36 ascend and finely laminated, also more yellow above and chocolate brown at the top. This sandstone passes into an argillaceous division of various colours, chiefly red, one stratum of a soapy nature was excavated and used as edible clay by women. The red strata pass into white and grey, compact limestone of a lithographic type, and above this comes a whitish, chalky deposit, more or less argillaceous (from which the Bedouins cut their stone pipes). Then comes again a white compact limestone. No further details of the section are given until the soil on the summit of the table-land is stated to be of a brick-red colour. Then the following list of fossils is given as coming from the summit of the formation inland down wards to an unknown extent:— Alveolina sphaeroidea, H.J.C.; Alveolina Melo, D'Orbig.; Operculina, D'Orbig. species, white limestone; Cyclolina arabica, H.J.C., from the white limestone strata of the summit; Corbis? species, resembling Corbis pectunculus, Lamarck; Inoceramus ? species ; Nerita, species ?; Cari- naria ? species ? ; Trochus, species ? ; and Buccinum, spe cies ? Mr. Carter says (page 589), 'From the coloured argil laceous strata I obtained nothing but a rock specimen of limestone of a lead-blue colour, almost entirely composed of a small piece of Orbitolina, D'Orbigny, . . . but I did not preserve it, not knowing at the time from what part of the series it came.' He added, 'Nor did I see any thing in the micaceous sandstorie worth noting . . 67. On page 590, Mr. Carter continued as follows: 'Having, then, seen the igneous tract at Marbat, and traced the strata of the table-land to its summit, let us return ... to the granite plain . . .' He then describes the Miliolite formation and (page 591) proceeds along the coast to the base of the great slope of the table-land. Here 4 miles west of Murbat he examined a sea-cliff and found the section (from the top):— Calcareous sandy deposits, like the miliolite mentioned, in which are embedded rounded pebbles of the older lime stone 5 feet. Compact, coarse, shelly, impure limestone, of a light whitish colour. Dark brown limestone, of the kind stated to exist behind the granite hills at Marbat. Compact white limestone, breaking with conchoidal fracture and even surface. And then after tracing this cliff section for 12 miles to near Takah, Carter gives the following section (page 595):— Great scarp of White limestone strata above, containing the coast. Cyclolina at the summit, which, accord-Low cliff be tween Marbat and Takah. ing to A. d'Orbigny, is confined to the Cretaceous Series coloured argillaceous strata. Micaceous sandstone, of great thickness. Miliolite. White shelly limestone, charged with Foraminifera, belonging to the Num- mulitic Series. 68. Mr. Carter's description continues from Takah and across the Dhufar plain, with the ruins of El Balad, to Risut or Ras Resut as he calls it (page 596) and on the next page he states,'. . . Here then, we have compact white limestone raised up to form the ridge of the promontory, while the Nummulitic Series is thinned out to the dark brown limestone only, which remains in a horizontal line at its base. Nothing, therefore, now can be more plain than that this white compact limestone, which we have seen all along underlying the dark brown limestone, is a part of the cretaceous series, or that of the great white limestone series of the table-land . . .' From what has been quoted it is clear that the only fossils that can be used for the corre lation with the Cretaceous are those I have given .in paragraph 66 and not as indicated in paragraph 65, unless there is some other paper by Mr. Carter which refers to a subsequent visit. So, as matters stand, the whole of the 1,400 feet of limestones seen in the upper part of the scarp of Jabal Samhan, facing the Murbat pene plain, belongs to one series. This series is determined by the fossils found in the upper part of the limestones (summit of scarp). If these are Cretaceous (Cenomanian) forms, the Samhan hills are capped by strata of that age. If on the other hand the fossil evidence is Eocene, then there are no Cretaceous rocks in Dhufar, as there is no other fossil evidence from this province other than what I have given. 69. As already stated I found no fossils in the lower part of the limestone scarp of Jabal Samhan, facing Murbat. The few fossils I brought back from the Qarn Shaiba, to the north of the Jabal Qara, from about Hanun and somewhat higher beds (which I was inclined to correlate with those west-north-west of Risut on a petrological similarity only), have been examined by Mr. P. N. Mukerjee, M.Sc., Geological Survey of India, and he has kindly identified them as follows:— (1) Miliolite limestone from near Salalah contains Miliola and numerous fragments of Pecten, Conus, etc., also Macrocallista c.f. agrestis (Cotter) and Cardium sub- fragile (Bottger), both characteristic of the uppermost Eocene (Yaw stage) of Burma; 3738 (2) and (3) Echinoids from about half-way down the sides of Hanun wadi, and recognized as belonging to the genus Echinolampas, similar to specimens from the Kirthar of Kathiawar, Cutch and Sind—middle to upper Lutetian (middle Eocene) ; (4) Ostrea, closely related to 0. turkestanensis of h. R. Cox, middle Eocene of Persia and Arabia, collected at the same horizon and place as (2) and (3) above ; (5), (6) and (7) contain Scutellaria c.f. nummularia recorded by Cossman and Pissaro from the Lutetian (middle-lower Eocene) of the Paris Basin. These specimens come from the Hanun wadi and about the same horizon as (2) to (4) above ; (8) and (9) contain specimens of Lucina, Diplodonta and Natica. The Lucina is closely related to, if not identical with, L. yawensis of Cotter from the uppermost Eocene (Yaw stage) of Burma. Both lots of specimens come from a similar horizon and well above that of the Hanun wadi ((2) to (7) ). Some of the specimens are from the limestones between Kazmeem, but nearer Ayun, and the others are from the cliffs above Obet (Lay ath) on the way up to Nissa (Na Sat), roughly on the same horizon in both cases. 70. It may appear from the previous paragraphs of this section that I have laboured the subject of correlation, but this has been necessary from the economic point of view (of the prospects for oil and coal) since the stratigraphical data are so uncertain. However, from the information in my possession the following succession of the rocks of the Dhufar province in the Sultanate of Oman may be tentatively recognized:— 12. Recent alluvium, Sand dunes and Tufa deposits. 11. River terraces and conglomerates of W. Ghaiz. 10. Miliolitic limestone of Dhufar coast (Murbat to Risut). 9. Qara (A1 Qutun) limestones (between Na Sat and Obet). 8. Qam Shaiba limestones (Hanun, Thenut, Ha'rat). 7. Risut limestones (up the wadi Nagar Ghaiz). 6. Samhan hills limestone (with that east of Takah). 5. Argillaceous beds (300 feet) Jabal Samhan scarp. 4. Micaceous sandstones (1,700 feet). 3. Murbat bay sandstones north of Murbat. 2. Jabal Ali metamorphic rocks (Murbat). 1. Crystalline gneisses of Murbat peneplain. These successive formations are dealt with in the following paragraphs from the oldest (1) to the youngest (12).A Archaean of Murbat 71. There are two different groups of Archaean or pre-Cambrian rocks at Murbat. The older, in my opinion, are: (1) the crystalline gneisses seen on the peneplain of Murbat and well exposed along the south coast and near the emergency landing ground. These rocks trend almost north-south with high westerly foliation dips, and comprise gneisses and schists of a banded series. The chief bands are micaceous schists with quartz granulite bands, but there are pink to red pegmatitic granites associated, probably as intru- sives (and so perhaps somewhat younger), but no basic igneous rocks were noted in this area. The next series are (2) seen immediately north of Murbat in the low hills, Jabal Ali, between the town and the base of the Jabal Samhan scarp at the eastern end of Murbat bay. These are definitely a metamorphic complex and include dolomitic marbles, amphibolite and serpentine, tremolite of a fibrous type, talc or soapstone, and appear to include sills of granite (pegmatite). These rocks have a strike trending in a general north east to south-west direction with north-westerly dips (of the foliation planes, but these are irregular and often twisted). The nearest equivalent to these rocks appears to be in the Kuria Muria islands north-east to east-north-east from Ras Nus (the far side of the pene plain from Murbat) and within 70 miles of it. The distances to the various islands from the ruins at Hasik (10 miles north of Ras Nus), east-north-eastwards, are 20 miles to Hasikiya, 36 miles to Suda, 44 miles to Hallaniya, 52 miles to Gharzaut (Rodondo rock, 6 miles north of Hallaniya) and 64 miles to Jibliyah. Samhan Hiij. Series 72. Under this title are included (3) the Murbat bay sand stones on the shore of Murbat bay and immediately alongside the Jabal Ali (2) rocks; (4) the Micaceous sandstones of the southern base of the Jabal Samhan scarp; (5) the 300 feet of Argillaceous beds in the Samhan Hills scarp facing Murbat; and (6) the 1,400 feet of limestones which cap the Jabal Samhan and which have been believed to comprise strata which range in age from Lampanian (upper Cretaceous) to lower or middle Eocene (Lutetian) and were correlated with the limestone of the cliffs overlooking the sea along the coast from 4 miles north-west of Murbat to just east of Takah (Taqa or Taga on some maps). Returning to the basal (?) beds of this series—(3) in which the 'oil' occurrence is reported (see para graphs 51 and 52)—I am unable to say if these rocks are the base of the Micaceous sandstones (4) or as old as the' trap-like rocks and phyllites found up the Nagar Ghaiz wadi (see paragraph 54), but they are in close association with (2) and appear faulted against40 these metamorphic rocks. There is thus a possibility that the rocks with gypsum veins and bituminous matter in the wadi Ghaiz may be the equivalent of these (3) beds, and that both may be the same as the Micaceous sandstones (4) of the Jabal Samhan scarp base. It is possible also that these beds (3), as above considered, might be the equivalent of lyittle's Hisn Baqirdan (Corallian) in Makalla (and grouped with (4) ). With regard to (5), which appear to be quite conformably laid on (4), there-is the possibility that these strata are the equivalents of Little's Asfal el'Ain (Neocomian) of Makalla and/or Lees' Cenomanian marls at Sireir (opposite Hamar an Nafur island) on the mainland of the gulf of Masira. 73. The most complex question has been the geological age of (6) the Samhan Hills limestone (see paragraphs 65, 66, 67, 68 and 69). I found no fossils in the basal beds of these limestones, but I noted that they sloped south-westward to be in situ along the sea- cliff mentioned by H. J. Carter (near the island rock of Guena). If the fossils collected by Mr. Carter on the summit of Jabal Samhan are considered as Cretaceous, there is nothing more to say than that they are the only limestones of this kind in southern or south-eastern Arabia. They do not correspond with the Cretaceous (sandstones) of Makalla, nor are they the petrological equivalents of those beds referred to by Dr. Lees at Sireir (on the gulf of Masira). Lees shows the Samhan Hills limestone to be as old as Cenomanian (page 606 of his paper) and the Sireir beds to be Campanian (though he puts both under the same colour on his geological map). The matter is of considerable interest, and until a detailed investigation is carried out I propose to regard the Jabal Samhan limestones as lower Lutetian and possibly of Laki, but probably of lower Kirthar age, with the equivalent of the Ranikot (Landenian to Montian) missing. Qara Mountain Limestones 74. So far as the rocks from Takah to Risut are concerned there is great uncertainty since the plains of Dhufar are, along the coast, covered by the Miliolitic limestone and around the edge of the plains, along the foothills, the strata appear to be considerably higher in the sequence than the basal limestone of the Jabal Samhan (6). We have no fossils from Risut and the limestones there (7) are, for the present, correlated with (8) the Qarn Shaiba limestones, which from good fossil evidence are fixed as middle Eocene or Kirthar (middle Lutetian). It is in these strata that chalkv limestone' is noticeable almost everywhere, and, in the Hanun wadi the beds are, in certain layers, saline and the 'dead' white beds, near the top of the section, are pure dolomite. The next vounger subdivision of these extensive limestones of Dhufar are those of the cliffs above Obet and the wadi at Heelah. The fossils from the outcrops atboth places are similar and have been identified as upper Eocene (probably Bartonian) forms. These limestones may not be the highest beds on the Qutun or watershed of the Jabal Qara, but are referred to as the Qara (A1 Qutun) limestones (9), because I think they will be found in all the upper valleys if not forming the actual open upland, karstland, of the Jabal Qara. Included among the fossils of these beds are certain forms indicating the uppermost Eocene (Yaw stage) of Burma (see paragraph 69). Miuoutic Coastal Limestones 75. These porous, shelly limestones are seen all along the coast from Murbat to near Risut, usually within a distance of about 2 to 2J miles from the beach. They are very similar to the Porbandar limestone of Kathiawar and other coastal Miliolitic limestones at the head of the Arabian Sea from Sind to Dhufar. The occurrences near Okad (Augad), Salalah, Hafa and so on eastwards to Takah and to Murbat are in bedded deposits 8 to 20 feet thick with the separate layers each from 12 to 18 inches thick. The dips at Salalah are south at about 5 degrees, and the rock is sufficiently consolidated (cemented with carbonate of lime) to be hard enough for a somewhat friable freestone for building purposes. It is difficult to decide the age of the beds and their origin, but studies elsewhere (Kathiawar) by J. W. Evans (1900) resulted in most of these Miliolitic limestones being regarded as' wind-borne' (aeolian), littoral deposits of relatively recent age. The material is chiefly the cases of small foraminifera and fragments of shells and corals. In the case of the Miliolite limestone from near Salalah (see paragraph 69) many of the fossils appear to be uppermost Eocene forms (Yaw stage), but as the aggre gate is almost entirely detrital material it must be assumed that the foraminifera and other fossil fragments represent material derived from the rocks exposed within the drainage of the Dhufar coast. As the oldest fossil remains are not older than uppermost Eocene it may be concluded that such rocks exist or existed in this area and suffered or are suffering erosion. In my opinion the Miliolite is probably not newer than Pleistocene and might be as old as Pliocene and the uppermost Eocene has been removed and some what older rocks, upper to middle Eocene, are now present in the existing drainage area of the Dhufar plains. W. Ghaiz Conglomerate and Dahaq Tufa 76. The conglomerate terrace now subject to erosion by the Nagar Ghaiz wadi is upwards of 30 feet thick and is regarded as not younger than Pleistocene. The pebbles and boulders are largely of limestone, with some sandstones, and cemented with tufaceous (calcareous) precipitates. The evidence of this erosion suggests 41 jV: : that there has been an uplift of the Arabian coast near Risut (and presumably westwards into the Jabal Qamar of the Hadhramaut). The wadi down the scarp of the Jabal Samhan into Murbat bay also shows evidence of erosion, but it is not as marked as that in the Ghaiz wadi. All the wadis draining north from A1 Qutun into the Qarn Shaiba and towards the Nejd show strong signs of erosion, so that the general evidence is towards uplift throughout Dhufar. There are terraces of tufa-conglomerate at the debouche of many of the wadis emptying into the Dhufar plain. Among the most conspicuous of such deposits of calcareous tufa or travertine is that in Darbat wadi, at the ' abyss' of the Bents (Bertram Thomas' precipice), known as the Dahaq. It has been deposited from water which has cascaded over an obstacle and become aerated and precipitated calcium carbonate. In this way a lake was impounded and the overflow continued to build up the dam (as is the case at Band-i-Amir in the Hindukush in Afghanistan today). After a time the lake spilled through the lateral valley to the west until another natural dam was built up there, and then both dams were built up and the lake bed itself also largely filled up with tufa. The lake of Darbat is a remnant of what it was, and the Dahaq must be between 500 and 600 feet high where seen as a wall (up valley as you come from Takah). Weathering and Erosion Effects 77. Except for the evidence of the springs—Garzaz, Sahnut, Rizat, etc. —and the curious hole (Dianae Oraculum?) in the wadi Nihaz, there are no great underground caves in the limestones of Jabal Qara, other than that of Sahaur above the Ghaur Fazl (Dianae Oraculum). Caves occur all around in these hills, but they are erosion rather than solution effects on certain beds of limestone (as is well seen at almost every water-hole (pool) in the Qarn Shaiba country). And yet on the upland of A1 Qutun (between Na Sat and the descent to the Rizat spring via Othik, for example) the ' trip pillars' of limestone show that solution is operating effectively. In the upper valley of the Darbat among the western slopes of Jabal Samhan there is said to be a great 'sink-hole', and it is shown on some Air Flight maps. However, more active in this respect is the weathering in progress in Dhufar. In the region to the north chemical action appears to work hand in hand with hot sun and occasional heavy rain, and it was my impression that the' chalky' dolomite beds of the Qarn Shaiba area were chemically produced in non-dolomitic limestones in situ. I had the impression also that some of the flint and chert had been segregated in those limestones after the beds had been laid down as sediments in a tropical sea, and that this silica- freeing action was of comparatively recent date. This may explainthe relative abundance of flint and chert fragments on the arid plains in the Qarn Shaiba and their comparative rarity in the Dhufar plains. The same remark, chemical reactions in the zone of weathering, applies to the formation of quartz-chalcedony geodes, the presence of nests of calcite and the development of veins of fibrous gypsum in the limestones of the arid region to the north and their almost entire absence in the southern tract—of the Qara mountains and the Dhufar plains. 43 .I V. ECONOMIC MINERALS 78. In dealing with the mineral resources of Dhufar it is necessary to remember that practically the entire province is on Eocene {Lower Tertiary) limestones and that very small areas include older rocks—Sandstones and Shales—which may contain coal or petroleum, and that such ancient rocks as met amorphic and Archaean formations, which usually contain metalliferous deposits, occupy only 60 to 100 square miles in Dhufar (Murbat peneplain). Furthermore, from the specimens which were collected to show me it is seen that material came largely from the Archaean rocks of the Murbat area, and a little from the Ghaiz wadi inlier of phyllites (of supposed Mesozoic age). However, there have been no industries in Dhufar nor any evidence of a mineral industry in this province at any time in its long history, except the quarrying of 'freestone' for building purposes, the manufacture of stone pipes (for smoking tobacco), the production of earthenware (pottery) and the occasional use of edible clay. The practice of eating clay is far wider than is normally appreciated even by geologists and medical men, indeed, it is correct to say that 9 out of 10, so-called 'salt licks' frequented by animals, are clay-licks. The list of minerals to be considered is as follows:— (1) Alum shale; (2) Aluminium ore or Bauxite; (3) Building stone; (4) Coal and Lignite; (5) Copper ore; (6) Dolo mite ; (7) Edible clay; (8) Flint and chert; (9) Gypsum and Anhydrite; (10) Hematite (Iron ore); (11) Lead ore (Galena); (12) Limestone; (13) Oil (Petroleum); (14) Pottery clays; (15) Road 'metal'; (16) Salt; (17) Serpentine; (18) Talc (Soapstone); (19) Tremo- lite; and (20) Water-supplies. Alum Shale 79. A sample of carbonaceous material from the Ansarit side of the gap at the head of the Nagar Ghaiz wadi, 9 to 12 miles, west- north-west of Risut, with a strong astringent taste (of Alum) was analyzed and showed only 2-84% of water-soluble components, but these included 1-21% calcium sulphate, 0-90% magnesium sulphate, 0-02% ferrous sulphate, 0-13% aluminium sulphate, 0-28% sodium sulphate and 0-30% sodium chloride. The carbonaceous matter in the specimens represent 14-66% of the whole and yield 9-06% volatile matter (including a small proportion of moisture) and 5-60% 44 *fixed carbon (in total percentages). It is thus a carbonaceous or coal shale (or possibly an oil shale). Aluminium Ore or Bauxite Although no bauxite has been located in Dhufar, it is to be noted that Mr. Little has recorded a bauxitic shale (with 46 alumina in the Cretaceous (Neocomian) beds of Arnut el Uik (Sultanate of Makalla), and that another sample of a white powdery sample gave as much as 67% of alumina. No statement is given ot the percentage of silica in this material (an important factor in aluminium ores) but the alumina is sufficiently high for the material to become of economic interest. It is possible that at some future date when the Argillaceous series in the Samhan hills scarp are thoroughly examined, some similar, high alumina clay ma\ be dis covered close under the white, lithographic limestones. Building Stone b ^ l The Miliolitic limestones are already well known, so much so that the dressed blocks and pillars from EkB«l«d and other ruins are taken away for new buildings and quarrying avoided. However, there are large quantities of this' freestone available along the coas . Further inland, among the Qara mountains, there is superior stone. Eocene limestones, but they will be harder and more costly to quarry as dressed blocks. Their greatest usefulness, as a building material, will be for lime-burning and cement manufacture (and where the purity is especially high they would be valuable tor chemical purposes, as will be explained). There are no easily accessible sandstones which might be used in place of the mihohte, and the subject of sand for mortars and plasters and concrete wiU 1 think, be concentrated on the sea-shore sands which must be both calcareous and salt-impregnated. The former constituent will not be a defect, but the salt may require washing out. Curiously, there are no basic igneous rocks, so far as I am aware, in Dhufar provmce. The Semail Igneous series of Oman (bordering the Batinah coast) and of Masira island (and even of Ras Madhraka or Jazirah) has no representatives in Dhufar. Such stones as dolente and basalt are very serviceable, but without them the building stone m Dhutar is adequate for all the purposes that such stones may be required m this province. Coal, and Lignite 80. Except for the carbonaceous material from beyond the head of the Ghaiz wadi towards Ansarit, in no other locality has coal or lignite been found or reported. The Ansarit material is certainly suggestive of lignite, since its volatile percentage is much greater than the fixed carbon. Nor has the material suffered crushing46 or severe shearing, but since its ash percentage exceeds 85% and is largely silica (74%) this material must be regarded as siliceous. The texture is fine and for this reason I have not termed it a car bonaceous or bituminous sandstone. In this connection I must say- that Httr-FTigliiitas showed me a specimen of sandstone with car bonaceous laminae attached, and stated that it came from the Samhan hills. I procured no further specimen when at Murbat, and feel certain that the Sultan's information is quite accurate for the following reasons. In the Geological Survey of India office there is an entry on a File (528), under Reg. No. 1818/5-12-1907, of 'Car bonaceous Shale—Samhal Hills Coal ? Arabia' with the analysis below: Moisture 2*40%, Volatile Matter 6-60%, Fixed Carbon 3-6%, Ash 87-30%, and a Specific Gravity of 2-38. The car bonaceous components agree very well with the specimen from Ansarit and so does the percentage of Ash. The material may be of a lignitic character, but is not of any economic value. The poorest material of lignite from Makalla, that from Baqrein, shows 5-4% Moisture, 16-6% Volatile Matter, 10-9% Fixed Carbon and 67% Ash, while the good quality lignite, from Asfal el'Ain, gave, on analysis, 10-0% Moisture, 40-2% Volatile Matter, 38-5% Fixed Carbon, 11 *3% Ash and a Calorific Value of 6,370 calories (11,466 B.T.U.'s). In regard to the possibilities of finding lignitic coal in Dhufar, all that can be said at present is that the position of the anticipated seams may best be sought at the base of the Samhan hills limestone or in the highest beds of the underlying Argillaceous series. Before closing this subject of coal it may be remembered that two officers of the Geological Survey of India visited an area south of Sur and about 30 miles west-south-west of Ras al Hadd in 1900-01. Both A. L. von Krafft and R. D. Oldham brought back large samples from the area between Musweh and Migel, in the Fisao valley, and where outcrops are as much as 4J feet thick. The strata occur in a synclinal 10 miles axially and 4 miles across, trending roughly east-west. These samples yielded the following:— Von Krafft's Oldham's Moisture Volatile Matter Fixed Carbon Ash Specific Gravity 4-66% 5-61% 5-81% 13-77% 30-29% 29-88% 28-27% 29-03% 64-04% 62-78% 59-70% 52-33% 1-01% 1-71% 6-22% 4-87% 1-318 1-34 1-31 1-36 Caking Property47 The calorific value of one of von Krafft s samples gave no less than 7,846 calories or 14,122 B.T.U.'s. The strata are said to be of Miocene age at the top of a 6,000-foot series of lime stones at the base of which Nummuhtes occur. The ratio of volatile matter to fixed carbon is suggestive of the Gondwana (Permian) coals of India, and I should doubt the Miocene age of these seams However, Oldham is supposed to have found the seams irregular and thought the distance to Khor Jerama (near Ras al Hadd) too far and difficult at that time for the development of the Sur or Fisao valley coalfield. Nearly 50 years have passed since his visit and it might be worth re-examination now. The high grade of the samples, bo Oldham's and von Krafft's, is evident and the calorific value is exceptionally high. Copper Ore 81 I saw no sample of copper ore from any locality in Dhufar province, but mention must be made of the copper ore occurrences, including old workings, in Masira island. These deposits were drawn attention to by H. J. Carter a century ago. The material met with was the 'blue' and 'green' carbonate of copper, which occurs in decomposed hornblendic rock (presumably of the Semail Igneous series). No sulphide ore was encountered, so that the mining opera tions may have been conducted only with a view to obtaining eas y smelted ore without much trouble. As the deposits have been lyang idle for 100 years it is possible they may have been forgotten, l-hey cannot be considered as useless until the sulphide ore beneath has been tested and found unsatisfactory. Dolomite Two samples of 'chalky' limestone which I collected from beds, 3 feet and 20 feet thick, respectively, and lying practically horizontal in ravine exposures south-west of Hanun, have yielded the following results3-foot bed. 10-foot bed. Calcium carbonate . Calcium sulphate Magnesium carbonate Insolubles, Silica, etc. Oxide of iron Alumina .. Alkalies, etc. 53-66% 53-41% 0-02% 0-20% 45-14% 44-69% 0-34% 1-06% 0-26% 0-20% 0-08% 0-08% 0-50% 0-36% 100-00% 100-00% Since the composition of pure Dolomite is 54-35% calcium car bonate (30-4% lime) and 45-65% magnesium carbonate (21-7/„(I magnesia), it can be seen how high is the quality of the material I brought back from the Qarn Shaiba region, where material of this quality occurs under many square miles of country within an easy quarrying depth. If we reckon 2 million tons per foot thickness per square mile, it is seen that a 10-foot bed (which is really half the exact thickness of the bed from which the second sample was taken) holds 20 million tons per square mile. It is probable that some of the 'chalky' limestones in the coastal tracts, for example near Risut, may also prove to be high grade dolomite. Unfortunately, I was not aware of the exact nature of my two samples or I should have taken samples near Risut, but I do not remember seeing such dead white material or beds as thick as those near Hanun among the exposures near Risut. Edible Ci^ays 82. An unctuous clay, found in the shales of the Argillaceous series in the scarp of the Jabal Samhan facing Murbat, is used by some of the people as an edible clay. I saw the excavations, but did not know at the time the purpose for which the material was utilized and believed it was for pottery-making and colour-wash. Mr. Little mentions as 'soapstone' a clay associated with the lower beds of the middle Eocene limestone of Makalla (Gebel or Jabal Qara) which is used as a cleansing agent (detergent), and he gives the following analysis for a sample of this 'fuller's earth' as follows: silica 53-60%, alumina 21-60%, iron oxide 1-60%, lime 2-40%, magnesia 1-87% and moisture, etc. 18-93% with a specific gravity of about 2-13 (as found) and of a pale green colour (yellowish when dry). One of the best known edible earths (and fuller's earth) in India is the 'Multani matti' of Bikaner, Jodhpur, etc. which is also obtained in the middle Eocene of Rajputana. This Indian clay is of a slight greenish yellow colour (becoming biscuit colour on drying) and has the following approximate composition (Bikaner, Palana): silica 44-96%, alumina 14-16%, iron oxide 4-74%, lime 8-72%, magnesia 4-63% and loss on ignition 20-72%. In another case, under the lignite of Kasai in Makalla, Little mentions a reddish brown shale or impure soapstone (with a composition essentially a double silicate of iron and magnesium, which is correct for sepiolite in the steatite-saponite silicates),'. . . which is moist and plastic when first removed. When dry it is smooth but not so unctuous as that of G. Qara and sometimes feels slightly gritty. . . . It disintegrates slowly when placed in water, but does not swell up like the specimen from G. Qara.' The Qara fuller's earth, after drying, disintegrates immediately in water and swells up to twice its original volume. The Bikaner material is similar, but still not quite a typical' bentonite'. When the Dhufar province is more thoroughly 48searched it is very likely that the above-mentioned clay from the Jabal Samhan scarp will be found to be a fuller's earth suitable for edible purposes (largely for the absorption of oil matter). As this matter is of some interest I shall quote extracts from Carter's 1857 publication (Geological Papers on Western India), page 585. Writing of 'chalk', he says,'... By chalk here is meant a soft, white, earthy limestone, or gritty calcareous deposit belonging to the Nummulitic series; there is no genuine chalk on this coast . . .' Then discussing the top of the argillaceous strata of Jabal Samhan, he wrote (page 586), '. . . the argillaceous division, which presents strata of various colours, but chiefly a red one; one of which, a dark-red clay stratum, of a soapy nature, presented an excavation which the Bedouins told us was made by their women, who came there occasionally to eat the clay . . .' He adds, ' These red strata pass into white and grey, compact, limestone strata, more or less thick, more or less fine in structure, more or less lithographic in appearance, above which comes a whitish yellow, chalky deposit, more or less argillaceous, from which the Bedouins cut their pipes, and then a white, compact limestone again . . .' I am not able to say, without samples, whether the edible, red clay is 'bentonitic' but it is of course not a fuller's earth, nor is it possible to say if the Bedouin 'pipe' clay is of 'meerschaum' (sepiolite) which Little has called 'soapstone' quite correctly (the Kasai specimen, not the Qara sample, which is fuller's earth). Faints and Chert 83. There is a great abundance of small and large fragments of true flint as well as of chert and related chalcedonic and similar siliceous material to be found strewn on the bare plains of the Qarn Shaiba country from south-west of Hanun to Thenut and Obet (see paragraphs 41 and 77). Similar fragments are to be found near Risut, up the Nagar Ghaiz wadi, and also near the debouche of the Rizat (Ar'Zat) wadi and elsewhere along the southern side of the Jabal Qara in the Jurbaid or Dhufar plain. If large blocks of flint were required to make 3-inch to 4-inch balls for a rotary grinding mill, then a very thorough search would have to be made in such places as the Hanun wadi, as blocks large enough to yield such 'balls' are uncommon. For smaller material there is an abundance of flint in the northern area, but rather spread abroad on the extensive plains (of a very bare country). It would be difficult to collect even a ton of flints from any area south of the Qara mountains, between Risut and Takah. It is even more difficult to find flints at all within the Qara mountains south of the A1 Qutun (watershed).Gypsum and Anhydrite 84. Although fragments of Gypsum are to be found on, and as veins in, the limestones and sandstones and slates at the head of the Ghaiz wadi, towards the Ansarit gap where the vertical veins of fibrous Gypsum are 6 to 8 inches wide, there is no considerable deposit which could be worked on a commercial basis for export. Gypsum, with perhaps some Anhydrite, is more common across the Jabal Qara in the Qarn Shaiba country, but it is again present, so far as my observations went, only as irregular veins and segrega tions in the limestone. I had thought, after discovering the ' chalk' beds not to be chalk, that what has since been proved to be pure Dolomite was massive granular Gypsum (or perhaps Anhydrite). There is so much evidence of Gypsum in that northern area that extensive deposits might be discovered, though it might be difficult to account for the sources of the Sulphuric acid which has reacted to form the Calcium sulphate. In the case of the wadi Ghaiz veins the probability is that Pyrite was present and the decom position of this Iron sulphide would yield the necessary Sulphuric acid to react with the limestone or water-carrying Calcium carbonate in solution to form Calcium sulphate [as Gypsum in its various forms —satin spar (fibrous), selenite (crystals), alabaster (fine grained), etc.]. Dark, pyritiferous shales occur with many lignitic coal seams and with carbonaceous shales among bedded limestones, and these might quite easily yield the necessary Sulphuric acid for the formation of Gypsum and become themselves so leached as to be found now as beds of 'Multani matti' or 'fuller's earth' and the like. I noticed no such beds in Dhufar, but my traverses were such that any exhaustive search was impossible, and such clays would not be very conspicuous in scarp and cliff sections. It does not follow that, because I found no massive bed or deposit of Gypsum, none exists. Indeed, I believed the 'chalky bed' to be Gypsum and I was rather surprised to find it was Dolomite (the chemical formation of Dolomite from coral or foraminiferal limestone requires percolating water charged with Magnesium chloride or at least much Magnesium salt in the presence of Sodium chloride). It is quite likely that beds of Gypsum will be found towards the Nejd. Hematite (Iron Ore) 85. A fragment of specular Hematite was handed to me by Mr. Mohammad Amin Salim, who stated that it was reported to have been found in the Murbat area. I was unable to secure further specimens or any reliable information as to the source of the specular Hematite. Mr. Little mentions 'micaceous Hematite', used as kohl (stibnite) mistakenly by the Bedouin of Makalla, from several places in that country, but his various specimens proved much of it to be 50cupriferous iron ore which was associated with veins in igneous intrusions (decomposed dykes) at Pakhida, Aidma Ras el Aqaba, etc. As the archaean peneplain has not been thoroughly examined it is not possible to say whether the specular Hematite shown to me occurs with any micaceous Hematite and in what quantity. I do not think there can be any large deposit of Hematite for iron ore. Lead Ore (Galena) Among the specimens handed to me on my arrival at Salalah on the 3rd February (see paragraph 32) was one of galena which was reported to come from the Murbat area. When I got to Murbat on the 11th February (paragraph 47) the Governor there, Sheik Ali bm Salim, gave me to understand that the Lead ore (galena) was brought from Garat Athetate, a day's journey away, and that the man who knew the place was ill. I was sorry about this as, subsequently, I was handed a sample of several pounds weight which looked very attractive. An assay of this Lead ore, made by Messrs. R. V. Bnggs &amp; Co., Ltd., Calcutta, indicated 48-6% of Lead with 7 ounces of Silver (to the ton of ore or about 15 oz. to the ton of Lead). It is not an argentiferous galena, but it is a very rich Lead ore (in quality) if the sample is at all representative of the ore-body. As I was unable to see the occurrence and do not know if there are old mines there or if the deposit is being worked at all, it is not possible to say whether it is a workable lode or not. It appears to occur m o. limestone or marble, judging from the material adhering, and this suggests that the galena is in the metamorphic rocks (those seen in the low hills, Jabal Ali, just north of Murbat) which probably con tinue north-eastwards along the foot of the Jabal Samhan scarp. In this connection it may be said that pure galena contains ob b / 0 of Lead and 13-4% of Sulphur and is a sulphide of Lead. The well- known Bawdwin lead ore mines of Burma carry a complex ore which averages about 23-0% of Lead (and carries 13-8% of Zinc, 0 /o o Copper and 17-7% of Silver to the ton of ore), ihe Garat Athetate ore, if present in workable quantity, would be a simple, high grade ore'to treat, and, .as the smelting of such an ore is relatively simple, it is surprising that it was not used m making lead tor bullets by these tribesmen who scarcely move without firearms. Limestones 86. Seeing that 95% of the area of Dhufar is limestone country it would be surprising if the limestones were not of different kinds and in very large quantities of various grades or types. I have pre viously, under Dolomite, mentioned the great richness of northern Dhufar in high grade Magnesian limestone or Dolomite. In the same area, but half-way down the side of the Hanun wadi (near the52 Hanun water-hole and camp site) there are bedded middle Eocene limestones, some with a strong taste of salt, below the Dolomite beds. An analysis of the limestone which tastes of salt (Sodium chloride) was analyzed by Messrs. R V. Briggs &amp; Co., Ltd., Calcutta, with the following results: Calcium carbonate 92-41%, Magnesium carbonate 3-32%, Insolubles (Silica, etc.) 1*26%, Oxide of iron 0-23% and Alumina 0-17%, and 2-42% of water-soluble matter. This water- soluble matter (2-42% of the whole limestone) was composed of Calcium sulphate (0-48%), Magnesium sulphate (0*03%), Magnesium chloride (0*24%), Sodium chloride (1-67%) and a trace of Potassium chloride. The limestone itself is of high grade, but I did not collect the specimen for its quality, but for the salt it contained. Indeed, I was of the opinion that it was not a particularly high grade lime stone, and that material of better quality was there present. I was not interested in the chemical composition (for commercial utilization) of limestones in the Qarn Shaiba region when there was so much limestone near and along the coast of Dhufar, including the Miliolitic limestone of Salalah, etc. An analysis of a sample of the Miliolitic limestone from between Salalah and El Knlotl^ made by Messrs. R. V. Briggs, gave:— Calcium carbonate . . .. .. 90-25% Calcium sulphate . . .. .. 0-92% Magnesium carbonate .. .. .. 4-55% Insolubles (Silica, etc.) .. .. .. 3-28% Oxide of iron . . .. . . 0-17% Alumina .. . . .. 0-31% Alkalies, etc. .. .. .. 0-52% Limestone of this quality is suitable for the manufacture of Portland Cement. The Magnesia content would be 2-14% (from 4-55% Magnesium carbonate) and allowing 1^ tons of limestone per ton of cement the total Magnesia in the latter would be about 3-2% (which is below the 4% permissible in specifications of the British Standards Institution). However, while the miliolite lime stone might be suitable for making the best quality Portland Cement, and the quantity is very large, this limestone is not as high in purity as the saliferous limestone (Nummulitic) from Hanun, and I was myself anxious to locate good quality limestone on, or close to, the coast for chemical purposes, such as preparing Soda Ash, Bleaching Powder or in the purification of sugar. I therefore took, as fairly average, samples on the slopes as I descended to the Rizat spring on the 10th February (see paragraph 45). At the time I was somewhat disappointed, as the material I was collecting appeared to be siliceous and inferior-looking to most of the limestones I had superficially noticed elsewhere in Dhufar. The results of the chemical analyses made by Messrs. R. V. Briggs &amp; Co., Ltd., are as below:—53 (2) (3) 97-84% 97-28% nil 0-19 1-31% 0-85% 0-18% 1-08% 0-10% 0-09% 0-10% 0-07% 0-47% 0-44% (1) Calcium carbonate .. 98-25% Calcium sulphate . . nil Magnesium carbonate . . 0-85% Insolubles (Silica, etc.) . . 0-24% Oxide of iron . • 0-13% Alumina . . • • 0-07% Alkalies, etc. .. • • 0-46% T otal .. 100-00 100-00 100-00 The great purity of these limestones is evident and all three are of a quality suitable for chemical purposes, the preparation of Bleaching Powder and Calcium carbide, etc. The samples represent beds 300 or 400 feet thick, so that even if some beds are inferior and usable only for cement or lime-burning, there are almost in exhaustible quantities of high grade limestone for all purposes, in the Rizat hills alone and from easily quarriable outcrops. Oil (Petroleum) 87. Soon after my arrival in Dhufar my attention had been drawn to an 'oil' seepage among the sandstones of the shore near Murbat, and I naturally made a point of examining the place (see paragraphs 48 and 52). There can be no doubt that oil has been seen by those who have drawn attention to the place, and the position is one (among seaward dipping argillaceous, marly sandstones) where a seepage might be expected from oil-bearing beds; but, as the rocks there are exposed only at low tide and covered (or largely awash) at high tide (rise and fall about 5 feet), there is also the likelihood of the seepage changing position. Unfortunately there is no undoubted seepage now, and, if there was a great seepage, it would mean that the oil-field would be out at sea under Murbat bay. As the platform of Murbat is of gneiss I should consider the prospects under Murbat bay very poor and unattractive, since, if oil-bearing beds were proved to exist (which is not at present the case), they could only be worked by sinking shafts on the shore and driving out, under the sea bed, to tap the oil from drivages—an exceptional mining proposition under any circumstances. It happens, however, that this is not the only indication of oil in Ohufar, as the fault encountered in the slates at the head of the wadi Ghaiz (or Nagar Ghaiz) contained what may be bituminous rather than ligmtic material (see paragraph 54). p , • -.o • 1 The carbonaceous material in the fault is 18 inches across, sheared and flaky and without any trace of Alum. ^ I thought it was a sheared coal seam and took a sample to see if the coal (or lignite), as I had supposed, had been converted into graphitic-55 bonaceous material from the Ansarit exposure was analyzed by Messrs. R. V. Briggs &amp; Co., Ltd., as follows;.— Moisture on sample as received .. . • 1*92% Analysis on dried sample (100 o C.)

Unfortunately neither specimens react to the solvent action of alcohol, petroleum ether or benzol and do not even give a coloration, and thus, ac cording to normal tests, neither sample can be regarded as a petroleum residue at present. Mr. O. H. Little has mentioned the Bitumen from Lahia near El Sidara (a specimen of pure black Bitumen) which assayed 96-00%56 soluble Bitumen, 3*7% free Carbon and 0-30% mineral Ash, and stated that' it is doubtless an oxidation product of petroleum . . .' He gave a further analysis of bituminous Sandstone from the same locality (in Makalla) as follows: 19-1% soluble Bitumen, 1*4% free Carbon and 79-5% mineral Ash, and stated: 'This is evidently a Sandstone richly impregnated with bituminous or oil matter . , .' The mineral contained 80*8% of Silica and 19-2% of oxides of Iron, Aluminium and Manganese. There is a close resemblance in the composition of the bituminous Sandstone of the El Sidara locality and the materials from the Ghaiz and Ansarit exposures, except that the Dhufar material is slightly higher in mineral Ash, but this may be a mere accident, and as Mr. Little says of the occurrence of this class of substance, it ' . . . is an indication that petroleum existed at a former period and may still exist at greater depthI shall discuss this subject of a search for oil in the next section of this report, as the question of the origin of the oil, its normal geological horizon in Arabia and surrounding countries, and the structure of the strata in which' oil sands' usually occur, must be carefully considered for the province of Dhufar. Pottery Ci.ays 89. I was not aware of any special clay as regularly used in the preparing of earthenware pottery by the people of Salalah, Hafa, etc. Indeed from what I saw it seemed that they used imported Chinaware cups and plates, and skins or canvas chaguls for holding water. The subject of a good pottery clay might be taken up after Dhufar has been opened up by mineral and agricultural development. Some of the soil or sub-soil clays appear suitable for earthenware as well as for brick-making, but with so much soft freestone available (not to speak of the dressed stone in the ruins of El and other places) there is no demand for bricks. S ai/t Sodium chloride: Except for veins of salt in the Limestone of the Hanun, and the somewhat more massive sample brought me by Sheik Sail bin Garwah from somewhere north-west of Hanun, I encountered no deposits of rock salt during my tour in Dhufar, nor were specimens or samples produced for my inspection; and, so I am obliged to say that workable deposits of rock salt do not appear to be present in the province of Dhufar. Nor is there any spring or well of strong brine available this side of the Nejd, and, judging by the pool of the Mugshin, on the edge of Ar Rimal ('The Sands'), and the vast quantities of water that pour down the wadis northward from the A1 Qutun (watershed) of the Jabal Qara and adjacent highlands, I doubt if any real brine wells or salt bedswill be found even in the Rub'al Khali. However, salt is of impor tance to Dhufar, and at the present time small quantities are obtained from 'pans', by the evaporation of sea-water near Kharain, on the edge of bay at Risut, and between Okad (Augad) and the wadi marsh near Risut. The quantity now evaporated is small, but there is space for establishing a salt manufacture on a large scale. This salt would be primarily for the manufacture of Soda Ash, and the rise and fall of the tide, about 4 to 5 feet, would permit large quanti ties of salt water to be trapped at high tide to allow continuous opera tions on a large scale. Serpentine 90. Serpentine occurs among the metamorphic rocks in the low hills, Jabal Ali, near Murbat, and specimens were brought to me from further east along the foot of the Jabal Samhan scarp, but, so far as I know, the occurrences are small and irregular. The interest in Serpentine is not so much in itself as in the possible occurrence of true Asbestos, Chrysotile or fibrous Serpentine, and perhaps of Steatite (Talc). Steatite Among the specimens there were two or three of Steatite or Talc, but the material was not pure white nor pale green with a fresh appearance, but a dull white with, what seemed, rusty spots where Garnet crystals had weathered away. However, there is no doubt that Serpentine, in massive form, is present among the metamorphic rocks of the Murbat archaean platform. It is possible that the larger deposits occur with good quality Steatite or Talc, but the material shown to me is what might be designated soapstone , a general term for mineral substances possessing a soapy feel, but usually of an inferior quality to fine-grained, massive Steatite. The important fact is that a closer search for workable deposits may be justified when a detailed mineral survey of Dhufar is made. TrEmoute Actinolite: Besides odd specimens of mica-schist, chlorite- mica-schist, etc., there were some with an amphibole (now determined as Actinolite), but which I first thought was Tremolite. However, the mineral was in a fibrous form, which is known as Asbestos (meaning incombustible). Both Actinolite and Tremolite occur in the form (fibrous) of Asbestos. The commercial kind of this amphibole Asbestos is that in which the fibres are separable, otherwise the material is not amenable to weaving into cloth or rope. None of the specimens brought to me have easily separable fibres, but it often happens that this variety weathers badly and is not as evident at first as the more solid fibrous form (having the fibres like thin longr needles, all stuck together—as is the case with the specimens). The mineral Tremolite is a calcium-magnesium amphibole (silicate) while Actinolite is a calcium-magnesium-iron amphibole, and fibrous Serpentine (or Chrysotile, the short-fibre Asbestos) is a hydrous magnesium silicate, quite distinct from the amphibole group of minerals. Serpentine may be derived from amphibole and is invari ably a secondary mineral as the result of the alteration of basic rocks (rich in amphibole or pyroxene minerals) of igneous origin. It may thus be that these substances—Serpentine, Steatite and Tremolite (Actinolite), which have been found among the metamor- phic rocks of the Murbat plain—may prove them to be the equivalent of Mr. I^ees' Semail Igneous series, and, from the evidence above given, show that they are much older than he thought when assigning them to the Mesozoic age. There is obviously a younger Igneous series, since Mr. Ivittle writes of Dolerite and Basalt with veins of Granite in the Ras Makalla headland. n59 vi. industrial possibilities Cement and Lime Manufacture 91. With so much Limestone present, the first question is whether the material is suitable for utilization on a profitable basis and on a large scale. The analyses which have been given in paragraph 86, Limestones, show that the coastal Limestone, the Miliolites, are of a quality suitable for the manufacture of Portland Cement. This stone is from 8 to 20 feet thick (in places) but barely 20 feet above sea-level at Salalah, so that excavations up to 12 feet may be made without water trouble. This depth may also be regarded as the average thickness of the stone, which shows at the surface in beds 12 to 18 inches thick, dipping gently, 5 degrees, to the south, seawards. The material covers several square miles of the coastal country, but probably not continuously, being better developed between A1 Hush and Salalah to Hafa and near Takah than at intermediate places. The deposits at Murbat are also not very extensive and about 6 feet thick on any average. The Miliolite limestone is porous and friable and so can be easily crushed and made into slurry. The specific gravity of the stone is a little more than 2-00 so that about 20 cubic feet may be reckoned to a ton (one cubic foot per hundredweight). An area 440 yards square in 6 feet of workable Miliolite will, therefore, yield 500,000 tons of stone. A modern cement factory produces 500 tons of cement per day from 750 tons of Limestone, so that the yearly consumption of stone, reckoned at 400 days (to allow a margin), will be 300,000 tons of Limestone. If l/16th of a square mile yields half a million tons of stone then one square mile will yield 8,000,000 tons, which is a 25-year supply. The Dhufar Miliolite deposits would probably be able to supply several cement factories of the above-mentioned capacity. 92. Portland Cement is being made at Dwarka, Kathiawar, India, from exactly similar material (Miliolitic Limestone), often much more friable and locally spoken of as 'marl' (which it is not, since the term 'marl' assumes the presence of clay). Indeed a considerable percentage of clay has to be added to make the correct slurry at the Dwarka cement works, and clay will be required at ariy Portland Cement works on the Dhufar plain. The Dwarka works face the Arabian Sea without any shelter from the south-west monsoon and thus the cement is carried westwards by rail, or to the new port which the Government of Baroda have established 20 miles or so to60 the north at Okha. The chief difficulty which has been faced at Bwarka, especially during and since the war, has been fuel. Like most cement works the practice was to use coal in pulverized form, but the uncertainty of getting their supplies of coal led to the works re-equipping their kilns to burn oil, fuel oil. This is now a common arrangement, i.e. for pulverized fuel furnaces to be capable of turning over to fuel oil firing in case of shortage of coal, and vice versa. I understand also that the Dwarka cement works imported considerable quantities of the Gypsum they require (to be mixed and ground with the 'clinker' to control the rate of setting of the powdered product—the cement) from Egypt. Some Gypsum was also being procured from Rajputana, 400 miles away by train. The amount of Gypsum needed is perhaps 5% of the cement produced, and for a works producing 300,000 tons of cement annually the Gypsum will be required at 15,000 tons a year. . 93 The composition of Portland Cement varies, but, trom several analyses from different makers, the variation may be from 58 to 67% of Lime, 18 to 27% of Silica, 5 to 10% of Alumina, 0 to 7% of Iron oxide, under 4% Magnesia, under 2% Alkalies and under 2-75% Sulphur anhydride. The proportions of the main com ponents are according to specifications laid down by the British Standards Institution as a result of long experience. For a Portland Cement works in Dhufar the most obvious site is near A1 Husa,, somewhat west of Salalah, as it is here that 10 feet of Miliolite should be readily obtained at the surface and over more than a square mile (without interfering with the cocoanut groves which fringe the beach). The supply of Gypsum might be, at first, obtained from up the wadi Nagar Ghaiz, west-north-west of Risut, and barel} 10 miles away. The problem of fuel would be similar to that at Dwarka, imports of coal or/and fuel oil. This can come from the Persian Gulf (fuel oil) on the one hand, and South Africa (coal) on the other. There remains the probability of obtaining high grade coal from the Fisao coal-field, between Musweh and Migel, south of Sur, and there is the possibility that oil may be found in Dhufar province itself. For immediate consideration fuel imports appear necessary, and the question of exporting the prepared cement to other parts of the Arabian Sea coast must introduce the subject ot an anchorage. This is obviously Risut bay. Taken on its own merits a single Portland Cement works, even with a subsidiary factory making rapid-hardening and other special grades of cement, will probably not be able to face the cost of improving the projected port of Risut on the model of Okha. However, if on Okhamandal it has been possible to establish a big cement works (at Dwarka), a new port (at Okha) and a big chemical works (at Mithapur), there should be no climatic disadvantages in Dhufar, but rather great climatic advantages. An alternative site to Salalah is of course near■ ■ Takah, where the Darbat lake area, 5 miles away, would be an attractive place for the colony, but it will mean dredging the mouth of the river and allowing the sea to re-enter the khor Ron to become an anchorage, once more, as in the days of Abyssapolis! Salt and Chemical Works 94. The subject 'of salt-making has already been discussed in paragraph 89, and it was there stated that a small salt industry now exists at Kharain, between Okad (Augad) and Risut. The salt pans there tap sea-water from the bay of Risut, and there is sufficient space in that area to have pans over an area ot 6 or 4 square miles, by using the tide and pumping.; The conditions tor evaporation are as good as those at Mithapur, if not better, and t le salinity of the sea-water may be assumed as the same. On this basis it should not be difficult to prepare 250,000 tons of salt annually, and half this amount easily as a raw material for chemical purposes. The sea brine concentrated at Mithapur has the following com position Calcium carbonate .. Calcium sulphate Sodium chloride Magnesium sulphate Potassium chloride . . Calcium chloride Magnesium chloride .. Magnesium bromide .. 0-0221% 17-4649% 17-2666% 1-6016% 0-4569% 0-0427% 1-9532% 0-1836% Total Solids .. 21-9816% The Mithapur chemical works are able to deal with 125,000 tons of sea salt annually, and are capable of producing 150 tons of Soda Ash daily. In addition, arrangements had been made or were being made for the outturn of the following products per day : 25 tons of Caustic soda, 7 tons of Chlorine, 2 tons of Magnesium chloride, 1 ton of Epsom salts, tons of Potassium bromide, 2 tons of Hydrochloric acid, some hydrous potassium-magnesium chloride (Carnellite) and Magnesia (Magnesium oxide). Thus the salt obtained was not sold as common salt in the Indian market (except under certain qualified conditions). . . ^ ., , • - 95 I have not made any special investigation into the subject of making salt at Kharain, nor is any claim made that the sea brine likely to be concentrated at this place will be identical with that obtained at Mithapur, but on a general survey there would appear to me to be some advantages m favour of the Dhufar proposal. The wadi that comes into Risut bay from the west -north-west does so through a marsh which contains saline water, but 3 or 4 miles 6162 J up this wadi there should be no difficulty in getting fresh water (and I pointed out a place for a well to the State Engineer). It is not possible to say what the yield of such a well might be, but at a rough minimum, a quarter of a cusec (about 125,000 gallons a day) may be assumed as the dry, hot weather yield. This, at 25 gallons a head, would supply 5,000 people, which is what the chemical works (with salt works) would probably employ or have in its colony at Risut. The existing marsh could, in my opinion, be suitably engineered into a reservoir holding a considerable reserve of water (impounded from the flood discharge down the wadi). The catch ment of this wadi system is perhaps not less than 200 square miles, so that with a rainfall of 12 inches and a run-off of 25% the flood or run-off water should be roughly over 180 million cubic feet (approxi mately 10,000 million gallons). If the reservoir could be made to hold such a quantity, or even a quarter of the amount, there would be ample water, mainly under gravity conditions, for a great chemical works of the standard of Mithapur. However, I am certain that the water-supply problem will not be difficult and will also be a more satisfactory and cheaper project than is the case with Mithapur in Okhamandal, Kathiawar. 96. It is in regard to its Limestone that a chemical works producing Soda Ash will have its chief problem. Mithapur uses a great deposit of 'dead corals' at site. This material is of very good chemical quality, as seen in the average analysis below:— Calcium carbdnate . . . . . . 95-94% Silica (insolubles) • Iron oxide Alumina .. Sodium chloride Combined water Moisture 2-22% 0-16% 0-60% 0-12% 0-72% 0-35% Undetermined including Magnesia . . 1'99% 100-00% If the analysis of this material is compared with the analysis of the Salalah Miliolitic, its superiority is evident, but if the Rizat area Limestones (in the southern slopes of the Jabal Qara) are studied (paragraph 86), it is evident that Dhufar possesses Limestone far superior to that available at Mithapur. It is true that the distance from the Rizat area to Risut is 25 to 30 miles by road, still this transport disadvantage is more than counterbalanced, first by the chemical purity and also by superior physical condition of the Qara hills' Limestones. This will become clear when it is remembered that the Carbon dioxide is required and, in consequence, a giant kiln, 100 feet or so high, is necessary for calcination (with coke as fuel).% The crush effect of the materials in the kiln would powder the Miliolite and much of the coralline Umestone, but would have little effect on the hard Qara Limestone. Thus there is an assured supply, in the largest possible quantity of the best kind of Limestone for chemical purposes, such as the production of Soda Ash (which incidentally yields a great deal of exceedingly high grade lime for other purposes). Oil-field Development 97. In paragraphs 87 and 88 I have discussed the general field evidence at present available to me of the prospect of an oil-field in Dhufar. It is there seen that the two samples (specimens) from 9 to 12 miles west-north-west of Risut, up the wadi of the Ghaiz and on the Ansarit side of the gap, might not represent petroleum residues. To this evidence may be added the analysis of the carbonaceous shale' from the Samhan hills (of 1907; see paragraph 80). There is a great similarity in all three analyses and, while I did not secure any ' coal' sample from the Murbat area, the Sultan himself showed me one, at the time of my arrival in Salalah, which had been collected in the Samhan hills area. There remains the 'oil show' on the shore near Murbat in the argillaceous sandstones (which are dis tinctly calcareous) which dip gently seaward into Murbat bay. Those who claim to have noticed the' oil' stated that it had a kerosene odour, and, as kerosene is a distillation product, the normal con clusion (seeing that there is no smell now) is that a castaway tin ot kerosene was wrecked on the rocks and impregnated them for a time» However, treating the matter more seriously, from other evidence as well, of the certainty that oil, as kerosene-smelling material, was noticed at the Murbat bay exposure, it is well to remember that the majority of oil-fields have had 'gas escapes' in greater number than 'oil seepages'. The direct recovery of 'natural kerosene by the condensation of such gases is well known, but it has also taken place naturally in rare cases where the conditions were suitable. I can imagine no conditions more suitable than the Murbat bay position, as gas escaping upwards along cracks and joints in the sandstone would be cooled by the sea-water, and any fractions which could be condensed would form light oils, such as kerosene, etc. And a gas escape in such a position might quite easily find a new outlet, if the outcropping rocks were disturbed (as may easily be the case at Murbat bay where the sea drives in during the monsoon with a resulting strong outward undertow). Thus the general evidence tor oil is fair. . . , m t 98. In two very informative contributions by Dr. u. M. L ^ ees (perhaps the chief authority on the geology of the oil-fields ot the Persian Gulf region—Iran, Iraq and north-eastern Arabia), one, ' Reservoir Rocks of Persian Oil-fields' (Bulletin, American Association 6364 fl of Petroleum Geologists, Vol. 17, No, 3, March 1933, pages 299 to 340), and the other 'The Geology of the Oil-field Belt of S.-W. Iran and Iraq' (see Geological Magazine, Vol. LXXVII, No. 3, Jnne 1940, pages 227 to 252), the general principles are clearly explained. In the former paper the reservoir rocks (i.e. those from which the oil is yielded up to wells) of three oil-fields are discussed. These are Masjid-i-Sulaiman, Haft Kel and Naft Khaneh. In these cases the ' reservoir rock' is a Limestone of lower Miocene age, called the Asmara I^imestone. It is a fine-grained foraminiferal Limestone, mostly of low porosity, and the porosity of the rock is independent of the degree of dolomitization. It is in the fractures, joints and cracks that the oil is held and these are essential factors in the oil-yielding capacity of the rock. In the latter paper Dr. Lees has reviewed the primary conditions for oil-fields. These are : (i) The occurrence of source rocks within which oil can be formed from material constituting the rock; (ii) The presence of reservoir rocks which are able to store the oil and also deliver it up to wells; (iii) Impervious strata or cover rocks which prevent the escape of the oil upwards to the surface; and (iv) Proper structural features, arches and domes, in the strata of (ii) to allow oil to accumulate locally. 99. In Iran and Iraq the 'source rocks' are believed to be certain chocolate to brown-coloured strata with 15% of hydro carbon matter adsorbed in them, and which are thought to range in age from Trias or Jurassic to Eocene. In Dhufar they could well be represented by the Samhan series discussed in paragraphs 72 and 73, and which include just those strata in which the bituminous matter, etc., as well as the 'oil show' of Murbat bay, occurs. These strata have not been searched or studied to establish whether they carry appreciable percentages of hydrocarbon, and this evidence will be difficult to secure from such outcrops as are seen. They carry uncertain evidence of petroleum residues, which, if true, might have come during the upward escape of oil from lower strata not exposed in Dhufar. In Iran and Iraq the 'reservoir rocks' as stated are the Asmara Limestones of Miocene age, but it is also known that certain Eocene Limestones are 'reservoir rocks' in the Kirkuk oil-field. There are no Oligocene and younger (Miocene) rocks in Dhufar, and the Limestones of the Qara mountains appear to be largely upper to middle Eocene, but I doubt whether they are functioning as 'reservoir rocks'. This applies also to the basal Limestones of the Jabal Samhan which may be lower Eocene and possibly upper Cretaceous in age. The total thickness of the Limestone series of Jabal Qara and Jabal Samhan is probably not more than 3,000 feet. The next series below, the argillaceous and65 (\ arenaceous strata next below the Limestones of Jabal Qara, are at least 2,000 feet thick and may be somewhat greater. They were indicated as possible 'source rocks' but they might be higher in the sequence, and the true source rocks may be lower and not seen. In which case this areno-argillaceous series might be 'cover rocks'. It is only near disturbed strata, the exposure at the head of the wadi Ghaiz and the 'spot' on the shore of Murbat bay, both of which I examined personally, that evidence, which might be indica tive of oil, has been found in Dhufar. My opinion is that there are potentialities of oil in Dhufar, notwithstanding the disappointing evidence so far obtained from surface exposures. 100. If there are 'source rocks' in Dhufar, they are not seen, although the buried strata of the areno-argillaceous series might be source rocks. If the source rocks are concealed, then the arenaceous beds of the Samhan hill series (as indicated in paragraphs 72 and 73) might be ' reservoir rocks' and the argillaceous portion of this series would function as cover rocks. These are all matters which must remain conjectural until proof is obtained by boring. Personally , I am of the opinion, that the source rocks are not exposed anywhere in Dhufar, and that both the Samhan hill series may be 'reservoir and 'cover rocks' in combination, and these under the anticlinal portion of the Qara mountains will be at a depth of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. This then is the minimum depth to which an explo ratory boring might be drilled at, say, the vicinity of Othik on the one hand or along an east-west axial line about this position. There always remains a possibility that the basal beds of the Limestone series, with the lithographic type of Limestone which is often much fractured, may be found to carry oil and so be the ' reservoir rock in Dhufar, and that the 'cover rocks' are the middle Eocene beds. This is again pure conjecture, but it is my opinion that the strati- graphical and structural geology of Dhufar have some evidence for the belief in a local accumulation of oil. If exploratory borings in the Zeloi field were carried to depths of 10,000 feet to discover oil and found the strata waterlogged, then I think a 4,000 to 5,000-ioct boring in Dhufar well worth consideration on an anticlinal position (which must be more precisely determined by geological mapping). Other Mineral Industries 101 I have considered the subject of Portland Cement manufac ture and that of Soda Ash. In the former case a relatively impure, though still high grade, Limestone, the Miliohtic Limestone, would be suitable; and in the latter case the high grade material from the area of Rizat springs (but there may be as good material near Risut and tests should be made to establish this point). In both these industries the basic raw material is Limestone. The pure lime that66 will be a by-product in preparing Soda Ash can be used for making Bleaching Powder, Calcium chloride and various other substances in which slaked lime is required. I have now to consider the L&lt;ead ore of Carat Athetate eastwards of Murbat, but unless the ore is in very great quantity the production of metal (Lead) by smelting will not be attractive for a small-scale industry, and it will be better to consider the manufacture of Lead pigments, such as ' Red Lead' and White LeadThis might be best done near the mine, if the deposits are close to the coast, or the ore could be brought round to Risut to a factory near the chemical works. With the subject of the pre paration of Paints will come the use of some of the pure slaked lime as well the manufacture of Plaster of Paris from Gypsum. As matters stand, the supplies of Gypsum appear very restricted, and this problem of Gypsum is one of considerable importance to the cement industry. The 'Soapstone' or Talc would probably find use in the paint industry 7 , or it might be powdered and sold as a filler for cloth or paper and for the packing and preservation of rubber goods. All these details concern the so-to-say minor minerals along the coastal side of the Jabal Qara. On these hills it is possible that other pigments might be found, such as Red and Yellow Ochre, but I did not see any actual occurrence. 102. The northern side of the watershed, A1 Qutun, in the area I have been referring to as Qarn Shaiba, has immense resources in Limestone and in pure Dolomite. There is also evidence of Gypsum and Salt and Flints (and Chert). The reserves of these three sub stances are unknown, but do not appear large within a distance of 40 miles from the coast. One specimen from among those brought to me from within 10 miles north-west of Hanun is identified as Chalk . It is of a pure white colour, soft and powdery, and I thought it might be 'China Clay' but the chemical analysis shows it is a powdery Limestone or Dolomite, i.e. chalk of a kind. If there was any substance that was sufficiently attractive to fetch by building of a good motorable road over the Jabal Qara to Hanun or into that region, a more thorough search for ceramic mineral substances might be carried out. On the basis of the specimens T have collected and the knowledge I have gained of the country towards the Nejd, I think that some more expeditions mode of travel than by camel will help greatly in opening up the country and bringing to notice minerals which have so far not been reported, or large, workable occurrences of some of those—such as Gypsum and Salt and China Clay—which have been found so far only in small quantities. In case it is thought that a good road is not justified to tap an area fringing 'The Sands' (Ar Rimal) where the country is believed to be emptyI should like to say that all the evidence I have gleaned by studying the 'flood signs' in the various north- draining wadi courses, as well as from the information in Mr. Bertram67 Thomas' book, Arabia Felix, is that the question of water-supply would seem a much simpler one than has been thought hitherto. If irrigation could somehow be introduced it is possible that the Rub'al Khali might require a change in name, and settlements in that area might lead to further discoveries of mineral substances. 103. The subject of water has already been fairly fully discussed for Dhufar generally and for the Jurbaid or coastal plain of Dhufar in particular (see paragraphs 34, 46 and 55). I have shown that considerable quantities of water not only emerge as springs, but that there is, in certain cases, as for example to the khor El Balad, and possibly to the khor Rori, an appreciable underground flow. I am not sure of the actual fall between the great spring on the Rizat wadi 5 miles north of *Mahnmlah (and the Sultan's shooting box at ^Mahmulah), but, assuming a fall of 100 feet with 18 cusecs of minimum flow, the electrical horse-power that might be generated is about 160 (and thus roughly 120 kilowatts) continuously. The formula I have used is, for power from a flowing stream, E.H.P. equals cusecs multiplied by head or fall and divided by 11 (for kilowatts divide by 15). In this way a valuable quantity of electric power would become available at^ MahHFalalr, and from this point a minimum of 18 cusecs of water would be available for irrigation purposes. I believe that 18 cusecs of water would be ample for nearly 3 square miles of sugar-cane (roughly 1 cusec for 100 acres). If a second area as large as 3 square miles could be irrigated, there would be assured supplies of cane for an important sugar factory. This is one example of the value of water in agriculture. There is no doubt at all that sugar-cane could be successfully grown and that a sugar factory is worth consideration near M^i hmulah. f* M rt moo p ft Other Industries 104. As agriculture looms large in the industrial picture of Dhufar, the problems and possibilities should repay examination by a suitable expert on such questions as sugar-cane, etc., which might yield high-priced products. On the hills, Jabal Qara, although the soil is fertile, I was of the opinion that it is good cattle country, and consequently grass and hay should be important considerations. In this connection the Bents (see page 263, Southern Arabia) wrote of the 'Qara mountains' (Jabal Qara),'... As we happened to be there in the dry season, the grass was all brown and slippery, and there stood around us acres upon acres of hay with no one'to harvest it but after the rains the aspect of the Gara hills must be as green and pleasant as those of Derbyshire . . .' I was even more surprised to learn that, because of lack of grass in the dry season, camel loads of dried sardines were taken up into the hills as food for the cattle. There are fairly large herds of cattle in the hills, and there can be no68 doubt that hay could be gathered in, as I saw for myself; and there must be very cheap sardines procurable along the coast. There thus seems to me evidence for improved dairy farming and possi bilities for a fishery business also. These are, however, matters outside my own professional knowledge, and I draw attention to them only because the people seem poor and unprogressive. 5 w \ v ^05. From remarks by His Highness I gathered that coco an ut oil was not a regular trade product from Dhufar, notwithstanding the thousands of cocoanut palms along the coast. Bound up with the subject of cocoanut is that of coir and of cocoanut shell, con sidered as commerce, as prepared products, the former as woven goods and the latter as converted into activated Carbon. Dr. Reginald Child has been conduefeing a research on cocoanuts in Ceylon and has demonstrated the superiority of cocoanut-shell charcoal as an absorbing agent; he mentioned that it was a remarkable property, used in the production of high vacua and was a main contribution in the progress of modern physics. Activated Carbon is of considerable value today, since it is in use for several purposes—purifying air, purifying carbon dioxide from fermentation, recovery of gasoline (from natural gas and benzine from coal gas), in vacuum work (making of radio valves), in decolourizing and purifying edible oils and glycerine, etc. to mention only a few items. The largest potential application is in sugar-refining. It is hardly necessary to refer to the trade in 'frankincense' and other gums and balm that is shipped from Salalah in the crude, although higher priced products might be prepared by skilful people. 106. Anyone who has had an opportunity of traversing the Qara mountains will have noticed the herds of cattle, the grassy A1 Qutun and the camels moving slowly upwards with their 'scented loads' of sardines. They will also see in the squalid huts at cave entrances and the frequent use of the numerous overhanging Lime stone beds (usually referred to as caves) a very primitive condition of living. There is great scope for progress in many directions. From the resemblance to the olive-growing areas of France I should think olives could readily be grown in the hills of Dhufar, and perhaps grapes and other fruits—oranges and lemons, etc. The tribesmen, however, are rough herdsmen, not agricultural farmers; nor are they sea-farers. From the abundance of sardines and other fish there is scope for fisheries and fish products. Sharks infest the bay of Risut and the sea along the coast. I saw the huge bones of whales lying bleached on the shore of Murbat bay, and I understand that it is not unusual to find pearls in oysters from the Dhufar sea bed. Indeed I was constantly surprised at the potentialities on the one hand and at the apparent lack of enterprise on the other.69 VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS Importance of Maps 107. I have indicated the maps I have used in connection with my investigations in Dhufar (see paragraph 7), but these are on too large a scale for geological mapping, and even those based on Air Information are inadequate for any detailed work, whether engineer ing projects or other development plans. A topographical survey of the Dhufar plain is an immediate necessity, and such a survey could be quickly carried out in the hills also. The map which was made by Khan Bahadur Imam Sharif for publication with the Bents' book, Southern Arabia, is an example of rapid work by a trained Indian surveyor. I should compute that a trigonometrical survey accom panied by plane-table mapping and traverses for levelling an area of 4,500 square miles of the character of Dhufar province would require five survey parties and could be completed in 10 months at a cost of about Rs. 1,50,000. From this survey maps on the standard scales— 1 inch to the mile and 4 miles to the inch—could be prepared and show contours at 50 feet intervals, and, also larger maps, 4 inches to a mile with 10-foot interval contours at least of particular areas, say, around the various springs—Garzaz, Sahnut, Rizat, etc.—for- irrigation schemes and for hydro-electric projects. A detailed geological survey of this Dhufar country, on a map of 1 inch to the mile, would probably cost Rs. 1,50,000, including a report of the geological structure, description of fossils and analyses of samples, and an outline of the resources, but it would not include detailed exploration and borings for petroleum. It might, in the hands of an experienced economic geologist, include the prospecting for Lead ore, the Talc or Soapstone, and very close examination of the bituminous matter up the Ghaiz wadi. ■ Importance of Communications 108. By flying to Salalah from Karachi I saved perhaps 10 days' sea voyage, by motoring to Garzaz, Sahnut, Murbat and west of Risut I must have saved another 10 days in the journeys alone, and the ease of getting from the aerodrome to the Palace and elsewhere must have saved another 10 days in making arrangements and other details connected with my work in making this mineral audit of Dhufar province. My investigations were made without haste; but I might have covered more ground in greater detail if it had70 been possible to motor to Kazmeem, Heelah, Hanun, etc., and return via Obet and Othik and^MahTTmMi. Seeing that I travelled by camel and encountered only a few steep slopes on the route, I am confident that an easy road alignment could be quickly found on a good topographical map and that such a road might be made motorable at small expense. Possibly 200 miles of road would give access to 10 miles west-north-west of Risut, up to and round by Hanun and also eastward to near Hasik from Murbat, and on the average cost perhaps Rs.2,000 per mile or Rs.4,00,000 in all. 'Ihere is already a landing ground and aerodrome at balalah and Risut bay offers a reasonable hydroplane base as well as a fair anchorage. A tramway cxiptod—between Riout bay and the Salalfth—IctiiJiu^ ground, but now lio^-abauduned allei llie - wai. If the above com munications were revived (and perhaps a new tramway made to Limestone quarries, where these might be opened, near Rizat spring or Sahnut or elsewhere), Dhufar would rapidly attract notice and its resources might be quickly explored. Mineral Exploration of Dhufar 109. Although the nationalization of industries and the planning of development by Government is at present popular, it is a very expensive business and likely to prove exceedingly costly if handled by inexperienced individuals and departments. In most cases industrial enterprise, while encouraged by the State, has been carried out by private enterprise. It is true that in some cases the industrialist has made large profits, but it is also true that he has taken risks and faced disappointing periods. It is thus worthy of consideration whether it would not be to the advantage of the Sultanate of Oman to invite offers for mineral exploration, parti cularly of such expensive items as the search for oil, the erection of a Portland Cement works, the building of a chemical works, and the like. If an Oman Mineral Industries Ltd. were formed on reasonable terms of royalty (minimum royalty or/and dead rent), first for a 3-year prospecting period and then for actual mining and quarrying, the State would not be faced with serious expenses. These would be for surveys (topographical and engineering) and road construction and for the collection of data on water-supply. The Oman Mineral Industries Ltd. would carry out detailed geological and geophysical surveys as needed, as well as the prospecting and proving of the mineral deposits, excluding that of oil. Such a company might be in sections—Cement branch, Ceramic branch. Chemical branch, etc.—and work through subsidiary companies who take out licences or leases for particular minerals or products. The lease for oil should only be given to a very experienced firm. (Indeed the planning for industrial development could include everything—71 agriculture, fisheries, minerals, etc.—on which the State might feel it could not itself embark immediately.) The terms would include the right of the State to take up 25% of the shares of the managing agency and of any subsidiary firm, at any time, at market prices and to buy the industries outright after 25 years. Water-power and Water-supply 110. Throughout the Report there has been mention of water, evidence of abundanc'e of water either at springs, or signs of floods and evidence of considerable underground movement of water. There is no doubt that the Rizat and perhaps the Sahnut springs could yield electric power by establishing a hydro-electric station out in the plains at, say/Mahmulah or elsewhere convenient. The site must still permit the tail water to have command for irrigation. These details can only be fully understood and appreciated after all available data are collected—relating to volume of hot weather discharge, difference of level between places, character of water, etc. The State Engineer could do much of this if he were not too heavily engaged in other engineering duties, but with one or two qualified assistant engineers (one for irrigation questions and the other for roads and buildings) he could be freed for this important work. It might include questions of storage, say, a dam in the debouche of the Rizat spring And another downstream from Sahnut and a third, perhaps the most important, at the marsh at Risut. The problems of storage in the wadis of the Qarn Shaiba might be attended to subsequently. v m *1*00 a a Recommendations 111. I have no hesitation in saying that I consider the province of Dhufar, which has an exceptionally mild climate for southern Arabia, to be endowed with other advantages both mineral and agricultural. The mineral resources are of the kind that can be best exploited on the largest possible scale. For this reason an exploration company or corporation (private enterprise) would, in my opinion, be the most efficient mode of opening up the mineral industries: Petroleum, Cement, Chemicals, etc. To encourage such industrialists the State would be well advised to have maps produced for mineral and other surveys to be properly conducted. This is a relatively small expenditure, but I do not think any useful purpose will be served at this stage by a geological survey (which requires considerable field experience) until the topographical maps are ready, and even then the expense could be readily borne and the work done more expeditiously by a private firm than by the State (which would have to engage a geologist—a matter that is not easy at present owing to the lack of really experienced geologists). The subject of having an agricultural expert who had experience in72 sugar-cane growing and sugar-making might perhaps be referred to the Government of India. In the case of any research work on cocoanuts the reference should be to the Government of Ceylon. As regards road-making and water-supply problems I suggest that such an engineer -might be obtained, on loan, from the Government of Baroda (as they have had experience of Okhamandal and country similar to the coast of Dhufar). His-Higfrness-is already aware of the value of a suitable guest house or hostel near the aerodrome for ' the representatives of industrialists who ma^y come to halalah to conduct negotiations and make local enquiries and as a nucleus for offices later on. In conclusion, I must repeat that I feel a vast advance, industrially, is possible in the province of Dhufar, and this can be encouraged and accelerated by facilities of accommoda tion, communications, and by grants of licences and leases to reliable firms on generous terms. I have no fear that the tribesmen may give cause for anxiety. They are poor and proud but I am sure they will see the advantages of progress. ^^4^. hw . C yrii . S. F ox, 17th March, 1947. Printed 12th May, 1947.73 6 APPENDIX Archaeology The mention of the word 'frankincense' introduces an atmosphere both of fragrance and ancient Arabia. The use of frankincense as an inflammable resin for incense was well known in the time of Moses, 1500 B.C., and there is every reason to believe that this odoriferous gum was in use in Egypt even before the 'balm of Gilead' was carried there from Canaan by the Ishmaelitish merchants, by camel caravans about 2000 B.C. It is possible that the trade in frankincense from southern Arabia was carried overland on camels in those ancient times; it seems definite that a coastwise trade was in existence, probably from the Malabar coast of India up to Elath, near Ezion Geber at the head of the gulf of Aqaba, in the days of King Solomon (1000 B.C.). However, while the tree Balsamodendron Gileadense— which yielded the balm of Gilead—is not now found in the Jordan valley in Palestine, both the trees Boswellia thurifera and Balsamodendron myrrha —which yield frankincense and myrrh—are still important sources of odoriferous gums in southern Arabia in the'Frankincense Country' (see the'Description of the Frankincense Tree of Arabia with remarks on the misplacement of the Libanophorous Region in Ptolemy's Geography' by H. H. Carter, Surgeon, Hon'ble East India Company's Sun-eying Brig Palinurus, The Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume II, Art. iv. No. xi, page 380, July 1847). • , . xu I think Dr. Carter gave sufficient evidence to make it certain that the ' Frankincense Countrv' was what is now the province of Dhufar in the Sultanate of Oman. In an earlier contribution Dr. Carter had described the ruins he examinedv arvte in Dhufar (see 'A descriptive account of the Ruins of El «a4e4-, / ransactions of the Bombay Geographical Society, Volume VII, Art. xiv, page 225, December 1S46). From Dr. Carter's reference to Ptolemy and other writers of the second century (A.D.) it is evident that there were, as might have been suspected, marts or trading ports along the southern coast of Arabia, but the subject requires special stud \ and cannot be dealt with in this brief note which concerns Dhufar or the ' Frankincense Country' particularly. However, according to Dr. Carter, the Arabia Felix of the author of the Periplus (? Arrian) is identified with modern Aden, and the Arabiae emporium of Ptolemy with Kanez {Cava Canem) which is thought to have been on the site of Hisn Ghorab as distinct from Makalla today. Dr. Carter's observations El / *Baiad-(in the district of Dhufar between Silalah and El Hafa on the west and Dareez on the east) are the most detailed yet available, but he ascribed the ruins to Saifal Islam al Gharsan (sixteenth century A.D.) because his bearing of the axial line of some pillars was roughly west-north-west—in the direction of Mecca. I took a reading and found the bearing almost exactly east-west. The accompanying sketch plan is practically a copy of that with Dr. Carters description, referred to in the previous paragraph. My opinion is that while the stones of El Balad were used more than once and that a Muslim ruler possibly built on the site, the place had already been a fort and mart in much earliei, prob ably in Phoenician, times. Indeed the Bents (J. T. and M. V. A.) have in their contributions of 1895 'Exploration of the Frankincense Country, Southern Arabia , and looo'Southern Arabia', identified the'hole' of Ghaur Fazl in the wadi Nihaz as Ptolemy's Diana Oraculum, and the khor near Takah as the pool of an ancient port Abyssapolis (of Ptolemy) and possibly identical with the portus Moscha (of the Periplus). They have also suggested that the precipice or Dahaq up the wadiDarbat is Ptolemy's abyss. Here, again, near Takah are also the ruins of an Islamic city, Hnsn Mirahadh, of Mohammad bin Ahmad al Mingowi. On the sketch-map which accompanies this Report (on the Mineral Resources of Dhufar) I have marked the position of several places where there are evidences of earlier buildings or villages or towns in which the mode of living was of a higher standard than that of the people of Dhufar today.

In the Belel El Engris (north of Aden) it is often above 6,000 feet; in the Hadhramaut (behind Makalla) the highlands average 4,500 feet above sea-level; in the Jabal Qara and Samhan (in Dhufar) the land rises above 3,000 feet from the coast; then in the gap (250 miles wide) west of the gulf of Masira the land is barely 600 feet above sea-level. This low-lying tract of Oman trends north-west and appears to be physically a continuation of the trough in which lies the Persian Gulf of today. South of Muscat and trending north-west to south-east are the mountains of Oman (the Western and Eastern Hajar) with heights often above 6,000 feet and peaks to over 9,000 feet. Indeed it would seem that, physically, the main part of Arabia belongs to the African continent (Abyssinia or Ethiopia and Somaliland) while the mountains of Oman are part of the Iran or Persian and Baluchistan side of Asia. Somaliland acts as a barrier to moisture-laden winds to south-western Arabia and so it is that only the highlands of this region secure rain in any seasonal manner whereas the Hadhramaut as a whole has a small rainfall, diminishing eastwards to practically nil. The mountains of Oman receive the south-west (wet) monsoon and secure rain from these winds in July to September, and they also secure some rain during the north-east monsoon in January, and as a result the slopes of the Jabal Hajar are forest-clad (whereas the highlands of the Yemen are largely wood land slopes). And the highlands of Dhufar are also covered by woodland and forest in spite of the fact that they are half-way between Muscat and Aden on the coast of southern area and on the borders of the desert tract which comes to the sea at the gulf of Masira. The explanation of this evidence of rainfall and reasonable climate is that the Jabal Qara and Samhan of Dhufar are within the edge of the moisture-laden winds of the south-west mosoon. The accompanying chart shows that these winds traverse no area of land as they blow northwards along the Somaliland coast, and therefore arrive over Dhufar saturated with moisture. The highlands of Dhufar, averaging 3,000 to 3,500 feet, function in the same manner as the Western Ghats of Malabar and secure from 25 to 30 inches of rain in a strictly local manner. To the north eastwards these moisture-laden winds from the south and south-west pass over the low desert region without precipitating their moisture until they encounter the mountains of Oman. The north-east monsoon supplies a little rain to Dhufar, but the climate of this province of the Sultanate of Oman, and its abundant water- supply, is almost wholly due to the south-west monsoon. If Somaliland extended further eastward, Dhufar would be as hopeless a desert as the A1 Rimal to the north, and if the Somaliland barrier was removed, the whole of south-western Arabia would enjoy the climate of Dhufar, while Dhufar would probably have an even more temperate climate than it has.77 Note on Sea-water and Brine In any problem relating to the manufacture of Soda Ash (Sodium carbonate) there are three chief raw materials concerned—high grade limestone and coke for the production of Carbon dioxide and very cheap common salt (Sodium chloride). In the Indian Soda Ash works (in the Punjab district of Jhelum, in Dhrangadra State and in Okhamandal of Baroda State) there are three different sources of salt— rock salt in the Jhelum district, brine from the Runn of Cutch and sea-water at Mithapur in Okhamandal. At Mithapur the works are on the coast, and this will be the model to follow if Soda Ash is prepared in Dhufar near Salalah (see para graphs 94 and 95 of the Report). Owing to lack of data I am not able to discuss in detail the subject of the evaporation of sea-water at Kharain on the northern shore of Risut bay. , . It is evaporation by the sun's heat and a fair dry wind that is the most important factor in the preparation of cheap salt from sea-water. The factors which influence the rate of evaporation are; (i) the temperature of the air; (ii) velocity and pressure and direction of the wind; (iii) the moisture in the air; (iv) the cloudiness of the skies; and (v) the rainy days and rainfall. The effect of rainy days is partly included under cloudy skies, but the chief effect of the rainfall will be in its diluting effects both of the sea brine in the salt pans as well as that of fresh flood waters entering the sea and reducing its salinity for a time. This effect is well seen in the case of the Dead Sea where the salts in solution may vary from 278% (where the Jordan flows into it) and 27-81% (at its southern end). _ The common average of the salts in solution in sea-water is about 3-5%, but this may vary from less than half that (1 *76% in the Black Sea which is fed by the Danube the Dnieper and the overflow from the sea of Azov) to half as much again (4-53% 'in the case of the Red Sea). Although most of the salt material in solution in sea-water is Sodium chloride (273% out of 3-5% in the case of average sea-water or nearly 78% of Sodium chloride in the total dissolved salts) the proportion varies. In the case of the sea-water off the Kathiawar coast the amount of Sodium chloride is 2-68% as against 3-50 of total salts present (or only 76-5% of Sodium chloride in the total salts present). In the case of the Red Sea the amount of Sodium chloride is 3-03% out of 4-53% salts or 66-88%. _ , , , Details of the composition of sea-water in parts per 100 are given below tor A (average sea-water) and B (Bombay sea-water, presumabl} an a\ erage also).

The brine is unsaturated until it contains 17% of salts (at about 15 degrees Centigrade), but between 17 degrees Beaume and 25 degrees Beaume it is saturated so far as Calcium sulphate is concerned, and the brine is in a meta- stable state. Between 25 and 29-5 degrees Beaume the brine is in a labile state as far as Sodium chloride is concerned, and with higher concentration, up to 38-5 degrees Beaume, this salt separates. As the sea-water in the salterns concentrates to brine by evaporation, so differences in the solubility of the dissolved salts become effective. At an early stage, 11 degrees Beaume, the Calcium carbonate precipitates. Next, between 17 and 25 degrees Beaume, the Calcium sulphate (as Gypsum) separates out. The Sodium chloride reaches its unstable saturation between 25 and 30 degrees Beaume during which this salt crystallizes. Experience shows that the evaporation of sea-water is, in its less concentrated state, quicker than fresh water when exposed to the sun and wind in open sheets of water. It is thought that in suitable weather this evaporation may be one inch in three days. On the shores of Risut bay the evaporation would probably average 2*75 feet between October and March, 3-25 feet from April to June and 0-5 feet from July to September (7-5 feet total). Salt (Sodium chloride) is prepared at Kharain during January to June in small quantities, and there is little doubt that, if the necessary care was exercised, larger quantities of superior quality may be prepared on the northern shore of Risut bay. If the quantity of good quality salt was sufficient, it should be possible to manu facture Soda Ash (Sodium carbonate) and other chemicals near Salalah. It is, how ever, not possible to estimate the quantities and cost of manufacture of the salt without fuller data on the cloudy and rainy days on the one hand and the effect of rain and flood water in diluting the sea-water of Risut bay on the other. The impounding of the flood water in the wadi Nagar Ghaiz has been considered from a water-supply point of view, and this would reduce the dilution of the sea-water in Risut while at the same time providing fresh water. It is not to be presumed that Dhufar is the most suitable coast in the Sultanate of Oman for the manufacture of salt. A typical site would appear to be along the coast of the gulf of Masira half-way between Salalah and Muscat. The salt plain of Bar al Hikman, on the mainland opposite Masira island between Ghubat Hashish and the Masira channel, would appear to be more satisfactory. There is likely to be less cloudiness and little alteration of the sea-water during the south-west monsoon rains. It is one of the most desolate-looking regions on the coast of Oman and, for this reason, prove unattractive for the site of a large chemical works. Should limestone and sufficient fresh water be procurable in the vicinity, Bar al Hikman might be the best place for preparing Soda Ash as it is certainly a better place for making salt although 400 miles from Salalah.At the express desire of the Sultan the words HIS HIGHNESS are to be sub- stituted by the words THE SULTAN (see pages iii and iv, also paragraphs 3, 31, 47, 55, 80, 105 and in).
