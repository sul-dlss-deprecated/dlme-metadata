D Oc* Balirain, the Hth October 1925. nir . of todays date , Please refer to my D.O. No.85/9/9 reporting my conversation with kajor Holmes on the subject of water in Bahrain. During Mr. Madgewick's sta:' here in connection with the Artesian wells, I had little doubt that he was taking ever^' opportunity of looking over the islands with a view to advising the Syndicate oti the subject of oil. My suspic- -ions were confirmed when Major Holmes stated today that if he got the concession, he would hand over the whole of the geological side of it to Mr. kadgewick! I was interest ed at once to find out whether or not Mr. .uadgewick had discovered any definite indication of the presence of oil in the islands, kajor Holmes however alluded to the conces- -sion as'pure wild-catting', but stated that the Syndicate were prepared to lose as mach as £40,000 before giving up. I gathered also that owing to the difficulties they are encountering in connection with the jhasa concession, the Syndicate hope to obtain some indication of the geological conditions prevailing in that area by boring in Bahrain. My impression is therefore that ^ajor Holmes has no definite prospect of finding oil in Bkarain. He is however ooviously keen on getting the concession, which would doubtless be a feather in his own cap in view of the struggle he has had in obt^ianing a backing from the Colonial Office. He is now onl^ awaiting your permission to interview Sheikh Hamad on the subject. I would be grateful if you will kindly wire me this permission, if you see no objection, when I will arrange an interview with the Sheikh , at which I propose to be present myself. L^eut. Colonel F.B .Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.ii., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*11. In this connectiQn there have occurred to me one or two considerations wMch I 'beg leave to put 'before you. I presume that though instructed 'by the Colonial Office to raise no objection on the partja of H.M.Government to the conclmsion of an oil concession on the lines of the draft agreement, there would be nothing to prevent my pointing out clearly to the Sheikh the consequences which sire likely to result from the grant of such a concession, and to advise him purely from a Bahrain point of view. Since I heard that Major Holmes was coming here definite- -ly to conclmde an oil concession, I have had some misgiv- -ings as to the effect that such a concession would have on the welfare of Bahrain generally. At present the life of the whole community is centred in the pearling industry, which brings in either directly or indirectly a very comfortable revenue to the State. This industry is however in the course of reorganisation, and will require ^ery careful handling for the next year or two before it is established on a stable footing. Is it wise at this atage to introduce into Bahrain a new industry such as oil, which if found in commercial quantities is likely to rival ana even eclipse the pearling industry, particularly if the latter is not fully organised? Is there' not the danger of Bahrain and also foreign divers giving up their old calling and engaging themselves in the more lucrative and less.toilsome work of employees in a flourishing oil concern? Is this not iikely to be the'last straw' for Bahrain nakhudas already disgruntlei by the few reforms now introduced in the pearling industry? And finally, is there not the danger of diving nakhudas,and possibly 'Tajurs' too leaving Bahrain and forming a new centre of the pearling industry in Debai or elsewhere? - and then,one can imagine the oil peteringa out and leaving Bahrain a - a sucked orange.! I apologise for the above picture which is painted in very black colours . j no ^ think things are likely to beIII. ,v , ■ as bad as that, 'but I cannot help thinking that the grant of an oil concession Just now might 'be the cause of much trouble during the diving season, which the State can well afford to avoid. It has occurred to me that the present would be a very opportune moment for you to visit Bahrain, as the Resident ha$ not been here all the summer. The Sheikh himself would I am sure be very grateful for your personal advice on several matters, and you would alsb have an opportunity of meeting Major Holmes. If you approve of thisa suggestion, I wouflid ask you kindly to inform me by wire, as. Major Eolmes is anxious to know how the land lies in regard to his concession. If you are unable to come, I hope you will be good enough to give me the early benefit of your advice on the line I should take with the Sheikh on the matter of the oil concession.

With regard to the question raised in the last paragraph of your letter under reply, I am to say that Mr. Amery has no objection mutatis mutandis to the conclusion by your Syndicate of an agreement in similar terms with the Sheikh of Koweit, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is being instructed accordingly. It has beer brought to Mr. Amery's notice that in the draft mining lease enclosed in Colonial Office letter of the 28th ultimo (38049) and agreed by you in your letter under reply, paragraph 2 of Article IV provides for a privilege of customs exemtion of indefinite duration.

Political Agent, Bahrain Resident, Bushire. © * \ PRIVATE MD MOST CONFIDSHTIAL . I had a straight talk with Shaikh today- regarding oil concession. He assured me that his sole reason for favouring Holmes was his desire not to incur the displeasure of his father by dishonouring former concession which both had signed. He said no one had informed him that His Majesty's Government had at any time disapproved of Syndicate. He had no objection to Anglo-Persian Oil Company and had only been approached by them once through Mackie, to whom he had disclosed his reasons for wanting Holmes, and who had appeared to accept them as satisfactory. I feel sure that the above is a true explanatiol of Hamad's attitude, in which he still persists owing to a growing desire to ^appease his father. But I cannot believe that the Shaikh would not have accepted the advice of His Majesty's Government even at the cost of displeasing his father which he has already done a hundred times over. For the present, in view of His Majesty's Government's approval of the Syndicate and Holmes' presence here, it seems impossible to divert the Shaikh's sympathies in the direction of the Anglo Persian Oil Company. Opinion in Bahrain is decidedly in favour of immediate oil concession. MALUM. mi i-86/2. Telegram R. From Resident, Bushire. To Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. Ho♦ 24. Dated 31st October 1925. 19. f V Bahrain oil concession Your despatch No. In an interview with Shaikh Hamad I have told him that Eis Majesty's Government have withdrawn objection to his concluding agreement with Syndicate and have passed draft recently submitted in London. In course of conversation I learnt that Hamad is inclined to settle with Syndicate for following reasons (l) concession of two years ago was signed not only by Shaikh Esa but by himself. (ii) this concession was recommended to them by Ibn Saudj for whom Hamad feels great reverence, when they visited Sultan in Hasa. (iii) people are afraid of political element in Anglo Persian Oil Company. It is evident that Syndicated agents have continuously harped on Shaikh*s moral ±± liability to honour his signature in spite of Governments denunciation of transaction. I hear that Madgwick did a good deal of Exploring' when he supervised boring for water last summer, so that Syndicate can proceed to second stage (prospecting license) almost immediately. I may add that the exclusion of the Syndicate from open negotiations between last winter and April last v/as nullified by their action in allowing geologists to travel between Hajd and Iraq through Bahrain and by their telling the Shaikh that negotiations would be reopened in April. IfIf His Majesty f s Government consider that these facts warrant their instructing me to oppose the signing of concession, I might (i) press Shaikh to refuse further consideration of the question for say ten years as a sign of his real contrition for breach of treaty engagement, (ii) point out that while the result of negotiations hetwee-n His Majesty^ Government and Ihn Saud is uncertain, he cannot he certain of pleasing His Majesty's Government 'by following the Sultan's lead, (iii) that there is a possibility even of the Syndicate quarrelling with Ihn Saud. (iv) that now that it is proved that good water can be tapped all over the northern half of his State, the development of agriculture is his chief interest and the admission of an oil company will interfere both with this and the pearling industries.

I went over to Bahrain on the 21st with Mackay and returned to Bushire on the 27th. The report that Holmes gave out that the Colonial Office had confirmed Shaikh Isa's agreement is rather absurd. «hat Holmes did say to Shaikh Hamad ( as the latter told me ) was that the Colonial Office had passed a draft of a concession which they allow Holmes to negotiate with the Shaikh. The Arabic translation of this draft was being prepared in Baghdad and was expected to reach Bahrain in a few days* time. ■lie Colonial Office have told me that provided the terms of concessions from Bahrain and Kuwait follow the terms of the draft agreement, of which they enclose a copy, no object- •ion need be raised on the part of His Majesty^ Government. I note what you write about Hadgwick. It is evident that Daly was grossly misled. Sinoe returning from Bahrain I have telegrpphed to the Colonial Office suggesting grounds on which the agreement may be held up indefinitely. If they dissent, there is nothing more to be done» There is no doubt that Hamad wishes to give the con- -cession to Holmes, partly to please hs father and quite as much to please Ibn Saud» who recommended it to him in 1923 at Hofuf.

Major Holmes sent me an apologetic reply,, and this is how matters stand, except that I have now received from you the necessary intimation from the Colonial Office under Residency endorsement No.393-S, dated the 23rd October 1925. I have not informed^ Major Holmes of this, as I wished first to get your definite permission for him to carry on the negotiations, and, as this seems now the certain result, for Sheikh Hamad to si^n the concession. \ ' After his success with the water. Major Holmes is v very popular locally, and Sheikh Hamad would I think have popular opinion behind him, if he gave him the oil concess- -ion. The Hon'ble Lieut. Colonel.

Xtd the holder of the Bahrein Oil Concession dated 2nd Dec 1925 I wish to apply for one year's extension of the Exploration License Granted therein. The reason that the Syndicate request this extension is to permit of additional time for the purpose of revising the delimitations, tentatively made last year, of the three areas over which, eventually, a Mining License is to be granted in accordance with the terms of the Concession Agreement; as the Syndicate's Technical men do not agree that the tentative delimits enclose the most promising Areas. The Engineers and Geologists who, in addition to other work, are to revise the delimitations of the above- mentioned areas are due to arrive here at any moment, I remain.

YII of the Pirst Schedule to the Agreement that the SjmjiinjLte can claim an extension only if they are prevented from carrying out the wor^ of exploration by causes beyond their control, otherwise there would be no point in inserting that article. The reason the Syndicate nave given is merely tnat their technical men are not agreed upon the most promising areas for the mining license. It is quite j^ossible that the Syndicate merely want to continue to keep out their rivals the A.P.O.C. without going to the trouble of taking out a prospecting license under the Agreement.

Bahrein,23rd April 1928, To H.B.M's Political ^.gent, Bahrein, Sir, I hereby apply for and 'behalf of the Eastern &amp; Gene ral Syndicate Ltd for permission to negotiate an Oil Con cession covering the regaining portion of the whole of the Bahrein group of Islands not alienated under the Bahrein Concession Agreement of 2-12-1925 and their Territorial Waters, The area for which permission to negotiate for is requested is that portion of the Bahrein ibtxK Islands and its Territorial Waters which is not included in the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement by which 100,000 acres of the Bahrein Islands was granted to the Eastern &amp; Gene ral Syndicate Ltd by H.il.Sheikh Hamad bigi Isa Al Khalifa Governor of Bahrein on December 2nd 1925. The total area of the Bahrein Islands includ ing its Territorial Waters is roughly 198,000 acres aprox- imately 309 square miles. The area granted under the Bahrein Oil 'Conces sion Agreement is 156 square miles. Therefore this re quest is for permission to negotiate for the balance of the total area including Territorial Waters which is 153 * Square miles equalling 97,920 square miles. The terms upon which this area is requested are exactly the same as those laid down in the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement of December 2nd 1925. Further permission is also requested that the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Ltd be allowed to negotiate with H.ii. Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa for permission to develop the deep waters of Khor Kayila lying to the southr south of Muharraq and east of Halat-an-Eannas and Has al Jasra (Essex ^oint) and the sea and land approaches there to as a safe harbour for the ships engaged for transport ing the Oil and its products won from the Bahrein Islands. Sole rights to the use of the harbour of IQior Kayila are not asked but preferential rights, use and facilities for developing these waters and approaches thereto and prefer ential rights to the use of the developed harbour and full control over all piers, causeways, docks etc erected by the- Concession holders to develop and nake the harbour safe fo^ ships to enter, load and depart therefrom. If permission be granted to negotiate the writer ^who holds a full power of attorney from the iSastern General Syndicate Ltd) will be pleased to submit a draft Concession Agreement for your approval.

Wemy i C\ / V Bahrei n 5th, May 1928. To # His B. Maji* s Political Agent, BAHREIN , Sir, I have to acknowledge and thank you dtor your letter Ho.0/149 of 1928 dated 3rd May 1920. I am pleased to note that H.E.Sheikh Hamad is prepare to consider negotiations for further concessions for which I thank him, I am enclosing herewith, three copies of a draft Con cession Agreement drawn up, except for a few alterations required { to describe the area now applied for, and a small addition in Clause I. Schedule III (Mining Lease) referring to harbour rights, upon exactly the same terms and conditions as specified in the Bahrein Oil Concession dated 2nd December 1925. You will note that the area now requested has an area of approximately 97,9^0 square acres. The harbour,the Company will require to develop in order to facilitate the handling of the Oil won from the area hereby applied for and from the area of our present concession, must have deep water and Khor-Kaliya and adjacent waters is the only one fulfilling this condition. There is one area,however, it is not agricultural land, which my Company would prefer not to see alienated from G-overnment hands at this moment. This area in greater part li,es within the Territory covered by the present Bahrein Oil,Concession The above mentioned area lies S.E, from Sheikh Al^s Bridge (Sakhir Road) a distance of 4 miles along the coast and two miles wide inland from high water mark, no part of the area lies N. of Sheikh Ali's Bridge, so does not interfere with date gardens. It extends South to a point opposit the Southernmost point of Sitra Island. This is almost entirely rocky land except -2- P. T. 0.1 —Tl, continued m o m for a f©w yardp from the aoaet line t there are a few dates palms at the Sitra end &gt; but they will not interfere with works necessary to develop the entrance and the harbour. This area is required upon which to build tanks, refinery aM puraplng plants and make Jetties and wharves etc., to connect with the deep water of Khor-Kaliya. Any other unoccupied land can be passed over quite readily without damaging the agricultural efforts to any appre- clable extent, if at all. In regard to the Agricultural project mentioned in your letter,as now being considered,that is the leasing out of unoccupied lands I do not think that this will interfere with the Company's operations, if we should find it necessary, to run pipe-lines^ tramlines or roads over any portion of such lands it will not effect the leaseholder except to a small extent owin^ to the small area occupied. The copies of the draft Concession are for use as follows # should others be required they can be sent to you:- No. i. To the Hon. The Political Resident,Persian Gulf. No. P.

I/ -V7/ 2# - •-&gt;' } y V Confidential. /4 \ DOWNIK&amp;.STREET, 1 9 June,1928 Sir, THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF, BUSHIRE. I have the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch No.13 of the 2nd April enclosing a copy of a supplementary agreement between the Shaikh of Bahrain and Major Frank Holmes,granting to the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited,an extension by one year of the period of the Exploration License held by the Syndicate ?/ith regard to oil, £♦ I assume that by the expression 'future agreements'in the second paragraph of your despatch you refer to agreements relating to any subsequent extension of the period of the Exploration License held by the Syndicate. I agree generally with your proposal that future agreements of this nature should contain a clause to the effecithat no alienation of rights thereunder can be made except with the sanction of the Shaikh and the approval of His Majesty 1 s Government but it may be difficult to compel the Shaikh to insist on such an .■ amendment since it would 'be tantamount to an amendment c of one of the instruments comprising the concession. It % / '■ is true that the Shaikh is debarred by his undertakings to His Majesty 1 sGovernment from granting any concession except to a person or persons approved by His Majesty 1 s GrOvernment,but His Majesty's Government have in fact already JA'ZElT-2^~ \ already approved the grant of a concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate,and have approved the terms of that concession. Possibly,however,no difficulty on the part of the Shaikh need be anticipated. 3. The following draft clause has been drawn up to insure that an enterprise of this character shall remain in British hands:- 'The Company shall at all times be and remain a British Company registered in G-reat Britain or a British Colony,and having its principal place of business within His Majesty 1 s dominions,the Chairman and Managing Director (if any),and a majority of the other Directors of which shall at all times be British subjects,and neither the Company nor the premises,liberties,powers and privileges hereby granted and demised,nor any land occupied for any of the purchases of this lease,shall at any time be or become directly or indirectly controlled or managed by a foreigner or foreigners or any foreign corporation or corporations, and the local Greneral Manager of the Company,and as large a percentage of the local staff employed by them as circumstances may permit, shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sultan. In this clause the expression 'foreigner' means any person who is neither a British subject nor a subject of the Sultan,and the expression 'foreign corporation' means any corporation other than a corporation established under and subject to the laws of some part of His Majesty 1 s dominions and having its principal place of business in those dominions'. I IkI suggest that the Shaikh should be advised to endeavour to secure in any future agreement the insertion of a clause in these terms,and,failing the acceptance by the Syndicate of such a proposal,to insist TOon the insertion of a clause in the terms of Article XIII of the Mining Lease included in the concession. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant,X o ■V^ r Ho. C- / ^ ^ of 1928. Political Agency, Balirain, 1 - ' The 5tli July 1928. ' / ?, S'rom To r ■ M b,j or C • C • j • San^cfct ; G»S«I»^ o»i *2 • ^ Political Agent, Bahrain. The Secretary to the Hon. the Political Residant in the Persian Gulf, Busiiire, V^p-i ^ Qfe Sir, I have the honour to inform yon that Major Prank Holmes, local representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate has applied for an exploring prospect- -ing and mining concession for the area of the Bahrain island not covered 'by the agreement signed 'by him and His Excellency Sheikh Mamad on 2nd uecember 19£5. I enclose three copies of an agreement for these concessions, which has 'been drafted 'by Major L.olmes , The Bahrain Government, whom I have uonsult^- -cd are prepared to grant a further concession only if the company will accept certain modifications proposed, which are incorporated in the alternative draft which 1 have marked B. The alterations are underlined in red ii^. The main point of difference is that the State demands an increased rental for their leases. The rental now demanded can he seen from reference to the Articles of the Agreement. In lieu of Rs 10,000 payable under Article VI a sum of Rs 20,000 annually is now asked for the exploration license while the annual pay- -*ment for the prospecting license has been raised from Rs 10,000 \ ii I | II I—— n \ ■ Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000. it is made clear that reckoning is 'be made 'by the English and not the Arabics -year, In the case of the mining leased reference is requested to Article III of the Third Schedule, The Bahrain Government require the Company to pay them Rs 20,000 annually in lieu of the Rs 10,000 suggested 'bj^ Majot Holmes. The sums of Rs 30,000 mentioned in ArticleVJ of the Third Schedule are accordingly raised to Rs 70,000. 3, Major Holmes considered himself unable to accept these increased payments on behalf of his Company whereas the Bahrain State Adviser considers that, in the altered circumstances, since the first agreement was signed, the sums now demanded err if at all on the side of generosity to the Company. The Company has now had the advantage of 2^ years exploration, hence they are not taking the same risk as formerly. Their explorations have apparent -ly convinced them that oil is to be found in the islands, and that it is worth their while to take over areas not already covered by their original agreement. Such being the case the State considers that they should be prepared to pay the extra price demanded. If the Company do not wish to pay, the State authorities are quite satisfied with the original agreement and do not desire to sign a new one. 4 # The other points of difference are of minor importance. Major Eolmes had agreed to meet the Bahrain Government's wishes, but subsequently for what appear to be tactical reasons withdrew his consent # and re-submitted his original proposals, on hearing that the Bahrain State pressed their demand for the increase^ preliminary payments. I will take the Bahrain State's modifica- -tions seriatim. Article to ^ 1: (S) Article VI.- This lias already 'been discussed aToove. S'irst Schedule. I # - The Sheikh cannot give the Company the right to enter private property. He recognizes their right to acquire private property by agreement with its owner and safeguards them ©.gainst a ring to put up prices. II. - It is made clear that the use of water for domestic purposes only is granted. This clause as originally drafted might he interpreted in such a way that v/ater essential for date gardens would be diverted to other purposes. III. » There is practically no fuel in Bahrain. The right to use such as is lying on waste lands only is granted. V. - There is a public pier at Bahrainlt v/hich goods iU are usually landed. The right of supplying porters is farmed out to a contractor. The State's wording of this article is intended to guard against the•Bahrain State being put to actual loss owing to the porterage of the Company's material. In the same way The State asks to be guarded against the choking of their warehouses by Company's goods left indefinitely in their charge. If the Company makes a private pier and ware- -house in their concession no charge would be made for goods landed therein. VI. - The word 'reasenable' does not require explana tion. Second Schedule. I,III &gt; IV J VI and VII. - These have already been explain- -ed under First Schedule. Third Schedule. I, - The addition of the words ,, saving and with dvP 'S respect■jjk i *:• tr—BE / m J: X respect to sacred 'buildings, shrines and grave yards'♦ II, - ' deeded 'by 11 lias 'been changed to 11 11 necessary to ' • III, - The change from Rs 10,000 to Rs Ji0,000 has already been discussed, IV, - 2nd, paragraph. The inclusion of the words 11 Subject to the right of the Sheikh to recover porter- -age charges, and demurrage on goods remaining in his charge for a' period in excess of 10 days on all goods entering Bahrain by way of the existing Customs pier w has already been explained, V, - The reason for the alteration of figures has already been explained, 71, - The words 11 To take all reasonable precau- -tions ' and ' except for reasons beyond his control ,, have been added as the original wording goes too far. The Sheikh canno £ be expected to accept liabilities, such as no civilized State would acceptor the recovery of stolen property. He maintains a police force v/hich with the help of the ,, trustworthy guards 11 will do all that they can to safeguard the Company^ property and nothing more can be expected, 5, I submit for the iniSormation of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf a copy of a letter dated 15th June IQSSaddressed.to me by Major Holmes before his departure from Bahrain. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrein, cp*r Enclosures 1, Letter d/l5th June 1928 from Major F.Eolmes to the Pol.

June 19&lt;:8,« To Political Agent, Bahrein « ( Persian Gulf ) Sir, I am in receipt of your letter Ho* C/183 of 1928 dated June 1-928, and with which was enclosed an ' amended n copy of the Draft Agreement of the further Bahrein Concession applied for 'by me on 'behalf of my Company. Until I received this letter on the 14th June I was under the impression that, at the conference of June the 4th, with you and the Bahrein State Adviser, we finally agreed the concession terms in accordance with the revised draft sent to you on June the 5th, I was not % aware, nor was I told either at the conference or otherwise until your letter No. C/183 of 1928, that the Draft Agreement we agreed upon was to he amended later by the State Adviser« There is such a marked difference of opinion as to the terms of the further concession between the Sts.te Adviser and myself, that I see no chance of us reach- -ing an Agreement, owing principally to the enormous- -ly increased payments demanded. At the Conference on June the 4th, I agreed to certain alterations in the text of the Draft Agreement submitted to you on May the 5th 1928, under the impress- -ion that we were settling a final Draft to be submitted to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, but without the knowledge that it was to be ' amended 11 later. Therefore, in view of the misapprehension on my part, I withdraw my consent to the alterations made in the Draft Agreement submitted on May the 5th, and which was discussed at our conference of June the 4th, such Draft being practically an exact copy of the First Bahrein Concession Agreement sanctioned by the ColonialColonial Office. Unfortunately, begore receiving jpour letter I had already infojiried my Company Toy cable that the Draft Concession Agreement had 'been agreed at a conference on June the 4th« Therefore, under the altered circumstances, and in order to enable my Directors to 'be free to deal with this application as they did with the existing Bahrein Concession Agreement, that is with the Colonial Office, I 'beg to submit for the consideration of the Eon 1 ble the Political Resident, the Draft Concession Agreement for the further concession as submitted on May the 5th 1928, without alteration or amendment. The State Adviser would then be at liberty to submit his suggestions and reasons therefor, for transmission to the Hon , ble the Political Hesident. I enclose 5 copies of the Draft Agreement as asked for in your letter Ho* C/185 of 1928. When the Colonial Office is in receipt of the Hon*ble the Political Resident's comments and proposals on the Draft Agreement, it would be greatly appreciated if the Secretary of t3ie Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Ltd; at 19, St. Swithin's l£tne London, E.C.4 could be informed by the Colonial Office, of that fact in order that the Directors may get in touch with the Colonial Office and g agree terms mutually accex-)table to the Colonial Office, the Bahrein Government and my Company, If you will kindly submit this letter and the enclosed Draft Concession Agreement to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I shall mueh obliged. I remain.

ENCLOSURE TO DESPATCH No. Co^f-OP 14 NOV 1928 n DOWm'G STREET, (£ November, 1926 1/ v.? ^ v A 4 bir, I am directed 'by Mr, Secretary'Amery to refer / to Colonial Office letter Ho.59115/28 of the 10th of September last, and to previous correspondence regarding the concession granted 'by the Shaikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General ..Syndicate Limited and to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for Board of Trade India , a copy of a letter which, has 'been receiver; from the Syndicate regarding their desire to obtain the renewal for a further period of one year from the 2nd of Decem'ber next of their existing exploration licence. 2. In this connection I am to state that Major Holmes and Mr* Jans on, one of the directors of the East ern and General Syndicate, called at the Colonial Office on the 17th oi OG;to'her in regard to the extension for which they have supplied and explained that, the first Geologist whom the Syndicate had sent out to Bahrein had reported unfavGrura*hly as to the prospects of winning oil in commercially payable quantities. Since then 4 other Geologists had 'been sent out and their reports, although conflicting, were, for themost part, very favourable. The Syndicate now wished to send out again the original Geologist in order to give him an opportunity of reconsidering his unfavourable report. They were satisfied that in view of the Geological information now available he would, if sent out again, report favourably. 3, The representatives of the Syndicate also stated that they were at present negotiating with American and Canadian THE UKDER SECRETARY OF STATE , 113)1 A OFFICE. THE PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT , BOARD OF TRADE.Canadian interests with a view to finding sufficient capital to finance prospecting operations in Bahrein (if the final geological reports proved favourable) ^ and ultimate commercial developaaent. In this they were hampered 'hy an agreement concluded 'between the various V ' interests participating in the Turkish Petroleum v/hich debarred any one constituent group from taking up a concession within an area so defined so as to include Bahrein, Hasa etc., without previously offering that concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company as a whole. The American group with whom, the Syhdicate were negotiating in regard to participation in Bahrein was a member of the Turkish Petroleum Company and consequently could not act independently of that Company^ It was t herefore possible that the latter Company might in fact acq ired an interest in the Bahrein concession. On fteing asked whether it was anticipated, if the present negotiations with the American group were successful, the preponderance of capital would be A blerican , Mr.«];.mson said that such would be the case# His own Syndicate had already expended some £60 ,000 on exploratory v/ork in Bahrein and could not themselves find tne money to finance prospecting end development. They had tried to obtain English capital for the purpose ^ut without success and they had now to look to America. Mr. Oianson admitted that, if the capital were preponderantly American, the real control would.also pass into American hands, but that the Eastern and General Syndicate would presumably be kept alive in some form as the nominal concessionaires. \ no ^ conceal the fact, however, that the British Company would be the merest facade behind v/hich the American group would pull the strings, and that, the concession would probably pass either into the virtual control of the Turkish Petroleum Company or into that of an American group of that Company. Mr. Janson was reminded that under the terms ofof the ninigg lease the concession could not '^e conveyed to a third party without the consent of the Shaikfe acting under the advice of the Resident in the Perisan Gulf and that His Majesty's Government had ^een assured when the grant of the concession to the Syndicate was* first '^eing discussed that control would 'he and would remain entirely British, Mr. Jan son did not deny this 'hut he said that in practice and in view of the earlier unfavourable geological reports it had proved wholly impossible to raise the necessary capital in tiis country. Mr. Janson added that before his negotiations with the American group went further he would communicate his financial proposals to His Majesty f s Government officially and invite their concurrence. 4. This latter communication has not yet ^ een received from the Syndicate presumably vecause they are still hopeful of obtaining British capital. l£r. Amery proposes, however, subject to the concurrence of the Secre ta ry of State for India to inform the Syndicate B'Oar'd of Trade that if they are prepared t give an undertaking similar in form to the draft clause referred to in Colonial Office letter Ko.59191/28 of today f s date, on the subject of an oil concession in Kerwait , that the Company shall at all times 'be and remain a British Company and to em'bddy that undertaking in any Agreement which they may conclude with the Shaikh of Bahrein for the renew al of their exploration licence, His Majesty's Government will he prepared to recommend the Shaikh to grant the renewal for the further year which the Syndicate desire. 5. As the existing exploration licence will expire on the 2nd of December next Mr. Amery would 'be glad to he in formed as soon as possible whether the Secretary Board of of Sta t e for India concur s in the course of action Trade concur proposed. 6.

The right of his Majesty's Government to impose certain restrictions has not 'been CLuestioned hy the Americans or the SydoLicate. The Americans insist however that as they provide the capital they must have dominating share in the control. After considerahle discussion 'between Colonial Office, Eastern and General Syndicate and (indirectly) Americans Interests, Colonial Office now propose, after exploration of utmost limits to which Americans are prepared to go, to inform the Syndicate that H|s Majesty*s Government would he prepared to advise Sheikh further to extend the period of the exploration license and to agree to assignment hy a formal agreement of the Syndicated rights under the concession of Deeemher 192^bo the J^merican^f interests on the following ©onditions. These conditions represent their last word and will not he subject to modification. Upon any breach of them the concession will he subject to cancellation. (A) Company formed to take over concession from Syndicate to be and remain a British Company registered in Canada but to maintain a registered office in Great Britain which shall at all times be in charge of a British subject, who shall be the recongnised channel of communication in the United Kingdom between the Company and His Majesty's Government.•X (2) (B) Of the five Directors of tlie Company, one at all times to 'be a British subject wlio shall he nominated hy G-overnment, and whose salary as Director the Company shall provide► (C) Company at all times to maintain in Bahrain an official to he called tt Chief Local Ilepresentative ,, of the Company, whose appointment shall he approved hy His Majesty^s G-overnment and who shall he the Company's sole representative empowered to deal direct with the local authorities and the population of Bahrain^ All communications which he may desire, on hehalf of the Company, to address to the Sheikh, shall he sent through the Political Agents Tor the first years after Company starts, or such lesser period as they may continue to operate in Bahrain, Major Holmes shall he the Chief Local Eepresentative» (D) As many of employees of the Company in Bahrain as is consistent with efficient carrying on of undertaking at all times to he British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain- (E) The Company to give a guarantee that no steps will he taken to prejudice position of proposed sites for landing ground and seaplane station in Bahrein. As you know, I view with apprehension the intrusion of American oil interests into Bahrain, hut the position has already heen compromised hy the ehsence of a British controlling clause from the agreement of 1925 and the conditions in question, if we can secure them, are prohahly the 'best we can hope for. If accepted and fully implemented the Company they should give us a degree of control. It is also of course, always possible that on closer investigation hy the Company, the oil prospects may prove insufficient to justify their continued interest . The Chief Local Representative would he a separate appointment from that of Local Manager in?- ( 3 ) in &amp; ^ charge of teohniQal operatioas, wtiiali the American Oompany who apparently have a low opinion of the managerial ability of British snhjeots, desire to keep in their own hands» As regards the nomination of Holmes for the appointment of Chief Local Hepresentative, I understanii that he has 'been accommodating in the ^ ^i negotiations with Colonial Office. Moreover the Americans are likely to make very great difficulty ahout a British nominee of whom they have no personal experience. There is prohahly some advantage in having someone whose measure we have taken, like Holmes. Syndicate has 'been promised very early - reply hy Colonial Office^ I shall he glad if you and Political Sesident will cahle your views with the least possible delay.

As/result of the discussion then held, a letter was prepared and was on the point of despatch to the Syndicate, setting out the conditions on which His Majesty's Government wtre prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to agree to the extension of the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate and to the Assignment of their Concession of the 2nd December, 1925. A copy of the letter in the form in which it was proposed to address it to the Syndicate is enclosed. Before the letter could be despatched, however, Mr. Janson of the Eastern and General Syndicate telephoned to the Colonial Office, asking that the letter should be held up pending further discussion between representatives of his Syndicate and the Colonial Office. He represented that, since the Meeting held on the 19th July, he had had an opportunity of discussing with Major Davis, the representative of the American interests concerned, the conditions which His Majesty's Government sought to Impose upon the participa tion of American capital in the enterprise. He asked, therefore, to be given an opportunity to communicate the views of the American group before any letter on the subject was addressed to his Syndicate. This suggestion was accepted and a further meeting was held at the Colonial Office on the 31st July. A brief record of the Meeting is appended to this letter. It will be seen that the American representatives are at present not prepared to accept, without qualification, any of the conditions proposed by His l ajesty 1 s Government. It became clear in the course of the discuss ion, that the objection felt by the American group to His Majesty's Government centred upon the fourth condition relating to the appointment of a British subject as the Company's local Manager in Bahrein. As will be seen from the record of the discussion, an alternative version of this condition was tentatively suggested by the Colonial Office representatives, and the representatives of the Syndicate undertook to ascertain the views thereon of their American associates, at the same time making it clear that the revised version would not necessarily be considered acceptable by His Majesty's Government. I am to request that Lord Pas^field may be informed at an early date whether Commander Wedgwood Ben is prepared to concur in the fourth condition in the revised form now suggested. The Under Secretary of State INDIA OFFICE. 4.4. Since the second Meeting with the representatives of the Syndicate was held, Mr •Jan son of the Syndicate has informed an Officer of the Colonial Office by telephone, that as a result of a preliminary discussion with Major Davis, he thought it most unlikely that the American ^roup would he prepared to agree that Major Holmes should he designated 'Local General Manager' of the Company, hut that he thought it probable that they would accept sane such title as ' Director', the term. 'General Manager' being reserved for the official in charge of the technical operations. He thought that the remainder of the fourth condition in its revised fom would probable be acceptable to the American group, but the latter might wish to insert some provision making it clear that Major Holmes would have no authority to intervene in the technical operations of the Company. Lord Passfield would be glad to learn whether Commander Wedgwood Ben attaches Importance to the precise designation to be given to the British official of the Company who will be responsible for conducting iiegotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the local popula tion, or whether so long as it is made clear that that official only may have access to the Sheikh and is the responsible representative of the Company for the purpose of all dealings with the Sheikh and his people, the question of his title may, in Commander Wedgwood Benn's opinion, be regarded as a matter of comparative indifference. 5. Copies of this l^ter and enclosures are being sent to the Petroleum Department, the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, and the Board of Trade, I am, etc. J.H.Hall.Cg) Mr. Janson and Major HolmeB af the Eastern and General Syndicate called to see Sir John Shuckburgh on Friday the 19th of July. Ml*.Williams, Mr. Bushe and Mr. Bigg were present during the interview. The representatives ot the Syndicate explained the reasons which had led them to transfer to .American interests the rights which they possessed in virtue of their agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrein. The Syndicate them selves had spent over £50,000 in exploring for oil in Bah rain and their American friende had. it was estimated, SDent a further £15,000 on the same object. The Syndicate had cane to the end of their resources and althoughthey had explored every possible avenue they had b en unable to obtain assistance from British capitalists to enable them to exploit their Concession. They had therefore been forced to obtain assistance Iran American oil interests and in return had transferred to those interests their rights under the Concession granted to them by the Shaikh of Bahrein. In transferring those rights they had made certain stipulations which they had anticipated would be acceptable to His Majesty's Government, to ensure that those rights should be exercised by a British company, and, in fact, the American oil interests concerned had already registered in Canada a Company formed for the express purpose of continuing the operation of the Concession. At no stage during the course of the discussion did the representatives of the Syndicate attempt to dispute the right of His Majesty's Government or the Shaikh of Bahrein to impose conditions upon the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession or upon the transfer to American oil interests of the rights conferred by the Concession, it was therefore unnecessary to make use of the various arguments referred to in the recent correspondence with the other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government, though it is, of course, possible that when the Syndicate came to talk to their American friends about the conditions which His Majesty's Government desire to impose, those American interests will raise the question. 'lien informed of the conditions upon which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to advise the Shaikh of Bahrein to a.^ree to the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession the representatives of the Syndicate were at first doubtful of their ability to induce their American friends to accept those conditions. AXter further discussion, however, the representatives of the Syndicate came round to the view that the conditions proposed were on the whole not unreasonable. Mr. Janson at first considered that, having regard to the fact that the America 1 oil interests concerned had already registered a Company in Canada for the express purpose of the operation of the Concession in Bahrein, they would oppose the suggestion that a Company should be registered in this country. He eventually agreed, however, that the proposal was not unreasonable and undertook to endeavour'to secure its acceptance by his American friends. Both Mr.Janson and Major Holmes considered that it would be difficult, if, indeed, not impossible, to secure thei the assent ot their American Xriends to the suggestion that the local General Manager and the whole of the local staff, with certain exceptions to he agreed upon between the parties, should be at all times British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. American oil magnates had a very low opinion of British directing staff arid we® likely to desire to employ American subjects as their local technical staff. Their American friends attached such importance to the retention in the hands of American engineers of the control of the technical work to be carried out in Bahrein that, although they might be prepared to agree to the appointment, of a British subject as their local General Manager, they were unlikely to agree that more .than a small proportion of their local technical staff should be British subjects. Insistence on the acceptance of the condition proposed might results the refusal of their American friends to participate in the operation of the Concession with the result that the oil resources of Bahrein would not at present be exploited. After some discussion the representatives of the Syndicate agreed that if the condition in question could be amended by the omission of the words the whole of the local staff with certain exceptions to be agreed upon between the parties', and the insertion in lieu/ of the words M as many of the local staff as is Consistent with the efficient carrying out of the undertaking' they would do their utmost to induce their American friends to accept the conditions proposed. Ir John Shuckburgh agreed to the amendment suggested. It was agreed that the Colonial Office should write to the Syndicate setting out the conditions which it was proposed should govern the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession and that the Syndicate would then endeavour to secure the assent of the American oil interests concerned to those conditions and report the result of their negotiations to 'the Colonial Office in due course. Mr. Jans on and Major Holmes were informed that it was ufclikely that His Majesty's Government would be prepared to consent to any further modification of the conditionsa« proposed, to which considerable importance was attached by other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government and it was agreed that if the Syndicate were unable to induce their American friends to accept these conditions the whole question should then be made the subject of further discussion at the Colonial Office. Colonial Office 2Cth July 1929•July 1929. 89035/29. Sir, I em directed by Lord Pasefield to refer to your letter ox the 16th of July and to the discussion with : r. Janson and Major Holmes which took place at the Colonial Office on Friday the 19th Of July, and to inform you that the following are the conditions upon which His I'ajesty's CiOvernment would be prepared to advise the 'haikh of Bahrein to arree to the extension of the exploration licence granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate Llmit«d and to the A .sslgnment of their concession of the 2nd of December 1925;- (a) that the Company to be formed to take over the Concession from the Syndicate should be aid remain a British company registered in Great Britain; (b) that the Chairman and the Managing Director (if any) of that Company should be at all times British sublects: (cj that a proportion of the Directors of that Comoany (less than one-half but not less than one- third), to be agreed upon between the parties, should be at all times British subjects; and (d) that the local Manager in charge of the Company's operation in Bahrein should at all times be a British subject; and that as many of the other employees of the Company in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying out of the uadortaking should be at all times British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrein. 2. If the Syndicate are prepared to accept those conditions, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to advise the Shaikh to extend the period of the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate in virtue of the agreement concluded between the Syndicate and the Shaikh on the 2nd of December, 1925, and to agree to an asslsnment of the Syndicate's rights under that agreement to the new Company. The assignment to be a formal document and to be made expressly subject to the above conditions, and to contain a provision for cancellation of the Concession upon any breach of the conditions. 3. His Majesty's Government attach great importance to the acceptance of those conditions arid it is unlikely that they would be prepared to agree to their ipodification in any way. 4. i am to request that you will inform the Secretary of State in due course whether you are prepared to accept those conditions. 1 am etc. THE SECRETARY EASTERN AND GENERAL SYi.lDCATE, LTD.,Mr. Janson and Major Holmes of the 'bastem and General Syndicate called to see Sir John Shuckburgh on Wednesday, Slst July. Mr. llliaws, Mr. Bushe and Mr. Hall were present at the interview. Sir John Shuckbimih explained that as a result of the discussion held on the 19th July with representatives of the Syndicate, a letter was prepared in the Colonial Office comunieating the conditions up^n which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to agree to the extension of the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate and to the assignment of their Concession. This letter was on the point of being despatched to the Syndicate when Mr. Janson telephoned to ask that the despatch of the letter should be postponed pending a further discussion. It was in accordance with this request that the present Heating had been called* r. Jan son explained that since the Meeting of the 19th July he and Major Holmes had had an opportunity to discuss with Major T)avis t the representative of the American group holding the option on the Syndicate's Concession, the conditions which His : ajesty f s Government wished to impose as disclosed at that eeting. He had ascertained from Major Davis that his principals took the following view in regard tc the four proposed conditions:- (a) They were not prepared to agree to the registration in Great Britain of the Company fonaed to operate the Concession. They had already formed a Company for that purpose in Canada which, as being within easy reach of their headquarters in the United States, could be controlled therefrom. They contemplated that the Directorships of the new Oompany should, for the most part, be filled by the appointment of directors of their own group, who, for the purpose of Board Meetings, could/could, without undue inconvanienca, travel to Canada. They had no oxnanisation in this country which would enable them to operate a Company in London. To do bo, therefore, would involve the sotting up of a special orgajmisation for the purpose. Another objection was that the taxation of Companies roistered m this country was extremely heavy, much more so than in Canada, (b) They were not prepared to agree that the Chairman and Managing Director of the new Company should at all times be a British subject. It was their intention that the Chairman of the group in America should also officiate as Chairman of the new Company, and that the Managing Director (if any) should also be one of the Directors or Officials already associated with the American group, (c) Of the five Directors contemplated, they were only prepared to agree that one should be a British subject. As they were providing the whole capital for the enterprise, they considered it essential that full control should rest in the hands of their group, (d) They were not prepared to agree that the local Manager in charge of the Company^ operations in Bahrein should at all times be a British subject, although they were willing to appoint a British subject to act as Liaison Officer and to be euployed for all negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and with the local population. He would, however, be subject to the authority of the local Manager who would be a technical official in charge of the Field operations of the Company, It would be entirely opposed to their ovgpniB&amp;iion to appoint a non*technical Manager. Cir John Shuckburah pointed out that in their counter/u 7~. counter proposals the American group in effect rejected all the condj.tione proposed by Ilia Majesty's Government except to the extent of the admission of one British Director to the Board of the Coiapany. He felt some doubt whether the Syndicated American associates fully appreciated the position. Without His Majesty*s Government's good will and support they could not obtain or work this Concession at all. As the price of that good will, His Majesty 1 s Government had laid dom certain entirely reasonable conditions. These, he was satisfied, represented the minimum requirements of His Majesty's Government, The fourth condition, that in regard to the appointment of a British local Manager, was as much in the interest of the Company as of His Majesty's Government, although the latter attached the greatest possible importance to this condition. Possibly the American group did not realise that had it not been for the services rendered by Great Britain in the Persian Gulf during the last hundred years, there could have been no question to-day of working an oil concession in those areas. This country, by sacrifice of men and money, had made the Gulf safe for enterprises of this character, and they had every ri^it to impose such conditions on the conduct of commercial enterprises in those regions as they considered necessary in the furtherance of their policy of pacification and the promotion of prosperity in the Gulf States. ur, Janson said that all this had been explained to the American group on more than one occasion, but that they apparently felt that as they were providing all the capital they should 'call the tune'. Sir jQlm SbwKburffa asked to which of the four conditions the Americans attached the greatest importance. Mr. Janson replied that undoubtedly his American associates attached the greatest importance to condition (d). Hs thought it possible that if this could be settled to the satisfaction/UrY satisfaction of both parties the remaining three conditions could be disposed of with loss difficulty. The Americans apparently had a very low opinion of the managerial abilities of British subjects. They regarded the control of the local operations as the vital consideration in the successful production of oil t and they were not prepared that thxB control should be delegated to either a British subject or to a person idthout the highest technical qualifications. Their local Manager must, in their opinion, be an official in whom they had full confidence. They were aware of no British subject 'mo would satisfy this requirement. Llaior Holmes asked whether it would satisfy His Majesty's Government if it were laid domi that no representative of the Company should approach the Sheikh except through the British Political Agent at Bahrein. Hir John Shuckbumh said that it ms essential that a British subject should be the chief local representative of the Company. He must be thapflrnpany^ 'Number One 1 in Bahrein, It was, he thought, a matter of indifference to His Majesty's (jovemment whether or not he had any control over the technical operations of the Company. The relations between the British Manager and the official in charge of the technical operations was a matter of internal arrangement within the Company, and one with which His Majesty 's Government were not concerned. But it was, from their point of view, essential that the Company's official chaiiged with responsibility for all dealings with the Sheikh and the local authorities should be a British subject and should, nominally at least, be the chief local representative of the Company# He would have thought that such an arrangement was in the interest of the Company themselves. His Llajesty's Government would, he thou^t, be perfectly satisfied if Major Holmes were appointed as the Company's local Manager at Bahrein/Bahrein, If the American group were so averse from agreeing to the principle of the appointment of a British subject, could it not be mutually agreed that Major Holmes should be the first local General Manager, and that tho appointment of his successor should be subjoat to the approval of His Maj esty * s Government» l.^aior Holmes said that, for his part, he would be prepared to accept the post, and he thou^rht it possible that such an appointment would hs acceptable to tho American group. In convareations t?hich he had h s id with Mr* Wallace, who virtually controlled the American group, ha gathered that he had won the latter*s confidence. Indeed Mr. Wallace had on one occasion pressed him to take up m inrportajit appointment on behalf of the group in lenesuela. It was finally agreed that the Syndicate should tentatively suggest to their American associates the adoption of the following variant of condition (d), and ascertain whether it would be acceptable. They would make it clear that this variant had not been accepted, by His Majesty's Goveniment and could not be so accepted without further reference to the interested Govemnent Departments: ~ 'There shall at all times be a local General Manager who shall be approved by His Majesty^ Government He shall be the Chief Heprasentative of the Company in Bahrein and shall be responsiblw for all relations with the local authorities and population. All comunication with the Sheikh on behalf of the Coiflpimy shall be through the British Political Agent. For the first five years after the inception of the enterprise the local' General Manager shail be Major Holmes', ^ In the course of the discussion, it was mentioned to the Syndicate's representatives that His Majesty's Government would require an assurance from the Syndicate that no steps would be taken which would prejudice the position of the proposed site for the landing ground and sea-plane station, the precise location of which would be communicated to them in the near future. The Syndicate's representatives said that they did not anticipate any difficulty with their American/- — rntti th J ndia O ffice, Whitehall, L ondon, S.W.l.I I ' ! V,.| *■ 1 ^ iliaerican associates on this score, and they promised to uantion the aattor to the letter at m mrly date. It was ^rood that in aaiy latter sent to th^i Syndicate sotting out the conditions govenxing tho assi^amant of the Concossion, tm clause to the abov© effect should be insort'M* It was agreed that a further Meeting between representatives of tho Colonial Office and of the Syndicate should bo held on Thursday t tho 8th of August, at • • 30«/- 'h g 9 69035/29 t I am directed by Lord Passfield to refer to Colonial office letter (No. 69035/29) of the 3rd of \ugust, regarding the conditions upon which Hie Majoaty's Government in the United Kingdom would be prepared to agree to the participation of United States capital in the exploitation of oil in Sahrein, and to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of state for India, a brief record of a further discussion which took place on the 8th of August between represontativee of the Colonial Office and of the Eastern and General Syndicate, limited. Captain edywood Benn will observe that tne American interests to whom it is proposed that the Syndicate's rights in Bahrein should be transferred, are not prepared to acoopt in their entirety the conditions comiunioated to the representatives of the SyndicateSyndicate on the 19th and 3l8t of July* As a result of disoussion with the representatives of the Syndicate, certain modifioations of these conditions hare been tentaxiireiy agir 'd upon, subject to the concurrence of the other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government and I m now to enclose the draft of a letter embodying the revised conditions which Lord Fassfield proposes, subject to Captain ; ed^wood Renn's concurrence, to address to the Syndicate, 5. Lord passfield would be ^lad to be informed as soon as possible whether Captain Vedgwood Be on concurs in the terms of that draft, 4, A similar letter is being addressed to the Forei^fi Office and copies of this letter and of the record of the Meeting held on the Bth of August, are beinb forwarded to the Petroleum Departments Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and Board of Trade, 1 am7f(&gt; (S&gt; Note of Conference with Eaetern arid General syndicate, 8th August, 19S9. As arranged on the Slat of July, a further meeting wae held at the Colonial Office on Ihursday, the 8th of August, between r. Janson and Major Holmes, of the Eastern and General tiyndlcate, and blr John .Jiuck burgh. Mr. «illlean, Mr. Hall, and Mr. Bigg were also present. Mr. Janson handed to ~ir John ^nucicburgh a sunmary, which had been received from Kew by telegram, of the commexits made by the American group upon the proposals put- forward on behalf of His Majesty's Government at the meetings held on the 19th and 31st of July. Ihie suraraary, which was practically identical with the views expressed by Mr. Janson on the Slst of July, read as follows (a) A Canadian Company is essential on account of taxation and easy location for Managing Director to attend Board Meetings. (b) xhe Managing Director and/or Chairman cannot be British, as Americans are providing all the capital and the Gulf Oil Company have no Foreign representatives on any of their Boards. (c) The Americans agree one Director to be British out of five, but he may only hold his qualificationqualification stores. (d) The Merieaas agree that a person satisfactory to the British Ooveroment would be employed with title of special Delegate special iigent Foreign uepresentative or Special Kepresentative, of the Gompaay $ who would directly handle with the sheikhs under consultation with the British Political Agent all matters of business nature necessary to be taken up with the ^heiichs and also all matter® of Political or Diplomatic nature to be taken up with the sheikhs. In all such business matters mch would be guided by advice and suggestions of Local Manager of the Company, but as respect all i olltical or Diplomtic matters involving policy such would be guided by advice and suggestions of the Home Office of the Parent owning Company ♦ (e) The Americans agree that as majoy British shall be employed in the Company as consistent with the efficient working of the property. &amp;ir John bhuckburgh again warned tot representative oi the syndicate that no modification of the conditions communicated to them on the 19th of July could be agreed to without consultation with the other interested Departments of Bis Majesty's Government, and that any modification tentatively agreed upon in the course of the present conversations would have to be referred to those Departments for concurrence. In bir John Bhuckburgh 's view, condition (d) was the most important condition, both from the point of view of the American group and from that of His Majesty^ Goverifflaent, aiid this condition was therefore diEcusseddiscussed in the first Instance» Mr. Janson explained that the American group had not felt able to accept in its entirety the variant of this condition proposed at the eeuing of the 31 et of July ♦ They had expressed their readiness to agree to the appointment of Major Holmes as their local representative in Bahrein for the purpose of conducting business with the Sheikh of Bahrein, in consultation with the Political Agent, but they were not prepared to confer upou him the litle of Local General Manager or Manager, or to allow him to control in any way the technical operations of the Company in Bahrein; nor were they prepared at this stage to conclude a contract with Major lolme© for a period of five years, as, until they had consraenced operations in Bahrein and had ascertained that oil to foe found there in commercially payable quantities, they were not in a position to say whether their operations in Bahrein would extend over so long a period as five years• ^ir John uhucicburgh stated tnat he appreciated why the /imerlcai|group were unwilling at this stage to give Major Holmes a definite appointment for a period of five years, but that, while the position might be reasonable in m far a© related to &gt; ajor holmes, it could not be said to be satisfactory from the point of vim of his Majesty's Government. In his view it was essential to ma&amp;e it clear that Major Holmes, or whoever else was appointed with the approval of Hi® Majesty's Government as the local representative of the Company for the purpose of their relations with the local authorities in Bahrein, was the chief representative of the Company in Bahrein, and was the only representative of the Company who was empowered to deal with those authorities* It was also be essential that hie appointment should^/for a definite periodperiod of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company might continue to conduct its operations in Bahrein. If the Company diecontinued operations, the need for the appointment obviously ceased; but it was necessary to provide against a different contingency, via:- that the Company might, at an early sta^ge in the proceedings, and with out any inesUon arising of a die continuance of operations, remove the representative approved by his Majesty's Government and invite our concurrence in the appointment of a successor about whose suitability it might be difficult for us to satisfy ourselves. It was as lauch in the interests of the Company as of His Majesty 1 s Government that the chief local representative of I rapany should be pereona i-rata with His Majesty's Government, and also with the local authorities in Bahrein. 'm believed tnat five years experience would suffice fully to convince the Company of this, and to satisfy them that it was desirable, in their own interests, to continue to employ a suitable British subject as their chief local representative in Bahrein. ulv John uhuclcburgn did no u think that there was any need for the chief local representative of the Company to control their technical operations in Bahrein; the question of his relations with the official in charge of the technical operations was entirely a matter for the Company, which need not be mentioned in the conditions governing the assignmexit of the Concession, After some discussion it was agreed that condition (d) might be redrafted to make it clear that Major Holmes should be appointed as the chief local representative of the Company in Bahrein, and that the CompanyCompany should be under tm obligation to ills Majesty's Government to mploy him in tiiat capacity for a period of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company were operating in Bahrein, and that he should be the only official of the Company who was empowered to deal with the local autnoritics and population in Bahrein. It was also agreed that the Colonial Office should furnish the Syndicate with a reasoned explanation of the circumstances which rendered it essential to impose this condition. As regards uhe remaining conditions, it was agreed that in all the circumstances, the contention of the iimerican group that they should not he required to register a freeh Company in this country might be regarded as reasonable; and it was suggested as an alternative that, if His Majesty 1 s Government agreed that the Company formed to take over the concession should remain registered in Canada, the C ,\r9pmy an their part should agree to maintain a registered agency in this country which should at ail times be in charge of a British subject, who should be the recognised channel of comunication between the Company and Mim Majesty*® Government in the United Kingdom* It was also agreed that if the Company was to remain registered in Canada and to be presided over by the Chairman of the icierican group a® was proposed, it ould be difficult for liis Majerty's uovemment to insist uiat the Chairman and the Managing Director (if any) of tue company should be British subjects. It was suggested, nowever, that if his Majesty 1 ® Government agreed to waive this condition, and to the appointment of one British Director only out of five as proposed by the American group instead of the larger proportion originally proposed, the Mexican group should be requested to agree that the British memberi -C / member ol the Board of Directors of the Coapany should be liomixiated by uis Majesty's government in Canada iu eoiieultatiou with ids Majesty's Governaient I t the united Kingdom, and that ids salary as director should be provided by the Company. With regard to the question of the local employees of the company other than their chief representative in Bahrein, it was agreed that the forwula originally suggested by .the colonial Office faJT' was preferable to the alterxiaiive ested b 4 um ^ f VKr#Vi iimerlcaiA group» and sl^Duld be irisisteci upon, ^ 14^(oi) ^, 4 | 1%H ^3 It was agreed that tne Colonial Office sliould eiideavour to obtain the coacurrence of tue other interested Dtpartoeats of nlB Majesty 1 8 uovenimejui in um reviBed conditions now proposed, and, when tlds had been done, should couimmicate thost conditions to the byMicate by letter with a full explanation of the reasons which rendered necessary inaiBtence upon condi uion (d) • The representative of tae Syndicate expressed the hope that if, as appeared to be the case, the / loodifications bautatively suggested represea^ed the extreme limit of Uie cancessions which ais Majesty's iiovenuaent were prepared to melee, it would be made clear in the letter coiflaiunicating the revised conditions that wis Majesty's aoveriiuent would not be prepared to consider any further modification of tnose conditions. Iht representatives of fche syndicate considered toat, if this was done, their t&amp;sk of endeavouring to induce the Araerican group to accept those conditions would be facilitated# Ihe representatives of the u^ndicate did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by further negotiation with Major OaviB in this country. They therefore proposed to inform him generally of tne resultresult of their conversatione at tht Colonial Office, and to explaiii that no further progress could be made in the natter until the other interested Departments of iiis Majesty 1 © Government, and possibly also 'the Gover mmit of India, had been consulted, and that some tkriiier delay was therefore inevitable. They hoped that in tue circumstances Major 3avis would return to the United States to retort to his Principals. In any case, f r. Janson and Major ■ ; olmes pro osed v on receipt of the promised letter from the Colonial Office, themselves to proceed to the United atates in order to negotiate direct with Mr. Wallace, the Chairman of the /American group; and they anticipated that, with the explanations to he furnished by the Colonial Office and with those which they the is elves would be able to provide, they would find it possible to secure Mr. siallace's acceptance of the conditions proposed. It was also agreed that the Colonial Office letter comminieating the revised conditions should stipulate that no step® would be taken by the Byndicate or the Americsn group which would prejudice the position of the proposed sites for a landing ground and sea-pi f -ie i ..ation in l^ihrein, the precise location of wild would be coiriivaniicated to trie syndicate m soon ae possible.(3 tm mmmMit mmmm wmssm. umtm.

SECRET• D.O, So.,4.^-.'.. f/y- ' ^ Bahrain, 8th September 1929. ■ l r.ioofio&amp; f Dear Colonel Barrett. With reference to your letter of 21st August about the oil concession. .fro 36^ ) I am certain that Shaikh Hamed would gladly stipulate that Major Holmes should be the Company^ Chief Local Representative in Bahrain; he knows him well and has a personal liking for him. I do not think that Shaikh Hamed himself cares anything about the nationality of the company. Until now he has been under the impression that the company is an English one because Major Holmes is an Englishman. What interests The Shaikh, and all his relations, is the prospect of possibly finding oil, increasing the revenues and so making it possible to increase their allowances. Shaikh Hamed is very interested in the idea that perhaps some day the air route will pass through Bahrain. It is thought locally that this is going to happen. I am sure he will be glad to insist on the aerodrome and flying boat harbour being kept free for the planes. As regards official business passing through the Political Agent Shaik Hamed would naturally be very glad that it should do so. When you wish Shaikh Hamed to make these suggestions I feel sure that he will be glad to do so# I think the only thing that worries him at present is the possibility of oil being found too near his house at Sakhrir.
