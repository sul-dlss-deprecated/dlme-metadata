The request had been made as a result of discussions by merchants in Bahrain about an increase in Saudi Arabia’s coffee quota. Most of the remaining correspondence dates from 1945 and concerns the refusal of the Iranian Customs authorities to permit an Aden merchant to reship coffee consignments originally landed at Bushire, to Bahrain, Basra or back to Aden, to avoid financial loss. The file also includes a list of the names and addresses of Bahrain importers of Indian coffee and spices, compiled by the Bahrain Customs, in response to a request from an Indian exporter. The file ends with a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain to the branch manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, Bahrain, authorising the opening of foreign exchange credit facilities in favour of a Singapore exporter who had agreed the sale and shipment of a consignment of coffee to a Bahrain merchant.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs, Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Coffee</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cb#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cb#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
