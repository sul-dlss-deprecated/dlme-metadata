FIRST LIST OF NAMES IN PERSIA(SOUTH). only, viz. Luristan, Khuzistan (formerly ‘Arabistan), Bakhtiari, Isfahan, Yezd, Ears, Laristan, Kerman, Seistan, Persian Baluchistan, and Makran. The boundaries of the provinces are for the most part indefinite. For financial purposes the Bakhtiari country is united with Khuzistan, Laristan with Ears, Persian Baluchistan and Makran with Kerman. W ith every name are given the approximate distance and bearing from the best-known town in the province in which the place is believed to be situated ; these are, respectively, Khurramabad, Mohammerah, Chigha Khur, Isfahan, Yezd, Bushire, Bandar ‘Abbas, Kerman, Nasratabad, Bampur, and Jask. Persian orthography is by no means fixed and consistent, and especially is there uncertainty about the identity and length of many vowels. The termination -an is often pronounced -un ; v between kh and a is mute. The P.C.G.N. usually discourages the use of hyphens, but allows them with the particle -i-, generally called Izafat or the Kasra of Relationship, which comes between a substantive and its possessor or attribute. A\ hen the substantive ends in -it or -u, it is followed by yi and not -i-. Some times the attribute precedes the substantive, and then the Izafat is not used : e.g. Kuh-i-Slah or Siah Kuh = Black Mountain. It may be noted that the termination -abad, meaning an inhabited place, is properly a separate word in Persian; but it has long been customary in transliteration to incorporate it with the rest of the name. Many other compound names are similarly treated. The word Bandar, meaning a port, which precedes the names of many coastal villages, is often omitted, but should be retained in the case of the well-known name Bandar ‘Abbas.

May I suggest a slight but possibly important alteration? In the second paragraph the\report reads as follows.- 'The Ruling family occupied Bahrain which was then in the hands of the Persians' I think it would be more accurate and less liable to misconstruction if this sentence read as follows.- 'The Shaikhs of the Khalifa Family are the Rulers of Bahrain.
