This very kindess made all tongues which thank you and pray to God to elongate your life and not to deprive me of your friendliness.A thing which pleased most than all is your alluding to the surplus of the incomes of Baladia after the expenses it has incurred notwithstanding the fact that it is not as^result of the increase to the taxes,which might be much more than the expenditures. arid gladden Sir, I beg to inform/Your Excellency that the increase tojthe surplus is not due to the increase of the taxes or r cm from any other caufre.

Sir, We beg to lay before your honour that our ICO Bags of rice which were landed here ex s.s.*Bandra* Toy. 162, and which were taJcen by the Customs into their Warehouse because they were slack, were weighed by the Municipality. The total shortage amounted to nine bags and the Municlaplity took from us fine of Hs. 186-12-0 It has never been the rule to weigh bags which had been re ceived in the Customs Ware House, because only such cargo as gets slack and tom in transit is received as such, and the consignees take delivery of such bags and fill them again for sale. We attach herewith Customs Certificate to show that the 100 bags were all slack and tom and repaired. This (slack) occurred in transit, for the carg* was shipped from Karachi^by a sailing boat on 25th August 1928, and the boat having broken its mast due to bad weather had to return to Xarachl from half way. The same boat came as far as Muscat and was unable to proceed further, and the cargo according to instructions from our head Office at Yerawal to their Agents in Muscat, was discharged at that port, and was re shipped to Bahrein from Muscat by the s.s.'Bandra* Toy. 162. As your honour will see that the cargo had an exceptionally rough handling in transit, and is natural to lose its contents. The cargo was correctly shipped from Karachi as per Invoice received i»e., two maunds of Karachi as usual. The correct weight can be verified from the Karachi Customs. All our cargo has eves been shipped to us in correct weight, and we never had an occasion to complain about short weight. The present case is an exceptional one on account of the rough handling, and we submit that the fine imposed on us by the Baladivah. under the circumstances is quite unjustifiable. We therefore appeal to your honcnir for justice in the matter f(P.jGuIJ) - 2 - bo that you will order refund of the fine paid by ns. We may mention as a further proof, that no merchant would have short weight packed in slack bags for Bahrein, for the very reason that a slack bag, being easily noticeable, does not fetch a sale. We have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servants, TOOSUP HAJI 31SHAMI- / 16 . /. Translation of proposed Muharaq Muncipality 1 s schedule of fines and other demands.

If you approve I will ask Shaikh Hamad to sanction its application here. Could you please obtain for us, four copies in Arabic and two in English, as early as possible. If they are on sale of course we will pay. I do not know where you got this copy from. H I think the greatest stumbling block at present is the fact of The Ruler being president which gives such weight to Municipal decisions that they become almost like orders from the Government itself. If you approve of the suggestion would you please order the copies as soon as is possible. They will need revising, like this one, before being submitted to the Shaikh. I see no reason why the Municipal Council should be asked for any opinion in the matter, they can be fold when it is decided. Yours sincerely,li.o.lo. /&lt;?r Th* Political Xranoy.

White drill. Red drill. Sliushi country. Bhushi red lined. Voil. Tliere have been several acrimonious discussions on this subjectEubj^ot in the Manana Municipality. Sons n^b^rr alleged that the cloth was of correct length when issued fron the nillB, but it war, tampered with on the instigation of the local traders who were anxious to secure greater profit for thenselves. This charge was of course denied and it was alleged that the cloth was issued to customers as received fron the mills. It was further alleged by sone members that the white cloth was always of correct length* but that the coloured cloth was often of short lengths owing to shrinkage at the tine of dying. Ho actual bales of short length white cloth appear to have been produced before the Municipal Connittee. The Secretary of the Municipality has now informed me that after receipt of ray last enquiry he took the help of local ci)Oth merchants and searched for cloth of short length but was unable to find any except 2 pieces of dyed cloth on which the names of the dyers Aiarakhia Ismail P.0. Ko.9 Bombay and Ssaji Reimanji Bombay 9 are printed. He states that though such cloth existed in the market before there is none to be found now. He claims that this fact is due to the issue of a notice prohibiting the entry of short length cloth. He states that from this fact the Committee appointed to enquir into the question surmise that the fault lay with the local merchants, who took cloth from the manufacturer in full lengths and asked the dyers to shorten them at the time of dying. X would emphasise however that the above is merely sur mise and that it is by no means established that any dyers in Bombay are guilty of malpractice. If any further information comes to hand I will at once inform you.

I shall be much obliged if you will be so good as to inform me wliat powers and responsibilities the Ruler deputed to the Manama Municipality at the tine of its foundation. Political Arent, Bahrein.Office off the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Bated, 15th Ramdhan 1347 To H. B* M's bo litical Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum With reference to your Memo Bo. 158 of 1929 dated 19th February 1929. It is difficult to say what powers and responsibilities the Ruler deputed to the Manamah Municipality. The Municipality was founded at a time when Shaikh Hamad held very little power himself. Shaikh Abdullah was the chief instrument in founding it. The earliest records which I can find are the enclosed letter and proclamation. I have enquired on the subject from Shaikh Hamad and he is unable to give a reply. sits as the Resident of the Council any decisions of theirs are considered as binding as Government Proclamations, being approved of and signed by Shaikh Hamad, the Ruler, in his capacity as President. The public will not understand that Shaikh Hamad signs Municipal orders, not as the Ruler. As long as Shaikh Hamad, the Ruler,A but as president of the Council. There is at present very consider- able and justifiable feeling that the Municipal Council have assumed to them selves powers for exceeding their proper position. There is a strong tendency on their part to interfere in matters which do not concern them. If one points this out their reply is that Shaikh Hamad was in the chair and therefore approved of their action. In my opinion it would be far more suitable if the president was not the Ruler. I will send to you, today if pos sible, the Baghdad Municipal Law, which I have been through marking in red ink the parts which to my mind could be most advantageously adopted in Bahrain. The position at present is absurd as the Council not only deals with Muni cipal affair, but legislates as to the amount of power which it shall have and how its own elections shall be 'arranged'. This most decidedly is a matter to be dictated by the Government. I would suggest adopting the Bagh dad law, suitably amended, as law and thenT rand 1 at ion of notification dated the 12 th Dhul Hijjah—' „ 1338 2.S - /yzo In continuation or the rules rentioned in the two notifications of the 8 th and 17th Dhul ^a*dah 1338 the followig are published for the information of the public;- ART, 15 Owners of ruined houses and falling down shops inside the town are required to build round them a wall of stone or Sa’af and raise it to 4 feet,so as to prevent fchB its use for easement or rubbish receptacle^, as it is the case at present. 17 « 18 19 ART, 16 Owners houses with water pipes not reaching the ground* whether such pipes^made qf iron, wood or earth #nould make them reach the cesspools so that no wafete wa*er may flow on the road or fall on persons passing by* Persons are forbidden from carrying more than two bags on Ahy animals or goading wounded,sick, or any other animal which is unable to etarxy the load.They should^ beat the animal hars&amp;ily othM^the usual way of driving The sale of rotten fruits and vegatbles is forbidden p£^-eruK, p# - SQans are forbidden from blocking the roadway or part oi it by throwing stones, mud,wood or any other , thing; but those who are forced to do so on account of building and have no other place can do so on paying a tax on tin# following line;- The first ten^wttl not be thiS Peri ° d full tax thOoe who have started the building and half frorr those who have not started.

After Compliments, With reference to the resolution passed hy the Baladiyah Council in their meeting of the 12th Muarram (i,e.l9-6-29) forbidding the sale of mixed ghi whether such * ghi is imported from outsdie or mixed in the town. First. lour excellency is doubtless aware L that it is impossible to comply with the Baiadiyah orders withing the limited time of 20 days given for the disposing off of the mixed ghi, as such short period is not enogh. t a There is a large quantity in the town not less than 4000 tins ^ which require*at least three months to dispose off as it is i the least time estimated for this purpose. Second. To prohibit its import from outside : and to keep supervision over the imported goods so that they may not be of the mixed kind is of great harm and will put traders into great difficuilties in addition to the amount of 1 of responsibility with which merchants are heavily burdened j by means of these rules. As for example in many cases we ordered for pure Arabic ghi irom Basrah and made it clear to our customers that it should not be mixed with any other kino, but after it reached this place we found that it cent- ' ains mixture of other kind,some of it having .ess mixture than the other. It is not possible at all to take precaution against this. Let us suppose that one of us has ordered the biggest firm in Basrah to send him 400 tins from the pure Arabic ghi. On receipt of the order the latter ordered the broker to get the quanity required from the pure ghi. The quanitity was then purchased and shipped to Bahrain. 0n£ arrival at this place the inspecting Committee which, has bet: selected by the Baladiyah Council, whether right or wrong, gave a report that it is of the mixed kind. k dio will then be responsible for the loss of the merchants, who ordered for■■■Ipure ghi and paid the cost of pure Arabic ghi• Will this merchhat suffer the loss for no fault of his own or will his customer who die not act contrary to his duties, taking into consideration that he ordered the broker in usual way to make the purchase, will bear the loss. Or who else will be held responisble for the loss. May it not be concea ed from your excelency that the vegetable ghi is spread all over T Irap, in its towns and villages and even among the desert dwellers, snd it is imposible to take precaution against it at all. Third. We know for certain that it is impossible for a man to distinguish between the pure ghi and mixed ghi when it is mixed with Marseille ghi which is liquid and easily gets mixed with it, and makes it impossible for the most expei person in this line to distinguish it. Such being* the case this will always be a source of trouble between the merchanite and Municipality. We beleive that the Baladiyah can do with out creating such sort of difficulties hich they xa no soon finish with one they will be entangled with another and there j will be endless trouble between the Baladiyah and the mrchants | rather it will go to the extent of reaching the Government offices. Fourtk. Has any one compained to tiie Balcdiyah or the 1 Government against a particular person who had soldj^vegetable ghi at the rate of pure ghi. Not at all, each kind is sold at \ its own price. Fifth. If the Baltiyah still insist that it should be prohibited we beg to inform you that it is impossible to take precaution against it unless the vegetable ghi is totally prohibited and not allowed to be imported to the town. «»hat~ i| ever steps tne -^aladiyah m y take , shop keepers can mix it with Marsellis-ghi as long as the vegetable ghi can be haa h here. Nhen it is mixed with little Vegetable ghi viz half pure and half Marsellis vegetable ghi it is not possible for the most expert person to say that it is mixed with vegetable ghi. Under the circumstances we humbly request your excell ency to give this matter, which is of great harm to merchants, J7»‘f M Ko. of the 1st / Ja*»4r rJ29. The Political Agency, Bahrein. To The Adviser, Bahrein Government. Bahrein. 'emorandum. I have before me a communication from the Manama Bala- diiyyeh which bears the following reference number; * Notice No.I of 1348, dated the I3th Mukarram 1348. I see from section 3 of this notice that the public are forbidden from importing mixed ghi into Bahrein from the outside. I take the strongest exception to this announcement, which is absolutely ultra vires, and I will not enforce it against any British or British protected subject. It is not for any ' municipality to dictate what foodstuffs may or may not be impor ted into a country, and I hop* that you will request them to can cel this pronouncement. Further, I very much doubt if they are withingtheir prohibiting powers mixed ghi within the town, provided it is not injurious to the public health, or that there is no trickery involved. Should ny trickery be involved, I should have thought that the proper course would have been for those affected to complain to the police, the ofience being a cognisable one. With regard to the translation of the municipal law, and its application to British subjects and British protected persons, I would say that I shall not be able to examine the bye laws involved until I proceed to Karachi on recess, and if the notice I have quoted above is a afir sample, they will repay care- t ful sudy.

As regards our further forward contracts we are communicating with the shippers and shall try to square up with them# ^ That why this mixed Ghee is being stopped by the Municipality was also not explained ta us. This requires the opinion of the Health Officer that it is - t niurxous to the health of the general public ana we shall be glad if you will kindly make rie3 T ^ ^ ie Officer and have his opinion on the subject, and let us know the result of your SUCXI as we are concerned we have coni Pj a ^ n ^ from any of buyers about their ?£ fect0 i» '^t the sales have rather increased in the past# That if_inspite of all the argvu/mtata this order of S00d » 3ha11 ^ only too you H 11 klndl y arrange with the Baladiah to purchase onr June and July shipments from us and pay we c C ?? t Pric ?* 131 the ordinary course if 7 7-!

Each of the two Municipalities receive from the Government a subsidy of Rs 2000/- per month each. This is presumably the Rs 48,000/- referred to in your first para. When the Manama Baladya was instituted a tax was collected by the Customs known as Baladya tax. This was paid directly to the Manama Baladya but later it was commuted to a definite monthly payment of Rs 2,000/-. Since then the Muharrak Baladya has been instituted and the Government pa^s to it a similar subsidy of Rs 2000/- per aasssum, but without increasing the Baladya tax. 2. Your suggestion has been forwarded and wi will be discussed at next meeting. y 7 . 3.
