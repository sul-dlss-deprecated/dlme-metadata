It notes that it is the intention of Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā, Prince at Shiraz, to personally supervise the embarkation of the invasion force at Bushire.It explains that Abdoal Russool Khan believes that the selection of Bushire is merely pretence to provide the Prince at Shiraz with the opportunity to depose him. It further notes his intention to flee Bushire if he fails to prevent Persian troops from entering his town, which is the motive for this tip-off. In response to this, it notes that the Shaikh has been informed of Britain's policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Persia; Britain will not interfere with either party.The letter outlines the Resident's belief that Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā has no real intention of invading Bahrain, and that he fully expects the invasion to be postponed once again.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
