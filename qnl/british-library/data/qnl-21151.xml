B.M’s Political A^ent, BAHRAIN: through The Adviser, The Government of Bahrain: Sir, Food e tc.Control . I have the honour to report upon the working of the Food Control in the State of Bahrain, during the past year 1941. This report should he read as a continuation of my N6.PA/FC/l5/13hO of the 1st March 1941. It is unnecessary to mention that the general mercantile community ;5^4who are trading for the sake of profit) would prefer that there should be v/ r: no control over their activities by Government. It will thus be understood &lt; why, in December 1940, a number of non-Bahrain Hindu merchants made an agitation to demonstrate to the Political Agent that the Food Control was not v/or king benefit. The points raised were dealt with in detail; and no complaints have since been put forward. It is well to repeat that the purpose of the Food Control is: (a) to conserve in the State of Bahrain a sufficiency of food-stuffs: particularly of the commodities in general consumption by the majority of the population who are v ery poor p e opl e as distinguished from luxuries; (b) to protect the public from profiteering by importers, wholesalers, and retailers of general commodities; and, t (c) having achieved these ends, to ensure to the importers and the wholesalers a fair profit on their trading. For this, in general a profit of ten per cent upon the prime cost was agreed by the importers to be fair when fixing a maximum price, ■ V they being at liberty of course to deal at lower prices in business competition. * ' The Food Control operates under the authority given in K.B.M’s Political Agent's Order under Emergency Regulation No.2.dated the 19th December, 1939, and such subsequent Orders as may have been issued as the situation required. In view of the restricted sources of supply caused by the World War, the Bahrain market for most comnodities is now supplied from India, Burma, and Java, and possibly a small proportion of provisions from South Africa, and occasionally Australia. It must be carefully borne in mind that as, regards the Persian Gulf shipping service, the port of Bahrain is a kind of 'half-way house' with some considerable importance as an entrepot for supplies to be transhipped or re-shipped to the mainland of Arabia, the realm of H.M King Abdul Aaiz ibn Saud. The main flow of the Gulf shipping is between Basra-Abadan at one end and Bombay-Karachi at the other; and Shipping facilities from India to Bahrain must necessarily become irregul ar since foodstuffs can come here only when ships can be conveniently be spared from other service. Consequently it becomes all the more important to conserve in Bahrain a considerable stock of foodstuffs, and very care fully to control their export so t.at the local stocks may not become low, it being remembered that the needs of Bahrain tai e priority over other mercantile enterprises. A complication in the situation is that two Oil Companies with a fairly numerous staff operating on the mainland, draw from the local markets a large quantity of foodstuffs; and when such foodstuffs- 2 - 2 ' foodstuffs (previously imported) become exports (such as sugar, rice, flour etc,,) as distinguished from local vegetable produce, this activity becomes a strain upon the Bahrain market which, with foresight, need not have arisen; as such organisations (unless having previously been told that they could rely upon the Bahrain market, v/hich seems doubtful) could easily arrange to import their own requirements, as is mainly done by he American Company in respect of canned goods. An important provision in the Food Control Order makes profiteering an offence; and this has since been extended to include hoarding and refusal-to-sell. Many com- odities other than the above come v/ithin the scope of the Order; and its effect in practical working is that the control is exercised over any commodity wherein it is evident that the above offences are being, or likely to be committed. Here it can be stated that every shop-keeper is doing his best to profiteer as much as possible, on the grounds that his customers, the v ery poo r„ are unlil ely to complain and so provide the opportunity for a prosecution; and of course, it is obviously impossible to supervise every retail bargin in every shop. Having regard to the sale prices, e.g. of sugar, in other Gulf ports, every trader feels justified in 'making the hay while the sun shines'; and the well-being of the very^ poor does not concern them in the slightest. Unfortunately too, up till recently the penalties inflicted by the Courts upon such offenders as it has been possible to prosecute have been so slight as to make it almost a waste of time to do so; since an offender cheerfully pays a trivial fine, and feels under no deterrent from continuing his practices. A short spell of imprisonment would have a much better effect. There were only eighteen prosecutions during the past year for such offences, when there might have been very many more. To combat this state of affairs, the Food Control endeavours to make the maximum retail sale prices as widely known as possible: by Proclamation, by announcements over the local radio, and by a public crier; but the shop-keepers evade the Order by making non-cash transactions. A further effort (which has some prospect of success) has been made by a leading Hindu importer who has opened shops in Manamah and Maharaq for retail dealing at the controlled prices; and one need hardly say that he has a daily run on his stock. Control is also exercised on wholesalers by issuing orders to sell in favour of specific buyers which specify the permitted quantity and price. The same remarks in general apply to the local market in piece goods of which there is a reasonably good stock accumulated over a number of years of goods mainly Japanese intended both for local consumption and for export to mainland ports. Here again, credit sales are very frequent, and consequently the public ultimately pay whatever price the salesman thinks he can safely extract from them. Here again the public are as much to be criticised as the salesman for profiteering. In view of the above, it is interesting to compare the pre-war and the present stocks of main commodities of foodstuffs: Commodity Pre-v/ar :stocks Present stocks 22.1.42 • • Average monthly consumption: Rice: : 28,000 bags 36,000 bags • • 5 - 6,000 bags. Flour: 3,100 bags 4,500 bags • • 1,800 bags. Sugar, Java. 4,000 bags 6,000 bags • • 1.-1300 bags. Ghee : 2,400 tins 300 tins • • 800 tins: Coffee: 3,000 bags 275 bags • • 200 bags: Tea: 700 cases 1,200 cases • • as per demand. Spices: 800 bags. . 1'300 bags • • as per demand. It should be noted that a stock of rice should not be kept more than six months, on account of damage by insects; nor flour more than two months, as it rapidly deteriorates.30 It is the purpose of the Food Control to conserve a stock of six months' supply of foodstuffs; but this cannot always be done on account of irregular visits of steamers from India. At the time of writing, a considerable quantity of rice, flour, and ghee, is expected from India (s.s.'V/yvern' ) to augment the above stocks. For the above reasons it has been felt prudent to supervise very closely every application for permission to export foodstuffs, much to the annoyance of would-be profiteers; but otherwise it is not desirable to restrict of Bahrain firms operating on the mainland, who bring through the port of Bahrain cargo originally intended for mainland mariets; though circumstances might compel the Food Control in case of need, to divert such cargo into Bahrain. Such circumstances have once arisen (in the case of wheat-flour) when suitable arrange ments were made v/ithout creating friction between the importers con cerned and the Food Control. Local sale prices for ( 1 ) importers, ( 2 ) wholesalers, and (3) retailers are fixed by the Food Control on the basis of the prime cost of the quantity landed from time to time. All these prices are he-cheched at least every ten days, but may be changed after three ^ days if an import of sufficient quantity justifies such action. The situation of Bahrain, as explained above, automatically makes these prices dependent upon the value at the time and place of export. Experience shows that there is a steady upward trend in the prices of all foodstuffs, partly due to speculation, and partly due to the increase in^the freight charges and expenses incidental thereto. This inflation is to be deplored; but the local market is helpless, as the importer cannot be expected to trade at a loss, not being a philanthropist. The inevitable result is that the local wage earner cannot buy so much with the same arcourit of money, and hence is poorer. In justice to this class, it is inevitable that increases in v/ages will have to be granted. Since it is to be expected that this upward trend will continue, I recommend to the authorities concerned the grant of 'War Bonus' (which will later on have to be increased), *as distinguished from more pay, so that the peace-time basic rate will^uncnanged. I attach herewith Statement 'A' illustrating the increase in the cost of foodstuffs and Statement 'B' regarding the increase in the K cost of clothing material. Reflecting upon this position, it is^.importance to note that the prices of provisions imported from Great Britain have increased locally by about 75 % due to ( 1 ) lack of imports ( 2 ) increases in freight and war insurance, and ( 3 ) lack of complaints from aggrieved purchasers. Some instances are: Cigarettes increased by Hardware (when available) ' ' Cooking utensils ' ' « ' Haberdashery &amp; Hosiery ' ' Headwear and footwear ' ' Indian cement (others unavailable) ' about 40%. ti ti it ti ii 200 %. 100 %.. 100 % • 1 %. 5&lt;$. Another effect of the upward trend likely to develope is a limitation of the numbers of importers owing to the necessity for paying cash against documents at sight for all imports, a sound practice, but one that prevents the snail importer from trading on credit; and in some cases, e.g. in Australia and the Unistates^ a two—months' irrevocable credit has to be opened before goods are sent hither; but owing to irregular steamers' sailing this short term involves the importer in heavy telegraphic expenses for renewals„ Even these sources are likely soon to be cut off by the exigencies of war; and thus India will probably become the sole source of supplv to Bahrain. Here considerable difficulties will have to be faced'by” the restrictions already being imposed:notably upon hardware, medicines, stationery, and such commodities as may be packed in tins.1 b 1 From the foregoing, it can easily be inferred that the cost ' .of living in Bahrain, especially for the poorer classes, has increased by 145% to 150 % over the pre-war cost; that is to say: life is 2 '. times as 1 expensive. This situation,unhappy as it appears, is favourable as compared with other Gulf ports where, for instance, according to reports, the price of a bag of sugar in Kuwait is Rs:70/-, and in D'bai it is Rs 20 O/-.v,ithout sellers; while in Basra it is said to be Rs:l/- per pound, the present Bahrain price being Rs 233 - 8 - 0 . Hence, so far as it operates, the Food Control justifies its existence, although it could do more if there were public co-operation. In regard to native produce the local lack of rainfall which will afiect the autumn date crop, gives cause for concern; but also the same upward tcend is to be noticed unfortunately greatest in the case of Basra dates, of which usually a large quantity used to be . locally consumed. Military needs in Basra have enabled local speculators there to sky-rocket their prices, and Bahrain suffers accordingly. I attach herewith Statement ’'C 11 which illustrates the increase in the cost of native produce. As mentioned above, regular buying by outside Oil Companies tends to increase this cost; and it must be emphasised that the needs of Bahrain must receive first consideration. The extension of the Food Control on account of the Orders against ^ hoarding, profiteering, and refusal-to-sell have created considerable work, but is bound to operate beneficially as it progresses. This working has brought to light interesting instances where shop-keepers, clerks, and the like, have bought large quantities e.g.of sugar to hoard up and sell later on at he higher prices which are bound to develope as the upward trend continues. Secret stores have been discovered which are dealt with by the Orders-to-sell at the current market price. The sugar ration in the Unista&amp;s is one pound per head per week, much less than in Bahrain where rationing is impossible. Further, the working of the Exports Control Order (under which no export of non-Empire goods may be effected without a Certificate from the Political Agency) should have considerable effect in conserving stocks in Bahrain, although it cannot affect the ultimate price obtained at the port of destination. The purpose of this is to conserve foreign exchange; and it should be rigidly applied, especially as regards American products, which cannot be replaced. The outlook for the future is very gloomy, especially for the year 1942; and_there can be no doubt that the cost of living in Bahrain will steadily increase until normal peace conditions prevail again. The aim of the Food Control (which would be better named 'The Price Control” , as it controls many commodities other than food) is to keep such cost as low as possible to prevent local discontent and possible law-breaking. This work is hampered by (1) the ignorance of the majority of the populace and ( 2 ) the rapacity of foreign shop-keepers, and(3) the impossibility of complete detailed supervision of the markets. Here I would acknowledge the assistance reaaily given by the Manamah Baladiah's Food Inspectors; and would add that the whole of the work is being done by the Customs Department without any increase in staff or salaries. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, LLER. Note: I attach a note of the gross and net weights of essential co;nodities. ('D”).CODES : BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE % PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QATAR) LIMITED 1. For the last five years we have relied on local purchase from Bahrain for much of our dry and fresh foodstuffs for our Qatar oil camp. We have always understood that this arrangement for local purchase was welcomed by the merchants as a regular source of profit to them. 2. During the last few weeks, however, we have been unable to obtain our requirements due mainly to regulations by the Food Controller and his 'cuts” in our requisitions. We have never been asked if the amounts permitted us are sufficient to enable us to carry on our operations. We do not know on what basis the Food Controller allots quantities but it would seem reasonable for us to expect to obtain an ordinary man-ration for a fixed number of men and days. We believe that so far the shortages, if any, do not necessitate a cut in a normal ration scale. We are prepared to submit full particulars of requisitions based on our actual ration scales. We may add that the Food Controller offered us very little hope that we should be allowed to draw our proper requirements from Bahrain on the grounds that Bahrain must be given priority. We had understood before that Qatar oil camp requirements had been included in the food estimates of Bahrain. 3. It will be realised that this sudden curtailment of supplies puts the Company in a very difficult position as considerable time must elapse before we can arrange to import our require ments from India. In the interim period our only reliable source of supply is Bahrain. G. Legh-Jones, J. B. A. Kessler (Dutch) BAHREIN PERSIAN GULF Q/CR.1/2809 3rd February, 1942. H.B.M.’s Political Agent Bahrain.

We should be glad of your assurance also that in the future we shall be permitted to call on Bahrain for assistance in emergencies such as a breakdown in any arrangements which we are able to make for supplies direct from India. 5. If it is decided that the Company should import from India we should be grateful for assistance in facilitating the export from India as we presume there are many war time formalities in addition to difficulty in obtaining shipping space. 6. It is assumed that nothing in the new arrangements will interfere with our purchase of fresh vegetables, meat, etc. from Bahrain.

It is possible, of course, that the Shaikh or Qatar merchants are making their own arrangements for importing stocks direct.

The implication is quite clear that we can buy in Bahrain and export Uee Major Alban’s No.2148 - 36/16 dated 28th October 1941). It gives us equal status with other Bahrain purchasers but does not exempt us from general food control. It ^ an _^ e argued, however, that if we enjoy this status we should be entitled to purchase our requirements based on an adequate man-ration for agreed periods. We believe that so far it is not necessary to cut down normal ration scales and, if this is accepted, we feel that it is not unreasonable for us to expect the Food Controller to sanction our requisitions provided we are prepared to show that they are based on specific ration scales covering a fixed number of days or weeks. It is also obvious that in the case of our isolated camp in Q,atar we should be allowed to build up a reasonable reserve. The Food Controller was not prepared to discuss the grounds on which he bases his cuts in our requisitions apart from a general statement that Bahrain must be given priority. It will be realised that we were left in a very difficult and uncertain position - in fact we could not be sure that we could procure sufficient food to continue our operations in Qatar. The position was explained in our No.Q,/CR.l/2809 and Q/CR. 1/28362 DO/CH.1/2863 (contd.) Meanwhile, we trust that it will he eventually possible with the assistance of the Political Department to arrange export permits and shipping space for our requirements of tinned provisions and dry foodstuffs from India in which case any facilities granted us to purchase in Bahrain markets would only need to be exercised in emergencies and in the case of minor items.

No. C/325 Political Agency, Bahrain, 17th March, 1942 ■ '/ You spoke to me recently about the weekly return of foodstuffs v/hich merchants send to you as Food Controller. You told me that you occasionally send your Manager to check stores of foodstuffs, but that the Manager only makes such visits after giving adequate notice; and it is, of course, easy for merchants in these circumstances to conceal the surplus stores or otherwise to make existing stores conform to their returns. You asked me whether you would be justified under the law in carrying out checks, or searches, without giving notice. For instance, if you received information that a particular merchant was hoard ing stores of food, would you have legalpower to send your Manager with one or two Customs peons to conduct a house search ? 2. The legal position is that no one can conduct a search of private property without a warrant issued by a court. If, therefore, you receive information that goods are being hoarded by a merchant, and that the returns he has sent to you are false, you should apply to the Court of the Indian Assistant for a search warrant in favour of your Manager. There is no harm if your Manager takes with him Customs peons to assist in the search; but under Section 103 (i), Criminal Procedure Code, the Manager should make a / C.C.L. de Grenier, Esq., Food Controller, Bahrain.a point of associating with himself in this search M two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate' 1 .

The granting of rewards is legally at the discretion of the court; but as a general rule rewards amounting to half the fine imposed should be given in cases of the nature referred to above* The Agency, Bahrain, 17th March 1942 to The Indian Assistant The Adviser to the Bahrain Government The Food Controller*IWA- jAK' t - sr No. Bahrain, Dated, March 27. 1942. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sik, I have the honour to inform you that I have today received instructions from His Highness asking me to purchase for the state 60,000 hags of rice from India and to arrange for it to he shipped to Bahrain. His Highness considers that this purchase is necessary in order to obtain a stock of rice in Bahrain as was done at the beginning of the war and also in order that the public may benefit by the sale of this rice by the government at the price obtaining at the time of its purchase. His Highness assumes that as the war continues the price will rise. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.'374 The Agency, Bahrain, the 28th March 1942 To The Adviser, Bahrain Government* Memorandum Reference your letter No*496-SF dated the 27th March 1942 in which you informed me that you have received instructions from His Highness to purchase for the State 60,000 bags of rice from India and to arrange for its shipment to Bahrain* 2. I discussed this matter this morning with His Highness, Shaikh Abdullah and yourself* You said you would endeavour to purchase 50,000 bags of rice at Karachi at once and I promised my assistance in securing shipping . space for the transport to Bahrain of this rice. I pointed out, you will remember, that shipping space was restricted and that it would be impossible to import 50,000 bags of rice in the course of a single month. I suggested that in the Civil Requirements List for May (which is due very shortly) provision should be made for 20,000 bags of rice; and I further suggested that, to avoid swelling unduly the amount of tonnage which we ask for during May, the Food Controller should be asked to reduce requisitions under other heads such as piece-goods etc. 3. In this connection His Highness mentioned that piece-goods were being exported from Bahrain to Iraq and other neighbouring territories in considerable quantities, and he expressed disapproval of this practice on the ground that it reduced stocks in Bahrain which would be invaluable / ifif the shipping position deteriorated. Export of goods from Bahrain (other than goods which are merely transhipped) can only take place with a permit from the Agency. Applications for such permits (known as Re-export Permits) are scrutinised in the Agency solely from the currency point of view e.g. whether our dollar exchange is likely to be affected by the transaction. If there is no objection to the re-export from the currency point of view a permit is granted with the follow ing additional words '’provided the Food Contr oil Authority has no objection”. if therefore Bahrain stocks are being export ed to Iraq and other places it is with the express permission of the Food Control authority. 4. - In the past the view has been taken that there is no objection to the export from Bahrain of goods of which an adequate supply remains in stock. To stop such export would have two disadvantages - (a) the exporter would lose the con siderable profit which he makes out of these transactions and (b) the exporter* s business connections outside Bahrain would probably cease to do business with him. Bahrain trade is largely of an entrepot nature and, taking the long view, it would be a pity if that trade were lost. At the present mo ment, however, another factor is to be considered. Stocks from India. Replenishment of such stocks takes up shipping space, and for the next two or three months all shipping space available to Bahrain should be used for foodstuffs and, in particular, the rice which the State is purchasing. 5. I am not in a position to give advice on this matter as I have not studied the situation with sufficient thoroughness. I suggest, however, that the Food Controller should for the next two or three months issue Export Permits only in respect of goods which will not be replaced from India, and that the shipping space thus saved should be used primarily for the which are re-exported to Iraq or other / Government’sNo.C/386 The Agency, Bahrain, the 30th March 1942.

Dear Sir, X enclose herewith, as desired by you, © copy of the statament which was recently lent to me by the Eastern Bank, Bahrain. Yours truly, Political Agent, BahrainNo: PA/FC/ THE CUSTOFHOUSE: BAHRAIN: £5th March, 194£., 7th Rabia.I., 1361., To: - H.B.M 1 8 Political Agent, BAHRAIN: MEMORANDUM:- FOOD POSITION: In reference to the position of the State of Bahrain as regards food supplies, the position is this: in general terras we have imported enough of the principal commodities to last six months, which, I suggest, ia as far ahead as one can reasonably see. 2* * So long as we ensure a six months 1 stock in Bahrain, it is well to allow the importers to export as much surplus as they may wish, because they thus gain enhanced profits. If export s were totally stopped the locals would refuse to import; anofSen the Bahrain Oovernment would have to import; and, as the Government cannot do such work as successfully as the merchants, it is well to permit them to export their surplus, especially remembering that so many of the merchants are not Bahrain subjects. Our last effort at creating a Government reserve, though justified by the uncertainty of the situation, narrowly escaped being a financial failure, owing to a falling market. (j The present situation is worse; because Government cannot ^ import from Java or from Rangoon direct, but would have to bay from stocks now in India, if the necessary permits could be^ pbtained. Government could not buy cheaper than the merchants because the Food Control in India has been a failure. ^ J&gt; It is inevitable that prices will go up in Bahrain consistently with Indian prices. This must be recognised, and Higher Authorities must consider some measure of relief on this account. For instance, I calculate that the cost of the daily food of an employe of the intelligentsia type has increased by 95^ since the outbreak of war. &amp; The outstanding danger to the food position of Bahrain is the laek of transport from India to Bahrain. For some long time there have been slight steamer facilities for Indian food stuffs from India to Irag, as most of such space has been reserved for military requirements; and the foodstuffs which go to Irag from India have passed on native craf£, and will continue to do so. Hence, such craft are not available for Bahrain, apart from the difficulty of the monsoon weather. Consequently, Bahrain has to rely upon such steamers as the B.I.S.N.Coy.Ltd., can produce; and this must not be forgotten. 7 It is therefore my considered opinion that, so long as the nterchants of Bahrain continue to carry good stocks( which must be carefully watched), and are prevented for profiteering in Bahrain, but are given a free hand outside Bahrain, and there is adequate transport for the renewals of such stocks, there is no need for Government action in the present situation, but It ought to be clearly pointed out (as I fear it is not) to the big ccnsuming companies outside Bahrain, such as the CASOC, and Petroleum Concessions Ltd, and to some extent the EAFCC, that they cannot rely upon the local market to supply their wants; and such firms should take precautions on their own account to ensure a good stock on hand for their own needs. Later on, it is possible that the question of ’’unwanted mouths” may arise, as it is clear that the needs of Bahrain nationals must FOOD take precedence. ETC. LLER.No.C/388 . The Agency, Bahrain, the 30th March 1942 To The Adviser, Bahrain Government Bahrain Memorandum | #€in, I enclose a copy of an interesting report on the Food Position in Bahrain sent to me by the Food Controller. 2. Para 2 of this report, in regard to the restriction of exports, expresses a view which is prima facie at variance 3 . I agree with the observation made in para 6 of the report that the real danger to the food position of Bahrain will come from lack of transport facilities between India and Bahrain. I consider that every effort should be made to develop transport by native craft. Such transport may not be possible during the Summer on account of monsoon conditions, but we already have stocks of essential foods in Bahrain sufficient to last through the Summer, and the danger period may well be in the winter of 1942. If steamer facilities are no longer available then, and existing stocks of food stuffs have run low, Bahrain will be in a precarious position if no native craft are available to bring supplies from India. This problem deserves, I consider, the earnest consideration of the Bahrain Government. 4 . I disagree with the observations made in para 7 of the report in regard to supplies for the personnel of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and Petroleum Concessi Limited. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company and with that which His Highness the Shaikh expressed at our dis my memorandum No.C/374 dated re relevant / Petroleum- 2 - Petroleum Concessions Limited are dependent for certain of their supplies on the Bahrain market, and this is greatly to the ad vantage of local merchants. They could, however, arrange for direct shipment of their requirements and, if they are not to be driven to adopt this course, they must be allowed equal access with Bahrainis to the local market. Moreover, when the Monthly Civil Requirements Lists are prepared, allowance of shipping space is granted to the various merchants from whom these # Companies purchase their supplies; and this constitutes further justification for allowing these Companies their quota of available supplies. Finally, the production of oil is an essential war industry, and the supply of foodstuffs to the personnel of these Companies must be continued at all cost. My views in this matter are, I understand, shared by His Highness the Shaikh. Political Agent, Bahrain.HEAD OFFICE: 122. LEADEN HALL STREET, LON D 0N.E.C.3. TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS: GRAY. CODES USED.

V/ill you please let me know whether you concur in the suggestion made in para 5 of the note. Sd. 3.B,Wakefield. Political Agent, Bahrain.Summary of the position regarding control of exports from Bahrain. 1 . There are two forms of control on exports from Bahrain. The first f exercised by the Agency, controls the export of goods of non-Empire origin or interest. It is exercised to prevent the loss of dollar and other foreign exchange. Export permits from the Agency are required for the export of all goods of non-Empire origin or interest other than goods manu factured or produced in territories contiguous to the Persian Gulf which are regarded, for the purpose of export control, as being of Empire origin. Such permits are either refused, granted unconditionally or, sometimes, and particularly in the case of Japanese piece goods, granted subject to the Food Con troller having no objection. Cargoes intended for re-export and marked as such in the country of origin are not affected by this control. 2. Interchange between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company of equipment of non-Empire origin urgently required for the conduct of their operations is controlled separately by the Agency,and is allowed on a loan basis. Accounts of the interchange are submitted by the Bahrain Petroleum Company quarterly. 3 . The second form of control is exercised by the Food Controller under powers granted to him in the Food Control Order. He controls the export of all foodstuffs for the purpose of maintaining adequate stocks in Bahrain. In practice this control has been extended to include the export of all manufactured articles and commodities both of Empire and non- Empire origin. The control is exercised by the scrutiny of shipping bills by the Food Controller before they are passed by him as Director of Customs. The special permits mentioned in para 2 of the Food Control Order are not, in practice, issued as such. 4 . The Food Controller has no legal sanction for the exercise of control over the export of manufactured articles / andand commodities other than foody and an addition to the order is required. It is suggested that the following paragraph be substituted for paragraph 2 of the order issued on the 19th December, 1939, by the Political Agent, Bahrain, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by Article 4 of Regulation No.2, of 1939, issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 23rd September, 1939 x- Para 2. * The export from Bahrain of all foodstuffs, manufactured articles and other commodities is pro hibited except with the permission of the Food Con troller. ' The note under the existing para 2 should remain. 6 . The new paragraph does not make it incumbent on the Food Controller to issue export permits and he can continue to exercise control by scrutiny of the shipping bills as before. oOoConfidential No.C/430.

It suits their methods to export most of their stock from their Bahrain stock. The heaviest trader in this direction is Abdulaziz Aly A1 Bassam, a commission man, who does a large R.E. business on the mainland. from Bahrain will, temporarily, restrict the scope of Dhamanmal Isardas 1 trading at Qatif, but will not restrict tie trading of A.A.Bassam, since his goods are previously consigned to the mainland. Such a restriction of trading implies a restriction of profit, since much more profit is obtainable outside than inside Bahrain. The same argument applies to every other merchant, but Dhamanmal Isardas ask for special consideration on account of services to the Government. Thus, Government is asked to assist one private treder to make a larger profit. I suggest that such assistance, if granted to one, should be granted to all. is that (excepting cardamoms and cinnamon) the stocks are saleable in Bahrain, but more slowly and at less profit than if exported.

Enclos&gt;' ’ 74 Dear S|r: We, the undersigned, are piece goods merchants and importing large quantities of cotton textiles annually. The bulk of these goods— making up approximately 80 % of our total imports— is being sold to outside merchants and only a small proportion consisting of about ZO'% of our sales is disposed of for local consumption, the local market being very small and limited. Unfortunately, since a fortnight back, the Food Controller has suspended the re-exportation of cotton goods from Bahrain. As a result, -we are threatened with considerable losses, because of the fact that we have accumulated large stocks of piece goods which are entirely unsuitable to the local requirements and have no outlet here but must be sold for re-exportation. On the other hand, a greater part of these textiles is composed of various dyed clothes which are subject to serious deterioration, if stored for a long period, owing to the nature of the dyes used for their colouring. Consequently, and in view of the grave situation in which we have thus been placed, we have found ourselves obliged to make this representation to you and request you to kindly consider our case with a view to allowing the re-exportation of piece goods as heretofore.

Please refer to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of my memorandum No .C/374 dated 28th March 1942 in which I referred to the opinion expressed by His Highness that export of piecegoods from Bahrain was undesirable as it reduced local stocks which would be invaluable if the shipping position deteriorates later this year* Subsequently, I understand, the export of piecegoods from Bahrain has been to a large extent, if not completely, stopped by the Pood Controller* 2* The veto imposed by the Food Controller has been of great use as it has arrested the wholesale export of piece- goods which would otherwise have occurred and has also given us an opportunity to take further stock of the position* 3* I understand from a number of merchants whom I have interviewed that stocks of piecegoods in Bahrain are very considerable and that, in the case of certain categories of ’ goods, they greatly exceed the quantities required for local consumption over a period of 6 months. I also understand that certain categories of piecegoods e.g* coloured prints or dyed goods, deteriorate very rapidly if kept in stock for a period of more than two or three months* 4* I cannot see that any useful object would be served by compelling merchants to hold stocks of goods which will deteriorate; nor do I think it necessary to hold in Bahrain a greater quantity of other piecegoods than is necessary to fulfil local requirements over a period of 6 months* Replace ments of piecegoods are still coming from India in satisfactory / quantities-2- © 74 quantities and I think it would be wise to allow from time to time the export of piecegoods surplus to what may be decided as being local requirements for 6 months. 5* If His Highness agrees in principle with the views expressed above I suggest that the Pood Controller should be authorised to permit the export of perishable piecegoods surplus to 3 months local requirements and of all other piece- goods surplus to 8 months local requirements* I understand that he is in possession of figures showing total stocks of piecegoods in Bahrain and the names of merchants by whom they are held* It will not be easy, but should be possible, to insist on each merchant retaining such proportion of his stocks as is necessary to ensure that the aggregate of reserve stocks is kept at the desired figure while the balance is allowed to be exported* 6. I understand that price control is limited to sales of goods for local consumption and does not apply to sales of goods for export* We should continue to follow this principle, I think, since, if merchants can make big profits from the sale of goods for export this will compensate them to some extent for reduced turnover and for the necessarily restricted profits which they make from the sale of goods for local consumption* 7* Please let me know in due course of any action taken as a result of this reference* r Political Agent, Bahrain. , \ \I 77 D.O.

I beg to attach a statement showing (a) the commodities required for consumption within the Trucial Coast. As regards (b) which is for re-export to Sa*udi Arabia. Of these six commodities very small and negligable quantity is being exported to Sa*udi Arabia each month which does not, so far,exceed one ton. Therefore I have omitted showing the export of these commodities to Sa'udi Arabia. 3. The figures given to me by the local authorities as being required for consumption within their respective dhaikhdons are not all correct but include the quantity which they usually re-export to Iran and other places other than the Trucial Coast. Therefore I have added another column showing the quantity which I consider is reasonable for consumption the in each Sheikhdom. This is based on/nunber of inhabitants and [ the figures of exports from India and Dubai to each Shaikhdom on the Trucial Coast. The figures in black show the figures given to me by each shaikh while those in red show the amount I consider reasonable for each sheikdom. 4. ABU DHABI. I sent a letter to the Shaikh asking him to send me the details required. He was not present and as l di( not get a reply in time I sent a car with another letter 1 asking him to send me the reply with the messenger. The Shaikh was out in the desert looking for fresh water. He sent his brother to Abu Dhabi to collect the information and kept my messenger with }&gt;im in the desert. Today I received his reply which is vague and does not answer my enquiry. He said ' The total2 « fc© quantity of foodstuffs required monthly from India is one thousand tons ,f . To ask the Shaikh again would mean another delay and the reply may not also be correct or satisfactory, iherefore I made enquiries from the Hindu and Persian merchants who export these commodities to Abu Dhabi both from India and the iracial Coast and wrote ip them in the statement as being ci reasonable estimate for Abu Dhabi's consumption© These figures do not include re-^ports to other than Abu Dhabi*s District© 5 * DUBAI, under Dubai, I have given the figures (i) the actual consumption in Dubai District,(ii&gt; the quantity required for re-export to Qatar and (iii) the quantity which is required for re-export by sea to the rest of the Trucial Coasto The total of these three items is the quantity required for consumption in Dubai and re-export to Qatar and the rest of the given Irucial Coast and does not include the quantity fTywa* in the statement for each Shaikdom separately© 6.

About this time last year we had a lot of trouble in regard to the scarcity of Indian wheat flour in this State; but I was able to save the situation by diverting into Bahrain sundry cargoes said to be intended for the mainland of Arabia. I asked for power under the Food Control Order to enable me to continue to do this, should the necessity arise; but I do not think that it was granted. The same position has now developed, but a little more acutely in view of the tightening-up of restrictions in India; and my expectation of a cargo of two thousand bags of wheat flour from Karachi has been disappointed. This was to have been shipped by Hajy Muhummad Marzuk hither to Eajy Abdulaziz Aly A1 Eassam. In view of the fact that in Bahrain we have barely a week’s supply of wheat flour, and no wheat to be milled into flour, I should be most grateful if I may enlist your good offices towards ensuring the issue of the necessary Export Permit in Karachi, so that this quantity may come forward. again in the near future to invoke your assistance towards a similar service. While thanking you for this interest,it may be necessary Believe me.

Bubject: Shortage of wheat flour in Bahrain. The stock of wheat flour in Bahrain on 11th April 1941 was 2500 bags of b] cwts. each estimated to last until 24th May 1942 at a rate of consumption of 1700 bags per month. Only 176 bags have been received since the lasx. big shipment on 26th March 1942. 2. Position now is that only one week's supply of wheat flour remains, abnormal amounts having been purchased during the last two weeks to victual pearling boats for the opening of the pearling season. There is no stock of un milled wheat. 3. A shipment of 2000 bags of wheat flour expected from Haji Mohammed Marzook of Karachi has not materialized. The exporter alleges that he has been unable to obtain an export permit in Karachi. 4. On 27th April 1942 I telegraphed a certificate to the Foreign Trade Controller Karachi to facilitate export of a further 4000 bags by Lalji Laxmidas of Bombay Bazaar, Karachi to Dhamanmal Isardas of Bahrain. This request has, I understand, been referred by the Foreign Trade Controller to the Government of India.

From this correspondence you will observe that one or two minor changes were made by me in the figures which you supplied; and that the Political Resident, in forwarding the figures to the Government of India, consolidated the separate figures for Dubai, Sharjah, Qatar, Abu Dhabi etc. and gave an aggregate amount as being the total require ments of each commodity for the Trucial Coast and Qatar as a whole. The Political Resident took this step as it is known that during the summer months country craft do not ply between India and the Trucial Coast, and all goods imported into the Trucial Coast from India during that season come by B.I.S.N. Company boats to Dubai or Sharjah. 4 4. If the aggregate quotas suggested by the Political Resident are accepted by the Government of India, the Shaikh of Dubai (and poss ibly the Shaikh of Sharjah also) will have to be told exactly what pro portion is to be allowed to go out to the various other Sheikhdoms. This, however, is a matter for the future, What is required now, urgently , is the figures of monthly requirements of the Trucial Coast and Qatar of barley, jowar, dal and gram, as quotas are also to be fixed for these.

Controller,Bahrain, prepared a detailed report on the subject supported by comparative figures showing the price of goods pre-war and on the 1st January 1942* Ihe con— vV 5 \ elusion reached was that the cost of living in Bahrain between 1st September 1939 and 1st January 1942 had in creased by 145 to 150%. That is, the cost of living on the 1st January 1942 had become two and a half times \ what it was before the war. • 3 . Since January 1942 the price of many commodities has further increased very greatly - e.g. sugar (which used to come from Java), rice (which came mainly from Rangoon) and piece goods (which came from Japan). The cost of living in Bahrain at the present time is approx imately 200 % greater than it was before the war; that is, the cost of living here at the present time is three times what it was before the war.

In this connection may I, with deference, venture to remark that the economic conditions referred to began with the imposition of a very heavy import duty on tea and sugar, and piece goods, of which very large quantities used to be imported into Southern Persia, mainly through Bunder Abbas. This situation has steadily worsened in years as exports fell off and the country was drained of its gold, and later, of its notes by sales to traders in specie in D 8 bai and Bahrain, all of which sales must have been at a considerable discount. 3. The main exports from Southern Persia to D T bai and Bahrain were wood, charcoal, wheat, barley, gr^m and dh$ll, and of course, vegetable ghee, Ifarpets,~and livestock. The latter still continue; but the former have practTically ceased. 4, In exchange for its exports to Bahrain the same dhows took away some rice, a little tea and sugar, and a goodly quantity of piece goods. The local war situation has made it necessary to restrict the exports from Bahrain of piece goods to the value of one-third of its imports, and also of foodstuffs to one-sixth of the imported value, i.e. fifty per cent in all, the reason being the need to conserve local stocks. The mercantile communities in Bahrain are most anxious to export to Iran much greater quantities than the above, as this avenue of trade is extremely profitable to them, and the Persians are equally anxious to buy from Bahrain because stocks in D f bai are very small. 5. Full particulars of all commodities exported to Iran are obtainable from my monthly statistical reports which, I feel sure, will indicate the annual value of Bahraini imports during recent years. If any further detailed information is required, no doubt you will very kindly inform me.Telegram From To No.476. Dated and Important G.T.C.(S). Residency Agent, Sharjah.

Also; staple foodstuffs may be exported by the same nukhudha to the value of one-sixth of the import. It is likely that H.H.The Ruler may review his decision, and allow exports of piece-goods up to two-thirds of the imported values, since a complaint has been submitted by local non-Bahrain traders that this restriction does not enable them to trade as profitably as before. 3. Local traders in piece-goods have lodged statements of their stocks, which are now being checked. After checking, it is proposed to decide the quantity of each item that is needed for six months 1 consumption in Bahrain, after which the trader will be permitted to export to mainland Arabia and to Iran the surplus. 4. The local stocks of spices have been similarly treated; and, in view of the summer climate and risk of loss by deteriofration local importers are being encouraged to export to the mainland of Arabia their surplus stocks. These arrangements appear to be quite acceptable to the local traders, and were appreciated by the Persian nukhudhas. 2- H.H.The Ruler has ordered that, as regards the Persian Believe me, Yours sincerely, To: - E.B.Wakefield Esquire, I.C.S., The Agencv.

Examination of these reports shows that since July 1941 the following amounts of rice in tons have been imported into Dubai and Sharjah:- 1941:- 1942 :- July 640 January 109 August September October November December 106 895 887 1107 388 February 1475 March 104 April 407 For the ten months since July 1941 average monthly imports of rice into Sharjah and Dubai together have only been about 611 tons.

Controller, Bahrain.► V i No . ^ --sr of 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 22nd R/Awal, 1361 April 9, 1942. H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- In connection with Director of Customs’ memorandum 'hut No. PA/FC 'dated 25th March 1942 addressed to you regard ing restriction on the export of piece goods, I have the following observation to offer. His Highness Shaikh Salman is keenly interested in preventing the Bahrain bazaar becoming depleted of piece goods which would rapidly result if merchants - usually foreigners - wetifreely allowed to export their stocks to Iraq, where they make excessively large profits. His Highness has suggested to me that piece goods should be dealt with in the same manner as essential commodities such as foodstuffs etc., that the Government should ascertain exactly what quantity of piece goods is stocked in Bahrain and should then only permit the export of amounts and types which can safely be spared. This arrangement sounds suitable but is difficult in practice as to make it effective would require a stock taking of all piece goods in the bazaars. It would how ever be possible for the Government to require merchants to send in a written statement showing their stocks, reminding them that a false statement would render them liable to prosecution. If this was obtained, and regarded as dependable, export of piece goods could be strictly limited to goods of which a large quantity existed in Bahrain.I have discussed the position with the Director of Customs and am in favour of dealing with the matter in the way which I have mentioned. As almost all the persons concerned in this trade, including many who did not associate themselves with the complaint, are foreigners I should like to obtain your views on the subject. I enclose a memorandum from the Director of Customs, No. GT/FC dated 5th April, 1942, for your information as it refers to your suggestion that goods which can only be replaced from India should not be exported from Bahrain. Adviser to the Government. EnelNo: Gt/FC/ THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: 5th April, 1942., 18th Rahia.I., 1361., The Adviser, The Government of Bahrain: MEMORANDUM :- . . (f j., .l|V In reference to/jfbur note/&lt;Sovering the enclosure of the Political Agent's Nos C/374 and 388 (which are returned herewith), it is not quite clear that it is His Highness' definite decision that (as suggested hy the P.A.) a ll_^ 00 ^ s replaceable fr om Ind ia should not be exported hence, at least until the Bahrain Government has accumulated a food reserve sufficient for one year. Since this decision will have a definite effect upon the local mercantile community's activities, I should like to have this decision clearly stated. 2. Conformably with your instructions arrangements heve been made for the local Indian firm of Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas to import, on behalf of the Government of Bahrain, 45,000 bags of Karachi rice, and 5.000 bags of ballam rice* provision has been made for shipping space for 20,000 bags of Karachi rice; and it is proposed to repeat this quantity in the next two ensuing months of June and July. As it seems probable that the rice will come forward in varying quantities on each steamer, I have arranged to pay for each consignment landed here at cost plus commission. 3. The P.A. 1 s remarks regarding 'Export Permits' (not Re-Export Permits) are not correct in detail. Such permits have been granted by the Agency for non-Empire goods only , and have included American imports. There has been a good eupp stock of commodities in Bahrain; and the view taken was that exports might be permitted, especially to the R.E. ports while shipping facilities continued. Recent events have completely changed the position; and since (1) Java sugar and Rangoon rice are now cut off, and (2) continuation of shipping faci lities cannot be guaranteed, and (3) the Government's reserve stock will take up considerable shipping space, it has been decided not to permit exports hence of imports replaceable from India. Here it is to be noted that during the~past six months - exports hence to Iraq of piece goods and certain foodstuffs have increased considerably an unusual development. 4. Here it is important to remember our treaty position wiu^ the Saudi-Arabian R.E. ports under which R.E. cargo passes through Bahrain, This cargo consumes shipping space; and I can see nothing to prevent a Bahrain merchant from using such a port, and thence re-exporting to Iraq, and so defeating our local restrictions upon exports from the standpoint of conserving shipping space. This point is cogent. 5. It seems impossible to develope transport from India by native t^craft to Bahrain as the local owner of the few deep-sea craft is now moving commodities from India to Iraq very profitably; and, although a Bahrain subject, he would be unlikely to place Bahrain's needs before his personal profit. 6. It is agreed that the two mentioned foreign Oil Companies may be afforded equal access with Bahrainis to the local market, as is now done; but they must not be given preference over Bahrain subjects' needs. One has not produced any oil at all, and the other has such an advantageous concession that its production would not be affected by a restricted local market of native produce. ^uju?

Perhaps Your Hxcelle cy thought that the embargo has taken place in all th~ coast countries but I can s y no, as the ships which cav~y cargo to our country HL Sharjah stopped only three months ago. Cargo which was consigned to Dubai belonging to our merchants was delayed at Bombay and Karachi, resulting in troubles for us and in high prices.

Thanking you and asking God to give Great Britain victory over her enemies. Please accept our respects.Confidential No.C/512-34/3o To, /bo British Agency, Sharjah, 24th LLay 1942© The political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum Reference your Express May 1942. Letter No.C/679 dated 1 ° the 18th 2o I beg to explain that the figures of imports into Sharjah and Dubai for ten months since duly 1941 cannot be taken as correct figure on which one can base future requirements. As you may know the merchants had large quantities of rice stored in their godowns before the war started and their prices were less than the rice they were importing from India. Therefore the quantity imported during the war was less than the actual require! -ments of the Trucial Coast. As the quantity imported was less th that the actual requirements, the merchants used to make up the deficiency from the quantity they had in their stores ancftthis manner the quantity they had in their stores began to decrease and the demand for more imports increased. Rice is also imported in large Xts quantity into the rest of the Trucial Shaikhdoms besides Sharjah and Dubai. For this reason I accepted the figures as correct estimate of actual needs of the tahole population of the Trucial Coast taking into consideration the number of the population and not the amount of rice/tHah*|wab imported and for which we had no correct figures for tfche^ifHole Trucial coast. The merchants have been complaining since ^pst year that they were not getting till the goods they have been ordering owing to shipp- i^ig difficulties and that on certain occasions they were compell- ed A the goods in India to avoid extra charges while the goods were awaiting shipment indefinitely. 3. The Trucial Coast supplies the inhabitants(including bedouins) of the area from Khor fwalba to Khor al Udaid near Qatar on the Coast and from Ibri to Dhank in the Dhahrah to Buraimi Oasis the population of which is estimated to be not less than 250,000 souls. As it is well known the Arabs of the Trucial Coast depend chiefly on rice and dates. They take two meals during the day and each person require at least one pound of rice for the two meals or half a pound for one meal. Thus if we estimate thfi population of this area to be 224,000 souls we find that we require ICO tons daily or 3000 tons monthly. 4. It is not clear to me from the Government of India's telegram No.3698 dated 11th Way 1942 how 3030 tons would provide for about,■ 800,000 souls. *0 Residency Agent,SharjahConfidentialo iul Ko .C/502-34/3.. y British .agency, Sharjah, 21st May 1942 • v...

The Shaikh of Dubai prohibited the export of rice to all parts except Qatar and Trucial Coast with effect from 1st April 1942. During your recent visit to the Trucial Coast I mentioned to you the large quantity whicliy/ls being exported to Persia. Before your departure you instructed me to draw the Shaikh's attention about the export of sugar from Dubai which I did. The Shaikh then consulted the Persian merchants who said that they had large quantities in stock and that large consignments were on their way to Dubai in sailing crafts© They complained that if sugar was prohibited from being exported to Persia many merchants,who imported this commodity for the sole purpose of exporting it to Persia / would become bankrupts’. To restrict the exports of sugar and tea^ the Shaikh imposed an export duty of Rs.10/- on a bag of sugar and Rs.5/- on a chestf of tea.

Reference your confidential memorandum No.C/502-34/3 dated 21st May 1942. 2. I am not in a position to lay down specifically how many bags of each commodity should be retained, and how many bags should be allowed to be exported. But the following principles are being followed in Bahrain, and I suggest that they might be followed also in Dubai and Sharjah. 3. In regard to essential foodstuffs which do not det eriorate i.e. rice, sugar coffee or wheat, six months* supply should be kept in reserve. By six months' supply I mean the amount which is required for consumption over six months in Dubai, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, and which is normally im ported through Dubai or Sharjah. 4. In regard to foodstuffs which deteriorate e.g. spices or wheat flour, only three months supply should be kept. 5. In regard to piecegoods, qualities which are not used locally may all be exported. In regard to other piecegoods, three months' supply should be kept. 6. In regard to tea, exports should be restricted to what has been normal in the past. 7. As long as supplies for the periods named above are kept in reserve, all surplus stocks may be exported. 8. In regard to sugar, I am very surprised that the price (as reported by you in your letter No.C/524-34/3 to the Air Liaison Officer, R.A.F. Bahrain) is as much as Rs3/10/- per maund of 9 lbs. In Bahrain, where price control is enforced, * Java sugar is only Rs2/- per maund of 9 lbs. It seems, there fore, that Dubai merchants must be making enormous profits out of sugar. 9. In regard to exports from Bahrain to Persia, the- 2 - /u(? position is that any Persians bringing fuel or foodstuffs to Bahrain from Persia are allowed to take out in return piece- goods up to 2/3 of the value of what they have brought in and foodstuffs up to 1/3 of the value of what they have brought in. Thus the value of exports from Bahrain to Persia can in no way exceed the value of imports into Bahrain from Persia. / 10. I do not want instructions to be given to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai about these natters. They must do what they think, best. But my advice is that they should follow the principles outlined above if they want to ensure that in the months to come their subjects do not suffer from serious food shortage. Supplies from India must obviously diminish later on. Java, Singapore and Ttengoon, the principal sources and existing stocks in India of these commodities are bound to become exhausted sooner or later. of sugai^ coffee and rice respectively, are all in enemy hands; Political Agent, Bahrain /® ml Telegram Q* From Political Resident, Bushire.

Memorandum . / ** Reference your memorandum No.C/469 dated 25th April 1942 with which you forwarded for comment a letter from the Shaikh of Sharjah. 2. Ever since the export of foodstuffs from India was placed under control the Trucial Coast, like Bahrain, has had difficulty in obtaining supplies. The difficulty has not been one of shipping space (in respect of which our require ments have been met adequately, even generously) but of ex port permits. I have not been informed officially how the 7 export system works, nor do I know in respect of what articles of food export permits are required. 3. I can only make a conjecture as to the reasons why Dubai has been more fortunate than Sharjah in obtaining supplies from India. Ity conjecture is that Dubai merchants, having more capital behind them and more enterprising agents in Karachi, have been more successful than other merchants in purchasing export permits. Certainly Dubai merchants have recently been successful in obtaining supplies of sugar which were denied to Bahrein merchants; and the reason undoubtedly is that they can afford to purchase export permits whereas Bahrain merchants, owing to local Price Control, cannot afford the extra expenditure entailed. It is of interest to at record that^the end of May the price of 1 mound (9 lbs.) of t , in Java sugar in Dubai was Jb3/10/- whereas/Bahrain it was Rs2/-. tu Ice- 2 - /n In Dubai stocks of sugar are plentiful, and the high price there is definitely not due to shortage of the commodity. Since the cost price of sugar in Karachi is the same both for Bahrain and Dubai merchants, and freight charges to Dubai are certainly not greater than they are to Bahrain, and Customs charges at Dubai are less than in Bahrain, I think the explanation of the difference in price can only lie in the factum of bribery. If Sharjah merchants are unable to compete successfully with Dubai merchants, I do not think it matters very much. The important thing is to get supplies to one of the two ports, and at present Dubai is managing to get supplies. (f Political Agent, Bahrain/i i' No.C/788 .

Reference para 4 of your Memorandum under reply, ‘‘The Government of Indian argument is as followss- Assuming the population of Bahrain to be 125000 (the Government of India were v/rong in this assumption), we know from Customs figures over a long period that 480 tons of rice per month is all that is required to feed this population. If a quantity of 480 tons per month feeds 125,000 people, a simple mathematical calculation shows that 3030 tons should feed over 800,000 people. And the Government of India point out^ as the population of the Trucial Coast is nothing like as much as 800,000 the figure of 3030 tons must be excessive. 4. The Government of India's argument is not entire ly sound, and I have pointed this put to the Political ^ lit Resident (vide my telegram No.330 dated 14th May 1942). At the same time I think your estimate must be excessive. If imports into Dubai since the Var have been, as you say, less than requirem .nts, and if large stocks were accumu lated before the War, then obviously imports into Dubai before the vvar must have been greater than requirements. Can you ascertain from Customs figures what was the monthly / average- 2 - /r2&gt; average of imports of rice into Sharjah and Dubai from, say, July 1936 to July 1939?

H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. H Memorandum:- Last week several Bahrain merchants approached His Highness Shaikh Salman asking him to help them to trade by obtaining facilities for them to export goods, chiefly foodstuffs, from India. His Highness discussed the matter with me and Shaikh Abdulla and suggested that I should have a talk with them. On 23rd May I discussed the matter with the following merchants, Mohamed Tayeb Khunji, Abdul Aziz al Ali al Bassam, Yusuf Fakhroo, Khalil al Moayed and Abdulrehman Zayani who were sent to see me by His Highness. 2. The^ explained that for about two months they had experienced very great difficulty in obtaining export permits for goods from India. They stated, but said that they could not raise this point officially, that it was only possible to obtain export permits by spending large sums of money on bribes to customs authorities in Karachi and Bombay and they also said that without bribery it was not possible to get their goods shipped on steamers. This state of things came into being when the export of goods was restricted to persons holding export permits. 3. Another matter which they spoke about was the practice of merchants in Karachi and Bombay selling their permits. A merchant having obtained an export permit say for 10,000 bags of sugar can sell it at considerable profit to another merchant who may sell it again to a third merchant. The eventual purchaser removes the goods as the agent of the permit holder, in fact he is the new owner. 4. The merchants asked that they should be assisted to trade by being given permits from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to export goods to Bahrain from India instead of having to obtain the permits in India. They also asked that they should be allowed 20$ profit instead of 10$ above the cost of the goods on arrival in Bahrain to cover various expenses which they could not legitimately show on their bills. They argued that the profit they make by importing goods into Bahrain is so small in comparison to profits in other ports where no price control existed that it is scarcely worth their trading between India and Bahrain. - 2 -- i5. On the following day I discussed the matter with His Highness who was inclined to favour an increase in the profit to importers of essential foodstuffs from 10$ to 15$ but he suggested that I should inform you about the matter before taking any further action. 6. I am inclined to think that there is some truth in the merchants 1 complaints about the necessity for bribery but most likely their statements are exaggerated. It is true that they can make very large profits by importing goods into other countries where no price control exists. It seems unreasonable that prices in Bahrain should be raised by 10$ according to their demand, because they are compelled to resort to bribery in India and because in neighbouring States there is no restriction on profiteer ing.

Dear Sir, Confirming our conversation of this morning, the company is willing to make available to the Bahrein Government any excess cargo space on our tankers returning to Bahrein, for the purpose of transporting food supplies for consumption in Bahrein. This is on the understanding that the Government will assume all risks and liabilities which may arise out of such transportation of food supplies. The company has asked its New York Principals what freight rates to charge. The rates should be at least sufficient to compensate for any delay which might be caused in transporting these supplies.

Memorandum . Reference your memorandum No*939-SF/50 dated 27th May 1942. 2. The abuses mentioned in the body of your letter have been brought forcibly by me to the notice of the Government of India. Similar representation.'* have also, I understand, been mads from Kuwait and 1 think, therefore, that the un satisfactory state of affairs existing at present will soon be rectified. I agree emphatically with your view that it would be unjustified and incongruous to raise prices in Bah rain in order to fill the pockets of dishonest minor officialt in India. If the present unsatisfactory condition of affairs continues I will re-examine the position; but at the moment I do not think we should rush into an increase of prices which/would be difficult to retract later. There is reason to suppose that the pressnt difficulties are only temporary though, as will be seen from what follows, it is unlikely that v-e shall again, during the war, be able to obtain supplies as plentifully as we could up to the Spring of this year. 3. In Bahrain Nature provides dates and fish; there are adequate stocks of coffee sad siogar; there is still some reserve of rice though stocks are diminishing as imports are at present below consumption; wheat or wheat flour are almost non-existent in Baiirain. Rice and wheat or flour are the main causes of difficulty in India just as they are in Bahrain. The loss of Burma rice saps it / India 1 sIndia* s internal supply by 10 per cent while heavy demands for rice are now being made upon India from Africa, Aden and other places which were formerly dependfn£ on Burma. Apart from the much reduced quantity of rice now available in India for export to the Gulf a further difficulty is created by problems of trans port. Hice is grown in the eastern parts of India but Bahrain imports it from Bombay or Karachi. The problem is to transport rice in the necessary quantities from the east of India to the western p#rts at a time when (a) the use of ports on the east coast ol India is restricted and (b) rolling stock on railways is diverted almost entirely to meeting military and para—military demands* 4. 1 have not been informed of the reasons for the present shortage of wheat in India. Possibly it is due to a poor harvest, possibly to the necessity of feeding large numbers of troops. Whatever the reason may be for the shortage of wheat and rice in India, that shortage does exist and it will not be possible for Bahrain to obtain supplies of these commodities on the sa r ce scale as heretofore. In India supplies of rice and wheat made available to the public are being reduced by 10 per cent. A similar reduc tion is likely to be made In aupolioa of these two commodities for the Gulf. Quotas for Gulf Ports including Bahrain are now being fixed. 1 had hoped that Bahrain’s monthly quota would be 6500 bags of rice and 1700 bags of wheat flour. It is likely, however, in view of what I have said above, that the amounts of wheat and rice made available for Bahrain will be 1C per cent less than the figures mentioned above. These quantities of course are for local consumption only and are irrespective of re-exports. 5. What has been said above concerns solely the quantity of supplies available for Bahrain from India. I have not In this reference mentioned shipping difficulties* It cannot be over looked that the shipping position may deteriorate and that v/e may be unable to secure transport for the quantum of supplies / earmarkedearmarked for us in India. une step towards providing against whis difficulty hds now been taken; and I have communicated to you separately the offer of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to place surplus space on their tankers at the disposal of the Bahrain Government for the import of foodstuffs . if also we can obtain the 10,000 bags of wheat for which the Bahrain Government have placed an order in Canada we shall have done everything possible to ensure our food position for the future. 6. I shall be glad if you will inform H.H. the Shaikh of the general position and of the difficulties with which we are faced. ihe difficulties are undoubtedly there but I do not think there is any need to take a gloomy view of the future. Bahrain has, in responsiole positions in India, some very good friends who will ensure that we are treated as generously as possible. I fljyself am fully aware of the importance of this question and am on all occasions and in every way possible rtpresenting Bahraini claims to favourable treatment. If supplies in India for Indians are reduced by 10 per cent I do not think we can justifiably complain if supplies from India for Bahrain are reduced to a similar extent. I shall do my best to ensure that supplies for Bahrain are not reduced to a greater extent than this and that the supplies which are made available to us are shipped regularly from India. ■ it % o l f Political Agent, Bahrain. fMNo. C/849* Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th June 1942.

BritconsulConfidential, Almost all the merchants of Bahrain are bitterly complaining against the Food Controller’s misjudgment in fixing the rate of different commodities for sale in Bahrain, Owing to the mis-management of the Food Controller, the merchants have t stopped importing any goods into Bahrain because if they import the goods they have, as they say, to sell them at a loss. The export of goods from India is extremely difficult and it is not also easy to export anything without a licence, but the merchants’ agents can manage to export any kind of goods to Bahrain and other places by paying bribes to the officials in charge of * permits. export jauxixx/In Bahrain the Food Controller who pretends to be ignorant of the state of affairs in India allows only 10 % profit to the merchants according to the inyoices which come from India in which the amount of bribes paid for facilitating the export is not mentioned. They say that there is no reason why there should be a shortage of flour in Bahrain whereas flour is very abundant^and other places. The people of Bahrain are now bringing flour in half bags from A1 Khobar and Ojair for their consumption. They quote as an example of the difficulty of exporting foodstuffs~ from India without payment of bribes that the Manager of Dhamanmal Isardas who left for India about 3 months ago for the purpose of purchasing rice, etc. for the Bahrain Government has not so far been able to ship for Bahrain a single bag of rice or flour whereas every ship that sails from India for the Gulf brings J foodstuffs for Dubai, Kuwait and other places. The merchants say that they are ready to import flour or any other kind of food stuffs provided that the Food Controller allows them to add to the price a reasonable sum which they say they must ivariably spend in India on obtaining export permits.Telegram Q.

Bahrain Food Supplies. 2. In regard to flour please see Foreign telegram No.420N May 18th stating that export of 2000 bags of flour had been licensed of which licence for 1000 bags was being issued in the name of Lalji Laxmidas. If this flour is not yet afloat presumably arrangements can be made as suggested by Political Agent Bahrain with the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 3. As for rice instructions were issued to Karachi on May 10th for licences for 1000 tons for Bahrain in names of various exporters. 4. This should enable Bahrain to carry on pending instructionf \ which are issuing very shortly in regard to quotas and operation thereof.No,C/876 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 22nd June 1942. To The Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Memorandum. I informed you two days ago that I had asked the Government of India through the Political Resident to issue immediately an export licence to Lalji Laxmidas for 2000 bags of flour and 6000 bags rice. Yesterday I informed you that this —: request had been strongly recommended to the Government of India by the Political Resident and that I expected to receive the sanction of the Government of India almost immediately. 2. I have just received a telegram from the Government of India saying that quotas for Gulf Ports will be fixed very shortly and instructions will be issued at the same time in regard to the operation of the quota system. Pending the time when that system comes into force Bahrain*s requirements are, the Government of India say, amply covered by export licences already issued. 3. The Government of India state that on May 18th licences were issued for the export to Bahrain of 2000 bags of flour. An export licence to export half of this quantity was granted in the name of Lalji Laxmidas. The Government of India say, with some reason, that if this flour has not yet been shipped to Bahrain what is required is not more export licences but shipping facil ities; and these have now been arranged through the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 4. In regard to rice the Government of India state that on May 10th they issued instructions for the grant of licences for the export of 1000 tons (i.e. over 11,000 bags) to Bahrain. These licences were issued in the names of various exporters. 5. Since the date when the export licences in respect of flour were issued only 144 bags have arrived in Bahrain.6 J -2- • Since the date when the export licences for rice were issued under 2000 bags have arrived in Bahrain* // 7* FVom these facts and figures it is perfectly clear . ••''W to me that the Bahrain merchants have not been co-operating and that their statements about the difficulty of obtaining y export licences are utterly false. fhe merchants have obviously been waiting to be allowed an increased margin of profit before importing rice and flour into Bahrain* 8. I understand that you are seeing merchants today. I suggest that you inform them of the facilities granted by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and that you instruct them to get into touch with the Bahrain Petroleum Company* s agents in Bombay and Karachi - Messrs* Caltex (India) Ltd. It would be interesting to know what excuse the merchants advance for not having shipped the rice and flour for which they obtained export licences. If their explanations are not satisfactory it might be hinted to them that the Bahrain Government will take over entirely from them the responsibility of importing foodstuffs into Bahrain.

The rice that used to come by dhows after the Indian mansoon was so large that the B.I.S.Company used to reduce the freight of their ships so as to compete with the dhows. Besides the import of rice from India large quantities of rice . used to be imported from the other Persian Gulf ports not only to Dubai and Sharjah but also to other places on the Trucial Coa^ On account of the war restrictions no rice could be imported and sold by nakhudhas of dhows in the manner described above nor do I think it would be possible henceforward to get rice from other % neighbouring states. 4.

The possibility of interference with shipments from Calcutta as a result of enemy action must be accepted* similarly a serious shortage in wheat supply in India makes it impossible to provide for the full staged requirements of the Arab States, though here a 10% cut only has been imposed in the recommended figures for flour quotas* sveiy effort has been made both to provide ibr the needs of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms to the limit of Indian capacity, and the results stated have been achieved only at the expense of certain other consuming countries which had placed demands on Indian production. There can therefore be no possibility of increas ing the quotas now fixed until there has been important improvement in the war situation. On the other hand any serious deterioration in the supply position in India may necessitate a revision of these quotas in a downward direction* 3. During July importers in the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms may place orders, within the limits of the quotas fixed, on regular suppliers at the Indian ports who are known to then and who are in a position to fill orders, but as from the 1st August the following system will be adopted in order to obviate the possibility of abuses at either end in the administration of these quotas* / Lists of established exporters at each of the Indian ports auw Being prepared and will shortly be forwarded shewing the proportion of export trade which each of them noimally handles* Political Agents after consultation with local importers will inform the sxport Trade Controllers at the Indian ports of the names of exporters in these lists to whom licences for stated quantities should be granted, taking care to keep within (1) the total monthly quota fbr each commodity (2) in the case of rice the fixed fraction thereof for eacu Inoian port* ImportersImporters should simultaneously place their orders on the nominated exporters. Political Agents should do their best to ensure that orders are distributed amongst established exporters in India roughly in proportion to their share in the export trade. Additions to the list ©I exporters may be proposed subject to the condition that it can be shewn that firms so proposed have been regularly engaged in the export trade to the Persian Gulf in the past# No proposal for an export monopoly such as was recently made from Kuwait can be considered# recognised that the operation of this sch&amp;ne will pj.ace an additional burden on Political Agents and their staffs. It is, however, essential in present circumstances to call for this additional effort in view greasing gravity of the general supply situation.

These quotas will be operative from 1st July 1942. 3. It will be noticed that a part of the rice quota is marked for shipment from Calcutta. This is due to the fact that heavy demands on Indian railways for military freight render it impossible to transport rice by rail from Eastern India to West Coast ports. 4. It has not been possible for the Government of India to provide in'full for Bahrain's normal requirements of rice and flour. The provision made should, however, be adequate if wastage is avoided.

In sending this information the Political Agent will have to ensure that his requisitions are kept within (1) the total monthly quota for each commodity, and (2) in the case of rice, the fixed fraction thereof for eacn Indian port. At the same time as the Political Agent sends this information to the Export Trade Controllers in India, Bahrain importers will place their orders on the nominated exporters. 6. In this connection I should add that I have been instructed to endeavour to ensure that orders are distributed amongst established exporters in India roughly in proportion wo their share in the export trade. Ho export monopolies will be granted. On the other hand, additions to the lists of exporters may be proposed if it could be shown that the firms so proposed have been regularly engaged in the export trade to Bahrain in the past. 1 have also been instructed to ensure that shipping requirements programmes are correctly com piled to accord with the operation of the quota system.

If arrange: ents can be made to ship this by tanker is it likely that an export permit could be obtained for this amount? Adviser to the Government. S.Z.Urgent .

If the Bahrain Government purchases 2000 to 5000 bags of wheat in India, and this quantity is exported from India to Bahrain, the amount so exported must necessarily be debited to Bahrain’s monthly quota of wheat/wheat flour, which is only 134 tons. As the full quota of 134 tons monthly is required for current consumption in the form of wheat flour, it would seem undesirable to make the suggested purchase of wheat. 3. Your proposal would have had a good chance of acceptanc€ a few months ago when the limiting factor in respect of exports was shipping space. Kow, however, the primary limiting factor is shortage of food supplies in India, and I am afraid there is no chance of Bahrain being allowed more than its fixed quota of wheat/v/heat flour.

Dear Sir, V ^3 Reference my letter CON-131 dated 5th July, 1942. The information furnished you by the above letter was based on a cable communication dated Bombay 3rd July, from friends, reading as follows :- 'Export license already issued to Lalji Laxmidas for flour and rice which we expect despatch 6th ,f The vessel on which they expected to despatch this shipment was obviously the 'Captain A.F.Lucas', which sailed from Karachi on 6th July. She has since arrived at Bahrein without cargo for the Bahrein Government. A subsequent cable from the same source dated Bombay, 7th July, reads as follows 'Further investigation reveals Lalji Laxmidas utilized export license he obtained to ship provisions by 3.1. steamer (stop) Has no further license for Flour or Rice, therefore unable ship anything on No. - ' This latter cable refers to a vessel lying at Karachi on 7th July, and so far as I know is still there. Further than the above we have no information regarding the flour and rice that was to be shipped on behalf of the Bah rein Government via the Company’s tankers. It is presumably en route by B.I. steamer and I trust will arrive in due course/ From the above it appears that the use of the Tanker 'Captain A.F.Lucas' wes not required in this instance. If in the future the Company’s Tankers can be utilized to advantage on behalf of the Bahrein Government on the conditions stipulated in my letter CON-105 dated 23rd June, I shall be glad to under take the necessary arrangements immediately upon receipt cf your advice. ^f -Mo.

In this greediness lies the present weakness of the system of relying upon imports by merchants. The system of issuing Ration cards to all who apply for them is working steadily; and every application is checked against the last Census returns, a card being issued for so many adults (two children form an adult) as compose a household. I expect that possibly fifteen thousand cc;rds will have to be issued; but at present very many folk are living upon their own hoarded stocks. Arrangements have been made for supplies to native residents at Awali, and inhabitants of the villages, which are working satisfactorily. It is estimated from the last census that at least 74,710 adult rations will be needed every month. The quota sanctioned in India is not sufficient to provide the above rations to this number, the quantities working out at: Ricellj. lbs. per iponth Wheat:.... 4. lbs. per month. Sugar..... 3.6 lbs ' n , and we have no guaranty that the quota*s quantity will come forward. Consequently the future outlook for Bahrain is by no means good; and the rations will have to be amended to: Rice: S.rubas a month. ^ /* lU Wheat: 1 ruba ' ' r f Sugar: 1 ruba ' n ~ q (k Of course the issue of one ruba per month of wheat is absurd; and the inference is that the people in future will go without bread practically all the time; and their physique will deteriorate, unless a supplementary supply of wheat can be obtained from other sources. Efforts must be made towards that end; and now we are awaiting the arrival of ten thousand bags of Iraqy wheat which will arrive here somewhen; and we must hope that it will not be as dirty as Iraq wheat usually is. Will you therefore note that I am changing the ration to the above quant it ies^ and it is t' that it will be appreciated by the public.

No. itfS-SolSF of 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 18th Rajah, 1361 August 1, 1942, His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - With reference to the correspondence regarding food supplies for Bahrain and your letter No.C/957 dated 2nd July, 1942, stating the quota which the Government of India allowed to be exported from India, I have the follow ing comments to make. You were informed by the Director of Customs that the monthly consumption of rice in Bahrain was 5,000 bags, about 385 tons taking 13 bags to one ton. This figure is incor rect. It was not arrived at by a careful examination of imports during previous years but was apparently a rough and inaccurate estimate. I have taken the figures of imports of rice into Bahrain, excluding re-exports, from the Annual Trade Reports, for nine years, until year 1938-39, and from these figures it is evident that the monthly local consumption of rice is 736 tons or approximately 9568 bags. The quota was reduced by 20$. If the original estimate provided by the Customs for the purpose of the quota had been correct the necessary amount for Bahrain, after 20$ reduction, would be 590 tons or 7670 bags. Owing to the estimated monthly consumption being under estimated and the reduction by 20$ the quantity allowed for Bahrain is considerably less than is necessary for the needs of the people Adviser to the Government.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

Dated 8th August 1942. 193 . .4389- : V Reference para 3 of Foreign Express Letter No.4389-N/42 dated 26th June 1942 in which it is stated that, in connection with the operation of the new quota system, 'Political Agents after consultation with local importers will inform the Export Trade Controllers at the Indian ports of the names of exporters ••• to whom licences for st n+ ed quantities should he granted.' 2. Discussion with merchants here and on the Truclal Coast has convinced me that, if the operation of the new system is not to be marred by a recurrence of the abuses which have so far defeated all efforts to regulate trade to Persian Oulf ports, additional precautions are required. So far as this Agency is concerned I consider it essential that I should give Export Trade Controllers the following information # fi) Name of exporter to whom licence is to be granted (ii) Quantity covered by licence. (lll;Name of consignee. s b (iv) Por^. of de^tir. 2 ti''n. ■'•iitLiM..SP t)*4gnment Is RE or for lov.?l conaumption.- 2 - lk\' 3. Licences issued by the Export Trade Controllers should in turn contain all this information. Otherwise exporters will be in a position to sell export licences! or refrain (partially or wholly) from using them, or use them as counters for bargaining with various importers who have placed orders with them. Unless export licences contain all the detail noted above, merchants (both exporters and importers) will have opportunities of defeating the objects of the system. JJlov 1 *-2 The enquiry whether the j?*ood Controller oan send hin 110.3 «r with one or two uuotoire poonr to a house- search may ia* split up, for the purposee of discucsion, into three heads (a; can the .rood controller search a house without the cour t f e authority? b ) can he send his Manager for that purpose? (c) Can he send the Manager with one or t wo Customs peons . 2, (a) The .rood controller derives his powers with regard to persons subject to the jurisdiction of the .Bahrain order in council from the order (dated the l*th P^uX/xX/ J » liocember 1939made by the Political Agent in exercise of / the powers conferred upon him by Article 4 of hemulation Bo. 2 of 1S39 made by P.H. under the Persian oulf States ( ihner^ency ) pi^der in council 1939. under Article 5 of Kegulation ho.8 ? the provision of Part III of the Bahrain Order in Council relating to Criminal matters shall apply to the trial of offences against the Kcguiation.Under Part m of the .Bahrain order in council (Article 14-(1] the Code of Criminal Procedure is, inter alia , applicable to Bahrain, This means that the offences against this Keelation or Orde r should be tried (and enquired into) according to criminal Procedure Code. This also shows that the criminal procedure Code is the only authority to which we should refer in this matter, under Section Police 165 of that code, only a rate*i t officer is authorised, in special circumstances, to search a place; and as the Pood Controller is not a Police o fficer that does not confer any powers upon him. in India customs &amp; Axcise officers, of course, enjoy the powers of search but those powers ar« oonfarred by apacific Acta none of which i a applicable.’ to Bahrain, m tha abaauca of any Acts or Kagulationa authorising tha pood Controllar to soar oh a housa, tha only posaibla oourso is to Got undar • ux;u.ei bection 96-(l)-3- - 2 - @) ^7o Crirainal Procoduro Code wiiich emjjowora the Court to i 33 uq a coarch-warrant 'if it considora that the purposes of an enquiry , trial or proceedinga will be served by a general search or inspection.' a request for a warrant fey- the jj'ood Controller will be sufficient /V to move the court; and tne court can issue one but without it the search conducted by the Eoou Controller will be illegal. (b) The illegality of a house-search without a warran t by the jvood controller having been established, the only logical answer to the question of his sending the Manager for that purpose is in the negative, but the Food Controller can ostain a search warrant from the Court in the name of the Manager. The issue of a search warrant under section 96-^ij Criminal Procedure Code is subject to the provisions of Section lol Criminal Procedure code which lays down that the provisions of sub-oactions 77 &amp; 79, inter alia , of the Criminal Procedure Code shall apply to all search warrants issued under Section 96, ur.p.C. under Section 77 Cr.P.C. a search warrant is ordinarily directed to a Police Officer and under o.79 Cr.P.C. that Police Officer can direct it to any other officer. But ao the jj'ood Controller is not a. Police Officer, oven if the warrant is directed to him, he cannot direct the same to any other officer, namely his Manager. At the same time, s.77 Cr.P.C. further provides that the Court may direct thfc wa-rrant to an&gt;, other person or persons ( i.e. other than the P^lice- O-^cc^, ^- 1 ^-) its immediate execution ig necessary and (i i) No Police-Officer is immediately available . Ard if Food Controller applies for a search warrant in favour of hie wr.n* C or, it can he issued to him under £.77 Or.p.c. aa_a ny other person . The condition V.at-5- its immediate execution ic necessary can serve the &lt;r basis of ti.e issue; and the other restriction, namely, that no Police-Officer is immediately available can be waived under Article 13, Bahrain order in Council, according to which, where any Act, law or order has been made applicable to Bahrain 'such Acts, laws, orders, forme, Refutations or procedure may be construed or used with such &amp;ltor?»tions and adaptions not affecting the substanco as may bo neoe soary having regard to local circumstances'. It might as well be argued why the Pood Controller should not be regarded as a Rolice officer under -nrticle 13 of the Bahrain Order in Council and have the power of search under Section 165 Cr.P.Code or of redirecting the search warrant iosued in his favour to any other officer under s.79 Cr.P.Code, But that would mean stretching this 'opportune' article too far - an article to which recourse should not bo had ordinarily but only in circumstances where the rigidity of the British or Indian law is likely to cause unnecessaiy delay, inconvenience or, owing to loca.1 conditions, miscarriage of justice. As a. search warrant can be issued bp the Court with all haste and secrecy in the name of the Manager under Section 65-(!) Or.R.Code read with e.q.IOO and 77 Cr.p.code only with a slight adaption of s.77 Cr.p.code, it doosyseem necessary to interpret the provisions of the Cr.p.code so liberally and invest the Rood Controller with powers which ordinarily are not conferred upon him. 1 c ) With regard to the Manager's taking one or two Customs peo ns with him to conduct a house-search, it would be more appropriate and legal for him to call noon two or more respectable inh a bitants of the locality hn which the place to be searched is situate. That would 08 strict ly in accordance with s.l03yCr.P.Code. There is no objection to his taking the Crotons neons with him ¥(Vfr) but the cuatone peons should not he the only Lenreh v/itnQe&amp;ej*. 3. In brief, the Pood Controller should apply £or a search warrant in favour of the ja&amp;m£&lt;ar. it can ia* issue under s.s.96-(l), 100. and 77 Cr.P.Code; and the Manager should call upon two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the house to be searched i&amp; situate under e . !03yCr .P.Codc , toeing a.long with hiin, if he deems fit, his customs peons ac well. k list of the things seized should be prepared and signed by the ^rfrsono making the search and by the persons witnessing(JuUui-.

Q c&gt;k tJ*J\y c- -Tv |&lt;, k'- * On 14/6/42 Mr. Ward Anderson came to see me on the subject of food supplies. 2. In regard to food for staff personnel Mr.Anderson said that they were now getting the majority of their supplies from South Africa but that country was now tightening up export con trol and before allowing further food to be exported they want-[ • | \ ed to know what supplies Bapco had already in stock, what their monthly requirements were and what v/as the scale of ra tioning. Mr. Anderson is working out figures in order that he may supply this information. He added that it was diffi cult for them to get food from the U.S.A, because that country ' insisted on purchases for Bahrain being made inside the ster ling bloc. Enquiries were also being made in Australia but so far he did not know the result. Bapco’s food supplies come,of course,on tankers. 3. Mr. Anderson told me that in addition to staff per sonnel the Company employs about 2000 Bahrainis and 250 Indians. He said that the Indian employees were complaining that they could not buy locally their requirements of food. / TheyThey were specially upset by the absence of flour, Mr, Anderson asked who was responsible for seeing that the Company's local and Indian employees got a proper supply of food. H e said he presumed that the Political Agent and the Bahrain Government were between them responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of food for the local population. But, he said, if the Company were made responsible for feeding its own em ployees (a task which they hoped would not be given them) they could not themselves make the necessary arrangements but v/ould simply ask the Political Agent to arrange for the export licenses etc. necessary to obtain the supplies required. The only way, he said, in which the Company could help would be in regard to shipping space; and the Company would willingly use their tankers in order to bring food to Bahrain. He said that Company tankers come to Bahrain from time to time from Karachi or Bombay and he said that any avail able space on such tankers would be at our dispos al for the transport of food. He added that freight charges would be levied in order to com pensate for time spent on loading unloading etc. He also said that the goods could only be trans ported at shipper 1 s risk. 4 . Mr. Anderson said that a tanker was due to leave Karachi at the end of this month and he asked what steps should be taken to get in touch with the merchants who had wheat or rice to export. I told him that the names of such merchants could be obtained trom tne Foreign Trade Controller, Karachi, and he promised to instruct the Company's agent to with these merchants at once. 15/6/42.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00038a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/171</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00038a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/171</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 1/A/48 III FOOD CONTROL.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1942/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-12-21T18:21:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (278 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file, except where enclosures of an earlier date are filed after their relevant covering letter, and terminate in a set of notes (folios 249-279).
