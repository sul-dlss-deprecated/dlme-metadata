Object being to avoid discouraging Philby from completing his journey to India it would be better that any action in respect of his passport should be left to Indian authorities (despatch paragraph No.3 of my telegram dated July 16th). Action to arrest and deport him should be taken only if J^e gives trouble in Bahrain or attempts to slip away to another destination. .X 3. Your telegram No.2564 dafed July 17th.

I will telegraph further as regards your paragraph No.2. Me must be careful to avoid JUstiiiable criticism of the treatment of him and despite Ibn Saud’s opinion I would hesitate to sav his conduct hitherto warrants his being treated as a mental patient immediately on arrival in India.

Immediate Government of India telegram No.2681 dated July 14th I am advised that it is doubtful whether under a deportee could be compelled to go to a particular destination if he elects to go elsewhere. In these circumstances it is in any case preferable that no action should »be t aken against Philby. till he reaches India. Consequently it is desirable to avoid any act that might deter him from his intention of proceeding oi his own accord to India and we should therefore refrain _ from searching his luggage in Bahrain even at the risk that he may dispose of some of his papers there. powers Persian Gulf Defence Regulation 6 of 1939II Telegram 3.

This man is now in Saudi Arabia. He was formerly a member of the Indian Civil Service, from which he retired in 1925. Since that time he has been a source of embarrass ment to His Majesty^ Government owing to his anti-British attitude. Since the outbreak of the present war this has become more acute and a serious view is taken of his disloyal and defeatist propaganda. It is considered undesirable, therefore, that he should be granted any further facilities for travel in the East, and, if his passport is presented for any purpose at your office, it should be impounded.^ and an emergency certificate valid for the single journey to the United Kingdom issued in its place. No action should, however, be taken which is likely to result in Philby taking alarm prematurely and returning to or remaining in Saudi Arabia. J. W. STAFFORD, Chief Passport Officer.

The correspondence focuses on when might be an appropriate moment to apprehend Philby, so that he may be deported back to Britain. Proposals to apprehend Philby, who is believed to be carrying letters and articles of an anti-British bent in his luggage, in Bahrain, are abandoned due to uncertainty over whether the Persian Gulf Defence Regulation contained sufficient legal power to enable the deportation (f 11). Correspondence from the Foreign Department of the Government of India reports Philby’s detention upon his arrival at Karachi (f 16). Included in the file is a notice from J W Stafford, Chief Passport Officer in the Passport Office of the Foreign Office, dated 27 June 1940, which contains details of Philby’s appearance, his background, and instruction to impound his passport (f 20).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Harry St John Bridger Philby</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Passports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000059#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
