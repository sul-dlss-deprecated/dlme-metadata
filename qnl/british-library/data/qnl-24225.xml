Dear Sirs, 7/e have received your letter of 13th instant and in reply to your statement that we have complained to you after two months, we have to inform you that the stock is not in our possession but is lying in bonds and only a part of the consignment was taken delivery of for the godown for sale in Bahrain. In the beginning we could not dispose of a single and it was after a long time that we succeeded in selling few tins, which unfortunately were returned to us on the next day of their sale. Your interpretation of your telegram of 7th November last is a complete surprise to us. Your statement that you recommended to us the price and the availability of the Margarine Ghee to Arabia is nothing but an invention as the wordings of the telegrams are very clear even to a lay man. Of the consignment received 200 tins were sent to Qatar and 100 tins to Khurramshahr, but no offer is forthcoming and the stock is lying unsold at three places, Bahrain, Qatar and Khurramshahr. Your informant that we have sold the Margarine Ghee at Rs.60/- is wrong as the stock is still unsold as stated in the foregoing paragraph. As we informed you in our letter of 2nd Inst, we have placed the whole consignment to your account and shall charge you all those monies as have been incurred by us on this deal.

Your statement that we have informed Abdulrehman Albaker, about our having sold most of the ghee and the remaining to be sold in a week* s time is nothing but a r^e lie as we have never written to him on the subject. As we informed you before that out of 28 barrels, one barrel has been given to a merchant who is selling in retail and has upto now sold most of its quantity. The^remaining 2? barrels are lying in our stores?,as we could not succeed in getting a buyer for the whole lot, for the obvious reason that a large quantity of cheap oil and ghee had flooded the market which would not give chance to your high priced ghee. In the beginning the price of ghee was fairly good in the market but there was no buyer to buy the whole lot. Naturally you cannot expect us to thow the lot on some body’s head and we had no other go but to wait for the better opportunity. As the misfortune would take it the' price of ghee suddenly collapsed and it became almost impracticable to dispose of the remaining barrels till date. From the correspondence we have had with you so far, ypu^. will observe that we have never requested you to ship us 28 hsj^els of ghee and you have acted all along on your own responsibility. Fven aft®^ arrival of the ghee we refused to accept the same and it was after your great insistance by cables and by letters that we agreed to accept thf goods on your account. Considering you as one# of our friends we trie'-d our level best to do you good and to save you from any^Oasible loss, but on the contrary/'the harvest we are reaping from this favour is clear from the utterances in your letter and- this we must say does not befit for such a Fig firm like yours. We have learnt a lesson from you and this will add to our experience which will help us in thS^TutUTe while dealing with firms like yours. We must now frankly inform youthat the responsibility you hold to us for supplying the useless Margarine ghee cannot be shirked by you under the pretence of your 28 barrels o^ ghee and we still hold you responsible for the amount recovered from us .for Margarine ghee. If you fail to settle our account first ^shall be compelled to auction ' 9 your 27 barrels of ghee making part adjustment_ against bur account and' the balance recoverable in the court of law. Please therefore bear in mind that any actioiv-that you may contemplate to take for your goods, you will do so,at-your_cost and^risk.

We are now referring you to your cable of 13 th March which reads as under 'AVAILABLE 100 TONS 2NDGRADE RICE GIF BAHRAIN FREE EXCHANGE SHIPMENT MARCH/APRIL CONFIRM' and to which we replied as per our cable of 14th March last as under 'YOURS THIRTEENTH ACCEPTED CREDIT AMENDED CONTACT STDBANK' As per the Letter of Credit which was opened in accordance with your above cable, 100 tons of rice were*required to be shipped during March/April 1948 but we are greatly surprised to find that only 47 tons have so far been shipped and for the*remaining 53 tons no news of shipment is forthcoming.

Margarine ghee. We are not satisfied with the statement submitted by you and we reiterate that responsibility is purely yours for supplying us such rotten stuff. We fail to understand the source of your information that Abdulrahman Albaker &amp; Ali Hussein Nima are our representatives. We know it for certain that the former is your partner. As for Ali Hussein Nima, we are surprised to learn from you that he is 6 our representative. If you care to go through our^corresponded you will nowhere find the name of Ali Nima, referring him as our representative. We are really much surprised at your baseless statements, which can hardly be called as sane. We still stick to our contention that if you fail to make good the loss we have sustained, we will hold your ghee us part compensation for same, and the balance to be recovered through the court of law. We would in your interest advise you to come to fair understanding and settle the account of Margarine ghee at the earliest date. It has pained us much to learn that at the time of your own interest, you are calling us Muslim brother and reposing confidence that we will not play dirty trick with you. We are pleased to state that the beginning of dirty trick was from your side and if you had considered us your Muslim brother you would have surely not duped us but would have advised us not to enter into deal. We are true to all those Muslims who are true to us, but if one tries to mislead us, we know how to deal with such people. P.T.O. ■■■■■■■■■■■■IMeserrs. Mmo.6 fakhroo &amp; £ros#.

Lear Sir, 4th February 1948 MARGARINE GHEE. fll Our Bankers Messrs. Imperial Bank of Iran, Bahrain inform us that they have a Bill for £2465-13“4 drawn by you on us and request us to make payment thereof. We are surprised that inspite of our opening a Letter of Credit for £2435/- you have drawn on us by Sight Draft a further amount of £30-13-4 and this we cannot understand what for the additional amount is being charged from us. Further we draw your attention to your cable of 8th November last which clearly states that each tin is to contain 36 Lbs. of Margarine Ghee and in accordance to which advice we mentioned in the credit 'Each tin containing 36 lbs.' But from your Invoice we find that the shipment is short by 423 lbs. costing £33*10.0. We would therefore in fairness to the deal request you to instruct the bank to deduct £30-13-4 charged in excess of the credit amount and £33*10.0 for the short shipment, in all £64*3*4 to enable us to accept the bill. Please treat this as urgent and do the needful without delay. Yours faithfully, Ahmad Fakhroo12th .February 48.

We have insured your goods with Lloyds Insurance and as they are newly known by us we have no sort of reduction from them, and as regardsf retght, Company does not give rebate for the Persian Gulf. This is what we take it in our opinion theVeason of your claiming reduction of £.65 or otherwise there'is no error in the account. It is really a sort of shock to us and to the Bank when you refuse to pay, since the Bank at this side taking our Guarantee on all, we hope before receiving this letter, everything will be settled in good ways.

TO CLAUSES AS PER REVERSE’ x* » num'im'vm As Asrnt*.A/' I MOHAMEDRAZA SULEMAN VERSI of Ear es Salaam in Tanganyika Territory an Indian Merchant professing the religion of the Shia Khoja Ithna-asheri sect of Islam solemnly affirm and state as follows :~ 1. I am a partner in the firm of 'M.Suleman Versi' who trade at Ear es Salaam aforesaid, Mombasa in the Protectorate of Kenya, Zanzibar and elsewhere as (inter alia) Merchants, Importers, Exporters, Commission Agents, The other partner in the firm is Mohamedsaleh Suleman Versi. |he said firm is in this affidavit hereinafter referred to as ’’the Plaintiffs.” 2* The Plaintiffs (whose business wg.s first established in 191o) are concerned or engaged in trade with most countries of the wo rid. 3 . I am conversant and have throughout dealt personally with the matter concerning which the dispute with Ahmed Fakhroo &amp; Bros, of Bahrain (who in this affidavit are hereinafter referred to as ’’the Eefendants” ) over 28 barrels of ghee sent to them per s.s. 'Tairea.” has arisen. 4 . Previously to this dispute the Plaintiffs had traded with the Eefendants. 0 T7 I first met Mr. Abdulrehman Elbakir (hereinafter referred to as ’’Elbakir”) in Karachi in about November 1947. He informed me he was en route for East Africa. He suggested he should call in to see the Plaintiffs when he came to Ear es Salaam as we might do business together. I concurred. When I I concurred. When I dt£€&gt;* 6 , ,A 8 « 9. //&gt; returned to Dar es Salaam Albakir was already there* I allowed him to use a part of the Plaintiffs' office for a short time* Ultimately he proceeded to Mombasa where he undertook certain business in which the Plaintiffs were concerned jointly with Albakir* Two of the matters which he dealt with while at Mombasa were (a) the shipping of the ghee the subject matter of /'ZOO this dispmte and (b) the shipping of tins of Margarine ghee to tfte Defendants. The Plaintiffs originally intended to despatch the 28 barrels of ghee the subject matter of the dispute to the firm of Hussein Niamah of Banaibe#'* Elbakir warned us against dealing with this firm who he informed me were unreliable and suggested we should send it to the Defendants lo sell for us in Bahrain on a commission basis. He said that the ghee would fetch approximately twice the price in Bahrain that it could be purchased for wholesale in East Africa* Elbakir strongly recommended the Defendants credit and standing and it was on this recommendation that I arranged for the goods to be despatched to the defendants* The said 28 barrels of ghee which contained and weighed were purchased by the Plaintiffs Zanzibar Office* The ghee was best Somaliland ghee and in this affidavit I hereinafter refer to it as 'the said goods.' On or about the 12th day of January 1948 the said goods were despatched by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants to Bahrain ex Mombasa per s.s. Tairea. A sight draft for £1,540* was annexed to the shipping documents. Copies of the said shipping documents are contained in Appendix 1 of this Affidavit. All correspondence which the Plaintiffs have had with the Defendants (except certain letters which have been lost) and which consists^of original letters and cables ^from the Defendants to the Plaintiffs and of carbon copies of letters and cables from the Pled, ntiffs to the Defendants is contained in Appendix II to this Affidavit.3 10 . 11 . 12 . 13. 14. 15. ^ 16 . ^ XT. The terras upon which the said goods were despat&lt; Defendants are set out in Appendix II, On or about the 22nd day of March 1948 the Plaintiffs were informed by their bankers (Standard Bank of South Africa Limited) that the said sight draft has been disho-noured. I discussed the matter with Elbakir who suggested the goods should be released to the Defendants and the documents made ’’free.' He again praised the integrity and business ability of the Defendants and states that he would personally guarantee the Defendants in this transaction. As the goods were already at Bahrain I decided to make the best of a bad and do as Albakir suggested. Appendix II contains the correspondence pertaining to this aspect of the transaction. The Defendants then accepted the goods and the terms on 17th day of April 1948 (see Appendix II). Subsequently the Defendants were instructed to sell several times, at the best price obtainable, (in particular on 26th day of April and 9th and 19th May. 1948), The Defendants have never accounted to the Plaintiffs for the said goods or the price thereof. The said goods have never been returned to the Plaintiffs. On the 6th June 1948 Albakir wrote to the Plaintiffs stating that he had received a letter from the Defendants in Arabic stating that most of the said goods had been sold and the Defendants would be accounting to the Plaintiffs shortly. This letter has been lost but I remember the contents thereof. The Plaintiffs referred to this letter in correspondence passing between them and Albakir which is contained in Appendix III to this Affidavit. The Plaintiffs have never been concerned in any transaction re lating to margarine ghee with the Defendants. In or about December 1947 the Plaintiffs exported to Yousuf AbduXrahraan Fakhroo 1200 tins of Margarine ghee. These werei* despatched in response to a cable from 'Fakhroo' the telegraphic address of the said Yousuf Abdulrahman Fakhroo (who is hereinafter referred to as 'Yousuf” )in Appendix IV to this Affidavit which contains all the correspondence as before relating to the margarine ghee transaction between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. 18. The terms upon which the ghee was sold to the are set out in Appendix IV. The Plaintiffs complied in full with all their obligations under the contract* The said margarine ghee was certified as fit for human 19. 2 o • 21 . M 22. consumption by the appropriate authority in Bahrain as shewn in Appendix IV* At the same time identical margarine ghee was shipped in the following quantities to the following persons. Dhamanmal Isarda. Hussein Nemah. Both of Bahrain* Copies of Shipping documents relating to the export of the said margarine ghee are contained in Appendices to this Affidavit as follows :- SOJCd* y+uSi+f bxport to the i**a# • . . . Appendix V. Dhamanmal Isardas. • • • • • Appendix VI* Hussein Nemah. ••••• Appendix VII* The said Isardas and Nemah both honoured the Sight Draft in full and no complaints whatsoever as to the quality of the said margarine ghee have been received by the plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs have throughout regarded themselves as having contracted with the said Yousuf with regard to the margarine ghee transaction. They have no knowledge of the business relations between the said Yousuf and the Defendants and have conducted certain correspondence in relation to this5 transaction with the Defendants purely because the. said Yousuf apparently wished for reasons of his own that such correspondence should on occasion be so conducted* 23. The correspondence emanating from the Plaintiffs had mostly been signed by me* Some letters have been signed by Mr.Hassanali Giga, the Plaintiffs Assistant manager at Dar es Salaam who has throughout been in my confidence relating to the matters dealt with in this affidavit, is conversant with the facts set out herein and was present at the interviews which I had with Elbakir hereinbefore deposed to. 24* In all the Plaintiffs transactions with the Defendants they have considered themselves bound by the Indian Contract Act. the plaintiffs have themselves, no knowledge of ottoman law and would not enter into any transactions which was to be affected by such law. 25. Everything which I have herein deposed to is true to the best of my knowledge information and belief. 30 th day of July, 1950.
