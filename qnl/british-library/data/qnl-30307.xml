During tentative discussions with Political Officer Salalah and my Superintending Engineer it was suggested Sultan of Muscat preferred that labour for this project be sent from Muscat instead of from Aden. Sultan's wishes in this matter are appreciated but you will realise that in view of extremely short time available — less than six weeks — and over-riding % military necessity which requires this aerodrome be in full commission before May it will be quite hopeless to complete aero drome in time available if labour is to be sent from Muscat.

Not only would administration difficulties be simplified if defence troops can be despatched from Aden instead of Masirah but in fact we have no reserve troops in Masirah area and time would not permit Balucnis being obtained from outside my command.

Following may be of assistance. 2. (a) There was indication that local hills attract monsoon rain. (b) Fresh water is marked next to 'Dark x^int of Shuwamiyah' on Admiralty chart of South East Coast of Arabia. (c) A fresh water basin is said to exist inland from Has Ja{/a between Ras Shuwaraiyah and Ras Qarwao (possibly lake marked on above chart at 17° 54» N 56° 15 r E). (d) Water can be obtained by digging in the wadis of Hallauiyah, biggest island of Kuria Muria and British territory. 3. DEFENCE. There is no objection to employment of Aden levies. Sheikh of small tribe in immediate vicinity of Shuwamiyah has previously been friendly but inhabitants to N.E. around Sauqrah Bay were inclined to be hostile. Representative now chosen by Muscat Government accompanied above reconnaissances and was specially selected because he is Sheikh of tribe around shores of this Bay. Area is sparsely inhabited and I do not think you need anticipate any large raids, say by 100 or more rifles. Depending therefore on number of standing guards, two platoons seems suitable minimum force. Sultan*s levies cannot be spared but it would be judicious to employ a few local bedouin as askars. I presume air support could always be obtained quickly in unlikely event of real emergency. 4. Can Commanding Officer bring about one thousand dollars for local unofficial payments on my advice ? If not, I can and expenditure could be adjusted later. - PoliticalInter II-B/3(o) Telegram From Political Agent, Muscat. R.A.F., Ras al Hadd. (via Sliarjah).

The tribes there mostly consist of Jenn’ba, but thei section is quite different from the section of Jena’ba at Sur Some of Bani Wahiba were also among then. As regards water Saiyid Mahmud does’nt quite remeber that there was any. ./ater for them was to be supplied from the men of war.

It nas now seen definitely decided that this work is to proceed and it is necessary lo decide upon the most expeditious and economic way of carrying out tne work, • In tne course oh tne above quoted conversation, the political Agent gave several reasons why it -would oe preferable to organize tne work from Salad ah and not from muscat as was intended when the question of the extension was first raised nearly twelve months ago, shd undertook to discuss the matter with.His Highness the Sultan of kuscat slid Salalah on next visit ing Sadadah, and it is considered tnat if it can oe arranged for • is highness, through his State 3u 0 ineer, to carry out the work, it will oe by far the most satisfactory method. Hie question of the method of payment for the work carried out presents seyeral difficulties and it would oe appreciated if the political Agent will negotiate with His Highness on this point, out in the view of the Air ministry Directorate denerad of Y/orks, the most satisfactory arrangement would be for a lump sum figure to oe agreed for the execution of the complete job including supervision and to assist, it h a s oeen agreed that the aircraft cringing Fl/Lt. Finney, the oearer of this letter, will, if required, take the 'State Engineer to Shu warn iy a to inspect the work involved. due aircraft is also at the disposal of the Political Agent., snould it oe considered advisable to return to Sad-ed&amp;h with Fl/Lt. Finney for discussions with His Excellency. I 1 he alternative to carrying out tne work on a lump sum o a sis is by the supply of .labour on a day labour oasis, and for several reasons this is not considered satisfactory, and in particular the supervision of the labour to ensure an adequate output per man presents considerable difficulty. Should it oe considered impracticable to do the work from •aaladah arrangements be made to do the work from Muscat, it is assumed if a lump sum contract cannot oe arranged that advantage will oe taken of the labour contract with Messrs.B.Rapad^e, and in order to oe a ole to advise on the amount of labour required Fl/Lt. Finney has visited the site aud is fully aware of the extent of the work involved. Should it ue decided to Carry out tne work from Muscat under the labour contract, it is pointed out tnat the R. a.F. is responsiole for providing water and atta. flour and whilst arrangements could be made for the issue of flour from Lasirah for the la’oour proceeding from Muscat and for this to oe collected oy dhows en route to Shuwamiya, it would be preferred if all food including flour be provided by the Contractor, alsow it will not oe possible to supply water, and if the local water supply is not considered suitable, the Contractors should tale water with him from Luscat. (In this connection it is understood that the water• available at Shuwe^iya is suitable for the labour which would be used if the work is done from Salalah). ./ith re 0 ard to tools, mahruffas, siiovels etc. a certain number al'e available at Salaial and Masirah for loan to the labour, out in view of the recent he a .vy rains and consequent repair work required to tne landing strips at both pli- ; ces and further extensions now required, it would oe preferred if tools could be provided.

IJear Sir Geoffrey, • r '' / 4 Would you please refer to your telegram No 194 d*ted the 27th January, 1945, concerning the Shuwamiyah Landing Ground ? I am forwarding copies of the correspondence as desired (and also a copy of R.A.F. Masirah^ telegram No 0*248 dated the 28th January, 1945) but feel that the opening paragraphs of letter No Aden/1971/1^8/ORG, dated the 15th January, 1945, from Head quarters British Forces, Aden, require some amplification. One of the objects of my visit to Aden in December 1944 was to find out whether the Royal Air Force intended to take up the development of the Shuwamiyah landing ground this season. It seemed desirable to try and avoid the last minute rush which occurred last year and to complete as much as possible of the political arrangements before the Sultan left for India and the Shaikh, who was then at Salalah, returned to Shuwamiyah. ' When I saw the Staff Officer, Administration (the writer of the letter referred to) on December 7th he told me that I could take it as certain that the project would not be taken up. Two days later when I saw the Command Superintending Engineer I found him under the impression that the work was to start in the very near future. I told him of the decision given to me by the Staff Officer, Administration and he promised to inform me of any further developments before I left. During the course of conversation, I pointed out to him how much simpler the whole operation would be if conducted from Salalah but that this depended on the R.A.F. being able to supply return transport for labour as the winds in March and April would prevent the use of dhows• On December 10th I met one of the Superinten ding Engineer's staff who was shortly to take over as Section Officer, A.M.W.D., with his headquarters at Masirah and told him that I had received no further information about Shuwamiyah and asked him to let me know how the matter stood on his way through Salalah. I left Aden on the 11th December and as the Section Officer passed through Salalah a week later without seeing me, I assumed that the information given to me by the Staff Officer, Administration was correct.

My dear friend, I have the honour to refer Your Highness to my telegram from Muscat in regard to the development oi the emergency landing ground at Shuwaimiyah and to recuest your assistance in reaching a proper understanding with the Shaikh of the Beni Batahra. As Your Highness is e^are,- arrangements for the supply of labour from Muscat for the proposed work are complete and it is hoped that the required understanding with the Shaikh will be concluded as early as possible. It is estimated that the work will take approximately one month and the Air Officer Commanding, Aden is most anxious to see its completion before the approach of the monsoon. 2. The protection of all those being sent to carry out the work will be provided by a platoon of Levies which is being sent from Masirah, but , in order to ensure that the work will proceed without hindrance from the local inhabitants, it is desired that the Shaikh should undertake certain responsibilities the details of which are as follows: (a) in order to ensure that the work and all persons connected with it, are not interfered with, the Shaikh should employ ten guards who will be paid by the British Government at the agreed rate of two dollars per day with rations and carry out the following duties under his control: 1. they will do their best to prevent any unauthorised persons from entering the labour camp. 2* they will remove any person who in any way interferes with the work at the landing ground or who is found within the labour camp without authority.3?D 153 3* they will carry messages between the officers responsible for the work and the Shaikh. The Shaikhs guards will be posted outside the camp area end will not enter it unless in the execution of one of the duties described above. Their appointment will commence on the day the labourers from Muscat land at Shuwaimiyah and terminate on the day of thie departure. (b) The Shaikh is required to assist the Officer Commending the Levies in any way he can and especially by informing him of the approach of other tribes. He is also required to make it known that neither his guards nor anyone else will be allowed to enter the labour camp at night and that any person attempting to do so will be shot, (c) The Shaikh is required to do everything possibl* to assist any airmen who lend at Shuwaimiyah and to protect them and their aircraft. 3. In recognition of thses services, the Shaikh will ^ receive three dollars per day while the Muscat labour is at Shuwaimiyah and a present of three hundred dollars for himself and his people of which half will be paid now and the remainder on the completion of the work. In addition, ten of the Beni Batahra will be allowed to find employment with the labour from Muscat at the rates of pay approved for unskilled labour employed by th#NB.A.F. at Masirah. They will not, however, be given ration* and .the overseer in charge will be at liberty to discharge any of them if he is disatisfied with their work. These arrangements will form no precedent as to the manner in whibh any future requirements at Shuwaimiyah may be secured. Jjjr 4. I shall be grateful if Your Highness will kindly inform me whether an understanding on these lines can be arrived at. Your Highness* sincere friend Assistant Political Agent Muscatl •£££ From, To, AL-Husn DHOFAR 14th. Febuary, 1945 Said bin Taimur Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Mr. R.I.

I should like to point out that while the Shaikh will do his best to carry out all the points mentioned in the undertaking, it i. understood that he will take no responsibility for anything that) God forbid ) may happen to any air craft or men and the same applies to our authorities because ( as you know ) of the nature of that part of our territory. I hope that you will please explain to the men in the camp not to wander about far away from their camp and in the aerodrome area while the work is in progress. I hope that the work at Shuwaimiyah will go on satisfactorily as it was in the past and that you will find the local inhabitants there helpful. Yours sincerely, Said bin Taimur Sultan of Muscat and Oman.Undertaking by Shaikh Musellim bin Sulleyim, acting Shaikh of the Beni Batahra, in connection with the development of the landing ground at Shuwaimiyah. 1.

(b) vrill be given to the Shaikh by the Assistant Political Agent at the conclusion of the work. 2. to the ten guerds to be supplied by Shaikh Tusellim:- two dollars each per day. The guards will also be supplied with rations at the same scale as for unskilled labour • Daily payments to the Shaikh and his guards will commence from the day of arrival of the labourers at Phuwaimiyah and continue until the day of their departure. In addition to this it has been agreed that up to ten men of the Beni Batahra will be allowed to find employment as labourers at the landing ground. If any are so engaged, they should be paid at the rates admissable for unskilled labour from Muscat. Your bill should be presented to the Political Agent, Muscat, for settlement in the usual way. Yours truly. Assistant Political Agent , Muscat, at Salalah.IP 331 {&amp;&gt; From, R* I. Hallows, Ksquire* Assistant Political Agent, Muscat, at Salala^i, To, Tae Air Officer Commanding, British Forces, Aden* No. 3H/8. Dated, Salalah, the 24th. Febuary, 1945. Subject: Development of the lending ground at Shuwaimiyah. Sir, I have the honour to refer tc correspondence on the subject cited above and to forward, for your information, a copy ( with an English translation) of the agreement between the iluscat Government and Shaikh Musellim bin Sulleyim, acting Shaikh of the Beni Batabra. The principal shaikh of this tribe- Mohammed bin Sulleyim- with whom the agreement for eoe protection of the petrol store at Shuwaimiyah was signed n 1938, is at present away in the interior end not electee to return ior some considerable time. The Muscat Government are satisfied that shaikh Musellim is the proper person to act on his behalf. 2. In recognition of the services to be provided by the Shaikh, the following payments hsve been agreed to: (e) to Shaikh Musellim three dollars per day with rations; and a present of three hundred dollars. (b) to the Shaikh*a guards two dollers per day with rations. Rations will be on the same scale as for unskilled labour at Masirah and the daily payments will commence from the day the expedition arrives at Shuwaimiyah end continue until its departure. Of the present of three hundred dollars, which is for both the Shaikh and his people, half was paid on the signing oi the agreement end the remainde# will be paid at the conclusion of the work.3. The Shaikh was very anxious that any of his tribe who wished to do so, would be allowed to find employment with the labour being brought from Muscat, This was agreed tc on the conditions that (a) their number would not exceed ten, (b) the overseer would be free to dismiss them for unsatisfactory work (c) they would not receive rations and (d) that they would recei¥e the same wages as the labourers from Muscat, The first condition was imposed as the inhabitants of Shuwaimiyah are extremely wild and not unlikely to cause more trouble than they are worth as coolies. 4, Every effort has been made to keep the payments to the Shaikh pnd his followers as low as possible, but it will be realised that the circumstances under which the present work on the landing ground is being undertaken are very different from those obtaining in 1936 and 1938 when the good behavour of the tribesmen was ensured by the presence of one of His Majesty’s Sloops which remained anchored off Shuwaimiyah for the duration of the construction work. The sums finally accepted were only agreed to after I was satisfied that any further effort to reduce them would afiect the Shaikh's willingness to carry* out his responsibilities. In view of this, and the importance to any who may be forced to use this emergency landing ground, of having a friendly people to as ist them, I trust that the payments agreed to will be found satisfactory. Owing to the very short time at my disposal for completing the necessary political arrangements, and the urgent necessity of avoiding delay if the work were to be completed before the monsoon, I was unable to obtain your sanction to this expenditure before concluding the negotiations, 5. Arrangements for the payment of the first instalment oi the Shaikh's present were made with the Muscat Government: the second instalment of this present and the daily payments to the Shaikh and his guards will be disbursed at Shuwaimiyah by the Agent of Khimji Ramdas, the Royal Air Force labour contractor at Muscat. I shall be grateful, therefore, if you will authorisethe Political Agent, Muscat, to make the payments detailed in this letter so that the Muscat Government end the labour contractor can reembursed from trie Muscat Agency treasury* 6. I am sending a copy of tills letter to the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Officer Commanding, Royal Air Porce Station, Masirah. 1 have the honour to be Sir, your most obedient servant, 1 , ihtLL a Assistant Political Agent, Muscat, at Salalah* C ^ L o A-^vo c&lt;~J ~ ■Dhofar. D.O. No. SH/9. Dated, Salalah, the 26th. Febuary, 1945. 7)-t •-/ C. d ^ &lt;J( ~] Would you please rel'er to my telegram number S.3., dated the 16th. Febuary, 1945, regarding the landing ground at Shuwaimiyah ? 2. I enclose for your information, a copy of the agreement between the Muscat Government and the acting Shaikh, and also copies of the conriected correspondence. 3. When I first arrived at Salalah on Febuary the 9th., the Sultan had not returned from India and I had no definite news of the probable date of his arrival. As the R.A.F. had allowed so little time for the comoletion of the project before the monsoon, I considered it necessary to start negotiations with the acting Shaikh at once with the assistance of the Wali of Dhofar. The Shaikh was prepared to undertake responsibilities on the lines of the draft I had prepared in ^iMuscat and an agreement was to have been signed on Febuary the 12th. The same day, I heard that the Sultan had le±t Karachi oy air and was expected to arrive at Saiaxah in the afternoon. I therefore postponed the conclusion oi the negotiations until I had had an opportunity of discussing the agreement with him . 4. When I saw the Sultan on Febuary the 13th., he said that he wished the agreement to De between his Government and the Shaikh ; he had no idea of tne existence C of the 1938 agreement and complained that §hihab had never informed him that such an agreement had been directly negotiaueo. by the then Political Agent. He was aware that Shaikh Mohammed bin Sulleyim received ^120 yearly for the protection of the petrol store at Shuwaimiyah, but did not know that the conditions of this oayment had been embodied in a formal undertaking . 5. The Julian 1 s main concern was - as he himself d’escribed it - to ' run away from responsibility'. Though he was sure that we should nave no trouble from the Beni Batahra and was anxious to help in any way, he wished&amp; it to oe clearly understood that our activities at ohuwaimiyah were entirely at our responsibility. He wished to modify the agreement, which i had dnwn up, so as to make this clear. I asked him whether, in view of this , he would be able to punish the Shaikh if he proved troublesome and after some thought, he replied that he hoped so. There/is, in fact, no doubt that the Sultan has considerable influence over this tribe, due, perhaps , to their close association with the hillmen of Dhofar who are regular visitors to SaMah; and doubtless assisted by the annual visit of the Shaikh to collect his stipend for the protection of the petrol store. 6. I hope that the payments to the acting Shaikh and his men will not be considered unduely high. His first demands were, of course, fantastic - ft 120 as a landing fee for each aircraft using the landing ground and #5 each per day for himself and his guards while the work was in progress, together with a substantial present J His principal argument was that he would have to employ at least five from ^e neighbourhood of Has Hasik and Ras Nus to ensure satisfactory relations with the tribes of these Ereas. This argument had to be given some consideration, and it was agreed that these khafirs would be included in the ten guards to be supplied by the Shaikh. It was also accepted that the sum of &amp;300 would adecuately provide for a present to the Shaikh and his people^, and any sums necessary to 'sweeten ' neighbouring Shaikhs. 7. It was only with the greatest difficulty that the Shaikh could be persuaded to return to Shuwaimiyah by air. He first refused adamantly and I went so far as to obtain permission from Aden to use the High Speed Launch stationed at Raisut. When he finally agreed to fly - on condition that I accompanied him - the Albacore refused to start /a nd the misbehavour of the cartridge starter, which each time it was fired, merely covered the aircraft in a cloud of smoke, must have made him profoundly regret tnat he had changed his mind. The journey was finally performed without incident on the 18th. lebuary. Yours sincerely, To, Lt. Colonel A.C.

My dear Sir Geoffrey, ..ill you oui- tclcgraa No.C.10 Shuwaiiaiyah V % 5 The 18th April, 19 ase refer to the corresponaencc ending wMith the Loth January, 19^0, on the subject of g. The fleet of dhows carrying water and rations, the labour, one platoon of tne Aden Levies, the Sultan*s Representative, and the A.M..D. Supervisory Staff arrived at Shuwainiiyah on the Loth of Feoruary. Hallows with tnc Medical Officer ana the Officer Co.unanaing the Levies flew to Shuwaimiyah from Salalah on the same day. The camp was then established, and security organisou. 3 . Hallows had previously made the necessary political arrangements with the Sultan and a copy of the undci taking agreed to by Sheikh Musallim bin Sulaiyim, in the place of Shci^di Muhanmad Din Sulaiyim who was absent in tiic desert, was in his possession. The main points of this were a gilt oi 300 dollars . .i. lor hi iL-cli and his people, and a daily payment oi three dollars to the Sheikh, ana of two dollars to each of the ton guarus he provided. In exchange the SheiKli agreed to assist in every possible way in the provision of security. All expenses were paid by the K.rv.r • The work progressed satisfactorily, but tne maintenance of an ade t uate supply of water, all of which had to be imported by dhow from Masirah and Lalaiah, caused considerable anxiety ci.icldy because of the violent storms which occurred. g. dork was completed on the 28th of March when a furti cr violent storm arose, and scattered the waiting dhows, ihcy returned after three days, ana eventually everyuody returned safely to Masirah or Salalah. 6. The landing-strip is now 1,300 yards long with over-runs of 100 yards. It is considered serviceable by the R.A.F. for the ty^e of aircraft using the Southern Route. 7 . The political agreement negotiated by Hallows was purely to cover the period of the work, and the old agreement covering protection of the petrol store and landing-ground, ior which a monthly payment of 120 dollars is made, rc .lams in iorce. cs. I should lixc to say here that I think that the way hallows carried out his part in this difficult operation is highly co a fiendable • In fact without his assistance on all points I doubt if it would have been successfully achieved. He was at least on one occasion in considerable personal danger and only just made Salalah landing ground with literally pieces of the single engine of the /wlbacore failing off.
