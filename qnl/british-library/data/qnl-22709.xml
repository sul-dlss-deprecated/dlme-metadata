PS*90/33/1. 20th April, 1945. Dear Mr. Harrison, The Bahrein Oil Caopaqy through the Texas Oil Ccmpany who act on their behalf in London have made a request to the Ministry of Labour in regard to the reoruitraent of young women stenographers in this country for work on Bahrein Island* They require 10 as soon as possible and 75 in the oourse of the next year or two. The reasons giren for this demand are that the Company have constructed recently an 100 Octane Plant, which has and will increase the clerical work considerably and the fact that reliable stenographers cannot be obtained from local labour. The matter has been referred to this Ministry* We should, therefore, be most obliged if information could be obtained from the Political Agent concerning the accGnmodation on Baliroin Island for tbe suitable housing of the number of young women it is proposed by the Compai\y to engage from the United Kingdom* We should also be glad of any other comments that he may care to make. lours &amp;c. , (3d) 7.A,K.Harrison, Esq., India Office, limit. hall, S.W.I.D.O.

HOUSING OF FSMALE EMPLOYEES Dear Sir, ^ Kindly refer to your letter D.O, No. C/55^of the l^'th May, 194-55 on the above subject. The Company has for some time had difficulty in obtaining adequate clerical help and believes that the solution lies in the use of female clerical employees. With this in view it contemplates hiring six to ten female stenographers in the near future to develop the feasibility of using this type of labour at Bahrein. For the first group, the Company plans to use its regular air-conditioned married quarters for housing, several women to a house. ^ Should our experience indicate that it will be desirable to utilize this type of help on a more extensive scale, it is then planned to construct special women's quarters somewhat similar to the present quarters we have for the nursinp sisters. It is planned to cater to these women in the Company 1 s regular messing facilities. The messing of men and v/omen in the same place has proved quite successful in several enterprises of which we have knowledge, including Aramco who utilize their regular messing for their nurses.
