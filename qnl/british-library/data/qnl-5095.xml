Repeated to Governuent of India. IMMEDIATE, Persian Ministry of Foreign affairs have sent note stating that Ministry of Health “propose to celebrate on August 21-th 25th anniversary of the opening of Pasteur Institute in Persia with participation of heads of Pasteur Institutes of Great Powers in the world”. Ministry of Foreign Affairs accordingly invite head and officials of Pasteur Institute of Great Britain ( or of any similar institute which holds place of Pasteur Institute ) to be present. The French Embassy informs us that the head of French Pasteur Institute is coning about that tine to inspect Persian Pasteur Institute but they were unaware of international celebrations now proposed. Our Embassy physician adds the interesting information that well known French bacteriologist is coming to improve efficiency of the Persian Pasteur Institute and that French wish him to take over the institute from present Persian head. The Embassy physician considers therefore that the proposed international celebrations are designed to cover up and if possible prevent supersession of Persian head. The American Embassy tells us that they have expressed the hope to their government that the latter will be able to send some distinguished medical expert for the occasion should that, however, be^impossible they suggest that two senior American doctors in Persia, one attached to the Ministry of Health and one to i*merioan Military Mission, should represent America. Motive of celebrations is clearly a ramp on the part of the head of Persian Pasteur Institute but there is the danger that if we and other po ers do not participate the field will be left clear for the Russians. Please telegraph whether any suitable British representative can be sent from the United Kingdom or India. Failing that I suggest Embassy physician should represent the United Kingdom, O.T.

The majority of the file contains correspondence regarding the decision to send a Doctor Pirdie and Colonel Findlay as representatives of the UK, and includes discussions of travel arrangements and dress code.   The main correspondents are as follows Sir John Helier Le Rougetel (HM Ambassador to Iran); the British Embassy, Cairo and the Government of India, External Affairs Department. The file also includes a telegram addressed to the Foreign Office from Le Routegel relaying information received from the French Embassy and the physician of the British Embassy in Iran, Tehran.  The telegram suggests that plans to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Persian Pasteur Institute have been organised in order to jeopardise an inspection planned by the French Pasteur Institute and to prevent their plans to replace the current Persian head. The United States of America’s planned representation is discussed and concern over potential Russian involvement in the event of the United Kingdom’s failure to send a representative is also expressed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Health</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Pasteur Institute of Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Anniversary celebrations</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy, Cairo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Teheran</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00019f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
