If you see no objection would you kindly convey my warmest thanks to the Flag Officer Commanding the Royal Pakistan Navy ? I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, . £ . H * ^ The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.COKPID T MIAL . Muscat. 28 20th September, 1949. (28/9/1/49) • Sir, I have the honour to report that the H.M.P.S. '•Jbelum 1 ’ flagship of the Poyal Pakistan Navy, under the command of Lt-Ccurrander C.S. Ahmad, paid a visit to Uuscat on the 17th and 18th of this month. Though the ostensible reason for the visit was the trans port from Karachi of certain gunpowder belonging to the Muscat Government, apparently the actual intention was to show the flag, for which purpose the 'Jhelum' has been largely used du ring the past year. The visit was originally scheduled for one day only, and calls wer- exchanged between myself and the Commanding Officer of the M Jhelum” soon after arrival. I then took Lt-Comrander C.S. Ahmad and his Secretary, Lt- Commander Maqbul Hussain to call on the Sultan: no provision for a return call had been made, as His Highness had insisted that the visit should be treated as semi-formal. However, during the interview Lt-Commander Ahmad invited His Highness on board to lunch the following day, saying that he would delay the departure of the ship especially for the occasion: and this invitation was accepted. Fntertainments for the ,, Jhelura ,, included hockey and volley ball matches against the Muscat State Infantry, a tea party given at the Consulate Club by the Pakistani Community for the officers and local notables, and a dinner party at the Agency for senior officers and members of the Royal Family. In return, a cinema show was given on board and the ship thrown open to the public from 8 to 1C on the following day. The luncheon party for His Highness was, in accordance with his wishes, informal, being attended by Mr. Woods-Ballard, Saiyid Faher and myself, and although the ship was dressed, a salute was fired only at the Sultan*s departure. The visit was successful and surprisingly ppular not only with the Pakistani community but also with the general populace. Lt-Commander Ahmad, however, had one complaint to make, the re fusal of the Muscatis to accept Pakistani money from his men on shore. Arrangements were made for ordinary rupees to be changed for Pakistani rupees at this Agency, but the grievance unfortunately remained, as all officers clearly felt it invol ved a question of national prestige and the favouring of India at the expense of Pakistan. This was not, however, mentimed in the full description of the visit put over the Pakistan Radio the next day. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, R.McC.
