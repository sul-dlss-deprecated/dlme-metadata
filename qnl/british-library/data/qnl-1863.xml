One of our boats coming from Goa cringing ifDout 2000 baskets of charcoal, was caught in stormy w weather; in order lo save the boat from sinking, the captain of the boat was obliged to jettison practically the total cargo. As the boat was manifested to uubai, and th as the nearest port having British authorities was also jjubai, the boat came there. As the conditions of trie lnsurar.ce company,with which tne abovementioned cargo is insured, requiresthat the captain oi the boat should lodge a protest w±th a public notary, tne copy of which should ^e forwarded along with other documents so as to enable us to recover our claim from the company. Accordingly the Political Oiiicer .Crucial Coast, Sharjah was approached by our firm there. But he refused to have the protest lodged on the plea that he was not authorised to do so. He suggested the other ai alternative of sending the boat to Bahrain,which is impracticable as it will involve heavy expenditure.
