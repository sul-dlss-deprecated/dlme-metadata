The letter does not have a stated recipient, but it would appear to be addressed to the Resident at Bushire, Edward Galley. The letter concerns the loss of the boat at Genowa [Bandar-e Ganāveh], which Meer Ally Khan [Mir Ali Khan] swears was not carried out by his people but by people of the desert. Nevertheless, he promises to hold the people in question accountable.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023598787.0x000050#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
