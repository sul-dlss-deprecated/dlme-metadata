FILE NO.29/21-III AND ENCLOSURES) Treasury Ref. No.OF 89/46/1. TREASURY CHAMBERS Great George Street,. London, S.W.I. 20th September, 1948. Dear Dundas, You asked me some two months ago for a general argument wherewith to arm the Political Resident, Bahrain, against any attack by the Shaikhs, as forecast at tbe end of paragraph 6 of Despatch 1673 (80/78A &gt; of 16th June, that Gulf oil can &gt;e sold for dollars and therefore dollars should be made available freely to the Shaikhdom governments. 1 understand that you have been provided by the Ministry of Food with a sufficient brief on why the specific request for dollar exchange for Brazilian rice made in the despatch cannot be ^r^nted. In so far as the Shaikh's request is for dollar exchange to purchase essentials only obtainable in the Western Hemisphere, then the answer is that we do in fact provide such exchange. Quotas of hard-currencies have been allotted to the Resident for the Shaikhdoms, which in the past have proved more than adequate to meet essential needs. We must examine the essentiality of those needs, or rather,.get the Residentand his Agents to do so on our lehalf, and if possible endeavour to meet them from 'softer' sources, but having done this we do not refuse the exchange if we are satisfied that it is really needed. This policy applies generally speaking, throughout the Sterling Area. I am not certain from the despatch however if the Shaikh of Bahrain is pressing for dollar exchange for inessential as distinct from essential imports. The paragraph under present discussion is linked directly to the demand for rice I.e. for essential foodstuffs. • If, however, tbe Shaikhs do wisb to have dollars for inessential goods then the attached memorandum on the sterling area's dollar receipts from oil will provide the resident with sufficient argument to show that the sterling area, so far from earning dollars with oil from the Shaikhdoms, has in fact to pay dollars to Americar participants in its exploitation. Furt 1 er, oil from the Shaikhdoms does not enable sales to be r ade to dollar markets from oil produced elsewhere in the Sterling area, for on lalance the Sterling area is a large importer of dollrr-costing oil. The Shaikh of Bahrain may well feel in tbe light of this information thrt he would have done better to conclude oil contracts exclusively with American cone* rns. Should be suggest this then the Resident will ro doult refer to the political and military advantages of the British attachment and to the essentially short-term nature of the problem of dollar shortage. In its efforts to recover from the economic destruction wysnatel wrought by the war, the Sterling Area In common with most of the rest of the world is suffering from a shortage of dollars, from a shortage of goods to pay for all the Iniports available and needed from the Wps^ern Hemisphere. The American recognition of this struggle to recover former economic standards and to advance still further is shown in tbe Economic Cooperation Act and the financial and economic help given under its authority. To enable economic recovery to take place, imports all-- MX I the two telegrams of POth we^e sent to the Resident any discussion. all oyer the Sterling Area from dollar sources are being restricted to essertials. Expenditure on dollar inessentials anywhere in the Sterling Area will prejudice that recovery. Vhile it is not suggested that full recovery will he attained v y the end-of the Furopean Recovery Programme, Sterlin'; Area dependence on dollar aid will it is hoped he eliminated and comparative freedom to import dollar goods at will, he restored to the■countries comprising the Sterling Area. The present struggle in which up are engaged to improve Sterling Area and European productiveness vis-a-vis the U.S.A. will also of course benefit the Shaikhdoms in a more plentiful supply of goods from Eurone and the Sterling Area when that struggle succeeds. To fritter dollars away on inessentials will delay recovery and hence lessen the gross supply of goods from all sources in future years. Another argument is that dollar inessentials are at present expensive; it would he foolish to spend oil royalties on them now when by waiting much better terms can be obtained. The general aims of our import policy are set forth in to the Colonies, copies of which May and w v ic 10 might also te of use in tc Finally it should be pointed out that the participation of the Shaikhdoms in the Sterling Area is not complete. They enjoy al' the benefits but do not have to alide by all the rules governing the ot v er members. Thus exchange is granted freely for Imports from the S'erling Area and from most other countries outside the Western Hemisphere, ard for essential imports from the Western Hemisphere, but merchants in the Shaikhdoms are not ol liged to surrender the r 'oreign currency proceeds o^ their exports to the Exchange Control. The Shaikh of Kuwait will soon tegin receiving substantial dollar payments under the concession in the Neutral 'one which he has recently granted to an American Company. When that happend we shall have to insist that these dollars must le used for Kuwait's requirements before we make any available out of the pool In fact we hope that Kuwait should soon be self- supporting in dollars. this will need more thought when the time comes, 1 ut it is as v ell that the Residert should have it in mind. I believe that the danger of ext eme pressure by the Shaikhs for dollars is not imminent, provided their immediate essent^l needs ^re granted. We mu. c t ultimately provide goods of th^ right so-'t in sufficient quantities to neet the b^ 1 1 represented by the Shaikh 's earnings from oil royalthe Resident'^: task in effect is to persuade the Shaikhs to wait for the day when sterling convertibility is restore without promisin any date for this, and meantime to convince them that their essential dollar ncjeds will be net, and all reasonable demands from outside hard currency countries will \e granted. Yours sincere 1 y, (SGD) ILLEGIBLE Esquire, Office.•onA OF.89/46/1. / . 3 STERLING AREA DOLLAR RECEIPTS FROM OIL These receipts are of two kinds Dollar r oysl tles . Practicelly the only example of these Is provided ly the concession recently awarded \y the Shaikh of Kuwait to the American Independent Oil Company in respect of his share of the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian Neutral Zone. Under the terms of that concession the Shaikh will, we understand, &gt;y now have received the sum of ^7,876,000 and will from 1949 onwards receive an annual royalty of at least ^626,000. Although Kuwait is not required to surrender these dollars to the Sterling Area pool, the existence of this income is bound to affect the amount of the net hard currency quote which will be made availalle to Kuwait from the pool. (?) D pi 1 r receipts from Amer i c a n 1 s + r i &gt; ut s w h o t h em - selve s re-sell Sterling Area oil q-' the St er ling Are^ . As the Kuwait Neutral Zone, Qatar and other concessions are not yet producing oil In commercial quantities description of the financial arrangements in force is limited to the two cases of (r) Bahrain and (h) Kuwait proper. (a) (1) The Bahrain p etro le ^ni Company Limited (B.P.C. ) Is norminally registered in Canada and owned jointly ly two big American oil companies (60' 7 by Standard Oil Company of California and 50&gt; of the Texas Company). B.P.C. Is administered and controlled from New York. It sells its oil through its subsidiary the California Texas Oil Company (Caltex),Bwh1cb is nominally registered in the Bahamas, but Is also considered as American for exchange control purposes and must therefore pay dollars in respect of all oil shipments from Bahrain to countries outside the Sterling Area. When oil produced or refined at Bahrain is sold by Caltex Inside the Sterling Area sterling revenues accrues to B.P.C. (ii) B.P.C. requires sterling for local expenses in Bahrain and for purchases of equipment, etc., elsewhere in the Sterling Area. It requires dollars for purchases of Saudi Arabian Crude Oil fpom the Arabian American Oil Company,* for American equipment and materials, for the salaries of Americans it employs at Bahrain and elsewhere, and for remittances of trade profits (agreed with the Bank of England) which are transferable to U.S.A. because B.P.C. is an American controlled company. (iii) B.P.C. is allowed to use its sterling revenue to meet its sterling requirements and for the purchase of dollars for the above purposes. Since its dollar reqi irements far exceed its dollar earnings we should' expect B.P.C. in an average year to remit a seven figure sum in dollars from London to New York. Thus on balance the Sterling Area pays and does not earn dollars in respect of B.P.C. operations, and the existence of some dollar earnings, which are accounted for to the Bank of England cannot justify any claims by the Shaikh of Bahrain for dollars to le spent on inessentials. (iv) At present any dollar remittances of profits to U.S.A. may well largely be re-invested by B .p C. in equipment The Deeds of 1936 and 1940 supplementary to the mining lease of 1934 are intended to ensure that these purchases will not lead to a reduction of crude oil production in Bahrain itself.-2- needed for Its current improvement schemes. But even when th are completed the remittances of surplus funds to U.S.A. will continue and no dollars will accrue to the Sterling Area Exchange Control from the activities of B.P.C. (b) (i) T he Kuwait Oil Company Limited. K.O.C . Is considered a British resident for exchange control Durpoes and is controlled jointly by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited of London and the Gulf oil Corporation of Pittsburg, U.S. Crude O d1 produced at Kuwait is normally shared equally between the two shareholders. A considerable capital expansion programme is at present on hand to enable production to reach a level of 488,000 barrels a day in 1961 and the company expected last year that for some 2i years from then until the end of 1949 it would le incurring capital expenditu e at the rate of roughly £6 millions a year alout «bne half of which would Ve in dollars. These dollars would be found from the Gulf Oil Company's 50^ subscription towards the funds of K.O.C. (ii) Dollar earnings accrue to us from Kuwait Oil only when Anglo-Iranian Oil Company or the Gulf Oil Corporation sell this crude oil to American firms for consumption outside the Sterling Area, but even in so far as such sales do in fact take place the dollar earnings from them have to be set against the profits which the Gulf Oil Corporation earns on its sterling sales of Kuwait Oil and which H is allowed to transfer into dollars and to remit to America. The time when Kuwait can claim that its oil is not only a dollar saver but also a net dollar earner for the Sterling Area would also seem to be'still distant and the operations of K.O.C. thus provide no grounds on which the local ruler can claim to receive additional dollars from us. rCONFTDSNTIAL. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, S.0.No.C/R-??!. Dated 8th November, 1948. Dear Sir Rupert, The reason why the Instructions referred to In paragraph 1 of your semi-official letter No.2/30/48, dated the 27th Octoler, 1948, were not followed (or at any rate adverted to) is that I do not appear, as far as I can make out from my records, ever to have seen them; you will remember that I did not recollect them when you mentioned them the other day. This was no fault either of Hudson or my office but w- s an acci dent. Incidentally J should mention that I personally passed orders on all applications for hard currency. Another reason which convinces me that I did not see these instructions is that if I had done so, I would certainly have asked for their amplification. It seems to me that to apply tbem literally would- mean that I could make no allotment whatsoever of hard currency, i.e. there are no cases I know of 'where the local r supply of free market dollars cannot be tapped', t ■ 0 j \\ I have been making these allotments in accordance with the Foreign Office instructions received with Re sidency endorsement No.1694-80/74P, dated the 28th June, 1948, - granting hard currency where it is 'essential' to do so. May T say that in trying to administer similar instructions for the last six years I have never seen a satisfactory definition of what is 'essential' - and. I think you will agree that it is a fairly elastic term. In dealing with the applications I tried to find out in the first place whether the articles for which the currency wes asked were available in a reasonable time from the sterling area, and, if they were, the ap plication was usually turned down. It never occurred to me to refuse hard currency in reasonedle quantities for refrigerators, air-conditioning plants, fans, thermos flasks, or anything else which would lighten the burden of the hot weather - and do so as cheaply as possible so that the largest number of people could get relief. For wearing appall and food stuffs, I have granted about £6000/- worth of hard currency in all. Apart from the fact that it seems to be essential to keep a certain amount of easy trnde open with hard currency areas, small allotments under these heads seem to rre justified in order to keep the cost of living down for the many people here of all nationalities who need tinned food and so on and can not purchase them, as we ourselves do, from Bapco. Surely also the fact that the people here believe that Bahrain is a dollar earner - a belief flvhich I am sure is shared by the Shaikh - is relevant in administering the rules for granting them? I find it difficult to appreciate the arguments to the contrary set out in the enclosures to Residency letter No.(172/2/48), dated the 7th October, 1948, and I feel certain that the Shaikh would neither understand nor appreciate them. - v : , ..^Vours sincerely, (S'D) C.J. FELLY. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.wamm (2/44/48) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 17th November, 1948. enclosure to this Residency letter (172/2/48) of the 7th October, headed 'Sterling Area Dollar Receipts From Oil', it is stated that Bahrein Petroleum Company's dollar requirements far exceed its dollar earnings, RusseltBrown has always tried to persuade me that the reverse 1s^the case and has also probably said the same thing to the Shaikh and Belgrave, If you see no \\V objection, I should be grateful if you would kindly go into the matter with him and try to obtain a clear statement of the position,'as, if the Shaikh and Belgrave are under a misapprehension it is important that they should be informed of the real state of affairs.rOMFID^KTIAL . S .O.IIo .C /n -252. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 1st December, 1948. Dear Sir Rupert I have had some discussion tflth Belgrave end Russell Brown on the point raised in your semi-official letter No.(2/44/48), dated the 17th November, 1948, about the dollar earnings snd requirements of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 2, Delgrave has no Idea as to what the position is in this matter. 3, Russell Brown contributed something to the question though,like the Treasury memorandum, he did not paint the whole picture. He said that all dollar earnings of Bapco had to be accounted for to the Treasury (I.e. the Bank of England) and that they are only released for payments on account of overhead expenses in the York office and for 'transportation'. (Why dollars should be made available for the purchase of motor vehicles he did not know). He could not say whether the company's dollar requirements exceeded its dollar earnings. 4, I do not understand the sentence in the memorandum you refer to which begins 'since its dollar requirements far exceed its dollar earnings '• 1 have always understood it to &gt;e axiomatic that oil is an international value of the very highest order and that, however accountancy may disguise it, it is ultimately exchangeable for dollars in any part of the world. If this is true, it sefms to put the statement of the case in the memorandum In a dif ferent light to that in which it first appears. For His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.example, either the refined Saudi Arabian crude is sold for hard currency or it is not. In the first al ternative it is a dollar earner for the company; in the second, either the buyer is gettinr; a dollar product for soft currency or if the refined product is bought by the United Kingdom, it merely means th^.t it has spent dollars on oil. In neither case is it fair to say thnt the dollars needed to buy the crude from Aramco should be debited to Bapco's dollar requirements. Yours sincerely,1 eteiPr ■ * Lord Kennett,wlth whom I discussed tbe Foreign Exchange Regulations for the Persian Gulf, gave It as his view that the Treasury's policy is 'ungenerous, cheese-paring, and ignorant''. He thought the problem here was to forestall or to take measures to ftigate the effects of t' e soc's/ and pconomlc disturTances bound to take place owing to the' influx of the incomes from oil with very restricted outlet for their expenditure - especially on goods from hard currency countries. This note should be put on the file 1C/37 (Bahrain Petroleum Company Dollars) which is with me at the moment. TfH r. T P10 SECRET. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, S.O.No.C/R-274. Dated 22nd Decemter, 1948. Dear Sir Rupert, - may hove probably heard that the supply of free market dollars to Bahrain is likely to be very considerably reduced, if not to dry up entirely as a result of Aramco's decision not to accept rupees from their employees for their purchases in Aramco ^ commissariat or clubs or for any other purchases in Saudi Arabia. It would appear also that if the standard for the allotment of 'Government 1 dollars laid down in your semi-official letter No.(2/46/48), dated the 18th November, 1948, is rigidly applied, the supply of these dollars will be greatly restricted. You may have heard too that the Saudi Government is said to be pressing for a fixed Rial - Dollar rate, and, of course, Kuwait 1 s movement into the 'dollar area' is being widely discussed. It seems therefore worth considering how we are going to react to a possible demand from Bahrain for cl large allotment of dollars for the payment of ro- yalties in dollars or for th* currency convertible or partly convertible to dollars. Yours sincerely, O C&gt; His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.A ■PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 9th September, 1949. ersonal &amp; Confidential.

T roust apologise very humbly th^t oressure.of current'Work has prevented me up to nov from living the exnlanations about oil finance for which the Political A^ent at v Ba.hrajn asked In his letter to the Persian Gulf Residency of 1st Dpcember 1948, which you sent us on 27th January 1949. If I may first refer to the Resident's letter of 17th November : think the question raised th'^re is best answered by the Bahrain Petroleum Company's Income and xpenditure Accounts for the oeriod from January 1947 to June 1948 which have been compiled by the ^ank of England. I am enclosing two copies of Tiemorandum • are attached by way of Illustration. Since the accounts hive been obtained in confidence by the Bank of .n^Iand these copies of them should of course on no account be handed to the Sheikh of Bahrain . The figures explain clearly, I think, thrt in 1947, for instance, the Bahrein Petro' 1 eujn Co, had a turnover of £?3.7 minions (equivalent to ^96.5 rail'ions); its sterlin; and rupee payments amounted to only £1.8 millions, leaving £21.9 millions (^8^.3 millions) to be found for current dollar- exnense?, depreciation allowances and trading profits remlttable to America. Of this sum, the Comn^ny itself e rned from dollar sales to destinations outside the scheduled territories the sum of #42.5 mil 1 ions; for this it accounted to the Bank o^ ngland, leaving to be found from the central reserves of the Sterling iirea only a net sum #45.8.millions. The transportation item in the co. c ts of production, to which p elly refers, rela es to the-chartering of American tankers and possibly to the cost of work done on the submarine pipe-line from Saudi-Arabia to Bahrain. The co-^t of any motor vehicles which the Company has been allowed by the authorities to imoort f^om the U.S .k . would appear, not under this &gt;ead, but under M ^qulnment, nat&lt;-/'ia 1 c '- and supplies 11 . If I have understood the point in D eliy l s fourth paragraph correctly, it is that 'the Sterling Area as a whble 'ould be getting something for nothing if.it did not be^r the dollar cost Involved in oroducin^: the Ba&gt; relni refined products which it consumes. I would a ;ree with t^at: the f • ct th-1 s r ich shipments of bahreini oil are in the first instance Invoiced in sterling just like any other sale from one part o^ 'the Sterlln'g Area t'o another does not , mean that the Central^Reserves do not, a few weeks later, have to find the dolla s for ^apco's remittances to America, as explained above. It is, however, correct that individual consuming terri tories may up to now not have been fully aware of the dollar element in the co^t of Bah^eini oil, and we are just,abQut to send a circular telegram to them to exnlain the position. It has of course not Veen in the interests of California Texa^, the marketing of Bahreini oil, to point out to its customers that, although this oil came from a S erling Area source, its purchase involved su&gt; -r stantial dollar payments to U.S .A., and hence the misunderstanding has persisted. DurinrDuring mo^t of last ye^r, it looker! as If-the Unit er* States mipht become a permanent importer o r oil on' a substantial sc^le, andif recent developments had not falsified this hone, Felly's statement th^t all 'oil is ultimately exchangeable for dollars' mi^ht oerhsps have become true. The fa^t is that only American oil companies can ultimately convert the -proceeds of t^eir oil sales' into dollars, and even they have growing difficulties to do so, on account of t e JTKiisr world's dollar shortage. What Pelly probably had in mind was th^t, as long as British-controlled nroduction is not sufficient to meet the needs of the terlin^ Area and British companies' trade outside it, the marginal deficiency has to be &gt;ought for dollars, whether by British, or American controlled distributors in the Sterlinp; Area, and every additional ton of oil from a genuine sterling source is therefore a dollar saver. But it is not a dollar earner. It is not correct to imply that certain commodities like oil are 'dollar products' because, looking at the world as a whole they predominantly come from American producers: the underlying fallacy would be obvious if it were sought to anply the same argument to'wheat. But in times of shortage, it is of course occasionally possible for producers of scarce commodities to extort dollars from their custom rs, in excess of the dollars which t^ey themselves have snent on producing the commodity. Such an attitude we would wish to contest whprever we met it* and the original arguments in Tjaden's letter of- 20th Sep tember 1948 were designed to this end. If, however, there are any further points which the Resident or the Political Agent at Bahrain may wish to raise, we shall be glad to trief then for their discussions with the Sheikhs - and 'iit h somewhat less delay than I am afraid there has been on this occasion. I am sending conies of this letter to S.J. Davis at the Ministry of Fuel and Power and to Bloomfield at the Bank of England, and I should be grateful for their comments: please therefore obtain their views before sendin the substance of the present letter to Bahrain.M EMORANDU M. Purchase o f Oil by j.meH o.^ n C ornpanies . Araerican comnenies' oil purchases are the concern of the United Kingdom Exchsn^e Control If the oil is acquired jn one of the ^ollowin-' 7 three wavs:- (a) ^rom their own operations in the Sterling ^rea, e .g., Bahrein Petroleum Company: (b) from a shareholding in a Sterling A^ea company, e.g., Iraq Petroleum, Kuwait Oil; (c) by purchase from a Sterlin A^ea Company, e.g., Anglo Iranian, Shell. In the case of (a), operating as a Sterling Area producer, the company nust account to the appropriate Jterlincr Area Exchange Control for all the foreign currency proceeds of its.sales. Equally it looks to the Sterling Area for its foreign currency needs. The Company is not restricted as to its 'choice of markets since it sells inside the sterling area for sterling, and outside for dollars, which /-&gt; are taken into account when calculating the amount of dollars to be provided by the sterling area in respect of profits on total ope rations . American companies acquiring oil under (b) usually do so-at a special price which leaves a large margin of profit on the ultimate sale. The companies have a contractual right to their sha~e of the oil produced. He have no control over where they sell it and would lose heavily in dollars if we allowed it to he sold for sterling outside the S+erling Area to countries havir^ no dollars. Finally, purchases by Americ n companies under (c) are made at market prices for dollars or Anerican Account sterlin?. If we al 1 owed them to resell this oil for sterlin r outside the Sterling . Areat- (i) the resulting transfer of the nroceeds in sterling to American Account would co^-t us dollars so t^at in effect we should lose the equivalent of our original dollar sale and a bit more representing the Anerican Company's nrofit; . (ii) we shoulo be allowing the Americans to maintain their trade in markets where dollars are scarce, at the exnense of our own dollar reserves. There is a further and even more comnelling objection to al lowing the American oil companies to sell oil for sterling outside the scheduled Territories in that the present limited supplies of oil have resulted in severe restrictions in' sales by British Cos.

The production of oil in the 'etherlands ^ast Indies involves the Standard Vacuum Oil Company and its subsidiary companies in considerable dollar expenditure for which the N.E.-I. Exchange Control Authorities do not accept responsibility. As a result of repre sentations by the Company, the United Kingdom ycVian Control have agreed, under a special arrangement? that their purchases of f oil from Standard Vacuum shall &gt; e paid partly in K.. I. sterling (available for exchange into guilders) and partly in dollars, the precise proportion being based on tv^e Comoany's estimates of their expenditure in each currency. Prior to the Japanese Occupation the proportion was 86^ N.E.I, sterling and 15% dollars and w^s subject to adjustment in the light of the actual exnenditure incurred. The present proportion of 50^ M.E.I, sterling and 60 dollars is in ac cordance with a sup-^estion from the Company in 1947 N shortly before N.S.I, nroduction w -s resumed.S.O.Ho.C/H-410.
