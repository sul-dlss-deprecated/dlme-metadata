Only one of these letters is transcibed in this volume; letter from Nicholas Hankey Smith to Jaffer Ali Khan, dated 4 April 1808. The letter discusses difficulties arising over payments for [French] letters. The Resident also discusses the acquisition of the French packet Jaffer Ali Khan has been trying to obtain for some time, and how much they should be willing to pay for it. It also briefly covers the gathering of intelligence more generally. The payment of Jaffer Ali Khan's bills, along with the marriage portion is also mentioned, but the Resident has no news of the requested increase to his pension.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x000055#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
