No. 3947 of 1852. Political Department. From A. Malet , Esquire, Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay, jyynJ ///fc jl ) Dated XSth September 1852. Sir, The Governor in Council has had under consideration the replies which have been submitted to the Circular calling for suggestions as to the Political Department, No. best means of eradicating the alleged belief of a large portion 226o, dated 15th Ma&gt; 18.)0. ^ ^0 Native community in the success attending endea- &gt;4i?o V j nue j m!r a JT mei l t QCA No * vours to obtain objects from Government and the Autho- 4138, dated 20th Mav 18o0.

It appears from the replies of several local Officers to the Circular, that there is an idea prevalent that there are individuals who attempt to forward, by their personal influence with Officers, who receive them on familiar and friendly terms, the views of those in whose affairs they are interested ; and that either these individuals, or the parties who make use^of them, are inclined, from motives of self-interest, to encourage the belief that they can do so. 3. While fully sensible of the advantages attendant on the Civil Officers of Govern ment being at all times accessible to Natiyes, the Right Hon'ble the Governor in Council is equally convinced that the-utmost care should be taken, during interviews with them, to prevent such matters being discussed or adverted to as would, on inquiry, be likely to form subject of official consideration, either by themselves or other public Officers, and thus to avoid giving the impression of a bias having been received, or any particu lar interest taken, in such affairs. His Lordship in Council cannot but think that it the Officers of Government had invariably observed in their intercourse with Native visitors,u/ A. ' XJ ^ I- W ■ [ 2 ] or with thosG inclined to take an interest in their affairs, a circumspect line ot conduct of the nature indicated, the mischievous belief which exists could not have obtained the prevalence it has. 4. Private discussion of matters within their official jurisdiction is prohibited to Judicial Officers by Regulation III. of 1827, Section 2: the spirit of this Rule ^s of course applicable to alK Departments, and His Lordship in Council does not feel it necessary to add more precise instructions, for he feels confident that the Officers to whom the Circular is addressed will be glad of the opportunity it gives them of pre cluding for the future all possibility of their being importuned in a manner of which they must disapprove; and he hopes that it may further serve to ensure them from any embarrassment, which in its absence might be occasioned to them, either by their ap pearing unnecessarily to discountenance applications made to them for their Sympathy and advice, or, by their listening to such, affording the slightest grounds for any ex pectation that they would consent to meddle privately with matters for the settlement of which an open and regular course of application or appeal is available for all willing to pursue it. 5. A compendium of the Rules observed in receiving and disposing of Petitions ad dressed to Government will be transmitted hereafter, for the information of all local Officers. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. MALET, Chief Secretary. Bombay Castle, 13^ September 1852.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023612307.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/129, f 61</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612307.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/129, f 61</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Circular No. 3947 of 1852 from Arthur Malet, Chief Secretary to the Government, Political Department, Bombay to the Resident in the Persian Gulf</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1852/1852</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-02T00:24:20</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 folio</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The circular concerns how Government officers should conduct themselves when receiving 'native visitors', and how they should receive/dispose of petitions addressed to the Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612307.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
