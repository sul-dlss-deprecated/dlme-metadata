(1810/377/35). Jedda. December 20th, 1937. Sir, In my despatch No. 180 dated December 18th I had the honour to report the ratification by Ibn Saud of the instrument which purports to record the adhesion of the King of the Yemen to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance. I have to record also the conclusion of two other agreements 1 between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen: (1) Agreement for the Settlement of Disputes (published in the ’'Umm al Qura' of December 10th) c N .Bo This is not the Arbitration Covenant which was published in Annexure No*l in the Iraq Government Gazette No o33 dated August 15th 1937. (2) Annexe to the Treaty of Taif, regarding the delimitation of boundaries between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 2. Translations of these agreements '111 be sent to the Foreign Office as soon as they are completed. The frontier agreement contains scores of names which it will take a considerable time to verify. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellenqy the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan (No.1812/377/35), His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo (No .1811/377/35) and Bagdad (Nod813/377/35) , His Excellency the/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., • f etc etc etc.X the Governor of Aden (No.1815/377/35) and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, . . (No. 1814/377/35). I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, etc. (Signed) R.V.Bullard.P.Z.3862/36. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No.E 2830/2830/25 dated 4th June, 1936. O UQ.118 (705/377/15). British Legation, Jedda. 25th April, 1936. Sir, You will remember that at the close of the Saudi Yemen war of 1934, ibn Saud secured the surrender of Sayyid Hasan Al Idrisi and two other important members of the family Abdul-tfahhab and Abdul-Aziz, the latter of whom died last year. a rumour recently reached us that another member of the, Idrisi family, described by my informant as T »Sayyid Al-Arab', had arrived in Jedda last February and had been taken to Mecca, where the others are allowed to reside, after the Italian Legation here had obtained guarantees for his being v/e 11-treated. 2. 1 was inclined, if there was anything in the story at all, to identify the person in question with Sayyid Muhammad Al-Arabi, son of Abdul-Al, son of the original Ahmed Al-Idrisi, i.e. one o± that branch of the family which is associated principally with the Sudan and Egypt. This man's submission to ibn Saud would be of some little importance, as he was one oi the Asiri delegation who came to Mecca in October 1930 in connexion with the arrangements for the absorption of Asir into Ibn Saud's dominions but was afterwards concerned in the revolt of Sayyid Hasan in November-December 1932. It was understood that, after the collapse of the rebellion, he went with a nephew of his to Massawa, which might account for the alleged Italian interest in him. The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., etc., etc., etc. 3./2. 3, 1 took an opportunity to-day of asking Sheykh Yusuf Yasin whether Sayyid Al Arabi had arrived in Mecca. He replied that he had, he thought, been there for a year or so; anyhow he had seen him there before he himself left for Riyadh last November. In view of this information, which I have no reason uo doubt, it now seems to us probable that my previous informant 1 s sources were confusing two things, viz. the presence of Al Arabi in Mecca sometime ago and the more recent arrival from Jizan of certain other persons, whom 1 cannot identify but who are said to have been landed in Jeada in conditions of some secrecy and conveyed to Mecca. Conflicting rumours have reached us regarding the composition of this party and the reasons for their being sent here. 1 am not, however, pursuing this matter, as my object has merely been to locate Al-Arabi for the reason given in the preceding paragraph. 4. l am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty*s High Commissioner for Egypt, Cairo, His Excellency the Governor General of the Sudan, Khartoum, His Majesty ! s Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the Government of India in the Foreign and political Department at New Delhi. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, AIT DREW RYAN./TV T // lae. RIYAl’H AliU KEJI3 HhViS .

Us*!?* My dear Laithwaite, Will you please refer to my letter of 13th November, 1934, in which I informed you that Reilly had obtained a refund of the expenditure incurred on the internment of Yemeni soldiers at Aden from the King of the Yemen. My letter was written on the strength of a despatch from Reilly, but now that the Residents accounts have been received and we have been able to check the details we find that the whole expenditure arising out of the Saudi—Yemeni hostilities has not been recovered. The following amounts totalling £253 (approximately) have been omitted from the claim sent to the King of the Yemen (a) £131 for transport of police (b) £35 expended on civilian refugees (c) £22 removal of civilians from Hodeidah (d) £65 an oversight in submitting the claim £253 J.G.LAITHWAITE, ESQ., C.I.E. ItemsItems (a) (b) and (c) are nor recoverable from the King in any case; (d) is an unfortunate • * + oversight, but we feel strongly that, on political grounds, we cannot again approach the King of the Yemen particularly as it might be difficult to explain to his satisfaction the circumstances in which the further claim came to be presented* 3. I enclose a statement which has been prepared setting out the amounts expended and the recoveries made from the King of the Yemen and we propose to charge the balance of £253 (approximately) to United Kingdom funds. We hope that, in view of the comparatively small sum involved, you will not raise any objection to the sum of £253 being considered as part of the Aden expenditure in respect of which India pays the usual one-third contribu tion and I shall be glad if you would let me know whether Yours sincerely, you agreeCopy 4404 EXPENDITURE lay Resident, Aden, in connection with Saudi-Yemeni War.

[E 7797/79/25] No. 1. ^ Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 31.) (No. 36$. ) Sir, Jedda, December 10, 1934. KELATIONS between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, since the recent dispute, have to all appearances pursued an uneventful course and have ceased to occupy the forefront of public attention locally. Nevertheless reports, vague but persistent, have not been wanting that all is still not well in the Yemen. Frontier difficulties are hinted at, and perhaps somewhat exaggerated stories are current of the restiveness of the Seif-ul-Islam Ahmad, said to be under arms still at Sada and chafing under the restrictions imposed by his father the Imam. 2. I have been disposed to attach little importance to these rumours, and it is perhaps unnecessary to treat them seriously. My French colleague, M. Maigret, spoke to me yesterday, however, on this subject, and whilst admitting that his own information was indefinite, expressed the opinion that there undoubtedly did exist trouble it was, at present, difficult to diagnose. He hoped to leave Jedda shortly on a three weeks’ visit to Sana, and expected to be able to arrive at a more accurate appreciation of the situation in the Yemen during that time. 3. The unrest may be of purely internal significance, and may be a natural reaction after the Imam’s ill-success in the late war with Saudi Arabia. The press of both countries have, however, not entirely allayed misgivings recently by protesting with vigour that the two countries are now on the most friendly terms, and denying with emphasis the “false reports ’’ put about by interested persons to the contrary. The Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd November quoted an article from the Sana newspaper the Imam in which reports of the concentration of troops on the Saudi-Yemen frontier were categorically denied. Peace and tranquillity prevailed; conditions had returned to normal; and concord reigned between the “ two Moslem sects ’’ (presumably the Zeidi and Shafi sects of the Yemen). From the Hejazi press, the Iman continued, it was understood that a similarly fortunate situation existed in this country. The Umm-al-Qura delightedly welcomed the article with lengthy variations on the themes of Arab brotherhood, the Treaty of Taif and the wiles of unscrupulous mischief-makers inspired by hatred and jealousy of the Arabs and of Islam. I do not propose to transmit to you a translation of this article. 4. It may not be out of place here to inform you, in regard to the Saudi- Yemen treaty settlement, of the insistence with which Mr. Philby continues to express his conviction that Ibn Saud did in fact receive a war indemnity from the Imam. He has more than once reverted to the subject. Ibn Saud, Mr. Philby stated quite recently, has for some two or three months been paying daily to his tribal visitors at Riyadh (as I have recorded in Jedda reports for October and November last) large sums in cash and kind, which my informant estimated at an average of 40,000 Maria Theresa dollars a day, or an approximate total over the whole period of about £100,000 gold. Where has this money come from if not from the Imam? £100,000 would probably be the amount of the indemnity. I still feel unable to share Mr. Philby’s conviction, and I find that the French Charge d’Affaires, to whom Mr. Philby has spoken in a similar strain, is equally sceptical. M. Maigret considered that Ibn Saud, to content the tribes disappointed of loot in the war, has probably had to make serious inroads on the Royal Treasury, and expressed his belief, from his personal knowledge of the Imam’s character, that the latter would have continued the war, by no means lost to him after the fall of Hudeida, rather than have parted with so considerable a sum of money. 5.

A • C ., We have received your esteemed letter on the subject of the expenses incurred by your Government in connection with the temporary internment of our men (soldiers) in Aden until after the conclusion of the agreement between our brother Hie Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Sa’ud and ourselves. We have gone through the enclosed statement which contains details of the expenses and we write this to thank your Government for the great interest and attention you have kindly directed towards them. We also thank you for the particular expressions of friendship which you have kindly shewn in this respeot. As the total amount of the expenses is Rs. 10,874-11-7, we have issued orders to the Officer Commanding Ta’iz to at once remit the amount to Your Excellency. Please let us have a reply after receipt of the amount. we continue to repeat our thanks and also our best respects to Your Excellencyfinancial Secretary .

The Colonial Office are definitely of the opinix that this expenditure is of the kina to whicn Inaia would normally contribute one-tniru. It seems undoubtedly to have been politically desirable from the point of view of the Protectorate to intern the refugee soldiers, and for the reason given in paragraph 2 of Lr. Laithwaite's aTote below dated 26th July 1934 the case for asKing yT'Ihdia to contribute to the cost through the one-third irrangement seems a strong one. U l . T 7Draft Paper.

It is observed from the July Statement of expenditure at Aden directly chargeable to the C.O., a copy of which was received on the 27th August last from the Resident, that a sum of Rs.9528:14:2 was expended during July on account of these internees, and the question has arisen whether any part of this expenditure should be borne by Indian revenues. Although it was no doubt desirable for the purpose of maintaining order in the Protectorate to intern these refugees, we are not convinced that the expenditure so incurred is of the kind contemplated by the Cabinet when mak^their decision of the 16th December 1926 that India should be prepared to contribute towards Military and Political expenditure at ! Aden the sum of £150,000 or one third of any total cost (including the cost of/ S’SOO 5000 5.34of any Air Force units at Aden) whichever is the lesser figure.

Mr. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received August 13.) Jedda, July 30, 1934. (No. 240.) Sir, WITH reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 202 of the 27th June, I have the honour to forward herewith a complete translation of the Treaty of Taif, which has been prepared by Mr. Furlonge. 2. Further study has served little to elucidate the obscurities of article 4 of this document. These arise partly from the absence of any trustworthy and sufficiently detailed map of the area, but more especially from the rather confusing use of the same word to denote the name of a tribe and at the same time to describe its tribal grazing-ground or dira. These latter are, moreover, known accurately probably only to the tribes owning them and to neighbouring tribes, who may or may not be in entire agreement as to their boundaries. Until the terrain through which this frontier runs is accurately mapped and surveyed, article 4 will, it is believed, continue to be a somewhat unintelligible concatenation of place and tribal names. 3. Otherwise, no points of importance, other than those noted by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch under reference, have emerged except that article 4 does provide for a “ friendly and brotherly ” delimitation of the frontier. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden, the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, Jerusalem, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, and His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt, Ramleh. Treaty of Islamic Friendship and Brotherhood, between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Yemen. HIS Honourable Majesty the Imam Abdul Aziz Abdurrahman-al-Feysal-al- Saud. King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, on the one part, and His Honourable Majesty the Imam Yahya-bin-Muhammad Hamiduddin, King of the Yemen, on the other part: Being desirous of ending the state of war unfortunately existing between them and their Governments and peoples; And of uniting the Islamic Arab nation and raising its condition and maintaining its prestige and independence; And in view of the necessity of establishing firm treaty relations between them and their Governments and countries on a basis of mutual advantage and reciprocal interest; And wishing to fix the frontiers between their countries and to establish relations of “ Bon-Voisinage ” and ties of Islamic friendship between them and to strengthen the foundations of peace and tranquillity between their countries and peoples; And being desirous that there should be a united front against sudden mishaps and a solid structure to preserve the safety of the Arab Peninsula. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Treaty of Taif. In the Name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate [181 n—1] B* 2 Have resolved to conclude a treaty of Islamic friendship and Arab brotherhood between them and for that purpose have nominated the following representatives plenipotentiaries on their behalf :— On behalf of His Honourable Majesty the King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, His Royal Highness the Amir Khalid Abdul Aziz, son of His Majesty and Acting President of the Council of Ministers, And on behalf of His Honourable Majesty the King of the Yemen, his Excellency Sayyed Abdul-bin-Ahmed-al-Wazir. Their Majesties the two Kings have accorded to their above-mentioned representatives full powers and absolute authority; and their above-mentioned representatives, having perused each other’s credentials and found them in proper form, have, in the name of their Kings, agreed upon the following articles :— Article 1. The state of war existing between the Kingdom of the Yemen and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia shall be terminated as from the moment of signature of this treaty, and there shall forthwith be established between their Majesties the Kings and their countries and peoples a state of perpetual peace, firm friend ship, and everlasting Islamic Arab brotherhood, inviolable in whole or in part. The two high contracting parties undertake to settle in a spirit of affection and friendship all disputes and differences which may arise between them, and to ensure that a spirit of Islamic Arab brotherhood shall dominate their relations in all states and conditions. They call God to witness the goodness of their intentions and their true desire for concord and agreement, both secretly and openly, and they pray the Almighty to grant them and their successors and heirs and Governments success in the continuance of this proper attitude, which is pleasing to the Creator and honourable to their race and religion. Article 2. Each of the two high contracting parties recognises the full and absolute independence of the kingdom of the other party and his sovereignty over it. His Majesty the Imam Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman-al-Feysal-al-Saud, King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, admits to His Majesty the Imam Yahya and his lawful descendants the full and absolute independence of the Kingdom of the Yemen and his sovereignty over it, and His Majesty the Imam Yahya-bin-Muhammad Hamiduddin, King of the Yemen, admits to His Majesty the Imam Abdul Aziz and his lawful descendants the full and absolute independence of the Saudi Arab Kingdom and his sovereignty over it. Each of them gives up any right he claimed over any part or parts of the country of the other party beyond the frontiers fixed and defined in the text of this treaty. His Majesty the Imam King Abdul Aziz abandons by this treaty any right of protection or occupation, or any other right, which he claimed in the country, which, according to this treaty, belongs to the Yemen and which was (formerly) in the possession of the Idrisis and others. His Majesty the Imam Yahya similarly abandons by this treaty any right he claimed in the name of Yemeni unity or otherwise, in the country (formerly) in the possession of the Idrisis or the A1 Aidh, or in Najran, or in the Yam country, which according to this treaty belongs to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. Article 3. The two high contracting parties agree to conduct their relations and communications in such a manner as will secure the interests of both parties and will cause no harm to either of them, provided that neither of the high contracting parties shall concede to the other party less than he concedes to a third party. Neither of the two parties shall be bound to concede to the other party more than he receives in return. Article 4. The frontier line which divides the countries of the two high contracting parties is explained in sufficient detail hereunder. This line is considered as a fixed dividing boundary between the territories subject to each.[181 n—1] b 2 The frontier line between the two kingdoms begins at a point half way between Medi and A1 Musim on the coast of the Red Sea, and (runs) up to the mountains of the Tihama in an easterly direction. It then turns northwards until it ends on the north-west boundary between the Beni Jama’a and (the tribes) adjacent to them on the north and west. It then bends east until it ends at a ^ point between the limits of Naqa’a and Wa’ar, which belong to the Waila tribe, 1 and the limits of the Yam. It then bends until it reaches the pass of Marwan and Aqaba Rifada. It then bends eastwards until it ends, on the east, on the edge of the boundary between those of the Hamdan-bin-Zaid, Waila, &amp;c., who are outside Yam, and Yam. Everything gq the right hand side of the above-mentioned line, which runs from the point mentioned on the sea shore up to the end of the borders on all sides of the mountains mentioned, shall belong to the Yemen, and everything on the left of the above-mentioned line shall belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. On the Yemen side are Medi, Haradh, part of the Harth tribe, Mir, the Dhahir Mountains, Shada, Dhay’a, part of the Abadil, all the country and the mountains of Razih, Manbah, with Arwa-al-Amshaykk, all the country and the mountains of Beni Jama’a, Sahar-ash-Sham, Yabad and its neighbourhood, the Maraisagha area of the Sahar-ash-Sham, the whole of Sahar, Naqa'a, Wa'ar, the whole of Waila, and also Far with Aqabat Nahuqa, the whole of Hamdam- bin-Zaid, which is outside Yam and Wad’a Dhahran. These mentioned, and their territories within their known limits, and all between the said directions and their vicinities, the names of which are not mentioned and which were actually subject to or under the control of the Yemeni Kingdom before the year 1352, are on the Yemeni side and belong to the Yemen. On the left hand side are Musam, Wa’lan, most of the Harth, the Khuba, the Jabri, most of the Abadil, all Faifa, Beni Malik, Beni Haris, the A1 Talid, Qahtan, Dhahran, Wadi'a, all the Wadi’a Dhahran, together with the pass of Marwan, and Aqaba Rifada, and the area lying beyond on the east and north of Yam and Najran, Hadhim, Zur Wada, all the Waila in Najran, and all below Aqaba Nuhuqa, up to the edges of Najran and Yam on the east, all these, and their territories within their known limits, and all between the named directions and their vicinities which have not been mentioned by name, and which were actually subject to or under the control of the Saudi Arab Kingdom before the year 1352, are on the left of the said line and belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. Everything mentioned regarding Yam, Najran, Hadan, Zur Wad’a, and all the Waila in Najran, is in accordance with the decision (Tahkim) of His Majesty the Imam Yahya to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as regards Yam, and the judgment (Hukm) of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz that all of it should belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom; and while the Hadan and Zur Wad’a and the Waila in Najran belong to Waila, and, except in so far as has been mentioned, do not come within the Saudi Arab Kingdom, this shall not prevent them nor their brothers of Waila from enjoying mutual relations and intercourse and the usual and customary co-operation. This line then extends from the end of the above-mentioned limits between the edges of the Saudi Arab tribes and of those of the Hamdam-bin-Zaid, and all the Yemeni tribes who are outside Yam. All the borders and the Yemeni territories up to the end of the Yemeni frontier in all directions belong to the Yemeni Kingdom; and all the borders and territories up to the end of their boundaries, in all directions, belong to the Saudi Arab Kingdom. All points mentioned in this article, whether north, south, east or west, are to be considered in accordance with the general trend of the frontier line in the directions indicated; often obstacles cause it to bend into the country of one or other kingdom. As regards the determination and fixing of the said line, the separating out of the tribes and the settlement of their diras in the best manner, these shall be effected by a committee formed of an equal number of persons from the two parties, in a friendly and brotherly way and without prejudice, according to tribal usage and custom. Ariicle 5. In view of the desire of both high contracting parties for the continuance of peace and tranquillity, and for the non-existence of anything which might disturb the thoughts of these two countries, they mutually undertake not to construct any fortified building within a distance of 5 kilom. on either side of the frontier, anywhere along the frontier line.4 Article 6. The two high contracting parties undertake immediately to withdraw their troops from the country which, by virtue of this treaty, becomes the possession of the other party, and to safeguard the inhabitants and troops. Article 7. ^ The two high contracting parties each undertake to prevent their people fiom committing any harmful or hostile act against the people of the other kingdom, in any district or on any route; to prevent raiding between the Bedouin on both sides; to return all (property) which is established by legal investigation, after the ratification of this treaty, as having been taken; to give compensation for all damage, according as may be legally necessary, where crimes of murder or wounding have been committed ; and severely to punish anyone proved to have committed any hostile act. This article shall continue operative until another agreement shall have been drawn up between the two parties as to the manner of investigating and estimating damage and loss. Article 8. The two high contracting parties mutually undertake to refrain from resorting to force in all difficulties between them, and to do their utmost to settle any disputes which may arise between them, whether caused by this treaty or the interpretation of all or any of its articles or resulting from any other cause, by friendly representations; in the event of inability to agree by this means each of the two parties undertakes to resort to arbitration, of which the conditions, the manner of demand, and the conduct are explained in the appendix attached to this treaty. This appendix shall have the force and authority of this treaty, and shall be considered as an integral part of it. Article 9. The two high contracting parties undertake, by all moral and material means at their command, to prevent the use of their territory as a base and centre for any hostile action or enterprise, or preparations therefor, against the country of the other party. They also undertake to take the following measures immediately on receipt of a written demand from the Government of the other party :— (1) If the person endeavouring to foment insurrection is a subject of the Government which receives the application to take measures, he should, after the matter has been legally investigated and established, receive a deterrent punishment which will put an end to his actions and prevent their recurrence. (2) If the person endeavouring to foment insurrection is a subject of the Government making the demand for measures to be taken, he should be immediately arrested by the Government applied to and handed over to the Government making the demand. The Government asked to surrender him shall have no right to excuse themselves from carrying out this demand, but shall be bound to take adequate steps to prevent the flight of the person asked for, and in the event of the person asked for being able to run ayray, the Government from whose territory he has fled shall undertake not to allow him to return to its territory, and if he is able so to return, shall arrest him and hand him over to his Government. (3) If the person endeavouring to foment insurrection is a subject of a third Government, the Government to whom the demand is made and who finds the person in its territories, shall immediately and directly after the receipt of the demand of the other Government, take steps to expel him from its country, and to consider him as undesirable and to prevent him from returning there in future. Article 10. The two high contracting parties agree not to receive anyone who has fled from the jurisdiction of his Government, whether he be great or small, official or non-official, an individual or a group. Each of the high contracting parties shall[181 n—1] B 3 take adequate and effective administrative or military measures, &amp;c., to prevent these fugitives entering within the borders of its country. If one or all of them succeeds in crossing the frontier and entering its territory, it shall be bound to disarm the refugee and to arrest him and hand him over to the Government of of the country from which he fled. In the event of its being unable to arrest him, it shall take adequate steps to drive him out from the country which he has entered into the country to which he belongs. Article 11.

The subjects of each of the two parties, when in the country of the other party, should be treated in accordance with local law. Article 13. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes to announce a full and complete amnesty for all crimes and hostile acts which may have been committed by any person or persons who are subjects of the other party, but reside in its territory (i.e., in the territory of the party issuing the amnesty). Similarly, each of them undertakes to issue a full, general and complete amnesty to those of its subjects who may have gone, or taken refuge, or in any manner joined themselves, to the other party; for all crimes; and for the property which they may have taken from the time when they came to the other party until their return, whatever its nature and whatever its amount; and not to allow any sort of injury, punishment or constraint to be made upon them on account of their having taken refuge or joined themselves, or of the manner in which they did so. If either party has any doubt of the occurrence of anything contrary to this undertaking, the party entertaining the doubt may apply to the other party to convoke a meeting of the representatives who signed this treaty; if it is impossible for any one of them to attend, he may depute another fully authorised and empowered person, well acquainted with the localities and who is anxious to effect a settle ment between the parties and to carry out the rights of both, to attend to investigate the matter, so that no injustice or dispute may arise. The decision of these representatives shall be considered as binding. Article 14. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes to return the property of those of its subjects whom it pardons, and to hand it over to them or their heirs on their return to their country, in obedience to the law of their country. The high contracting parties similarly undertake not to retain any of the goods and chattels which belong to the subjects of the other party, and not to create obstacles to their free use or to the disposal of them. Article 15.

Article 17. In the event of any external aggression on the country of one of the two high contracting parties, the other party shall be bound to carry out the following undertakings :— (1) To adopt complete neutrality secretly and openly. (2) To co-operate mentally and morally as far as possible. (3) To undertake negotiations with the other party to discover the best way of guaranteeing the safety of the country of that party and of preventing its being harmed, and to refrain from any act which might be interpreted as assisting that external aggressor. Article 18. In the event of insurrection or hostilities taking place within the country of one of the two high contracting parties, both of them mutually undertake as follows :— (1) To take all necessary effective measures to prevent the aggressors or the rebels from making use of their territories. (2) To prevent fugitives from taking refuge in their countries, and to hand them over or expel them if they have entered, as explained in articles 9 and 10 above. (3) To prevent its subjects joining the aggressors or rebels, and to refrain from encouraging or supplying them.

It is understood that this article does not restrict the freedom of either side in any manner whatsoever in any of its rights. Similarly, it cannot be interpreted as limiting the freedom of either of them or of compelling either to adopt this course. Article 21. The contents of the agreement signed on the 5th Shaban, 1350, shall in any case be cancelled as from the date of ratification of this treaty.7 Article 22.

It shall continue in force for a period of twenty (20) complete lunar years. It may be renewed or modified during the six months preceding its expiry. If not so renewed or modified by that date, it shall remain in force until six months after such time as one party has given notice to the other party of his desire to modify it. Article 23.

Arbitration Covenant between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Yemen. Whereas their Majesties the Imams King Abdul Aziz, King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and King Yahya, King of the Yemen, have agreed in accordance with article 8 of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Good Understanding, known as the Treaty of Taif, signed on the 6th Safar, 1353, to refer to arbitration any dispute or difference which may arise out of the relations between them, their Governments and countries, when all friendly representations fail to settle it, the two high contracting parties undertake to effect arbitration in the manner shown in the following articles :— x^RTICLE 1. Each of the two high contracting parties undertakes to accept reference of the question in dispute to arbitration within one month of the date of receipt of the other party of a demand for arbitration. Article 2. The arbitration shall be undertaken by a committee composed of an equal number of arbitrators, half of whom shall be selected by each of the two parties. A chief arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement between the two high contracting parties. If they do not agree in this respect, each of them shall nominate a person, and if either party accepts the peison nominated by the other party, the person in question shall become chief arbitrator. If even this cannot be agreed upon, the chief arbitrator shall be chosen by ballot, on the understanding that the ballot shall only be drawn on persons acceptable to both parties. The person chosen by ballot shall become the head of the arbitration committee, and entitled to settle the case. If, however, agreement cannot be arrived at on the persons acceptable to both parties, negotiations shall be carried on until the two parties agree on this point.■■■■ 8 Article 3. The selection of the arbitration committee and its chief shall be completed within one month of the date of the end of the month fixed for the reply of the party whose acceptance of arbitration was requested by the other party. The arbitration committee shall meet at a place to be agreed upon within a period not exceeding one month after the expiry of the two months provided for at^ the beginning of this article. The arbitration committee shall give its award within a period which, in any case, should not exceed one month as from the expiry of the period fixed for the meeting to take place. The award of the arbitration committee shall be given by a majority of votes, and shall be considered binding on the two parties. Its execution immediately after its issue and communication shall be considered obligatory. Each of the two high contracting parties may appoint a person or persons, as he desires, to defend his case before the arbitration committee and to produce the necessary evidence and arguments. Article 4. The charges in regard to the arbitrators of each party shall be chargeable to their respective parties. The charges of the chief arbitrator shall be chargeable to both parties equally, as well as the expenses of the other investigations. Article 5. This covenant shall be regarded as an integral part of the Treaty of Taif signed this day, the 6th Safar, 1353, and will remain in force during the period of the validity of the treaty. Written in Arabic, in two copies, of which each of the two high contracting parties is in possession of one. Signed on the sixth day of Safar, thirteen hundred and fifty-three.

(2) That the contents of this treaty be kept secret and be not published by either party, especially that part concerning the question of the frontiers, on account of the disturbance which might result, particularly in the Tihama.

With highest respects, KHALID-BIN-ABDUL AZIZ-AS-SAUD. (2) Abdullah-al-Wazir to His Royal Highness the Amir Khalid, dated the §th Safar, 1353. (After usual compliments.)

With highest respects, ABDULLAH-BIN-AHMED-AL-WAZIR. (3) Abdullah-al-Wazir to His Royal Highness the Amir Khalid, dated the §th Safar, 1353. (After usual compliments.) I have the honour to confirm, in continuation of the Treaty of Taif which has been signed by your Highness on behalf of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and by me on behalf of His Majesty the King, the Imam Yahya, that, in the name of His Majesty the Imam Yahya, I undertake as follows :— (1) The Surrender of the Idrisis to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. The necessary measures have been taken to hand over Seyyid Hasan and Seyyid Abdul Aziz-bin-Muhammad A1 Idrisi, who will be handed over immediately to His Highness the Amir Feysal in the Tihama, but as Sayyid Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi is still in the Abadil country, the necessary steps have been taken to bring him down from there, so that we can surrender him. In the event of his disobeying the order, I give the following undertakings in the name of His Majesty the Imam Yahya :— (a) The Government of the Imam Yahya will refuse him all moral and material assistance, and will prevent any aid or support reaching him from their country. (5) If the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz desire to arrest him in their territories where he is, the Government of His Majesty the Imam Yahya will, on their part, concert every kind of military restriction in their power in order to prevent him from fleeing into their territories, and undertake to arrest him, together with any person from any district or tribe in the Saudi Arab Kingdom who may have joined him in his activities, and to surrender them unconditionally to the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, in the event of their entering the districts of the Yemeni Kingdom, and to prevent him and any persons who may have joined him in his activities from escaping abroad in the event of their entering the territories of the Kingdom of the Yemen. (2) Those Sharifs and Others who were in any connected with the Idrisis and their activities. If these should desire to join the Idrisis, they shall be granted the safety, protection, respect, and regard due to their position, by the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. If, however, they should not so desire, they shall be expelled from the country of the Imam Yahya and shall not be allowed to remain in it, and, in the event of their returning to it a second time, shall be at once expelled and warned that if they return again they will be handed over to the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, if they should return again after their expulsion, I undertake in the name of His Majesty the Imam Yahya to surrender them unconditionally to the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz.I request that your Highness will be good enough to regard this as a firm undertaking having the same value as the treaty concluded this day between us and your Highness, may God be witness of it; I request that this may be considered as confirming the verbal agreement reached between us in this matter. With highest respects, ABDULLAH-BIN-AHMED-AL-WAZIR. * (4) Khalid-bin-Abdul Aziz to Siyyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, dated the 6th Safar, 1353. (After usual compliments.) I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s letter of to-day’s date regarding the undertakings which you have given in the name of His Majesty the Imam Yahya relative to the Idrisis and their followers. I am confident that your undertakings will be carried out with the honesty and faithfulness which is expected from His Majesty the Imam Yahya, and we hope that they will be carried out as early as possible. With highest respects, KHALID-BIN-ABDUL AZIZ (5) Khalid-bin-Abdul Aziz to Sayyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, dated the 6th Safar. 1353. (After usual compliments.) In connexion with the signature of the Treaty of Taif between our kingdom and that of the Yemen, I hereby confirm our agreement regarding the movement of subjects of the Saudi Arab Kingdom and of the Kingdom of the Yemen in the two countries, namely, that movements at the present time shall continue as in the past until a special agreement is drawn up between the two Governments relative to the method which they jointly agree to adopt in regard to the regulations fof such movements, whether for pilgrimage, or for trade, or for any other purpose or reason. I hope to receive your reply agreeing in this matter. With highest respects, KHALID-BIN-ABDUL AZIZ (6) Abdullah-al-Wazir to His Royal Highness the Amir Khalid, dated the 6th Safar, 1353. (After usual compliments.) I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Highness’s letter, dated the 6th Safar, regarding the movement of the subjects of the two parties between the two countries, and I agree with your Highness that movements at present shall continue as in the past until a special agreement is drawn up relative to the regulations of such movements in the future, and that this will be regarded by our Government as it is by yours.

Ho« 7&amp;/£1/10 . Sir, + * + 2* I received from Admiralty information that H.M. Government did not wish to he tied to awaiting the Italian withdrawal if the latter was unduly delayed, provided that I, and Resident Aden, were satisfied as to the safety of British subjects and property on t he YEMEN coast, and that the IMAM h©d given the necessary undertaking to safeguard British interests. I was accordingly to quietly drop my attitude of insistence on this point. (Admiralty message 1635/30th June). 3. I was assisted to this end by the feet that as reported in my 133Z/29th June, AZ3I had at last received instructions to withdraw when satisfied, and also by the fact that at a private interview which I had instructed SALEH JEPi^ER, the British Agent, to arrange with ABDULLAH WAZIR, the latter stated that he had had news from SANAA, and indicated that the Italians had agreed to comply absolutely with the IMAM'S views on the question of their flag and withdrawal. This enabled SALEH JAFEER to enquire whether, if the Italians had not withdrawn reasonably soon after security was assured, he would prefer the British and French to remain or leave. He was obviously delighted at being consulted thus in advance, and replied that if I would withdraw with the French when we were satisfied it would strengthen his position even further as regards getting rid of the Italians. 4. ABDULLAH WAZIR'S reputation of being a strong man is borne out by the following incident. It was pointed out to him that a certain company of regular troops (80) drawn from the TIHAMA tribes, detailed to act as advance guard in HODEIDA during SAUDI evacuation, had been guilty of looting and other misbehaviour during the original YEMENI retreat. It was suggested that they were singularly unsuitable for the occasion. 'Let them oome’' said WAZIR. On arrival, they were fallen in and each man given one or two Therfesas , since, it was explained, surely they must be short of money. On the following day, they were ordered to fall in in the Customs House yard. They did so wondering what further presentation was to be made. The heavy door was closed behind the last man, a small armed guard closed up, and they were called out one by one, disarmed and sent home. 5. Meanwhile, the 'turn-over” between AMIR PEI SAL and ABDULLAH WAZIR was proceeding smoothly and without disturbance, FEISAL'S departure being continually postponed. WASIR had taken over the Customs. End July. ABDUL WAHAB IDRISI left by car, under escort, for GIZAN and MECCA. 'PENZANCE” arrived and delivered mails, but in the circumstances I considered it advisable for 'HASTINGS” to remain at HODEIUA, and ordered 'PENZANCE' to return to KAMA RAN on the following day, with mails for despatch. HENRY The SECRETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY. DU (Copies to;- Commander-in-Okief, Mediterranean. Commanding Officer, H.M.S. 'PENZANCE').2 2nd July. (contd. ) DTS MONJPBEI D sailed for MOCHA at noon. An impression of his visit is given in Appendix I, although it is realized that interest in the Appendix will probably be confined to those who have met him, read his books, or served in an official capacity in or near the Red Sea in the past. 4th July. 7. About 1500 SAUDIS left HODEIDk in s.s. ALAVI, and a further 250 mounted troops by road. 'TURBIITE' arrived to replace M N51MB0 M who had sailed for MASSOWA on the previous day. 8. During the morning the Italian Senior Naval Officer visited me by appointment. I took the precaution of inviting the French Senior Naval Officer to be present also. After much hesitation, and obviously very ill at ease, AZZI suggested that it might be better if our official call on ABDULLAH WAZIK were paid independently, and not Jointly. I replied that as we were calling together on JPEISAL that evening to say good-bye, it might appear strange if we acted differently when paying our first official call on WAZIR. AZZI persisted, however, and, the matter not being of real importance, I told him that as he felt so strongly on the subject, I would certainly agree. 9. I had noticed that morning that the Italian flag was no longer flying on shore, and I could not help connecting the two incidents, I learnt subsequently that Doctors fAZZI and JEM^CKLLI had already had three interviews with WA2IE, the last being of a particularly tense nature. The subjects under discussi on were the usual ones, i.e., the Italian flag and withdrawal (my 1326/5 July). Briefly, MAZIB said that as soon as he took over officially, he would no longer request, but would order the immediate removal of the Italian flag. Whilst the British and French were being most helpful the Italians were obstructing, and, which was even worse, going back on the definite assurances given to the IMAM at SANAA. (I was fortunate in being able to obtain an ear witness* account of the interview). 10. I could only conclude that AZZI*S reluctance to call on WAZIR in company with the British and French Senior Naval Officers was attributable either to his intention of continuing the argument or, which appeared more likely, to his fear that WAZIR might make some remarks which would be extremely inconvenient if we were present. 11. The three Senior Naval Officers paid a farewell call on AMIR FEISAL in the evening. He was extremely pleasant, but the visit was purely formal and nothing of interest trans- pi red. 5th July 12. The formalities of handing over were completed and FEISAL left by car for the north with 250 SAUDIS. No incidents occurred, but the final evacuation was carefully watched by the advance guard of 150 regular YEMENIS who were methodically but unostentatiously stationed for that purpose. LGHEIYA also passed under YEMENI control. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, staff and 200 SAUDIS had embarked in s.s. ALNASER, but owing to various delays did not sail until 0200 on the following day. As in the case of the s.s. AL FATH (vide paragraph 51 of my No.7A/l9/2 of 1st July, 1934), NAJIB SALHA again approached me, and said that 'ALNASER' had not s ^H i ? n K water - Oovernment would be extremely grateru! if I would arrange a supply at KAMARAN as before, art assistance from 'PENZANCE'. I made arrangements accordingly.3 13. Following private representations from the shore authorities and by agreement between the three Senior Naval Officers, all ships dressed overall in celebration of peace. 14. During the forenoon, I paid my official call on ABDULLAH WAZIR, being accompanied by the French Senior Naval Officer. On the way ashore, we passed the Italian Senior Naval Officer returning from a similar miesion. As reported in my 1734/6th July 1KAZIR was quite overwhelming in his cordiality. He referred to 'PENZANCE’S' timely arrival in the first instance which had saved a very awkward situation, and to the subsequent firm British attitude on questions of landing parties, flags and withdrawal of warships, which had enabled him in turn to deal very firmly with the situation. He thanked the French Senior Naval Officer for his co-operation with the British and, in reply to my enquiry, gave the fullest guarantee on behalf of the IMAM, with which he willingly associated himself, to safeguard interests of British and French subjects. He said that our courteous act in dressing ship in celebration of peace had given him the greatest pleasure. I referred to the absence of the Italian Senior Naval Officer, and explained that by his own wish, he had arranged to call independently. WAZIR shrugged his shoulders aad said that he had quite expected this to occur. Finally I expressed my complete satisfaction with his guarantee to safeguard the interests of British and French subjects, and said that the British and French ships would sail on the following day. He thanked me profusely and asked me to convey the IMAM'S thanks to the British (Jovernraent. 15. It was very gratifying to hear the murmur of approval which greeted his remarks from the circle of high officials who had attended the audience. I felt that he meant all he said and I was confirmed in this view by his subsequent remarks to SALEH JAFFER who is a personal friend of his. 16. AZZI called on me later in the day and informed me that 'TURBINE” would sail that evening and 'AZIO' at 1130 on the following day. I was not surprised at this news, having previously received a description of AZZI'S official call on WAZIR. This consisted of the constantly reiterated statement by AZZI that he was only there to help ABDULLAH WA3IR, followed by an equal number of requests by WAZIR that he should withdraw with the British and French. WAZIR finally added that he did not wish to be compelled to order him to leave. 17. AZZI'S stubborn attitude was the subject of universal comment, particularly as it was displayed on the occasion of his first official call and before so many onlookers. 18. I ordered 'PENZANCE' to sail from KAMA RAN as convenient for PORT SUDAN and MALTA 19. During the afternoon, the port Master brought off under sail a present from WAZIR of an enormous calf and half a dozen sheep - all alive. The port Master is the leading native tennis player and I knew him well enough to enquire whether the calf, at any rate, could not be killed and Pressed on shore. He replied that it would be difficult as WAZIR had ordered the largest and fattest calf to he chosen for me, and misunderstanding might arise if it were seen sailing ashore again. So it had28 4 had to walk up the ladder with the rest. I responded with a letter of thanks and a present of certain tinned goods. 20. In the evening 'AZIO' gave an informal 'at home', after which 'TURBINE' sailed for EASSOWA. 'L* 21. The French sloop 'TPRES' sailed at 0700 for KAMAPAN, where I had arranged with the Acting Administrator, Dr CHGUAN that she should be supplied with water and ice. 22. ASZI called on me to say 'good-bye' and infoxmed me he was delaying his departure until 1230 in order to see WAZIR again before sailing. I returned his call shortly afterwards, and sailed for KAMA RAN at 1130. 23. I was subsequently informed by SALEH JAFFER that at this second interview AZZT endeavoured to remove any bad impression he might have created. WAZIR was in humorous mood and when AZZI said that he was sailing at 1230, enquired whether TAZZI and JEMSCELLI would not take advantage of such a splendid opportunity of going as well. Becoming serious, he added that they were not wanted and would have to go. AZZI replied that he could not take them at such short notice, but that he would report to his Government. 'AZIO' sailed at 1300. SAMARAS. 24. Arrived at 1630 on 7th July and landed the 7th-9th football team for a return match with 'YPRES', who had arrived July. earlier to embark water (paragraph 21 above). 'HASTINGS' won by 2 to 1, and afterwards entertained the French team at the canteen. 1 25. It had been remarkable how, even from the point of view of recreation, the Italians had managed to estrange themselves from the British, French and - not least important - the natives of HQD3IBA. 'HASTINGS', 'PENZANCE' and 'YPRES' had all decided, independently, that owing to the j methods of the Italian team, it would be unwise to play i any further matches with them. The climax wlfrived when the l native team, who always played a fast and extremely fair (game, quietly walked off the ground during a match with |the Italians, having already pleaded at half-time, for fair Splay. Their action was cheered by the spectators, and, it must be added, endorsed by certain Officers who had been watching the match and had left in disgust at half-time. Meanwhile fast but friendly games had continued between the British, French and native teams - in spite of the heat. 26. Ur. Chohan very kindly entertained Lieutenant Commander BE BATE' NS, myself and First Lieutenant to dinner. He informed me that dhows arriving reported all was quiet on the mainland and that the refugees were leaving KAMARAN with their belongings. 27. 'YPRRS' sailed at 0700 on the following morning (8th July) for PORT SUDAN, where I had arranged for her to fuel and embark petrol, and BEIRUT. I look forward very much to meeting her again. BE BABEN3 had throughout shown the utmost willingness to co-operate with me, and, apart from his charming manner, he is a seaman and full of common sense. His Officers and ship’s company also had a great entente with 'HASTINGS'.5. 28. Heporta from the mainland continued to l&gt;e good: the last refugees were preparing to leave with their belongings; tfElSAl and the SAUDI evacuation had been due to pass GIZAH on 6th July, accompanied as far as MIDI by the new AMIL of that town. I therefore decided that ray presence was no longer necessary, and sailed for ADSB at 0600 on 9th July. 29. I had previously obtained permission fran ABDULLAH WAZIB to call at HODSim for a few hours after leaving KAMAKAH* I accordingly anchored there at 1130 on 9th July in order to obtain the latest intelligence. I sent in a boat for SALKH JAifinSE, who was on the pier to meet it. He was accompanied by the port Officer, who came off to wish us, on behalf of the townspeople^ good luck, a speedy return and a further prolonged stay. This act was, of course, much appreciated by all concerned and I replied suitably, but with I fear, mental reservations. 30. SALKH JAJTnffi informed me that everything was quiet and that he had received nothing but satisfactory reports. I therefore weighed at 1400 and continued my passage to A DSN, arriving and securing in No.2 berth at 1700 on 10th July. 31. Official calls were dispensed with, and the Political Besident invited me to lunch on the following day (11th July), when I took the opportunity of describing in rather more detail than is possible by signal, certain of the events and situations which arose at H0DSIDA. 32. I was informed that Lieutenant colonel Lake, the political Secretary, would proceed to SANAA to ratify the treaty recently concluded with the IMAM as soon as the instrument for ratification had been received from the Colonial Office. The Resident requested that Lieutenant Colonel Lake might take passage to H0DEIDA in 'HASTINGS’'* the alternative being a rather undignified arrival in a small coasting staamer. I considered this proposal most desirable and reported to Admiralty accordingly (my 1002/ 14th July), also requesting early information from the Colonial Office. This was received later in Admiralty message 2125/l6th July, and indicated that instrument for ratification and other documents might be expected to arrive at ADEN on 19th August. 33. copy of a report to the Chief Commissioner, on the subject of commercial messages passed by w/T from and to H0DKTDA during the recent events at that place, is attached as Appendix 2.

He was aimply attired, viz;- in a loin cloth. The weather had been sufficiently rough to justify the hire of a dhow by some of the warships in preference to risking the ship’s motor boat, but in spite of the conditions, this remarkable man launched his tiny 'houri”, and disdaining the ordinary landing place, was propelled by two of his crew through the surf to the beach. I then lost sight of him temporarily, but met him on one or two occasions later, and also went on board his sailing craft - the 'JPAT EL RAHMAJJ”. 2. The latter may be described as a conrerted dhow, rigged as a cutter, of about 30 tons. There is an after 'cabin”; a tiny auxiliary engine which produces about three knots and current for a diminutive bulb over the desk in the 'cabin'; a space for 'stores'; and crew space and a further space for stores. The crew consists of six MNAKIL and I have never seen a cleaner, or more happy looking lot of natives. The 'cabin' has a bunk on each side, and also a small one athwart ships right aft. The bunks have no head room and there is very little comfort. DE MONFRSID admitted that he knew of no other European who would put up with similar conditions. The crew live on 'doura' bread baked on red hot ashes in a cylindrical stone cooker. He eats rice and macaroni which he cooks himself. Both he and the crew supplement this diet by fish caught on passage. He carries six rifles, one for each member of the crew, for, as he said, though now a man of peace himself, were there not still the 2AHAHIK ? He carries a sextant and navigates by latitude, run, and instinct• 3. As regards the purpose of his visit, he informed me that he had come to write a descriptive article for the Paris journals 'L*INTRiUSSIQ'iliUlT' and 'VUE' and would remain at HODEIDA for just under 48 hours. In answer to my suggestion that two days seemed a very short time in which to acquire a knowledge of a rather complicated situation, he replied;- 'Two days, and I have two eyes. It is ample, since I shall only write about what I see and not about what I am told'. 4. He furthe r informed me that he had picked up his old friend GHEIK ISSA ('SECKKTS OP THE BED SEA', page 82 et seq.) at TAJOUBAH, on account of his knowledge of the YEMEH, and had dropped him at MOCHA to try to arrange a visit to the IMAM. I enquired after ABDI and he replied that he was still working for him at his place near JIBOUTI, but had become quite blind. 5. DE MONPBEID visited me in 'HASTINGS”, wearing his best suit and looking far from unpresentable. (I am told by DE BADENS that in PARIS, where he now resides normally, he has a house in the fashionable quarter, next to that of the DUO DE YEN DOME, and is usually very smartly dressed). I remarked that it was a curious reflection that I, who in 1922 was endeavouring to frustrate his wicked activities, should now be entertaining him in my cabin. He replied;- 'Les amitifts durables se fondent dans la lutte', and then proceeded to write it on the fly leaf of the book referred to in paragraph 4 above, a copy of which had been given to me by the commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, before leaving MALTA.6. He assured me that his book 'STSCRSTS OF TH3 RED SEA' was accurate in every detail and was, in feet, an absolutely true story. After a severe cross-examination by myself and others, during which charts were called for and produced, I am inclined to believe him. He is now about to publish a translation into English by HELEM BUCHANAH BELL of a second book:- 'AtEHTURES SUR MEK'. He gave me the manuscript to look through, with particular reference to a description of the loss of one of his sailing craft which had been built under his own supervision, saying that he was a little doubtful about Miss (?Mrs) Bell’s translation. The interest in this particular chapter compelled me to skim through the whole manuscript, and a wonderfully exciting story it is. It contains, certainly, a few severe and unjustified, but at the same time amusing, paragraphs about the British and their methods of acquiring fresh colonial extension - but on the other hand, one or two chapters are devoted to his admiration for and gratitude to the British Navy when he was arrested 'by order', and kept on board the R.I.k.S. 'MINTO' at BERBEEA. And, as he remarked :- 'I am far more severe on French officials'. 7 7. He sailed on 2nd July for MOCHA. If CHEIK ISSA had failed to arrange a visit to the IMAM, he was going to re-embark him and proceed to JIBOUTI. And thence by paquebot to PARIS. He left at noon, with his DANAMIL and rifles and macaroni and sextant. A very remarkableAPPSHPIX NO.S TO S.O.R.S.S. Mo.T a/ 21/10 of lat Amast. 1934 r Ho.18/20/8. H.M.3. 'HASTINGS', at Aden. 17th July, 1934. Sir, I beg to bring to your notice the following messages exchanged between ADEN W/T STATION and H.M.S. 'HASTINGS' whilst the latter was at HODEIDA. g, (a) From 'Hastings' to Aden w/T Station on 29th June - Contents of telegram from Cowasjee, Hodeida to Cowaajee, Ad«u. (2145). (b) From 'Hastings' to Aden w/T on 30th June - 3* Pass to Cowasjee, Aden. I am prepared to accept your reply to Gowasjee, Hodeida* (1020). (c) From Aden w/T to 'Hastings' on 30th June - Reference private telegram accepted by you for transmission to Aden from Hodeida. Manager E.T.C* states this is irregular in view of cable service. (1140). (d) From 'Hastings' to Aden w/T on 30th June - Your 1140. There is at present no cable service. Italian Warship 'A3I0' is accepting commercial traffic. Cowasjee message was of Importance and affects evacuation of Hodeida. I sent it by request of Saudi Government to ensure quick reply. (1759). (e) From 'Hastings' to Aden w/T on 4th July - My 1759/30. I await Manager E.T.C.’s reply. I do not want similar situation to ariae again. (2219). (f) From Aden w/T to 'Hastings' on 7th July - Your 2219/4. Following received from Manager E.T.C. begins. We will accept traffic from Hodeida via H.M.S. 'Hastings” until we receive a satisfactory reply re Hodeida route ends. (1650/6). I desire to offer the following comments (a) The cable between HOIEim and SANAA had been cut for weeks, and 'A3I0' had been accepting THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, ADEN. commercla 1commercial traffic, sending messages via ASMARA. I accepted this situation, reserving 'HASTING’S' W/T for urgent messages. (fe) v/hile not suggesting that lanager E.T.C* should necessarily have heen aware of this state of affairs, I submit that he should have acted on my information regarding cable communication. So far from doing this, I am informed that he actually sent a message to ”A3I0', telling her that it was irregular for her to accept commercial messages, thereby, as far as was in his power, deliberately cutting of f our subjects in HODET from communication with the outside world. (o) I was informed, on arrival at Aden, that Manager E.T.C. was under the impression that there was a cable route from HODEIBA to JEDI&amp;H, and thence via POBT SUDAN to ADEN. A HODEIDA - JKDBAH line has, ao far as I know, never existed, and I do not think that Manager E.T.C.’e ignorance of this fact excuses in any way the action taken by him as described in (b) above. (d) I have received no explanation from Manager, E.T.G., although he has visited ’HASTINGS” since our arrival. 4. This letter is not written in a vindictive spirit, but merely in an endeavour to ensure that a similar situation cannot arise again.

HA JIB SAIjHA, Secretary to the SAUDI Minister of finance, presented the gift on behalf of the Amir. I responded with a letter of thanks and a present of tinned goods. 3. In course of conversation, HaJIB SALHA asked me whether I could arrange a period during which it would be possible for the Saudi shore station to transmit messages without interference by transmission of the warships. He said that it had become increas ingly difficult to maintain their W/T communication owing to this interference. He implied, and later on said point blank, that it was the Italian ships and not the British of French, who were causing this difficulty. 4. I replied that I would consult my colleagues and do my best to lessen his difficulties. At the same time I pointed out that we were all tied by the rules governing our respective w/T organisations and that we were all suffering in some measure from the same evil. 5. A communication from me to the Hrench and Italian Command ing Officers explaining the situation produced an immediate improve ment, and I subsequently received a letter of thanks from HAJIB SALHA 6. Ever since my arrival I had been pressing the Commanding Officer of 'AZIO' to let me have his plan for protection of lives and property should a landing for this purpose become necessary, at the same time informing him verbally of my intentions. To-day I told him that I would send him my plan in writing within twenty four hours, and hoped he would do the same, since as we were both here for the same purpose, it was essential that we should both know the exact procedure of our respective landing parties in case of emergency. He agreed. I also reminded him that there would, of course, be no landing except by mutual agreement and he assured me that this was quite understood by him. £KP JUNE . 7. The French sloop 'YPRKS' arrived rather unexpectedly at 0830* The Commanding Officer informed me that he had met his Admiral (JQUBERT) at sea and that it had been decided that he should return here immediately after fuelling at BEBIM, proceeding to DJIBOUTI at a later date. His instructions were tot co-operate with me in every way. 8. I sent my plan for protection over to the w AZI0 n and in return received an apology that the Italian plan was not quite ready. I received it however on the following day. ^. The.*«.. The Secretary of the Admiralty. (Copies to;- Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Commanding Officer, H.tt.S. 'PEHZAHCE').9. The main difference between the two plans was that whereas I had arranged to protect a definite block of adjacent houses, selected on account of (a) suitability for defence, (b) accommodation and (c) value, all British subjects assembling in these houses, the Italians intended to place an armed guard in every house occupied by an Italian subject, with a reserve stationed in Doctor TAZZI'S house. (The Italian subjects number approximately 30. At present the British list totals 340, all of whom have been warned as to their procedure in emergency). 10. The French plan was in reality an extension of the British, i.e., three or four more houses had been added to tbe British block. (French subjects total 15). ♦ * * * 3RD JUNE * 12. All ships dressed overall on the occasion of d.M. ike King’s birthday and also of Italian Constitution Day. Commanding Officer of 'Agio* very courteously paid me an official visit in honour of the occasion, \diich I returned. By arrange ment, Commanding Officer of 'YPRES' also met me onboard 'AZIO'. No salutes were fired by the wish of the AMIR FEISAL, to which 'AZI0 w had expressed his willingness to conform. 13. In the late afternoon, the IDRISIS AL HASAN and ABDUL AZIZ arrived in HODSIDA by car to be surrendered to the AMIR FEISAL. News was also received that the IDRISI ABDUL WAHAB was to be surrendered at ABOU ARISE. * * * * 4TH JUNB . 15. SALEH JAFFER gave me an eye-witness account of the reception by the AMIR FEISAL of the IDRISIS. He was extremely kind and promised them that everything would be done for their comfort. He placed a large house at their disposal and assured them of their complete safety. 16. The surrender of the IDRISIS gave rise to great and varied speculation. It was fairly certain that some tribes hitherto loyal to the IMAM would now turn against him, with vftiat effect it was difficult to predict. The military situation had appeared to be very advantageous to the YEMENI forces, and the turn of events caused a good deal of surprise, and relief to the SAUDIS in HODEIDA. This surprise was shared by the Italians with ill concealed annoyance. 17. Confirmation and further details of the landing of arms and ammunition by the Italians at MOCHA on 25th May,(my 1933/29 May) was received to-day. 6,000 cases of ammunition and 2,000 cases of rifles and machine guns were loaned by s.s. 'ERITREA”. Cases were disembarked into dhows specially ordered for the purpose*. * * * * 19. 'PENZANCE” sailed at 1230 for KAMARAN and ”YPRES” at 1630 for JIB0UTI. The latter had reoeivdd sudden orders, and asked me to be good enough to inform his agent and NAJIB SALHA. This I did. The French agent is old and quite blind. Commander DE BADENS of ”YPRES” has suggested to his Government that a new agent be appointed.A 20* In the erening I was entertained at dinner in 'ji^TO' by Oapltano di tfregata kZZl (Senior Italian Naval T „ wn Capitano di Corvetta HiOfIEHI, Commanding Officer of the TURBINE , was also dining with him. A marked contrast. A5555T, slightly deaf, formal to a degree, entirely devoid of humour, speaking little English and understanding less. RAHIEBI* bright, vivacious, informal and speaking perfect English. I gave him a passage to 'TURBINE” in ®y boat that night, and he told me that AftZt was a byeword for his extreme formality and lor the number and length of his cypher messages. It was evident r het the Commanding Officers of both the Italian destroyers viewed their present role with distaste, consisting as it did of ferrying stores and officers and men of 'A55IO' (who go on leave in batches) backwards and forwards between MASSOWA and HODEIM, with the possibility of a landing under unpleasant circumstances in the background* 7TH JUNE. 21. SALEH JAFFER informed me that RTEA, an important mercKanr and uncle-in-law of the IMAM'S third son, AL HUSSEIN, had received a private letter from SANAA enquiring whether any foreign flags were being flown in HODEIDA. The IMaM'S aversion to the display of any flag other than the YEMENI is well known. 22. SALEH JAFFEF also informed me that I BN SAUD had sent the IDRISIS a present of £200 in the form of a draft on the AMIR FSISAL. This draft the latter had been either unable or unwill ing to meet and the IDRTSIS were consequently without funds of any sort. 23. 'TURBINS' sailed for MASSOWA shortly after midnight, 7th/8th June. KAMARA*. 26. Officer Commanding British Forces, ADEN, very kindly lOtli -~13th arranged a special air mail trip which arrived shortly alter noon jon 11th June. At my suggestion an Officer was also sent by Political Resident, ADEN to discuss the question of the security of KAMAIUN when the SAUDI withdrawal from HODEIBA commenced, if 'PEN3ANC®' were withdrawn to refit at MALTA. political Resident ADEN was quite emphatic in his views as to the danger of on influx of armed refugees, and even the possibility of armed raids, from the mainland. It was also evident that one sloop should remain continuously at HODEIDA for the present. I reported accordingly to commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (ray 1607/11 and 1824/13/June) and subsequently was informed by him that refit of 'PEN3ANCE' might be deferred, but that she was to proceed to MALTA as soon as the situation permitted.

'YPRES' sailed from HODEIBA at 0930 on £5th June. A special air mail trip had been kindly arranged by Officer commanding British Forces, ADEH, which arrived at about noon.

'PDNSABCH' gave an informal 'at home' at 1830 to Captains and Oificers of all ships present. 44. On my arrival I addressed a letter to commander AZZI - attached as Appendix 2 - on the subject of the withdrawal of foreign warships from BODEIDA, I was prompted to do this by my growing conviction that he was not really anxious to leave as soon as possible, and that he might, in fact, have quite contrary orders. This conviction was shared by the French Senior flaval Officer as well as by many level headed persons on shore. Further, since 'A2SI0' was served by two destroyers running weekly trips between HOD&amp;IUA and MA8S04A with provisions, mails and libertymen, and thus could remain for months, I considered that the sooner the position was clarified the better. I Informed Admiralty accordingly (my 1801 and 1917/£5th June). , 45. The Peace Mission arrived from SAHAA to await a ship for AIRS. 'PENZANCE' sailed for &amp;AMABAS at 0530. I received a reply from AZZT to my letter on the subject of the Italian withdrawal (Appendix No.B), It consisted of a statement that he had no instructions, but had communicated the contents of my letter to the necessary authorities. He had arranged to call on me that morning, and I took the opportunity of expressing my natural surprise and disappointment that he should be without any orders, particularly in view of the arrangements made between the British, French and Italian Governments that the respective Haval Commanders of the two latter would concert with me regarding withdrawal. He said he had no instructions on these lines, W BADEBS, who was also present, stated that he, quite definitely, had received such Instructions from his Admiral* . 46* Italian destroyer 'NSMBO' arrived at 1045, and her Commanding Officer, Oapltano di Fregata GIARTOSIQ was on board 'A2I0' when I returned ASZI’S call. In course of conversation I referred again to the question of the withdrawal of foreign warships from HODETDA. with particular reference to our joint official call when ABDULLAH WAS5TB took over. I pointed out how awkward it would be if I was unable to apeak for the three Senior Naval Officers, AZZI replied that he hoped for an earlyrreply from his Government on the subject of withdrawal and that he felt he would be able to settle the flag question amicably with the YEMENI authorities.27tJa Ju*6. 47* although I have alya^a ex^reaaei my vie^ Witli £2IiS i-SV-^ (contd.} able firmness, these converaatIona have been carried on throughout in the most friendly spirit.

At ABDULLAH WASIR'S request, SALEH J A PEER had paid him a visit on the previous evening. WAZIR eiqpreased profoundest gratitude for the consideration shown by the British for the YEMENI feelings on the flag question and the fullest understanding ; of the position regarding the withdrawal of foreign warships. He admitted an uneasy feeling, before he arrived, that he would have difficulties with the British. He found only hekp and consider ation. He said that he would inform the IMAM accordingly and ask him to thank the British Government officially. He referred bitterly to the Italians and stated his determination to order the removal of their flag as soon as he took over. B8TH JUNE. 50. The Italian s.s. 'ERITREA' arrived at 1030 and negotia ¬ * I tions were at once commenced by the SAUDI authorities for the evacuation by her of the 1,300 remaining SAUDI troops. The nego tiations ended in failure owing to the Master’s unwillingness to embark the SAUDIS without his company’s permission, although 'ASIQ' informed him that there was no official objection. 51. BOO SAUDIS left in s.a. 'AL SMB'. NAJIB SaIHA, Secretary to the SAUDI Minister of Finance, asked me to arrange a supply of 40 tons of water at KAMARAH en route. I arranged the supply of water, but was then approached by NAJIB who asked whether 'PENZANCE” could assist in pumping U on board. I replied that this would not be possible, as owing to the confined anchorage and constantly whanging wind, it would be dangerous for the ships to get sufficiently close to one another. 'PENZANCE' would assist, however, in any way possible. I infoimwd 'PENZANCE' accordingly, and with the aid of the latter’s small semi-rotary hand pump, BO tons of water were embarked during Friday B9th, after which 'AL FATH' continued north. 5B. I lunched in 'ASTO” at the invitation of captain ASZt. He subsequently weighed and moored astern of s.s. 'ERITREA' and filled up with fresh water, resuming his berth on completion.

July 18, 193* Section -R-. z. ' 5322 i v-/ \w' “ Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 18.) (No. 209.) Sir, Jedda, July 3, 1934. SINCE I wrote my despatch No. 194 of the 19th June the only major developments in connexion with the Saudi-Yemen situation, as seen from Jedda, have been the exchange of ratifications of the peace treaty on the 22nd June, its publication next day, and the first stages of the Saudi evacuation of the Yemen littoral. I dealt fully with the peace treaty in my despatch No. 202 of the 27th June, and the commanding officers of the Red Sea sloops have kept His Majesty’s Government fully informed of the progress of the evacuation. I will, therefore, confine this despatch to recording a few items of information not important enough to telegraph. 2 . Once the evacuation of the Yemen became certain, the Saudi Government appeared to lose all interest in the proceedings of the foreign warships at Hudeida. I therefore abandoned some little time ago any attempt to keep them advised by formal notification of the arrivals and departures of the Red Sea sloops. 3. Two of the three principal Idrisis, viz., Seyyids Hasan and Abdul Aziz, arrived in Mecca on the 25th June, having been brought overland from the Yemen. They seem to have passed through or close to Jedda, but attracted little attention here. It is not clear that Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi was actually surrendered before the 22nd June. Anyhow, the fact of his surrender was not definitely made known until it was mentioned, without any indication of the date, in the communique of the 27th June, a copy of which was enclosed in my printed despatch No. 202 of the 29th June. The Umm-al-Qura of the 29th June published telegrams exchanged between him and the King on the 26th June. The Seyyid addressed the King as his father and besought his forgiveness. The King’s reply magnanimously minimised the regrettable past and assured Abdul Wahhab of his regard for all Arabs and the Idrisi family in particular. 4. It seems probable that the Irdisis will be removed in due course to Riyadh and interned there in the same easy conditions as other political personages of high lineage like Ali Idrisi and the Beni Aidh. 5. The Umm-al-Qura of the 29th June, already referred to, published also telegrams of congratulation exchanged between Ibn Saud and the Imam. Their only feature of interest is that Ibn Saud seems to have telegraphed on the 19th June, immediately on hearing that the Imam had signed his ratification, whereas the Imam postponed his reply until the day after the ratifications had been exchanged. A later paper, the Saut-al-Hijaz of the 2nd July, published a telegram from Pince Omar Toussoun to the King applauding his demonstration of his desire to avoid bloodshed and to promote peace, and a reply from the King stressing his devotion to those objects and calling upon God to witness how unwillingly he had joined issue with the Imam. 6 . Tfie arrival of the first contingent of Saudi troops to return from the Yemen by sea caused a slight stir in Jedda on the 2nd July when the Besse steamer El Hak brought 200 or 300 men from Hudeida. There were no signs of patriotic exaltation, but there was much moving about of cars. Larger numbers of troops may be expected in a few days in the Alavi of the Mogul Line (Turner, Morrison and Co. of Bombay). She was chartered at short notice as a result of the negotiations mentioned in my telegram No. 148 of the 23rd June, and left Jedda for Hudeida on the 1 st July, instead of proceeding to India with pilgrims as had been previously arranged. It appears from the latest naval reports that she will suffice to complete the evacuation of the Saudi forces, although the first enquiries addressed to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. were for shipping for 5,000 men. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. were unable to make any offer.' 2 7. Thus ends the Saudi-Yemeni war, satisfactorily though perhaps not gloriously for anyone concerned. The great personages who have been least in the picture during the final phase have been the eldest sons of the two principals. It is to be hoped that they will inherit the prudence of their fathers, in which case the peace settlement should be an important factor in the political stabilisa tion of Arabia. It may also prove to have given a stimulus to the idea of Arab solidarity against the rest of the world. 8 .

[E 4452/79/25] /l. John Simon.—(Received July 10.) ^ Jedda, June 27, 1934. WITH reference to my telegram No. 151 of the 24th June. I have the honour to enclose herewith an annotated summary of the recent treaty between kaudi Arabia and the Yemen. It will be some little time before I can send you a lull translation, as it is a lengthy and rather difficult document and my chiet interpreter’ is absent on local sick leave. I have prepared the summary from a rough translation made by Mr. Furlonge with the assistance of the second interpreter. I am anxious that it should reach you as soon as possible, in viev of the exaggerated statements which have appeared in the press suggesting that the two countries have concluded an agreement tantamount to an alliance. I understand that Mr. Philby has gone even further and reported to the Daily | Mail that Ibn Saud has established a veiled protectorate over the Yemen. 2. Despite many obvious defects, the treaty may be regarded as a lairlv workmanlike document. It is in European form and the pious formulae, which have done so much to obscure Saudi-Yemen relations in the past, have been reduced to a minimum. It would be hard to say whether article 4, which determines the frontier, is sufficiently precise to obviate future quarrels, but it at least allocates the principal disputed areas. It is perhaps rather a pity that even now certain points should be referred back to the status yuo before April 1933 and to Ibn Saud’s arbitral award of December 1931. On the whole, however, it would probably have been impossible to do much better in dealing with regions of which there are no accurate maps and where tribal considerations are more important than geography. 3. There is nothing on the face of the treaty to suggest that it has been concluded on other than equal terms. It is significant in this connexion that the Imam figures in it as “ His Majesty the King of the Yemen, a title never given to him in Saudi official language before this treaty was drawn up. Apart from the preliminary conditions on which Ibn Saud insisted to the last, there is no single provision which is not based on the strictest reciprocity. There is no provision for an indemnity and, yace Mr. Philby, no present evidence that Ibn/ Saud has got one by some special arrangement outside the published texts. What' it comes to is that he has, at any rate for twenty years, established his title to both parts of Asir and secured Najran; and for these undoubtedly solid gains he has paid a longish price in military expenditure and a certain price in men. 4. Whether the treaty can be regarded as in any sense an alliance is a more difficult question. I myself am inclined to think that it amounts to little or nothing of the kind. The peculiar position of the parties as the only tw r o really independent rulers in Arabia, both ardent xenophobes, has driven them into impressive affirmations of their Moslem and Arab solidarity. In this matter, if no other, the mission of Arab mediators may have made themselves felt. My new Iraqi colleague goes so far as to attribute the recurrent phrase about brotherhood to the inspiration of the Amir Shakib Arslan, with whom it is a favourite catchword. Great play is made with the doctrine that the people of the two “ countries,” which are carefully distinguished, are one “nation;' but the word which, for the want of a better equivalent, has been translated “ nation ' is not used so as to imply any political unity. It refers rather to that ideal unity of Moslems and Arabs which it is the present fashion to acclaim. 5 . When all is said and done there is little to suggest a real pooling of interests, except articles 15 and 17. The former of these is not very explicit. The latter contains a singular definition of neutrality, compounded, I think, of the three ideas that neutrality in the European sense is a duty, that a brother’s a brother for a' that, and that it is just as well none the less to tie a brother up2 in the knots of a formal understanding if you should need to trust to his neutrality 1 am not ignoring the reference in article 19 to the possibility of an ultimate customs union, but that need not, I think, be taken very seriously at present. 6 . The only other point to which I need advert is the reference to secrecy in the first pair of annexed letters. The Saudi letter suggests that the treaJW should be kept secret, especially the part relative to the frontiers, for fear^or disturbances, more particularly in the coastal region. It might have been supposed that this reason would operate until the Saudi evacuation had been complete, but Ibn Saud and his Government seem to have been content in the end to delay publication only until their preliminary conditions had been fulfilled and the coming into force of the treaty was assured. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Rome, His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner, Aden, the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, Jerusalem, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad, and His Majesty’s High Commissioner, Ramleh. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1 . Annotated Summary of the Saudi-Yemen Peace Treaty concluded at Taif on the §th Safar, 1353 (equivalent to the 20th May, 1934, hut no European date is given). Heading. —“ Treaty of Islamic Friendship and Arab Brotherhood between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of the Yemen.” Preamble. —Appointment of plenipotentiaries, the Amir Khalid-bin-Abdul- Aziz for Ibn Saud and Abdullah-bin-Ahmed-al-Wazir for the Imam, to conclude a treaty as described in the heading in order to realise the objects stated. Note.— Among the objects are the termination of the state of war; ' uniting the word of the Moslem Arab nation, raising its position, and maintaining its prestige and independence and the creation of “ a united front against eventualities and a solid structure to preserve the security of the Arab Peninsula.” Article 1 . State of war ends as from the date of signature of the treaty; perpetual peace and firm and everlasting Moslem Arab brotherhood. Disputes to be settled in spirit of friendship and all relations to be governed by the spirit of the same brotherhood. God called upon to witness the good intentions of the parties. Prayer for His blessing. Art. 2. Mutual recognition by each party of the complete independence and sovereignty of the other and his lawful successors. Abandonment of past claims by either to territory on the other side of the frontier now established. Note. —Express mention is made in the renunciation clause of possible claims by Ibn Saud to territory formerly possessed by the Idrisis or others in what is now recognised as Yemeni, and claims by the Imam on grounds of Yemen unity or otherwise in respect of territory formerly possessed by the Idrisis or the Beni Aidh or of Najran and the Yam country. Art. 3. Neither party to concede to the other less than he concedes to any third party. Neither bound to concede more to the other than he gets in return. Note. —Apparently intended as a most-favoured-nation clause. Art. 4. Description of agreed frontier. Note. —This long and elaborate clause is very difficult to follow owing to the lack of accurate maps and the wealth of unfamiliar geographical and tribal names. It proceeds on the double plan of indicating the general lie of the frontier line and then naming places and tribes which fall on one or the other side. The line runs east from the coast to the mountains ofTihamat Asir; then bends north to the north-westerly limit ot the Beni Juma; then east to the boundaries of Nuqaa and Waar belonging to the Waila tribe and the boundaries of the Yam; then to Madhiq Marwan and the Rifada pass; then east to the boundary between tribes of the stock of Hamdan-bin-Zeyd, Waila, &amp;c., and the Yam. The sketch enclosed in -- Chancery letter of the 12th June to the Eastern Department seems to correspond fairly well with this definition, if the line be continued more or less east between Najran and the Beni Wail, though it is doubtless very inaccurate in detail. Art. 5. No fortifications to be erected within 5 kilom. of the frontier. Art. 6 . Occupying forces of each party to be withdrawn forthwith from the territory of the other and protection to be afforded to the inhabitants and troops. . . . Art. 7. Each party to restrain his people from hostile action against those of the other and to prevent raiding. Captured property to be restored in accordance with legal investigation after the ratification of the treaty; legal damages to be guaranteed in cases of murder, &amp;c., and hostile acts to be punished upon proof of them. This provision to operate pending a further agreement on the mode of assessing and investigating claims. Art. 8 . Parties not to resort to force for settlement of disputes arising between them under this treaty or otherwise. Failing settlement by friendly negotiations, such disputes shall be referred to arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the annexed agreement, which will be deemed an integral part of the treaty. Art. 9. Each party to prevent action or preparations in his territory directed against the other party and to take action defined in this article against their authors on receipt of a written demand. Note. —The action to be taken is defined under three heads according to whether the persons involved are subjects of the party applied to, of the applicant party or of a third party. The provisions are not unlike those laid down in the corresponding article of the Saudi-Transjordan treaty of July 1933. Art. 10. Fugitives from the jurisdiction of either party not to be admitted by the other. Entrance to be prevented and persons circumventing measures to prevent it to be disarmed, arrested and surrendered; or if they cannot be arrested to be driven back to the country to which they belong. Art. 11. Governors and officials of either party to be prevented from inter fering with the subjects of the other. Measures to be taken to obviate disturbance or misunderstanding as a result of such action. Art. 12. People of areas assigned to each party under this treaty to be the subjects of that party. Neither party to accept as his subjects the subjects of the other party without the latter’s consent. Subjects of either party in the territory of the other to be dealt with in accordance with the local law. Art. 13. Amnesty to be granted by each party to the subjects of the other residing in his territory; to his own subjects who have taken refuge with or joined the other party, both as regards crimes and as regards property taken from the time of their doing so to the time of their return. In case of doubt on the part of either party as to the fulfilment of this clause, he may call upon the other party to convoke a meeting of the representatives who have signed this treaty, failing either of whom he may be replaced by a person having stated qualifications. Their decision to be binding. Note. —The first sentence of this is very loose. The main object of the whole article appears to be to give the maximum of protection to tribesmen and others who have sided with the other party in territory now reverting to one or the other party. Art. 14. Property of persons benefiting by the amnesty to be restored to them on their return to their country or to their heirs. Goods of the subjects of either party not to be sequestrated by the other party. [156 k— 1 ] b 24 Art. 15. Neither party to meddle with or come to any agreement with any third party, whether an individual, a group of persons or a Government in any manner prejudicial to the interests of the other party. Note.— The general sense of the original is fairly clear, but the requires further scrutiny. Art. 16. The parties, who are bound by the ties of Islamic brotherhood and Arab origin, declare that their nations are one nation, that they wish no one evil and that they will endeavour to promote the interests of their nation in tranquillity and seek the good of their countries and their nation, without intending enmity to any nation whatsoever. Note. —See covering despatch. Art. 17. In the event of external aggression against the country of either party, the other shall, (i) Observe complete neutrality secretly and publicly. (ii) Practice all “possible moral and spiritual co-operation.” (iii) Negotiate with the other party with a view to discovering the means of guaranteeing the security of the country of such other party and preventing harm thereto and refraining from any action which might be interpreted as contributing assistance to the external enemy. Note.— See covering despatch. Art. 18. Measures to be taken by each party in the event of rebellion or internal hostilities in the country of the other. Note. —These are stated under four heads covering measures to prevent the abuse of the territory, to refuse asylum to the rebels, to prevent supplies from reaching them, &amp;c. Art. 19. Both parties to collaborate as regards postal and telegraphic com munication, economic matters, &amp;c., and to negotiate a customs agreement. Note. —The article expressly contemplates an agreement between the parties to safeguard their interests either by an unification of customs duties or by special regulations, but each retains freedom of action pending the conclusion of the agreement. Art. 20. Representatives abroad of either party to represent the other party, if the latter so wishes. Representatives of both parties in the same place abroad to collaborate in order to secure unity of policy and promote the interests of both countries which are one nation. Neither party restricted in its freedom of action by this article. Art. 21. Abrogation of treaty of the 15th December, 1931. Art. 22. Ratifications to be exchanged as soon as possible, whereupon the treaty will come into force forthwith, saving the provision in article 1 regarding the termination of the state of war. The treaty shall remain in force for twenty lunar years and may be amended or renewed during the six months preceding its expiry, failing which it shall remain in force for six months from notification of the wish of either party to alter it. Art. 23. Treaty to be called the Treaty of Taif. Drawn up in two copies in the noble Arabic language. Conclusion .—Normal except it mentions Jedda as the place of signature. This is probably a slip of the draughtsman or the printers, as the Saudi Govern ment certainly did not on this occasion apply their general principle that Jedda is the only real suitable place for diplomatic acts. Protocol on Arbitration .—This consists of a preamble and five articles providing for arbitration by a board to consist of an equal number of persons nominated by each side and a president to be chosen by agreement, or failing agreement by ballot between agreed candidates, or failing agreement on a list by further negotiation.Annexed Letters .—There are three pairs of letters recording agreement on the following subjects :— {a) The Saudi stipulation that the treaty shall not come into force pending fulfilment of Ibn Sand's preliminary conditions in regard to the surrender of the Idrisis, the evacuation of the mountain area and the release of the hostages. The treaty is to be kept secret, especially as regards frontiers (see covering despatch). {b) Arrangements in regard to the Idrisis, with special reference to Abdul Wahhab, Sharifs and other supporters of the Idrisis to be received by Ibn Saud and well treated if they elect to follow the Idrisis into his territory, but otherwise to be expelled from the Yemen. (c) Movements of subjects between the territories of the two parties. oINDEXED Fn am further communication on this subject, please quote N *- t 3-U 0 \ \ A'\ and address— no&lt; to any parson bu name, but to— ' “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. r pz. 5057 reignj presents his THE Under-Secretary of State for Fc compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copvjs^o of the under-mentioned paper.

CONFIDENTIAL [E 3761/79/251 No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 7.) (No. 145.) ,, gj r Jedda, May 14, 1934. WITH reference to paragraph 9 of my despatch No . 133 o f the 28th April, I have the honour to enclose herewith one copy of the SaudfGreen Book, v inch was published in its complete form on the 29th April. It runs, as you will see, to over 200 pages of close print, and I cannot hope to forward a translation, enclose a summary of the contents of the book. The plan of the principal chapters is to provide a certain amount of explanation and comment in addition to the numbered documents which form the major portion. Numerous as these documents are they certainly do not contain anything like all the correspondence which has passed since 1927. I will give you one instance which is of present importance. On the 8 th May Fuad first spoke to me of the possibility of peace on the basis of compliance by the Imam with Ibn Sand’s demands as formula.ted at the outset of the present hostilities, subject to certain “guarantees, which seemed to be of a formidable character, as they were to include a rectification of frontiers and an indemnity. I suggested, in a general way, to Fuad Bey that, as the King had persistently repeated his demands in their original form, it might be some what difficult to recede from the position that compliance with them was the only condition of peace. Fuad Bey gently reminded me that a treaty of friend ship had also to be concluded and said that any question of “guarantees ' would fall to be dealt with in this. Then he added that a telegram, not published in the Green Book, had been addressed to the Imam warning him of the risks he might run, if actual hostilities became necessary. 2. The Green Book nevertheless contains texts of great interest. Perhaps the most interesting of all is the text of the first treaty between Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, the exact nature of which has long been a subject of speculation. I enclose a rough translation of this agreement, but as I cannot have it checked at present, I would ask that it should not be used for purposes of publication until a more accurate translation can be made. You will observe that it bears the date the 16th Dhu’l Hijja, 1338 (the 31st August. 1920), whereas it is referred to in the second Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of the 21st October, 1926. as an agreement of the 10th Safar, 1339 (the 24th October, 1920). I have ascertained from Fuad Bey that the date of signature is correctly stated in the Green Book and that the latter date is that of a letter from Ibn Saud approving of it. This gave the agreement final validity, the Idrisi himself having signed the original. 3. The title ‘ ‘ Imam ” has become so closely associated in European language with the Imam Yahya that it may not be out of place to remind you that it is borne equally by Ibn Saud as Imam of the Wahhabis and by the Idrisi as the religious head of his own adherents. It has often, in the past, been applied to them tout court, with results that are nowadays somewhat confusing. 4 . It will be seen from the enclosed translation that the first Saudi-Idrisi Treaty did not in any precise sense establish frontiers. What it did was to take account of the ancestral claims of Ibn Saud, founded on the early expansion of Wahhabi and the more recent expansion of the Idrisi, whose pretensions, if not his actual occupation, extended to areas far greater than his dominion in the Tihama of Asir. The effect of the agreement was to partition the total area which both might claim, but much more with reference to tribes and their ranges than to geographical features. I need not pursue the analysis further at present. I would point out, however, that, unless a treaty in modern form between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya relegates all past arrangements to limbo, the agreement of 1920 may still have importance in connexion with the complicated question of Ibn Sand’s titles. 5 . Next in interest is the account given of the negotiations between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya in 1927-28 and the settlement of the Arwa question in 1931. [131 g 3] b 3 2 r. m9 The story of the two missions which Ibn Saud sent to Sana in 1927 and the Yemeni missions which came to Mecca in 1928 becomes much clearer than it has hitherto been. The telegrams between the Imam and Ibn Saud which produced the latter's award giving Arwa to the Imam are still of interest. The most important points are perhaps the following :— (a) When the first Saudi mission went to Sana they were confronted with a Yemeni claim to the whole of Asir, as having always been Yemeni, despite Idrisi occupation. The Saudi mission counterclaimed the whole country as far as Mokha and Zebid and inland to Bajil, as having been Idrisi, and denied all lemeni claims in Asir. It is not astonishing that no agreement was reached. (b) Chapter III contains proces-verbauoc of meetings held during the visit of the second Saudi mission to Sana. If trustworthy, they bear out the recent Saudi contention that an oral agreement of sorts was reached in the course of two meetings, as stated in Mr. Zada's letter to Mr. Rendel of the 28th July, 1933. It is less important to try to ascertain the effect of that agreement, none of the versions of which quite agree in terms, than to record the fact that it was clearly a status quo arrangement only. The best of several proofs of this is that, when sending his own mission immediately afterwards to Mecca, the Imam wrote a letter to Ibn Saud in which he described his object as being to convince the King of his claim to “ what is in the hands of the Idrisi .... together with all that is counted as of Khaulan-bin-Amr and Hamdan-bin-Zeyd.” This, I think, can be taken as a restatement of his demands of the previous year, though it is difficult to estimate the territorial scope of demands in regard to the interior, defined with reference to the names of tribal ancestors. {c) The Imam’s mission to Mecca accomplished absolutely nothing and though the status quo went on it might well be argued that whatever validity it had was impaired or destroyed by the failure of the negotiations in the course of which it was more or less defined. The Imam does not, however, seem to have taken this line. He bided his time until he advanced to Arwa. (d) The Arwa incident led to a fresh meeting of delegations. As you are aware, they came to a deadlock over territorial questions and the Imam left the matter to the arbitration of Ibn Saud. The King’s telegram of the 22nd Rajab, 1350 (the 3rd December, 1931), giving his award, is precise only in the phrase : “ I say that I abandon Jebel Arwa to your Honour.’’ It is. however, clear from the correspondence that other specific areas had been discussed, including that of the Beni Malik and Jebel Fifa. and the Imam, in his reply of the 27th Rajab, 1350 (the 8 th December, 1931), said that he had instructed his delegates not to pursue the question of that particular area. This goes far to justify Ibn Saud’s resentment at the Imam's recent interference in the area in question, but the correspondence is in other respects ambiguous. The editor of the Green Book seems hardly justified in stating that the Imam’s telegram constitutes a complete recognition of the frontier by the Imam, subject only to a request of consideration of a proposal of his in regard to two named tribes. From a European point of view the upshot of the Arwa dispute can only be regarded as obscure, except as regards Arwa itself and perhaps the Beni Malik-Fifa area. (e) Immediately after the settlement of the Arwa question, the delegates signed a Treaty of Friendship. &amp;c., dated the 15th December, 1931. It was noted at the time that this treaty made no reference to frontiers. It has always been doubtful whether the Imam regarded it as a treaty at all, although the Saudi Government stated later that it had been ratified by an exchange of telegrams. It now appears from the texts of these as published’ in the Green Book that Ibn Saud's telegram expressed a straightforward approval of what his delegates had agreed to, but the Imam's telegram could be read either as an approval or as a postponement pending further discussion. On the face of it, it looks like an approval but he asked the King to send his delegates again to discuss outstanding minor points. 6 . ( hapters \ I to XIII relate to the most recent phase beginning about the end of August 1932, when, after delay due to various causes, including the Ibn Rifada revolt, the King again turned his attention seriously to his relations with the Imam. I have not had the whole of these chapters translated, as you are familiar with the main course of events and the result of all the negotiations including the King's suggestion for a sort of alliance, has been negative so far as any agreements of permanent effect are concerned.3 7. I have not yet had time to study Chapter XIV, which deals with the \am and with Najran. The divergence of views regarding these has been so complete and both parties are, to my mind, on such weak ground that I do not expect the documents to prove of much use either way, but, if I find them to be of sufficient interest, I will submit a further report on them at leisure. 8 . The Imam \ ahya is a master of obscure language. Ibn Saud is more capable of precision, but can be equally obscure on occasion. They both, as you know, overlay most of what they say with blankets of pious verbiage. I trust, therefore, that you will make allowance for the imperfection of this despatch, which I have prepared at a time of great pressure from rough translations of highly peculiar texts. 1 have endeavoured to isolate the points which seem to have most bearing on the present dispute, in case the recent happy turn of events should result in a rational general settlement free from the ambiguities of the past. 9. In this connexion I would revert to my despatch No. 1 of the 2nd January relative to the possibility of a Saudi claim to Hudeyda and connected matters. In that despatch I expressed the view that a study of historical events since 1872 might be a useful contribution to an examination of the claims and counter-claims of the two rulers. I have found that to be really useful such a study should go much further back, and, while I have collected a good deal of material. I have found it quite impossible to complete and collate it. I he most I can hope to do is to pioduce at some future time a paper of some historical interest, even though a settlement between Ibn Saud and the Imam should deprive it of practical utility. ‘ 1 10. In the meanwhile the facts which 1 have collected are of use in shaping my own views. If I were revising my despatch No. 1 of 2nd January, I should amend it in various particulars. I should not, however, alter my view that Ibn Saud has a good case for claiming both ports of Asir; that he would have a very poor case for claiming as against the Imam, on historical or legal ^rounds the littoral beyond a point somewhere not far south of the Wadi Tashar; and that neither he nor the Imam has any strong claim to Najran. as against the local tnbes. As regards Hudeyda, I find myself supported by no less an authority than Ibn Saud himself, who, in the conversation reported in Sir G Clavton’s desnatch of the 16th July, 1928, to the Colonial Office, said: “ That he would leave the Imam in possession of Hudeyda, to which he recognised the Imam’s clear right.” . sending copies of this despatch and the English enclosures to His Majesty s Ambassador at Rome and the Chief Commissioner at Aden.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Treaty between His Majesty the King and the Idrisi, signed August 31, 1920. (Translation.) IN the name of God the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Prayers and peace may be upon the Prophet of God. * May it be known to him who sees and reads this that when the Imam Abdul Aziz-biii-Abdurrahman-al-Feysal, may God protect him, ordered us to go to the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-bin-Idris to conclude an agreement of particular Islamic brotherhood and to bring about union in the religion of God and His Prophet, and to invite people to collaborate in good deeds and piousness, to cause good manners to be carried out and evils prohibited, to strive in the Course of the Cause of God and to endeavour to unite the hands against the enemies of the religion. When we approached the above-mentioned Imam he was glad and pleased to hear it. He liked it and he was keen about collaboration in working for the welfare. It was, therefore, decided by us and him to have an agreement of brotherhood concluded between the two above-mentioned Imams on the above- mentioned lines. Whereas there were in the kingdom (? territory) of the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali tribes and cities in Yemen of those which were in the past belonging to A1 Baud, the Imam Abdul Aziz has left them for him because of his desire for the welfare and collaboration in the same and his good behaviour. It is, therefore, necessary, to specify the tribes and to distinguish them in order that each one of them may undertake the duties commanded by God in respect of the subjects under him. So the tribes of all Yam, Wadaa and those which belong to them of Beni Jamaa, Sahar, Sharif, Qahtan, Rufeyda and Ubeyda, including Beni Bishr, Beni Talq, Shahran, Beni Shehr, Ghamid, Asir Ghamid, and all “ Qadha ” (province) of Mahayel, including Beni Thua, people of Bareq and Tarqash, people of Ar Rish, and others who belong to them, and all the tribes of Hali mentioned are all under the Imam Abdul Aziz. Those belonging to the Imam Muhammad- bin-Ali-al-Idrisi are Tihama, except what is mentioned above, and other belongings in his possession. Rijal-al-Ma of Asir is his own property. Neither party should interfere in affairs of the subjects of the other party. The tribes of the Surat, Tihama, Yam and others mentioned above as belonging to Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman cover the villages and the Bedouins in mountains and plain lands. They have to advise and collaborate with each other, and to exert their endeavours in performing their duties commanded by God as to what is necessary for the religion of Islam and in respect of their subjects. This has been issued, written and declared by us, the representatives of the Imam, as we aref WUS 5 acting on his behalf, and by the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-bin-Idris, in his presence and under his signature. This agreement and covenant has been given by us and him. He who goes back on his word will be violating his own promise. May God grant us success. Prayers and peace of God may be upon Muhammad, his relatives and friends. 16th Dhul Hijja, 1338 (31st August, 1920). (Seal.) MUHAMMAD-BIN-ALI-BIN-IDRIS.

On 20th June the following facts were brought to my notice by Mr. Saleh Jaffer, the British Political Clerk:. 1. The Aden jrirm of Messrs. Besse (Agents for ,, SHBLIi n Co. Ltd.) and the Greek Firm of 1IVERAT0S (Agents for SACOMY VACUUM CORPORATION) had imported stocks of kerosene oil shortly before the evacuation of Hodeida by the Yemeni authorities. In accordance with the usual practice, the oil was stored in the special Government warehouse outside the town. 2. The duty payable under the Imam T s rule was at the rate of 870 . Both Firms had been in the habit of setting off the duty against debts owing to them by the Yemeni Government for the supply of any petroleum products. This system was well recognised, and arrangements were made to follow it in this instance, the amounts of duty being approximately £120 and £85, though time had not allowed the usual clearing receipts to be obtained from the Customs authorities. In the case of Messrs. Besse, the Government debt at the time was slightly less than the duty payable. 3. The Italian Firm 'S.A.N.E.* are also importers of these goods, and had received a large consignment of Russian products at about the same time, on which the duty amounted to about £ 110(1 Their case differed, however, in that the Yemeni Government were not in their debt. 4. Shortly after the Sa'udi occupation claims were lodged against the three firms for the payment of the full duty. Messrs. Besse and Messrs. Liveratos explained the situation at length to the Sa f udi Customs authorities, the Minister of Finance (Abdullah Suleiman ) and the Amir, Prince Faisal, but obtained no satisfaction. The Italian Firm made similar representations. 5. On 20th June the three Firms received information from the Customs officials that if payment in cash was not made, kerosene to the value of the duty would be seized on the following day. Messrs. Besse and the Director of Customs is shown in Appendix 1. 6 . In my opinion the Sa’udi Government had no just claim on duties incurred before their occupation, and it appeared that the collecting of such duties amounted to the levying 0 f an Indemnity on the Yemeni authorities. which could only be solved by diplomatic negotiations, and as Messrs. Besse had not approached me, I considered that no action on my part was necessary for the time being. I took the preoaution of notifying the Italian 3.N.O. 0 f the position (of which he appeared to be unaware), and in view of the suspected desire of the Italians to land an armed force if any pretext could be found, I emphasised to him that there could be no possible question of resisting by force the commandeering of the percentage of stocks claimed. 7. On 21st June Messrs. Besse addressed a letter to Mr. Saleh Jaffer setting forth the situation, stating that they had already offered to pay the difference between duty and the A translation of the preceding correspondence between It seemed, however, that the matter involved questions debt owing to them, and requesting him to Government. approach the Sa'udi Mr. S^LEH •...2 - Mr. Saleh Jaffer forwarded the letter with a covering note to the Amir, requesting him to investigate the matter in order that justice might be done. 8 . During the afternoon of the 21st the representatives of Messrs. Besse and Messrs. Liveratos were in touch with He jib Salha ififfendi, secretary to the Minister of finance, and in conversation with him they offered to pay the full duty demanded, provided that he would guarantee that in the event of the Italian Firm failing to comply, the money would be refunded. Kejib appeared Impressed by the proposal, and in company with Saleh Jaffer (in a purely private oapaeity as witness) they all proceeded to call upon the Minister of Finance. This official, however, took a different view, and in a stormy interview he insisted that if payment was not fo rthcoming, he would immediately seize the value of the duty, in kind. 9. Later in the evening the three Firms received a further communication from the Director of Oustoms, stating that if payment was not previously made, he would force the looks of the stores at 0900 on the following morning, and would remove the required percentages from their stocks. 10. Shortly before 0900 on the 22nd the three representatives attended at the house of the Director of Oustoms. Both Messrs. Basse and Messrs. Idveratos agreed to pay immediately if their Italian colleague would do likewise, this attitude being in accordance with instructions received from tdieir Principals. The Italian, however, was unable to accept the responsibility for such a decision, and asked for one hour’s grace to enable him to consult his Government’s commercial agent, Sign. Jemlceli. The Customs officials were not prepared to grant this request, and on his departure instructions were given to force the padlocks on the stores and to oommence the removal of the requisite quantities of kerosene. 11. Although I neither consider it ay duty to interfere in a purely commercial dispute, nor had I, even now, been a Pproached by Messrs. Besse, I was of the opinion that an incident such as this could not be allowed to pass without official comment, while I also realised that the Italian reactions might be suoh as to provoke a situation out of all proportion to the true gravity of the case. I therefore proceeded at once to discuss the matter with the Italian S.N.O., who decided to land immediately in order to ascertain the latest developments, it being understood that he should take no action until I arrived later with the French Commanding Officer. It was clear that he took a serious view of the forcing of the looks, and considered that it amounted to a violent and unjustified assault on the property of an Italian subject. 12. I then called on my French colleague, both in his capacity of Commanding Officer of one of the Guardships, and also M as the representative of the Power which here assumes respon sibility for the welfare of Greek subjects, and at 1400 I landed with him. 13. IXiring the forenoon the Ba’udis had completed the removal of the goods demanded from Besse’s store (400 oases) and from that of Liveratos (250 oases), and had also commenced operations on the Italian store, whence 5000 oases were required. Work had, however, stopped before this quota had been reached. I learned later that this pause was due to the representations of the Italian Agent to the Minister of Finance, as a result of which a delay of 24 hours had been granted.- 3 - iH 14* On arriral ashore we interviewed Messrs* Besse and Liveratos* Neither appeared unduly perturbed by the turn of events, and both stated their willingness to pay in full if all three Firms were treated equally, without, however, admitting the justice of the Sa v udi claims against them* After discussion, and with the concurrence of my French colleague I decided to seek an interview with the Amir, and together we formulated the statement which it was proposed to present to him* 15* Meanwhile enquiries had failed to locate the Italian S*N*0., but it eventually transpired that he was at that moment interviewing the Minister of Finance* On his departure thence I was able to cheek him for a moment on his hurried way to the Amir (with whom he had already arranged a reception), and to explain to him the action which I intended to take. It was clear that he was still much agitated, giving indications that it was then his intention to demand the replacement of the Italian stocks pending a final decision from his Government. It seemed, however, that he was to some extent mollified by my view that it was most undesirable to do anything which might embarrass future diplomatic action, or which mi^t give rise to an incident at a time when the Sa v udl withdrawal had become so imminent, and before his exit he conveyed the impression that he would follow the same course of action as I and the French Commanding Officer had decided upon* 16* At 1715 Lieutenant-Commander de Badens and I were received by the Amir Faisal, Speaking on behalf of our mutual interests I Informed him as follows:- I was aware of the dispute which had been in progress for some weeks between the Sa'udi authorities and the three Firms engaged in the importation of petroleum products. The matter being essentially a commercial and legal argument, I did not desire to express an opinion as to the rights or wrongs of the case, neither was it my duty to do sc* I had, however, learned with regret that earlier in the day the Sa^dl Government had considered it necessary to foree open the stores and remove quantities of kerosene which represented the value of the duty claimed* The objeot of my visit, therefore, was to inform him that in view of this climax I now considered it necessary to report the whole matter to my superiors in order that they might take any diplomatic action which they deemed desirable, 17. The Amir replied that the three Firms had been given ample warning of the consequences wh&lt;eh would follow their continued refusal to pay, and that they had thus brought the denouement upon themselves. In further conversation, which throughout was conducted in a most friendly spirit, the Amir stated that as a result of his interview with the Italian S*N*0* (which, he indicated, had been by no means a cordial one) he had agreed to grant a further extension until noon on Sunday 24th, having been assured that by then a satisfactory reply would have been received from the Italian Government* He added that the extension would, of course, apply also to the other two Firms engaged in the discussion* I thanked him for this notification, and stated my belief that Messrs. Besse and Liveratos were prepared to pay on an .....an equal footing with the Italian Jftrm, while adhering to their re serration s as to the legality of the demand* We then too* our leave and returned to our ships* 18* At 2230 Commander Azzi rlsited me and informed me as to the results of his interview with the Amir* He stated that his assurances of payment were based on the fact that his Government had already enquired from 'S.A.J^.B. ,, as to whether payment in cash or in fcind would be preferable* He added that he had informed the Amir that if payment was not made within the time specified he would, on his own responsibility raise no objection to the seizure of goods* 19* On the following morning (23rd) I learned that all the stoolcs had been returned to this respective stores, but I have not yet been able to determine whether this was due to a direct request from Commander Azzi or whether it*was an act of courtesy on the part of the Sa'udi authorities* 20* On the morning of the 24th Messrs* Besse and Messrs* hiveratos, accompanied by Mr* Saleh Jaffer ms a witness, proceeded to the Customs House and there made payment in oash to the full amount demanded* In doing so both representatives made a foznal state* mert to the effect that their compliance was in no way to be interpreted as a recognition of the justice of the Sa’udi claims* 21. At 1130 (24th) Commander Azzi called on me and stated that he had just received the anxiously-awaited instructions from the Italian Government, to the effect that 'S.A.I.S*' should ma£e full payment in cash* He then proceeded at high speed to the shore, and there communicated the decision to the Minister of iflnance. i’his official took up an unhelpful attitude, and indicated that he would be obliged to act in aooordanoe with the orders already received unless they were countermanded by the Amir himself* After some delay, an audience was therefore arranged with Prince ffeisal, at which the dispute was finally settled to the satis faction of both parties* Payment was accordingly made of approximately 50$ of the total sum, the balance being promised as soon as the necessary bullion could be collected* 22 * I consider that so far as the local situation is conoerned, the matter may now be regarded as olosed, and have informed Messrs* Besse and Messrs* Liveratos that I assume that if it is desired to pursue the question further, representations will be forwarded by their Principals. 23. Mr* Saleh Jaffer has kept Seyyld Abdullah al W&amp;zlr fully Informed of the course of events, and has emphasised to him that if the normal procedure (see paragraph 2 ) had been carried out more expeditiously by the Yemeni Government, the situation as regards the British and the Green Firms would not have arisen* 24, It will be appreciated that, althougtyfche actions of the British and Greek Firms have not been beyond critloism, the attitude of the Italians has been the main source of friction. This is attributed to the fact that 'S.A.H*®*' appears to be largely a Government trading concern, the conduct of which is at ' 1 times directed by Government officials towards political ends. It may be mentioned in this connection that the Sa’udi authorities have never yet acceded to the original request of the Italians to accord any recognition of official status to SignHi—Sign. Jemiceli, whose presence in hodeida has been tolerated only in the capacity of a private individual. Under these circumstances the difficulty - if not the impossibility of effective co-operation with the Italian naval authorities is a foregone conclusion.

The treaty signed at Taif has now been approved by the Imam, who signed the Instrument of Ratification at Sana’a on the 13th June. Ratifications were exchanged at Hodeida on the 22nd June (P. Z.4249/34). The text of the treaty was published simultaneously on the 23rd June at Mecca, Sana’a, Cairo and Damascus. Prom the summary given in the extract from the H Times” of 25th June below, it will be seen that the treaty is to be valid for 20 years and that, as regards territorial matters, Nejran and Yam are acknov;!edged as being in Saudi Arabia while Hodeida and the Tihama of Yemen 2730 1000 4.34 are/are to revert to the Zeidi King, apparently with slight frontier rectifications to the advantage of lim Saud.

Saudi withdrawal and the Yemeni re-occupation is proceeding and the transfer of Hodeida itself is expected about the end ot this month (P.Z* 4239/34). It seems that the Saudis have agreed to evacuate the Tihama because they did not feel strong enough to hold it, but partly perhaps because of the fear of Italian intervention. The report of H.M.S. 'Penzance” dated 28th May at P.Z. 4196/34 indicates that the Saudi forces were not very well under control and that their position in Hodeida was threatened by Yemeni concentrations on their flanks. In view of the danger of further disorders during the retransfer of Hodeida to the Yemenis, H.M.*s ships 'Hastings” and Penzance” have been retained for the present at Hodeida and Kamaran.

Sir, 2Sn.d.t Juae^. 1934 . 4196 i i 1954 J I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary ’of State for India in Council copy of a report of proceedings of H*M.S*PEMZANCE covering the period 25th to 28th May. 1934, and dealing with events at Hodeidah. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l. EDCOPY secKsy . r H.M. S«PSi&lt;iZANC£ at 110DKXDA- 88th May, 1934. Ai' nop IDA &gt; MiQfj 19g4 &gt; pf , 1.- H.M. a.PSHZANOB had arrived at JCAMAKAK on 18th May from Aden, Joining there Senior Offloer, ed Sea Sloops* Before sailing for ADM in 1 M. AhlftiTTMii Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops had proposed in his submission timed 1109/20 that B#M* S*FBKMAMOX should pay a visit to HODEIDA of a few hours duration on 23rd May, while he himself should call there on the 28th, on his return passage to KAMA&amp;AK* 2*- On 22nd May the French despatch vessel *¥CBB8* (Capita di Corvette k.di BADSM8) arrived at KA&amp;ARAK for water, and I enquired from him his views as to the situation prevailing at HODEIDA on his departure thence on the previous day. His information appeared to me to be less reassuring than had Been the case when X,1U8*Mt&amp;2&gt;&amp;XSS had departed on 19th, an j I therefore proceeded in the afternoon of 22nd to the entrance to KAMARAH passage, with the object of reaching HODEIDA at an earlier hour on the following morning* 3*- At 2247/22 I received Admiralty message timed 1749/82 in which the proposed visit to HGD2IDA was cancelled* In view of the fact that no telegraphic communications exist between HQDSIDA and the outside world, it appeared that Their Lordships were unlikely to he aware of any local develop* meats since, at the latest, the early hours of the 19th* Taking ' into account the news received from the Oomm. ndin^ Officer, 'YRREB*, I therefore formed the opinion that, unless there were special diplomatic objections, it was very desirable the visit should be made, in order that the situation might be gauged at first hand* I therefore submitted my views in my cypher message timed 2317/22. 4*- At 2040 on the following day ivdmiralty message timed 1653/23 was received, requesting further details of the in formation received from this was transmitted in ny 2144/23, as a result of which Admiralty message timed 1869/24 was received at 2569/24, directing that PEH2ANCS should proceed to HODEIDA and report on the situation* In compliance with these instructions I sailed at 0646 on the following morning at 12 knots, anchoring in HODEIDA Roads at 0945. i Q CD CV smut!- 6.- Mr.SALEH JAFF .ix, the British Political Clerk, at, once came onboard. His information, which had also formed the basis of that given to me by Commanding Officer, 'YFREB*, was to the following effect - (a) The situation in the town had remained quiet since the SAUDI occupation. (b) The SAUDI garrison had been much reduced by the despatch of detachments towards the increasing YEMENI concentrations in the mountains to the east and north east, as far as the HAJU* country {.under the command of Seyyid ALI SAYENI, the ex-Amil of HARAD) and in the district centring on &amp;ABID to the Mouthward. (o) During their advance to HODKIDA, a certain amount of looting had taken place, while since the occupation other instances had occurred in the surrounding country. SAUDI... ttto •i-ffc I.SAUDI camel patrols had also levied toll on the email traffic which flowed to and from HOD KID A consisting chiefly of marketing activities by peasants* (d) A few cases of rape by SAUDIS had been committed in the neiifrbourhoody with the result that the tribes concerned# who in the first instance offered willing submission to the WAHABI authorities# are reported now to have renewed their allegiance to the IMAK* Attempts at outrage have also been made in the town* (e) The SAUDI forces# although issued with rations# ha* received no pay. This# combined with the absence of loot on the scale which they had by custom expected# was the direct cause of the misbehaviours referred to in (c). further# SAUDI troops were selling ammunition by auction in the basaars# while rations and articles of clothing were also being disposed of in the same way* 6* Two main conclusions were to be drawn from the foregoing - (a) The discipline of the SAUDI forces was not so firm as the assurances of their leaders would indicate* In tnis connection it should be borne in mind that the term SAUDI 'troops* does not in any way imply a disciplined body of men# in any regular formation# under any clear organisation of Officers and Non-comiuiesioned Officers# or equipped in any recognisable uniform. It inaioatet # rather# a body of armed tribesmen# led by their own village or tribal leaders# and with some previous experience of Arab warfare# clothed in their national dress and alihe only in their equip ment of a rifle and one or more bandoliers of ammunition* (b) Should war recommence# the SAUDI position in HODEIDA is seriously jeopardised by threats to the lines of communication. In an attempt to meet this threat the available forces have already been much dissipated. 7. These facts are sufficiently evident to arouse in the town a general feeling ox* anxiety for the future* It is clear that the SAUDI occupation will not continue indefinitely, but will be terminated either by an enforced retirement if hostilities are renewed (unless# of course# large reinforcemmsts are received) or by a deliberate evacuation in conformity with I BN SAUD’S announced undertakings if a satisfactory Peace is achieved* Whichever may be the cause of the final departure of the SAUDIS# a period will elapse before YEMENI control can be re-established# and during this interval it is felt that the town# thrown again on its own resources# will be exposed to the same dangers as existed on 29th April* 8* The ^ritish-Indian population viewed with anxiety the departure of H*M.i&gt;.Si I3S on 19th May# and welcomed the return of H*M.3.PENZANCE# The townsfolk were also reassured by the reappearance of the British flag# feeling as they did that British intexests had been delegated to the protection of the Italians# whose motives are always regarded with suspicion* 9...In the afternoon X was received by the Aalr x aX&amp;AL in the presence of KSJKB SA1 -HA iffeudi# a very well educated Syrian, epeakii% excellent linglieh and French, who la aerving aa Secretary to the Inis ter of r inanee, tBDUJUUA ioi un+di* I explained to the A»ir that the return of i mZAKGE was due to the fact thet, in the ehaenoe of telegraphic aonBunicaticne stem hODr.IDAp Hie M&amp;jesty v 8 Oovernaent had received no reporta of the situation since the departure of W*k*8* SHfSRPRXSE* and desired to aatlafy thenaelvea thet the livea and property of iritish aub^eota were still aecurt* X dec notifies ills koyal Hi^mess, confidentially, that X had been informed that negotiations were in progrtse at PAM1&amp; and i.OMJi to arrange a simultaneous withdraw! of all naval forces and that for this reason X was unable to state the duration of ay visit* The Amir informed ms that the town remained quiet and that there was no cause for alarm. He welcomed the return of a British warship and expressed the hope that so long as foreign men-of-war remained, a British ship would remain also* ID* On the conclusion of my audience I received a deputation of the Britlsh~Xndi&amp;n community, who expressed their anxieties as to the future* X reassured them that His Majesty's Government was following the situation with close attention, of which the return of K M B tMIlWl was tangible evidence, and that they could rely on all necessary steps being taken to ensure their security* 11* During the evening 1 learned that a small telephone system between the town 'post office**, the newly erected SAUDI portable W/T Station (in the Palace) and other SAUDI administrative centres had been Installed* m ex-TEMSKI ¥/f operator had obtained a post on the hxchange and had received a telephone report from the w/T Station that a message had been transmitted to the IMAM at SAH'a from Hie Majesty IBM BAUD* fhtg&amp;esaage was to the effect that as the IMAM had agreed to the SAUDI demands, includi^tg the payment of a war indemnity, IBM BAUD was willing to svacuate the oocupie^terrltory within IS days, i*e* before 6th June. 12* Rumour states that the IM M was highly displeased with the Governor of HODSIDA (SAIF Ah ISLAM ABDULLAH) for his pre mature evacuation of the town, and had refused to receive him on hia arrival at 3AH f A* SAlf AL I SLA?

These movements were specified as occurring in the districts of JEBSL EAX^ AH and J2iBKL BUKA (i.e. on the southern flank of the WADI ' IHAM - the road to SAN'A)» and in the neighbourhood of JEBSL lilLHAM and MAHAKHA. At the same time it was rumoured that the IMaM had instructed his oomDianders on this front to announce a free pardon to the lowland tribes which hed welcomed the SAUDI advance. 17. Through the telegraph clerk referred to in paragraph 11# I learned that the IMAM had informed IBNSA.UD that he was unable to arrest ABDUL WAHHAB AL IDiUSI# whose suri ender formed one of the King's demands. 18# SAUDI ammunition is freely sold in the basaar# -aid petrol# presumably from the SAUDI motor transport# is also offered. On being questioned as to his right to some live stock that he was auctioning# a SAUDI Warrior replied that it was fcod's gift*; tliis appears to indicate that even in Arabia, God helps those who help themselves. 19. In the afternoon the Ghip's Football team played a match against the town team# in which X had previously obtained the willing concurrence of the Amir. SO. The Anniversary of the birthday of Her Majesty The i ueen was observed by dressing ship# in which the Italian and I ranch men-of-war courteously conformed. At the express wish of the Amir the customary salutes were not fired. 21. In the evening a present of 10 sheep# fruit and vegetables was received from the Amir. In return I authorised the presentation of certain tinned goods from the ship's eteres# and expressed my gratitude verbally on meeting His hoyal highness on the following day. gTTE J4M • gft. In compliance with the instructions contained in Admiralty message 1*16/26 I sought a special audience with the Amir.

My points for discussion and Prince Faisal’s replies have been reported in my messages timed llb9/k;7 end 1818/27.

A 191 Sir, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council a cop;/ of a report by the Commanding Officer, H*M.S. ENTERPRISE, of events in connection with the occupation of Hodeidah by Saudi Forces covering the period 6th to 19th May 1934. 2. Similar letters have been sent to the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, War Office and Air Ministry. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office, C/TS—- OAH/ S. W. 1. No. 26 rf?f SECRETARY :J C'ET DEPT 28 JUN. 1934 ■X'.j ^ i !t*LKEIOBT of XTlirS IK CCHKBCSICB HU '1H &gt; OCOOIaTIC® OF HODEIIU BY &amp; JJDI i-OHCSS. May 6th. At 0620 H.M.3. I^NTKRPRISE aecured in Aden Harbour, and took in water, petrol, paraffin, provisions and 921 tone of oil fuel. to gain information in accordance with the inetructione contained in Admiralty Message 1246 of 6th May 1934. At the meeting the Officer Commanding, R.A.P., Group Captain C.F.A. Portal D.S.O. ,M.C., and the Chief of Police, Haslim were also present. 3. During the course of the interview the Resident gave me the policy of H.M.Government and said that he had also informed merchants at Aden having interests up the coast of this policy. 4. As regards the present situation, the Resident said that, as far as he could ascertain, progress by the Saudis was entirely confined to the sea coast provinces, fhe high ground round S&amp;da and Sana was copied by the Zeidis who were the Imam’s own eople and loyal to him. The coast peoples were really subject tribes of the Zeidis and therefore had no particular love for them hence the Saudi successes on the coast. Since he had failed to make much impression on the high ground Ibn Saud was obviously goijjg slow in his advance south for fear of flank attack, and to secure his communicati ons. The Resident had not thought that the Yemeni would give up Hodieda so easily, but the action of the Governor in leaving had made the garrison lose Saudis had come so far south, but he was sure that Ibn Saud would not have done so had he not been pretty eertain of himself. However there was the possibility of counter attack by the Yemeni from the Manakha direction and in the remote chance of this being successful and the Yemeni gaining the upper hand, there would again be danger to British lives and pro^eriy in Hodeida. 5. The Resident feared no invasion of Aden Territory by Yemeni, but there was a possibility that if Saudi troops got as far south as Mocha, Perim might be ovei*whelmed with refugees. Perim had 30 police but no pilgrim quarters like Kamaran. The Perim Administrator had been instructed to act as best he could. 6. As far as the Resident knew, at Kamaran there were 600 refugees and 200 of the Yemeni forces who had been interned, of these 6 were officers. The Resident was anxious that the internees at Kamaran and the 40 armed police, now in H.M.S. PKKZAHCM, should be sent to Aden in the first ship proceeding to Aden on her normal trip. The Resident requested At 0916 I landed for an interview with the Resident confidence. The Governor in this case had been one of the ar\Y\a A woo vr o Tmorn Vio a y*o 1 trrkiini-r a r\ #me to help arrange matters as regards return of police and internees to Aden on my arrival at Hodeida. In the event of British subjects having to be evacuated from Hodeida, the Resident affirmed that they should be brought to Aden, At 1146 H«M#3•ENTERPRISE left Aden and proceeded at 24 knots. I informed H.M.S. PEN3ANCF. of my intended time of arrival at Hodeida. At 1810 I received PENZANCE’s 1244/6 (cypher) and on the information contained therein decided to remain in the offing off Hodeida during the night, pending Admiralty instructions. I informed H.M.S. PENZANCK of my decision. J • At 0846 I received Admiralty message timed 0166/7 (cypher) ordering me not to enter Hodeida anchorage. I therefore decided to proceed to Kamaran to discover the situation there and to acquaint the Administrator with the wishes of the Resident, Aden. At 0860 I received message 0628z/6 from Commander-in- transferring H.M.S. ElfrKRPRISE to commander—in—Chiei, Mediterranean f B command. At 1006 I informed the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops in HASTINGS of my expected time of arrival at Kamaran and directed him to rendezvous with me there. 8. At 1130 H.M.S. NTKRPPIS anchored in KAMARAN Harbour and the Administrator, Captain Wickham, cam e on board. He reported that there were aporoxijaately 200 internees and 2.000 refugees on Kamaran. He had not wished to take any, but they refused to return in the dhows they came in and had they stayed n the dhows they would have died of thirst. Out of humanity he was compelled to take them ashore. The 200 internees had given no trouble and required only one man to guard them - they were terrified of returning to the mainland. 9. The refugees were leaving at the rate of 300 a day (starting about 6th May)t now that things on the mainland had quietened down they were anxious to get back. 10. The s.s. *E1 Amin 1 * arrived at 1226, which rovided an excellent opportunity fbr transferring internees fom Kamaran to Aden, particularly as the ship was calling at Hodeida .here she could pick up the 40 armed olice from H.M.S. P73rZAHCT;. This was done and the Resident at Aden informed accordingly. 11. At 2141 I received Admiralty message timed 1602/7 (cypher) ordering me to relieve H.M.S. PSarZANCB u.m. on dth May, and I informed the Commanding Officer. H.M.8. PENZANCE and the Resident, Aden to this effect- (ENTERPRISE’S 0065/8 and 0102/8). 12. On receiving the signal from Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, informing me that he uas unable to arrive at Kamaran at the time he had indicated in a previous signal owing to mist, I arranged to rendezvous with him near Kamaran Island so as not to delay my arrival at Hodeida. At . • • . •At 1030 H.M.3. ENTERPRISE sailed from Kama ran and effected the rendezvous with HASTINGS at 1110. Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops coming on board immediately. At 1200 both ships proceeded, H.M.S.ENTERPRISE tO Hodeida, H.M.3. HASTINGS to Kaaaran. At 1420 H.M.3. ENTERPRISE arrived at Hodeida, anc ioring 3 miles off shore, and the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. PENZANCE came on board at 1430 to explain the situation. (See H.M.S. PENZANCE* e report No.O/65 of Nth May) (Accompanying tracing shows the position of ships in harbour). 13. Guard At 1600 I received the Italian Officer of the He conveyed to me the compliments of Capitano di Guard, He conveyed to me the compliments of Capitano di Vascello Mario Bonetti of the Survey Vessel *MAgNAGHI* and informed me that he had transferred to the 'AZIO* and was acting as Italian S.N.O. 14. At 1630 I left H.M.S. ENTERPRISE in company with the Commanding Officer H.M.S. PENZANCE and Commander C.H.L. Woodhouse of H.M.S. ENTERPRISE landing at 1600. I was received by the Amir Peisal in command of the Saudi occupation of Hodeida. He received me with many cordial expressions of friendship for Great Britain and thanks for the steadying influence thich the presence ct H.M.S. PENZANCE had on the community. He gave the most emphatic assurance of his ability to protect the lives and property of British subjects so long as he was in occupation. He assured me that all was quiet and peaceful in the town and this was evidenced by my own personal observation and supported by the knowledge of affairs of the British Agent. I informed the Amir that I was entirely satisfied with his assurance and guarantee of protection, and as evidence of this further informed him that the signal party from H.M.S. PENZANCE had already returned to their ship and that no party would be landed from H.M.S. ENTERPRISE. I also informed him that H.M.S. PE JZANCE would sail at 1830 that evening. The Amir expressed annoyance at the presence in the town of 36 men from the Italian ship; he stated that their presence was having a disturbing effect on the community and that he would be glad if I could persuade the Italian S.N.O. to withdraw them . I assured him that the British Government in their strict maintenance of neutrality was using its best endeavours to persuade the Italian Government to withdraw their landing party as H.M.S. PENZANCE had db ne. Before concluding the interview I invited the Amir to visit H.M.S. ENTERPRISE, but with expressions of regret he had to decline owing to pressure of work at the present time. 16. I then called on the Italian S.N.O. who had transferred to the sloop 'AZIO* while his own ship the 'AMMIRAGLIO MAGNAGHI' sailed for the coast of Eritrea to pick upnhis surveying parties which had been left there. I called on the Italian S.N.O. first, as it was important that I should see him at once, and, H.M.S.ENTERPRISE being 2 miles further out, much time would be saved, particularly as the weather was uncomfortable for boat work. I 7 * I informed the Italian S.N.O. of my visit to the Amir Peisal and that, having received f om him the most emphatic assurance of there being no danger whatever to our respectivereapectiY© nationals, I ?as entirely satisfied and had withdrawn the small British landing party; furthermore they would not be relieved. I invited him to co-operate with me and withdraw hie party, but, although he assured me of his earnest personal wish to comply, he was unable to do so without Instructions from his Government, which he was expecting at any moment. I.then asked him to consider reducing the number of men (35) by half, and this I understood him to say he would consider. 18, There is no doubt that the presence of Italian ships and still more their landing party is very nmun resented in Hodeida, and is acting as a strong preventative against the coaimunity resuming normal and peaceful conditions under the Saudi occupation. The Amir would heartily welcome the departure of the Italian ships and the British also, at the moment, but only as an inducement to the Italians to go. 19. , The British agent, Saxeh Jaffer. and Mr. Day, a young Englishman, representative or Gellatly Hankey, were both strong in praise of the beneficial effect or the presence of li.M.S. PEHZA.NCE during the transition period between the evacuation of the town by the Yemeni and its occupation by the Saudi forces. SO. At 1820 the Italian ’’MAGNAGHI” sailed. At 1835 H.M.S. PENZAHCE sailed. 9thj&amp;X&gt; | 21. During the night 8th to 9th a message in unknown ssaithed to Jeddah, r&lt;j) eated to Admiralty, with information that he had transmitted a message from Amir Peisal to Ibn Baud, and on the assumption that this might be the reply I decided to deliver it. But when further Saudi messages were received for transmission, I considered that such action constituted a breach of neutrality. I therefore communicated with the British Minister at,Jeddah on this subject in ay 0309/9 and further in ay lo4o/9, meanwhile declining to transmit or deliver these messages. At 1916 I received the Minister’s reply which requested me on his responsibility to pass these messages without d elay. 22. At 1030 the British Agent came on board to report the situation. He said that the town was quiet but that no further Saudi toops had entered during the night or morning and that the present Saudi strength in the town was about 400 men. 10,000 Saudi troops were re^ported to be at Zohra but this number was probably greatly exaggerated; the journey from 2ohra to Hodelda took about 2 to 3 days. Yesterday 8th May a Saudi post of from 10 to 16 men had been established Ad 3ait-al-Fakih; there was also a like number at Taif, and the Saudi Commander hoped to send a similar number to Bajil on the 10th. 23. The Agent had received from three sources the news that the Imam was still alive. He had heard that Sada had not yet fallen, but he inferred that it was s r rounded by the Saudi. The largest c ncentration of Y meni in the neighbourhood of Hodeida was at Zabid but their intentions were unknown. Three days ago it was reported that there were about 400 Yemeni ax; Bura (not shown on Map 1 C) in the Raimap district, due East of Bait al Fakih, and another 400 at Hujaile, further north.24. This B8W8 came as a ^eat suxviise^tc^me^after emphatic aasurances given ^ bl8 ability to regarding the strength t * ' , ,,tement that several maintain it. to-day, when in fact thousands of hie troops we ^ e , t ‘ a t0 the British Agent none had arl '^ ®\^h’ bo 1 fexv troops in Hodeida the position that in my opinion with to lew w v r bad led was not so secure er so J that there were also to believe.

Another rumour which he had ^^“^tfrink that it w^entirely contrary to the policy of h.M.Oovernment, to e • e •to act thus* and its origin certainly did not cone from me* I then took the opportunity of explaining to him the policy of Government which was one of strict neutrality and that on no account would men he landed except in case of absolute necessity and then only in order to evacuate British subjects. He seemed pleased to hear this and agreed that Italy too had no wish to take part in hostilities. BO* He then informed me of the prospective movements of the local Italian Naval units* which were as followsJ- (a) He was transferring a few troops (number mot stated) from the 'CAGLIARI* to the 'AZIO* to remain there in case of trouble ajising in the town* after which 'CAGLIARIf would sail* (b) The 'MAGNAGHI' was returning to fiodeida to embark Captain Bonetti and the ship would then leave and continue her surveying work* Thereafter Commander kzzi, of the 'AZIO 1 * would be the Italian S.N.O* (c) A destroyer (name not 8tated)was on her way down from Sues to fuel at Masaua and would then proceed to Kodeida to tfoin the 'AZIO'. 31* In the forenoon I sent an Officer ashore with instructions to oboain from the British Agent the latest intelligence regarding the situation ashore* and to make clear to the Adviser to the Amir* my inability to send further Saudi messages* and also to inform him of the intended withdrawd of the Italian lending party. Regarding the Saudi messages the words used to the Adviser were*- 'I had now received orders from my Government that X was not to transmit messages between Saudi sources* *4 nee in their opinion such action was contrary to the British policy of strict neutrality and impartiality. I much regretted therefore that I could accept no further messages* but I was sure that the Amir would understand that my Government’s policy was in the best interests of not only international relations but also of the Saudi Government themselves. w The Adviser appeared well satisfied with this decision and explanation. He ftave the information that 1*000 troops from Zohra had reached Zediya by motor car but* through lack of petrol* were proceeding from tnese by camel or horse* and he expected them tomorrow (11th). 32* The British Agent's information was that Yemeni forces reputed to be 3*000 strong ted occupied the district in the vicinity of Ubal and were looting villages. With regard to the 400 Yemeni at Bura in the Raimah district he had received reliable information that this force was moving in the direotbn of Hodeida. No more Saudi forces had arrived in Hodeida but they were evidently expecting a large number because wells were being dug and temporary huts hut up* and they would scarcely go to such trouble for the sake of mere bluff. Saudi Officers had been distributing ammunition to tne inhabitants with a view to them hewing in the town’s defence if necessary. The town was quiet* and the shops and bazaar were operating normally* but trade with the outer world was still stopped.••stopped* The Italian force armed with rifles and two Machine gikns was observed re-embarking. 33. At 1647 I received a signal from the s.s. r, Sl Hak” to say that she expected to arrive at Hodeida Friday (11th) w i th the Saudi Minister of Finance, 200 armed police and stores* 34* Later in the evening I received news from the British Agent that an Italian Merchant in Hodeida had received a message from his agent in Sanaa by W/T via the ^AZID^ Thie message was “Good news. Bo not leave Hodeida” 0 If reliable this could be interpreted as showing that negotiations for a settlement between Ibn Saud and the Amir were in contemplation. 11th MAY. 36* At 0530 the Italian troopship rt QAGLIAkI' sailed. 36. During the forenoon the British Agent reported that the situation ashore was much the same. He had had a runner froM the Zabid district who reported that the morale of the Yemen troops at Zabid was low and that they were unwilling to fight. A high Saudi army official had entered Hodeida early in the morning by car, and large numbers of Saudi troops were expected in the evening and would camp outside. 37. The Italian ship *AZI0 H had left on shore a medical post consisting of one doctor, two European and two native 'assistants*. It was said that they carried nc arms, and were giving free medical attention. 36. At 1640 the s.s. ”1 H&amp;k* arrived and anchored inshore An officer was sent to board her. It was ascertained txx&amp;t the Saudi Finance Minister, Abdullah Suleiman, and his two secretaries, one of whom spoke perfect English, were on board, together with 200 armed and uniformed police, two small char-a-bancs, three staff care and quantities of ammunition, kerosene and petrol. The 'El Hak' had come from Jeddah via Port Sudan. The Minister of Finance, stated in an interview that he had come to organise the customs, arrange for the payment of the troops add put the affairs of the town in order. 12tn MAY. 39. During the forenoon I observed large numbers of tents being pitched to the north of the town, and decided to land in the afternoon and view the situation myself* 40. I was informed that, with the 200 armed police and the Saudi forces previously in Hodeida there were now 4,000 troops in the town. In an interview with the Advisor to the Amir I was informed that another 3,000 were expected shortly and they had been careful not to move such large numbers south before making sure of their oo Bimuni cations* 41. The town presented a very different aspect from that of my first visit (8th May), when business appeared to be almost at a standstill and the inhabitants unsettled. BusiAess now appeared to be brisk, the merchants confident and there appeared to be an air of security. Everywhere there....there were large numbers of Arabs armed for the most part with modern but cheap rifles made in Warsaw. 42• At 2230 the Italian destroyer 'Turbine” arrived and anchored* 13th May* 43* The situation adtore remained unchanged. Small numbers of Saudi troops continued to dribble in. It was reported that the continued presence of warships pro moted uneasiness amongst the inhabitants as it gave the impression that the general situation was net secure. &amp; small wireless set and an ice maj&amp;ing machine brought in the s.b. 'SI Hak' were being erected. 14th May. 45. The situation ashore remained unchanged. In the evening an Officer was sent to the Italian sloop 'Asio' with a note addressed to Captain Bonetti giving him the purpose of the Minister at Jeddah^ serial No. 16 announcing the cessation of hostilities between the Saudi and Yemeni forces. 15th May. 46. The situation ashore remained unchanged. 47. At 1630 Capitano di Corvette Mario kanieri in command of the destroyer 'Turbine' called. Owing to the bad weather conditions it had not been possible for me to receive his call until this day. He informed me that he had left Gaeta at 4 hours notice on 8th May with orders to proceed at 18 knots to Massawa where he would receive further orders before proceeding to Hodeida. On arrival at Massawa he was allowed only sufficient time to refuel before proceeding still with no instructions» and thus he had arrived at Hodeida with no knowledge of the situation whatever, he stated that his divisional commander in the 'Nembo' had left Gaeta the day after the 'Turbine'. Both destroyers were units of the fleet and I understood him to say that they had been despatched by order of the Minister of Marine at the request of the Colonial Office. At 1700 the Italian survey vessel 'Magnaghi' arrived. At 1800 the Italian destroyer 'Neabo' arrived. 16th May . 48. At 0930 Captain Bonetti called to say good bye as he was sailing in his surveying ship 'Magnaghi' to continue his surveying work on the Eritrea coast. He informed me that Commander Aszi of the sloop 'Aaio' would assume the duty of Italian 3.N.O. At 1346 the 'Magnaghi' sailed. 49. At 1020 the Commanding Officer of the 'Nembo' called and told me substantially the same as the Commanding officer of the 'Turbine' had done.60* Later in the forenoon the French Sloop 'Yprea* arrived from Beirut. The Commanding Officer informed me that he had been ordered to Hodeida from Port Sudan but for vhat reason he did not know as the French had no interests there and he had no knowledge of the situation. The only partially French subject in the place was an invalid old man of 80 years of age who was blind. He said that his Admiral from Syria was visiting Red Sea ports in the sloop ’ f Amiral Charner' which ship was on her way to China and that the 'Ypres' was due at Djibcut shortly to embark the Admiral and return to Beirut. HU I visited the Italian S.lf.O* in the afternoon and discussed matters with him in the light of Admiralty message 194b/l6« He agreed to take no action under any circumstances without consulting me first. 52. The situation in Hodeida was obscure. News of the cessation of hostilities* if officially receive^* seemed to be having little effect. Movements of Saudi troops in and out of the town continued and rumours of impending advance on Hodeida by Yemen forces were plentiful also rumours that the Saudi authorities were gloomy and obviously nervous. However the situation was quite quiet and it was only natural that the place should be full of arery sort of rumour. I Vth nay. b3. In t he afternoon the Commanding Officer of the French sloop 'Ypres” paid me an unofficial visit during which the conversation was of a general nature. 16th May. 64. At 0016 the Italian destroyer ^Turbine* sailed for Ma&amp;sawa. 66. At 1630 I landed to pay my respects to the Amir Feisal in view of the departure of H.M.8. BNYEk, early the following morning. He informed me that he was observing the Armistice ordeded by H.M. the King. The interview was of a very friendly nature. 66. The situation at Hodeida when I left was quiet under the Saudi occupation, but there were rumours of concentration by Yemen forces in the neighbourhood, possibly with a view to influencing the peace negotiations as regards the eventual control of Hodeida. 67. I wish to bring to your notice the good services rendered to me by Mr. Saleh Faffer the British Political Clerk at Hodeida. He gave me every assistance and kept me continually Informed of the situation besides carrying out the duty of interpreter in a very efficient and tactful manner. 68. Subsequently I paid a farewell call on the Italian S.N.O. 19tfr May. 59. At 0630 H.M.a.

Of H«M*S« followsJ- ihe situatl on at Hodelda at the time of depar^tire SMTifikPHISE on 19th May can be summarised as hnoir^ Saudi authorities in control of the town and local business practically normal but the general feeling of the inhabitants uneasy as to security owing to (1) Th^Saudi forces in the neighbourhood of Hodeida being considerably less than had been expected and promised* (^) Fairly authentic rumours of concentration of large numbers of Yemen forces from 20 to 30 miles East and South oi town* (3) Continued presence of Italian ships who were supposed to be in close communication with Imam of Yemen. (4) Lacic of confidence in Saudi control owing to allegiance *** l0Cal tribesfflen wha * was expected for their guffiours of every description were naturally pXnLxiui but practically could be discounted* The concent- ration of Yemen forces referred to in (2) seemed to be authentic as the information came to the British Agent through his own trusted sourees* 68. I had a talk with the Secretary to the Finance , xnxstcr on the evening before ay departure. This Secretary, an Arab, apojce excellent English having been educated in ^ e t£?f rlCan Uni T® r8ltjr at Beirut. The principal pointa of this conversation were that;- The Amir Feieal now in charge at Hodeida is an able laan „ wi J b a education and experience of the outside 1 °;* iXaa traVelled •xteiisively through Europe only (ii) The King was not acting rashly in advancing so far down the coast with only slender lines of communication because he had the measure of the Yemen and knew his capacity for interference* (iii) The King not only intended to retain Hodeida but intended eventually to go further Sputh in fact exterminate i n a ?* 00 &lt;”W hAs territory. (This appears ^rnfUot with opinions expressed to British Minister at Jeddah )• (iw) The King greatly reeented Italian interference, in fact his one fear was the possibility of Italian intervention on the Imam of Yemen’s behalf. The he£retary said the Saudis at Hodeida were 63. _ T th * borne trade [which is at present at a standstill) so as to get the benefit of customs dues. The presence of the Italian ships undermines the confidence of the merchants and the trade with the interior*...Interior cannot recommence until conditions are more settled* 64. The dislike of the Italian by the Saudis is so strong that I feel that if the Italians attempted to land men again an unfortunate incident might well occur.U9102/7196 3.04 300pds 2004ms CT&lt;feCoI^d 0i&gt;603/l, yO From H.M.S.

In January 19049 although the situation had progressirely deteriorated since August# a further delfts Conference was arranged at AiiBA (in ASIK). The Sa’udi Foreign Office in conversation with His Britannic Majesty's Minister at JKDDA (Sir AHBKKT KYAH# R.B.E*tC.M.O.) made no secret of the fact that they expected nothing from it, although a cleverly worded pronouncement toy their representatives in LONDON nd CAIRO was seriously mis construed by an optimistic outside world. A typical example of this misunderstanding was a leading article in *The Times* of 8th February# entitled *Arabia still Fortunate*. It may fairly be assumed that two motives prompted this manoeuvre. In the first place the King# Influenced no doubt by the repeated representations of Sir ANDREW RYAN to avoid at all costs an outbreak of open hostilities# desired to convince the world - and particularly the Moslem world# important members of which were at the time assembling for the annual Pilgrimage - of his un- ceaaih efforts in the cause of leace. Secrndly# and from a lass lofty though more pray tic 1 point of view# he was anxious that no check should occur to the arrival of the Pilgrims# who furnish the main source of his revenue. This point was of particular importance as regards those from EGYPT# who could more quickly take alarm and cancel their arrangements# and who in general belong to the more wealthy classes. 10. The Yemeni delegates reached their destination about the middle of February; nothing however was heard as to the progress of the discussions until on the 23rd March a private Secretary to IBM GA'UP brought word to 81r ANDREW RYAN of the complete breakdown on the negotiations and of the issue of orders for the Sa'udl forces to advance. 11. It may be well at this point to outline the facts of the problem of frontier dellniation# as far aa tney can be ascertained. It should be borne in atid# however# that the districts themselves are in most instances unsurveyed# the typical vagueness of native Information dees little to amplify the avalleole knowledge# while the Arab custom of referring to territory either by the names of local landmarks or by those of the tribes in the vicinity does but add to the confusion. Referring to Plan No. l.C (. ebruary 1932) of C.B. 1892 it is believed that the existing frontier (viewed through s&amp;'udi eyes) starts from a coastal village or post (MUWASS1M ?) some 10 miles north of MED1# and thence runs in an East north-easterly direction to the northward of JEBJSL i A£1H; here it turns north# passes to the eastward of JEBKL FaIFA# and then bands eastward through K&amp;JRAN# until# leaving the WADI HABUNA on its northern hand# it loaee itself in the deaerta of the interior.•••interior* The frontier dietricte i# dispute fall into three nain divisions - (a) The coastal region* known as the TIHAHA of ASIR, (b) The central mountain nassif* Boaetimea referred to as ASIR SURAT. (e) NEJRAN. IS* Broadly speaking* both (a) and (b) are in effective Sa’udi occupation; the demand for rectification is a Yemeni claim* IBN SA’UD desiring nothing more than stabilisation* NTCJRAN, centred in the Wadi of that name and in the WADI i IAB UN A, is inhabited by the tribes known generally as the BENI-YAM. It is claimed equally (and on equally (lender grounds) by both parties* The importance attached to it may be due to - (i) Its position astride the caravan tracks between the Yemen and Nejd. (ii) Its poseibfee &amp;rategic value as a route for an advance from the north against the eastern approaches to SA*NA« IB* On the 24th March, YUS3UF YA8IN, the holder of the post which can best be described as ’♦Head of the Privy council** also visited Sir ANDREW RYAN and recapitulated at length the recent developments* The case of the Sa*udi Government may be summarised under two main headings - (a) General Considerations* 14* It is maintained that the IMAM has repeatedly Ignored earlier promses for the regularisetlon of the boundaries* the implication being that the King 9 * dignity can no longer tolerate the present situation and the denial of hie sovereign rights over the disputed territory. This argument is perhaps his weakest point* since in the undeveloped state of the diplomatic organisation of the two countries it would be difficult (if not impossible) to produce irrefutable evidence of undertakings by the IMAM* while the intricacies* inexactitudes and ornateness of the Arabic language are such as to afford limitless scope for equivocation* 16* A much stronger case can be made out for the retention of ASIR* and to a lesser extent* SURAT* baaed on the fact that these districts were in the possession of the IDRISI* and were* beyond dispute* ceded to IBN SA*UD* in 1926-50* since when Sa'udl opeupatlon has remained effective except during the short period of the 1932-55 rebellion. 16* Aa regards NEJRAN* it is probable that both claimants can point to some period in the ^ast histories of their countries when in the course of the expansions* contractions and upheavals of Arabian politics this district submitted to their rule. It seems*however* that • • •In.•.. that until the present time neither of them have made an effort to establish themselves there# and the final disposal of the area a, ^ears therefore to be a reasonable object for negotiations. (to) Itmuedlate conBlQeraUoas. 17. The immediate cause of the failure of the ABHA Conference and the resort by IB# SA* UD to warlike measures is stated to bethe invasion of the regions of JKBKL FAIPAt BIL OHAZI and BEKI MALIK by Yemeni troops# which commenced before the delegates actually met# and which resulted in the capture of the Ba'udi garrison of 50 men at a post referred to as At AkDRA. This direct violation of the existing frontier is alleged to have been accompanied by the rebellion of certain tribee# stirred up st the connivance of the IMAM by ABDUL WAHHAB IDkISI (a nephew of The XDkISI) and by the installation of Yemeni officials and the imposition of taxes. In his final message the IMAM is said to have offered to withdraw the invaders in return for the recognition of his claims in MBJKAK and the evacuation of tne Sa'udl forces in that locality# but st the same time he re inf on ed his Commander in the Held. J • incursion is held to be all the mere unjustifiable on account of an agreement# made in December# 1931# wheiefey 1BN BA*UD admitted the claim of the IMAM to the district of JttVA (unidentified# but lying to the south of the frontier described in paragraph II)&gt; and obtained in return a tacit acknowledgement of his own righto in the territory now under discussion. legation staff# Colonel HAMD2 Bey# who among other tltlea holds that of Director general of Military Organisation# stated that the IMAM*s forces on ths ABIR front amount to IS#000 kegulsrs; a further 13#000 Regulars can be concentrated# while the irregular strength can be brought up to e maximum of 8b# 000 men. Facte ae to t e strength of the Sa* udi concentration are lacking. It is known that soma 2 years ago the soi-disant Regular rmy amounted to some 3# 000 men - infantry# cavalry and camelry. Approximately by sea from «TEJ)DA to JIZAN# and it seems probable that the total force does not exceed 30#000. In comparison with thsir opponents# the forces of IBB BA'OD are# however# much better equipped with mechanical transport# due largely to the number of lorries now engaged in the Pilgrim traffic and to recent purphases# while they also possess s number of portable wireless sets. Their weapon equipment# however# is probably inferior. Whatever may be the true facts# HARDI Bey in an ususual burst of confidence announced his conviction that within two months the Ss'udi forces would achieve a crushing victory. MILimy IH^UPKHCE.

IMPORTANT. ! 401C 1 1934 DOWNING STRKBT, 13 th June, 1934' My dear Freethy, You will remember that some weeks ago when the Saudi-Yemeni war was going on, a party of some 200 Yemeni soldiers took refuge at Kamaran and had to be interned at Aden. I discussed with you the question of the cost of rationing these internees and the Treasury agreed that the charge should properly fall upon the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote. The Resident estimated that the cost would be about £b per day. We have now received a telegram from the Resident asking for authority to incur expenditure on certain other services which have arisen out of the war. I enclose a copy of this telegram and of the previous telegraphic correspondence regarding the internees. You will see that the actual payments which he now has to make are in respect of the transport of the internees to Aden, their detention at Kamaran before leaving for Aden and also the cost of transporting the armed police to Hodeidah. I think I mentioned this last item to you when we were discussing the question of the internees. A party of 40 armed police had to be sent urgently from Aden to Hodeidah at the time when there was a serious threat of looting in the town and the Commander of the 'Penzance” represented W.R.

The party were six days at Hodeidah and I believe they were accommodated in the 'Penzance'. After they had been at Hodeidah for six days the situation was so much improved that they returned to Aden. chargeable to the Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote, subject, of course, to the usual l/ 3 rd contribution which the Government of India make to the political and defence expenditure of Aden under the normal standing arrangements. Will you kindly say whether the Treasury agree? If so, we will send a telegram to the Resident authorising him to pay the bills outstanding and also to incur the expenditure required for the return of the internees when the time comes for this to be done. In addition to authorising him to incur the costs required for the repatriation of the internees, we would propose to give him discretion to incur any further expenditure of small amounts which may be necessary, but we would propose to tell him that if any further large expenditure arises, we should be glad to be informed before payments are made. This should not tie his hands unduly, but, at the same time, will ensure that we are informed of any further commitments of any considerable size which may arise in the future. You will see, however, that the Resident does not at present anticipate anything of this nature. Perhaps you will let me have a fairly early reply to this letter in order that we may get a reply off to Reilly in the near future. Yours sincerely.

Section 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 14.) (No. 104.) Sir, Jedda, April 13, 1934. SINCE writing my despatch No . 91 of the 4th April, I have sent you several telegrams on the Saudi-Yemen situation, ending with my telegram N o. 60 of the 12th April, as well as the two communiques enclosed in my printed despatches No. 101 of the 9th April and No. 102 o f the 11th April. There is little of real importance to add to these reports, as regards the main course of events, but, as the King has been in Jedda and is leaving to-day, I find this a convenient moment to record a few matters of subsidiary interest. 2. The King arrived in Jedda early on the 11th April, in accordance with his usual practice of visiting this town soon after the pilgrimage. I was received in formal audience that morning, accompanied by Mr. Eurlonge, and again this morning, when I presented the Commissioner of Port Sudan, now here on a visit. We all gained the impression that His Majesty was in good form. He seemed somewhat tired and worn, but exhibited no signs of nervousness or discomposure. We discussed general subjects only, as etiquette requires. For all His Majesty showed, there might have been no war on nearer than Paraguay. He has left all business to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin during this stay and I need not record his visit to Jedda otherwise, except in the Jedda report. 3. The statement in the last paragraph of my telegram No . 52 o f the 6th April that the Amirs Feisal and Muhammad had started for the front was based on the communique issued that day, but was erroneous as regards the Amir Feisal. I learnt afterwards that, as his troops were mounted on camels, he preferred to delay his own departure and catch them up later. So far as I know, he had not set forth up to yesterday. 4. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, whom I have seen daily since the 10th April, discussed the situation with me that evening and again on the 12th April. He added little, as regards the actual operations in the south, to the communiques, except that he spoke of a movement of submission to the Ibn Saud among the tribes along the littoral. I think that he was referring to tribes on both sides of the de facto frontier, and at one moment spoke of the tribes as far as Luhayya having submitted, or being ready to submit, but he was rather muddled when I reverted to the subject on the 12th April. 5. You will have heard of the abundant talk of mediation in Egypt and elsewhere. The most important move in this direction so far seems to be that of a group including Haj Amin Husseini of Jerusalem, Abdul Hamid Bey Said, the Egyptian politician, Hashim Bey Attas of Syria and, it would appear from General Wauchope’s telegram No l 60 t o me (repeated to the Colonial Office), an Iraqi element of which I have not heard otherwise. I am not clear as to how far Prince Omar Toussoun is connected with this group, or as to the attitude of the King of Iraq. I gather that the plan is to send a mission to visit both Ibn Saud and the Imam in the hope of composing their differences. 6. Judging by the language of Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and other indications, I think that Ibn Saud’s present attitude towards all outside peace movers is one of polite aloofness. If a mixed Arab mission should visit him and he has not sustained any serious reverse in the interval, I anticipate that his reply will be such as may be summed up in the words : “ That wicked man has forced me across the Rubicon. I have told him my present terms. And there is no might or power but in God.” 7. The public of Jedda show very little interest in the war, so far as I can ascertain. I hear of no important repercussions in Mecca. Any loyalty that may be felt towards Ibn Saud in these towns is well contained. Rumour is readier to locate the Imam’s forces a few hours’ march from Riyadh or at Jizan than to echo the official news of victories over the border. [106 o—l] . r 26 21 JUN, -iH I fftOM SF-CRtrAftr, PCirri.: .. A:«i&gt; 1 SECRET DEPT. INCi X8. There is, of course, a great deal in the two local papers. Most of it, apart from communiques, is not worth recording, but one passage in the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th April is at least faintly amusing. An article headed “ Poor News ” refers first to the Times leader of the 24th March. It is not, however, directed, as might appear at first sight, against that sympathetic journal, but against commentators who have tried to make out that the 4,000 hostages mentioned by the Times are at Riyadh, not at Sana. The Umm-al-Qura assures its readers that the number of hostages sent to Sana is not less than 30,000, not merely 4,000, as stated in the Times; and adds that there is nothing of the kind at Riyadh. 9. The press also announces the formation of a First-Aid Association for the benefit of the fighting forces, under the presidency of Muhammad-ash-Shaibi, the Keeper of the Key of the Kaaba. The objects of the association are apparently to collect funds from the people to supply first-aid requirements, which have not hitherto been considered necessary adjuncts to warfare in this country. Its subscription list has been opened by the head of the long-established merchant family of Keynal and that of the A1 Fadhi family, who put down £200 and £100 gold respectively. Nothing has yet been said as to how the monies collected will be spent. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to Rome and Aden. I have, &amp;c.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 14.) (No. 115.) Sir, Jedda, April 19, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No . 104 of the 13th April, I have the honour to submit a further report on the Saudi-Yemen situation. It must be even more meagre than usual, as I have had no personal contact with the Saudi Government since that date. They may be too busy; they may have too little to tell to make it worth telling; or they may be holding off me owing to the imbroglio oyer the Royal slave, who took refuge in the Legation on the 11th April and who is still undisposed of. 2. I enclose a translation of a communique issued in the Umm-al-Qura of the 13th April. It merely confirmed what Sheikh Yussuf Yasin had told me the previous day, as recorded in my telegram N o. 6 0 of the 12th April. You will observe that the Saudi Government give in 'their communique the text of the Imam’s telegram to the King, one phrase in which is completely obscure (that relating to the Yam territory); but give an account only of the King’s reply. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin had followed the same procedure in his conversation with me. The account he gave me of the King’s telegram was similar to that in the communique, except in one particular, which I have not thought it worth while to telegraph. The sheikh mentioned the “release of hostages” as one of the King’s conditions. The communique refers more explicitly to hostages taken in the mountains, i.e., the Faifa-Beni Malik area, and adds that the King demanded that the Imam should cease to concern himself with the people in that area. 3. No further war news has appeared in the press, except a short announce ment in the Saut-ul-Hijaz of the 16th April, a translation of which I also enclose.^) The most definite statement in it is that the last of the forts at Haradh has fallen. Mr. Philby, who gave me the same news said that the Yemeni officer commanding had escaped. He stated that the position at Baqim was unchanged, 3 I &lt;10 the enclosure in my printed despatch No . 102 o f the 11th April), as it commanded the approach to the disputed mountain area. 4. I still have no confirmation of Mr. Philby’s further statement (see my telegram No. 62 of the 16th April) that the King received on the 14th April a telegram from the Imam agreeing to all his demands. My general impression is that Ibn Saud, having embarked on the war, is not very eager to call it off. If he ' finds himself in a strong position, he may even have some idea of asking for an indemnity, a possibility foreshadowded in a report from Koweit, dated the 1st March, a copy of which was forwarded by the Political Resident to the India Office on the 7th March. I have heard no reference to this here during the recent phase, but the general tone of the inspired press has been determined. Thus, on the 13th April, the Umm-al-Qura had an article referring to foreign reports of the Imam’s strength. According to these reports, said the writer, he could mobilise from 50,000 to 100,000 fighting men. The Saudis knew that he could in fact muster twice that number ; that he had arms left behind by the Turks and collected from other sources; and that he had gold and silver galore. Yet they must defend their frontiers and believed that God would give them the victory, because they were neither unjust nor aggressors. 5. I am awaiting to-morrow’s Umm-al-Qura before telegraphing further, on the chance of its containing something more than the single definite fact recorded in paragraph 3 above. In the meantime, I turn again to subsidiary matters. 6. The Amir Feisal left Jedda for the south in the small hours of the morning on the 15th April. His passage through this town was exceedingly unostentatious. Before he left, it was announced that his brother Khalid, a mere but that the Saudis attached importance to the occupation of Bab-al-Hadid (see ( l ) Not printed. . * 26 21 JUN, -I.M [106 t&gt;—2]wmmmmm 2 w lad was to act as President of the Council and Minister of the Interior. No announcement has been published regarding the Ministry for Foreign ^airs 1 s I write I learn that Fuad Bey Hamza has returned, and that he resumed his duties as Deputy Minister yesterday. As, however, the Amir Fema! is still m the country, it must be assumed that he is still technically at the head of the Ministry. 7. I reported in my telegram No. 62 of the 16th April the arrival here on that day of the self-constituted mission of Arab mediators. I believe the list 1 gave was correct, but as the Saut-ul-Hijaz of that morning gave a slightly different Fist of those expected, I cannot be absolutely certain of my own. The party who landed in pilgrim garb, were met on board by Sheikh \ ussuf Y asm and others. They were met at the quay by the Governor of Jedda and a guard of honour. This constitutes a first-class official reception, but I accept none the less readily Mr Philby’s view that the King holds the mission of little ^ cou T^.f u nd re g aids them as a nuisance to be suffered with a show of gladness. Mr. Philby quotes a recent utterance of the King to the effect that only the Iraqis are worth anything and that the others just say “ Ouah ! Ouah!” Nevertheless, I should dearly like to hear the King in converse with leaders of Moslem thought like Hai Amin Huseyni and the Amir Shakib Arslan. * &gt; . . &gt; ,, 8 . The. same Saut-ul-Hijaz of the 16th April contains a long article partly or wholly reproduced from the Al Fath newspaper of Cairo in its issue ot the 29th March It purports to give the text of telegrams exchanged between huad Bey Hamza and the King and Abdullah-al-Wazir and the Imam, when the Abha Conference had broken down. They are of little present interest, especially as the dates are not given, but the telegram ascribed to Fuad Bey contains one interesting observation, viz. : “ After the conclusion of the Anglo-Yemen Treaty, he says. ‘‘Abdullah-al-Wazir and his colleagues began to show obstinacy and fraudulence^ gend copies of this despatch and enclosures to Rome and Aden.

His Maiesty the King has replied that he is prepared to reopen discussion with the (Imams) representative, Ibn-al-Wazir, and to make peace if the retire ment of the Imam’s troops from Najran is proved; the hostages taken from our mountain people are returned and the Imam s relations w ith them discontinued, and the Idrisis are returned to him in pursuance of the Arwa Agreement made between him and the Imam, for it has been proved that the object of keeping them there was merely to use them as instruments for stirring up insurrection m T hamat \sir If these demands are complied with, the Government hope that the calamity of war will be averted and replaced by peace and concord, which we long for from the bottom of our hearts...

The attached report from H.M.S.PENZA 1X35 gives a very interesting account of the situation at Hodeida during the critical period between the evacuation of the Yemeni forces on 29th April and the entry of Saudi troops into the town on 5th May. The situation was extremely delicate for the first few days, but the Commander of H.M.S. PENZANCE seems, on the whole, to have acted rightly, in the circumstances explained in his report, in landing an armed observation post only, consisting of a Lewis Gun section accompanied by a signaller (page 6 ). The mere presence of a British Warship and a demonstration by aircraft sent from Aden 5041 2000 1.31had a reassuring effect on the population and may have prevented serious disorder. The presence of Briuish iorces was very well received by the inhabitants. The Italians, however, who arrived later, wore not viewed with much favour and they were foolish enough to attempt to land a large armed force after the town had been occupied by the Saudis, thus exposing themselves to a somov/hat icnoninious rebuff, since the Saudi officials refused to allow them permission to proceed further than the pier (page 16)* /^The Commander of PI.h.S*PfaTZAHCE praiscS the conduct of Saleh Jaffer, the British Political ulork, and of :..r.

Mr. HALL-CAINE asked the Secre- tai’y of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can make any further statement with regard to the position in Arabia; and whether he is satisfied that British in terests are adequately protected in the light of recent developments? Sir J. SIMON: His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has reported that terms of peace between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen were agreed upon about the 24 th May; but, as the conditions made by King Ibn Saud at the time of the suspension of hostilities had not been fulfilled by the Imam of the Yemen, King Ibn Saud . _ B 2 F.B. Form No. 3. threatened to resume hostilities on the 29 th May. An official Saudi Arabian communique of that date announced that, the Imam having reaffii’med his intention of carrying out the conditions completely, and having explained the delay which had occurred, King Ibn Saud had ordered the prolongation of the truce for some days. Recent reports from Hodeidah are to the effect that Yemeni forces have been concentrating in the mountains to the east of the town, and that Saudi forces have been sent out in their direc tion. An unconfirmed report states that there has been a clash. On the other hand, the Imam was reported on the 4 th June to have handed over to the Saudi authorities certain members of the Idrisi family, in fulfilment of part of the terms of the truce. As regards the second part of the question, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda received on the 29 th May re newed assurances from the Saudi Govern ment regarding the safety of British life and property in the area affected. His Majesty’s sloop “ Hastings ” is at Hodeidah and another of His Majesty’s sloops is in the vicinity. There are also two Italian warships and, I understand, one French warship, still at Hodeidah. I consider no further steps necessary in the present circumstances to safeguard British interests, but the situation is beinn - closely watched. U78 1000 2.32J00pd» 2001ms CTACoLW 0p605/l. MESSAGE.

Considerable operational activity has been displayed by the Royal Air Force at Aden during the month, in the course of which a new system of Air Control has been tested for the first time in the Protectorate. The system aims at establishing a 'blockade' of the territory of a transgressing tribe, as opposed to the previous method of inflicting definite material damage on their property as a direct punishment for their misdeeds. The blockade order forbids the tribe to occupy their villages, to cultivate their crops or to graze their livestock until the demands of the Government for the surrender of the criminals and the payment of a fine have been satisfied. It is enforced by air patrols at irregular intervals, who, if they see cultivators at work or flocks in the fields, attack with machine guns, and occasionally bomb the outskirts of villages. The effect of this pressure is that the entire tribe, with their animals, are forced to retire in acute discomfort into the caves and gulleys of the mountains, while their normal means of livelihood are completely suspended. At the present time the qUTEIBI tribe - well known 08 one of the most unruly and obstinate in the Protectorate are the defaulters, road guards in one of their valleys having attacked and looted a passing caravan. The blockade has been in force since the 22nd March, but up to the 25th April there were no signs of surrender. SAUDI/^AUDI - ARABIA - mTISII HOSTILITIES. 19. X. K X On 25th the Political Secretary returned by air from a visit to KAMAHAK, and brought intelligence of the heavy influx of pilgrims from the towns of MBDI and LOHIYAH, caused by the advance to the southward of the Sa’udi forces. A deputation of merchants also informed the Chief Commissioner that they had received news from MJ5DI that the Governor was preventing the departure of British subjects, women and children only being allowed to leave, while men and all property were being detained. After consultation with the Chief Commissioner it was therefore decided that PENZAKCE should sail at once for KAMARAK, and, if the detention of British subjects was confirmed, should endeavour to get into touch with the Yemeni Governor of MEDI (and if necessary of LOHIYAH) and urge him to lift these restrictions. The ship therefore left harbour at 1715 at 12 knots, in order to arrive before dark on the following day. * xx 20. - During the night of the 25th-26th April an intercepted message from KAMARAN stated that Yemeni troops were to be embarked at HOLEIDA in a ship of Messrs. COWASJEE DINSHAW Brothers for conveyance to MEDI. The name of the ship in question was known, but as she was not equipped with W/T it was decided to close her off HODEIDA and inform her that this unneutral service should not be undertaken; ADEN was informed of this intention. 21. - On approaching HODSIDA the ship (' AYAMONTE') was seen to be in harbour; PENZANCE therefore entered the anchorage, tired a salute to the Yemeni flag, and anchored. 'AYAMONTS' was at once boarded, and the situation explained to/to the Master. Ko troops had as yet heen embarked, but an enquiry for freight had been made and the Master was considering his reply. During the absence of the boarding officer, a signal was intercepted from ADEN which contained definite instructions from the Owners that, under the orders of the British authorities, the transport of troops or munitions was on no account to be undertaken. This confirmation of PENZAUC-S* s instructions was at once communicated to the Master, who received it with some relief. 22. - The British Government Agent and the Port Officer visited the ship soon after anchoring. It was explained to the latter that an important message had to be delivered to AYAMGNT35, while regret was expressed that notification of the arrival of PSNZANCS had not been possible in advance. These explanations were well received, and an invitation was extended to make a further and longer stay at the first opportunity. 23. - PENZAJICE sailed again at 1530, speed being increased to 14 knots to make the landfall in daylight. Anchored at KAM,ARAB at 1845. 24. The situation was fully discussed with the Civil Administrator in the light of the information which he had collected from refugees. The first refugees to arrive in the island were from ItEDI, to a number of 20 males and 200 old men, women and children; of these the last party had landed on the 17th, from which it was to be presumed that the ban on departures had become effective on the 16th. It was reported that the MSDI authorities had removed the rudders from all dhows in order to prevent their sailing* Prom the personal knowledge of the Administrator and bis staff, it was estimated that there remained in MEDI some 36 families of British or British protected subjects. with/1 with goods to the value of about 20,000 M.T. dollars. 26. Reliable information indicated that the town, although strongly invested by the Sa’udi forces on the north, south and east, had not fallen on the 24th. The strip of coastline about a mile in width which separates the town from the shore had been swept by Sa’udi patrols. 26. As regards about 850 refugees had arrived in KAMAHAH, who were mainly relatives of the inhabitants, who stood security for them. No Arab of military age had been admitted. Only 5 British subjects were Known still to be in LOHIYAH, and arrangements had already been made to advise them to withdraw. 27. All indications seemed to point to the desirability of proceeding to MEDI forthwith in accordance with the original intentions (paragraph 19), an this was emphasised by fact that the town appeared likely to fall at any moment, in which event the behaviour of the Sa’udi troops could not be foreseen or relied upon, although news had recently been received from JEDDA that the Sa’udi Minister for Foreign Affairs had given the desired undertaking as to the safeguarding of British lives and property. 28. It had therefore been decided to sail on the following morning (27th), when Admiralty message 1757/26 was received, in which the proposed visit to M2DI was made conditional on the concurrence of the British Minister at JEDdA. The situation was therefore laid before him in PENZANCE’S message timed 0111/27, and the ship meanwhile remained in KAMARAN. 29. At 2230 on the evening of the 27th the Minister’s reply was received, stating that he concurred ii the visit, but would prefer that the territorial waters of/of MEDI should not h e entered before sunset on the 38th in case His Majesty’s Government should communicate other views* At the same time a repetition of his telegram No.76 to the Foreign Office, LONDON f was received, in which he reviewed the situation, and recommended the visit, adding that he considered that the Sa'udi Government could have no valid objection to it if he informed them that the object of the sloop was solely to re-assure and, if necessary, to assist British subjects in the town* 30* The Minister’s concurrence and the other poihtB referred to above were summarised in PENZANCE’S message timed 0134/28 and arrangements were made to sail accordingly* The Minister was also informed that the ship would sail, and that territorial waters would be entered as nearly at the time desired as navigational considerations would admit. (PENZANCE’S message 0136/28, repeated to chief commissioner, ADEN). 31. On the morning of the 28th information was received from the Administrator that further news had come to hand. I therefore landed and accompanied him by car to the north end of the island, where two further jjarties of refugees had landed. One party was from MEDI, and included a Yemeni officer and two soldiers, from whoa it was learned that the town haa been evacuated on the 26tl by the orders of the Governor (the Amil ABDULLAH AtvASHl), and that he and the small garrison had fled to the south, some by dhows and others on foot. 32. This information if correct, materially altered the situation, since if the occupation of the town had been accompanied by any looting and violence to the civil population, it was evident that the ship’s arrival would/would be too late. On the other hand it was impossible to visualise with any certainty the regime which would prevail under the Sa^di occupation, and as it might well be that the British subjects would still desire strongly to leave, I decided to adhere to the visit, ind to approach the Sa f udi Commander with a view to their evacuation should they so desire. This decision was conveyed to Admiralty Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, the Minister JEDDA and the Commissioner ADEN in PENZANCE’S message 1213/28. PENZANCE proceeded at 1210 at 14 knots, the events recorded in paragraph 31 above having caused a considerable delay in sailing. 33. During the afternoon a repetition of a somewhat mutilated message from the Minister at JEDDA to the Foreign Office was received. In this the Minister stated that from a reliable source he had learned of the occupation of MEDI on thefeeth* Although this change in the situation was an argument against a naval visit, he still considered that, on the balance, it remained useful and desirable. 34. PENZANCE arrived off MEDI and anchored at 1810 (Zone - 3). No salute was fired, owing to the general uncertainty as to the conditions prevailing ashore and to the fact that its return could in no case be expected. 35. The Navigating Officer (Lieutenant R.C.GORDON SMITH, R.N.) and the Interpreter landed immediately at the Customs House in MSRSA BA3LA (Chart No.212), and were cordially received by the Sa’uai Customs Officer, who had l^terly arrived from JIZAN, his normal post. A Customs Guard of 20 soldiers were also present. A letter (English translation shown in Appendix I) had/had 'been given to t*ieutenant SMITH i‘or tranan iasion to the Sa’udi Commander, enclosed in which was an unsealed letter to a well-known British subject in the town, (Appendix II)• On these being presented, the Customs Officer at once despatched them by car to the Amir FAISAL IBN SA’UD in MXDI, and, pending his reply, entertained the party in a most friendly and hospitable manner. 36. The man appeared well-informed and intelligentj and volunteered the following information; it is, of course, impossible to guarantee its accuracy. (a) Alter the fighting at HARADH the 3a f udi advance met with no opposition during the advance to MEDI* Here tne resistance was very feeble, and on the 26th the town was occupied. The Amir and a small detachment of about 300 troops were pursued in the direction of HABL, where they were overtaken; a brief skirmish took place, resulting in the capture of the Amil, and some 80 of the soldiers, the remainder continuing theii flight. (b) The main Sa’udi forces have not entered the town, but are encamped on the outskirts, a small Guard only being in actual occupation. It was stated that no disturbances had occurred. (c) It appears that something in the nature of a general amnesty is in force; no restrictions have been placed on the movements of tne inhabitants or their property, while those who have removed merchandise from the town are encouraged to bring it back without the imposition of re-entry taxes. This is borne out by the fact that when the Customs Officer on his own initiative, sent a second car into MEDI with the news that there would be an opportunity for the despatch of letters to the south3 ? in PENZANCE, two British merchants availed themselves of the chance of communicating with ADEN and KAMAHAN* One of these letters was examined, and contained a statement that the conditions of affairs in the town was entirely satisfactory, and that any goods might safely he sent there* (d) The strength of the Sa’udi forces was stated to he 15,000, including cavalry, and 200 motor vehicles, some of which are armed with nachine guns* A further 10,000 men were said to he marching from JIZAN to reinforce the column* It seems probable that these figures are considerably exaggerated* (e) The sheikhs of tribes and villages as far south as the vicinity of HQDEIDA were alleged to be making their personal submission to the AMIR* This confirms reports from other sources that the TIHAMA tribes are rising in favour of the invaders* (f) The Sa’udi troops were said to compare very advantageously with the Yemeni levies in equipment, and particularly in the scale of rationing and pay, which are on a far more generous scale* Local boatmen who took the British party back to the ship confirmed this opinion* 37* At about 2200 the reply from the AMIR was received (Appendix III), and the party re-embarked* It will be seen that Paisal adopted the attitude thatj his occupation of MEDI placed the coast on the same diplomatic footing as Sa^di territory proper (e.g. JEDDA), and in consequence he protested against the lack of the advance notification which is customary at that port. In the absence of instructions from his Government h« felt himself unable to offer any assistance, and requested the departure of the ship, adding that the lives and property of British subjects were safe*38. The evidence referred to in paragraph 36 as to the tranquillity of the town and the well-being of the inhabitants, coupled with the Amir’s assurances made it clear that no useful purpose would be served by remaining longer in tne anchorage, while the matter of the official protest was evidently a question fh r diplomatic representations* The situation was therefore reported to all authorities concerned in PENZANCE'S message 'Important” 2356/88, ana the ship sailed at 0600 on the following morning (29th), arriving at KAMARAN at 1600* KAMARAN. 39* The situation there had changed but little. Refugees had arrived from IBN ABBAS and SALIFF (on the mainland, opposite KAMaAAN ISLAND), who reported the evacuation of the entire coast as far south as LOHIYAH by the Yemeni troops and officials* 40. At 0900 on 1st May the Administrator called and informed me that the AYAMONYE, which had arrived at 0800, had on board a large number of refugees from HODEIDA. He had also received letters from the Political Clerk, HODEiDA reporting the development of a very serious situation. I accordingly proceeded, on board her and interviewa the Master and 2 refugees; their evidence confirmed the Political Clerk’s opinion, and I therefore decided to proceed to HODEIDA with all despatch, reporting my intentions in my 'Immediate” message timed 1153/1* The subsequent proceedings of H.M.

His Majesty’s Ship under my Command has been sent to MEDI for the purpose of communicating with and reassuring the subjects of His Britannic Majesty who are now r siding here, and of assisting their departure if they so desire. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at J3DDA has previously requested the Sa’udi Government to guarantee the safety of these persons and their property in the event of an advance by the troops of His Majesty Ibn Saud into ports of Asir and the Yemen, and this assurance, for which His Majesty’s Government is deeply grateful, has recently been received from FUAD Bey HAMZA. A further and similar request, dealing in particular with the situation at MEDI, was presented yesterday to the Sa’udi Government. Information at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government indicates that there are now approximately 36 families of British or British protected subjects in MEDI, as shown on the attached list, which, however, may not be complete or entirely accurate. Since the occupation of the town by the Forces undei^rour command, it is without doubt that their anxiety has been greatly relieved. His/ __His Britannic Majesty’s Government will, however, be grateful if you exercise your authority on their behalf by, firstly, granting facilities for the delivery, after your perusal of the enclosed letter to SYED TALKB, ATT;S, the moot important member of the British community. Secondly, by granting facilities for all British subjects who may so wish t o embark either in dhows or on bo rd H.M.S.P ^AHCE for transportation to KAMARAN. With compliments, (Sgd.) R.H.BEYAJT.

The Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, is not, I gather, entirely satisfied with the handling of the situation by PENZANCE (it is not clear whether he thinks its Captain rather too alarmist) and steps have been taken to arrange for the relief of PENZANCE by HASTINGS. But the/ 1743 1000 3.33the telegrams taken as a whole ho leave a somewhat uncomfortable impression of instability and it seems clear that there is a case for the retention of a British vessel (particularly as the French and Italians are still both represented) at Hodeida for the moment.

He understood the Amir.; was limiting force actually in town ana considered this to be a wise precaution against trouble 0 m. i ± u\/q now received private and secret letter from Puad dated May 28th in which he sums up Questions address ed by Commander of 'Penzance' in somewhat different terms fiom those used by latter* After referring to my con versation with Yusuf Yassin he stated that Baudi Govern ment have undertaken protection of British interests, that they see no cause for anxiety and that they will take all necessary measures to obviate any danger to life or property* Fuad presumes that Amir has answered Commander on lines of lusuf i’assin’s statements to me* He adds that Saudi Government feel no alarm at concentration of Yemeni troops In direction of mountains. They rely on God and their own forces not only to repel any advance but to carry2c carry on the war in the event of failure of pease negotia tions. They are confident that fears of His Majesty's Government are groundless. Should peace negotiations suc ceed measures will he taken to eliminate any interval dui- ing which disturbances might attend process of handing over territory accruing to respective parties.

Following is gist of an official communique issued late yesterday. Messages were received from Imam on May 26th in which he re-affirmed his intention of carrying out the King’s conditions completely and explained delay as being due to great distance involved. He stated that part oi mountain area had already been evacuated, that Idrisis had been arrested and that officer in charge of them was on his way to Muhabisha where they would be surrendered on arrival of cars sent by Amir Feisal to receive them. King trusts the Imam’ s assurances and has ordered prolongation of truce for some days. Replying to complaints by Imam of strong attack by mnir Saud in Far a. district of Mai la, Ibn Baud has stated that any violation of truce would displease him and that orders have been given to avoid such incidents.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arabia. Disembarkation of Italian sailors at Hodeidah. Rome. 8th May, 1934.Translation No: 214866/74 MINISTRY OF FORKION AFFAIRS PRO-MEMORIA In reply to Hia Britannic Majesty’s Aide emolre of the 6th May, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs hare the honour to state that the disembarkation of certain contingents of Italian sailors at Hodeida was occasioned by the necessity of protecting the Italian subjects resident in that town and to safeguard their interests, and was effected in an analogous manner to the previous disembarkation of British contingents and independently of any requests from the Imam which were not made. It is true that other contingents of Italian troops have arrived in the port of Hodeida, and are being held at the disposal of the Italian Commanding Officer with the object of eventually relieving the disembarked sailors on the same lines as the disembarkation of contingents of Indian troops from Aden which took place on the 4th iiiay. From the preceding it is quite evident that the action taken by the Italian Government at Hodeide has been far from assuming, or from wishing to assume, the form of intervention:! the Royal Government assures the British Government that they are aware of and hold by the letter and the spirit of the conversations in Rome of 1927, and it is certain that the British Government will for their part maintain a like attitude ( u analogo atteggiaraento”). The situation which has developed in the lower Red Sea area reinforces, in the opinion of the Royal Government, the desirability of considering urgently with the British Government what measures might be taken to prevent further deterioration of this situation. His Britannic Majesty’s Government/Government will be aware that the l:oyal Government have already made a proposal to the Government in London for a joint examination of the situation in Arabia on the basis of the Protocol of the Home conversations of 1927, and that the British Government did not hold that such a proposal was actual ('attuale*)• The Italian Government trust that the British Government will now realise its desirability, especially in view of the situation which has been created at Hodelda. In formulating this view the Italian Government have taken into consideration the observation made at the end of His Britannic Majesty's Aide Memoir© of the 5th May, that is to say that the British Government were considering the measures which might assist in the re-establishment of peace in Arabia* &gt; Rome, Bth May, 1934 - XII, [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] You should reply to Italian cominuniGation on lines that armistice having since been arranged anrl direct peace negotiations being in progress 3 situation does not in n} yiew now call for proposed joint examination of situation at Rome® Addressed to Rome No*174* repeated to Jedda No»99o i 9 3 4 (Bv5035/79/25)♦ To ITtiLY.

To* Ministry of foreign South est Arabian dispute. Affaire, Rome. 30th April, 1934URGENT Hie Mfc.ieety'e Embassy present their compliments to the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have the honour to inform them that they did not fail to communicate to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom the substance of the Royal Ministry’s Note Verbale No. £13416/66 of the 25th April on the subject of the present situation in South Western Arabia. As the Royal Italian Government will be aware, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have, throughout the course of the present cispute between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, constantly urged on King Ibn Saud the extreme desirability of arriving at a peaceful settlement of the questions at issue: in particular, when, at the beginning of the present year, an outbreak of hostilities unfortunately appeared imminent, His Majesty’s Minister at Jecda was instructed on the 23rd January to aedress to the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs the personal letter, the substance of which was communicated to the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in His Majesty’s Ambassador’s personal letter of the 24th January to His Excellency the UndeivSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs: similarly, on the 22nd March, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda made to a representative of the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs a personal communication, the tenour of which was subsequently approved by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, expressing the earnest hope/hope that it would he possible to avoid the crossing of the frontier by Saudi troops: the substance of this communication was given in the Note Verbale from this Kmbassy No. 99 (39/66/34) of the 29th March. While His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will, in the future as on these and other occasions in the past, be most ready to use their influence with King Ibn Saud whenever it appears to them that by so doing they are likely to contribute to the cause of peace, they fear that where the rights and wrongs of the position are as obscure as they are at the present moment, intervention by them at this stage might well do more harm than good. His Ma-esty't Government will, hovever, certainly exert their influence on behalf of peace as soon as a euitab'e opportunity occurs.

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. No. 214277/69. NOTE V E R B A L E Most Urgent . In their Note Vcrhale No. 127 of the 30th April, replying to the request of the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs for immediate British intervention with the Government of Jeddah with a view to procuring the suspensions of hostilities by King Ibn Saud, His Brit- nnic Majesty’s Embassy stated - after recalling'serious other recent occasions on which British influence had been exercised at Jedoah - that the Government of London feared that 'where the rights and wrongs of the position 'are as obscure as they are at the present moment, 'intervention at this stage might well do more harm 'than good'. In regard to the above, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs have the honour to make the following observations, viz: that apart from the discussions as to the rights and wrongs, the situation is clear in this respect: that the Imam has declared his acceptance of all the conditions imposed by Ibn Cauc for desisting from armed action, and that in spite of this the advance of iaudi troops into Yemeni territory continues end the tribes of the Yemeni-Tihama are stirred up against the Imam. The result of this has been that Hodeida has recently been evacuated by the Yemeni troops. We are thus face to face with events which may upset the existing political equilibrium on the eastern/eastern coast of the Bed Sea which was the subject of the Pome conversations of 1927 between Italy and Great Britain, If events are allowed to take their course without interference, the interests wnich these j conversations were designed to protect may be compromised. The Royal Government for their part cannot therefore but regard with anxiety the creation of a fresh situation distinct from that which was the basis of the Italo- British agreements embodied in the protocol of the Pome conversations of 1927. It was in the light of such considerations that the Royal Government considered it desirable and urgent that the work of persuasion vis-&amp;-vis the Government of Ibn ; aud should not be interrupted, but rather intensified (the Italian Government for their part have not failed to act in this sense vis-d-vis ihe Imam) in order that nothing might be neglected which might prevent the situation in the Arabian peninsula from becoming more serious. The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs are confident that His Majesty’s Embassy will appreciate the friendly spirit of the present communication, which is inspired by the desire to continue the cordial Italo-British collaboration established in 1927, with the object of preservin peace in the Arabian peninsula ami of safeguarding the important interests possessed by Italy and Great Britain on the eastern coast of the Red Sea.
