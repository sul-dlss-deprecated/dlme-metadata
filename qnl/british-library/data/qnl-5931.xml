Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 12th April 194 3. jr»M* Rtt&amp;W V* yS Dmied o Addressed to POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. repeated to Political Agent Bahrain No.8/SAVING. During the past eighteen months three consignments of Iraqi currency notes have been lost en route from the United King dom; in one case as the result of an air crash off the coast of Spain and the others due to the sinking of ships. 2o It has now come to light that some of the notes lost off the coast of Spain have been negotiated in Bahrain and have Jbeen imported into Iraq. 3. I should appreciate your assistance in endeavouring to establish the channel by which these notes reached the Persian Gulf. For instance the money changers, sarrafs etc® may know if merchant seamen from vessels calling at Bahrain are endeavour ing to cash dinar notes. All local banks have been advised and their correspondents in neighbouring countries have been asked to keep a close check on all Iraq currency received. 4. Some of the lost notes may also have been negotiated at other ports in the Persian Gulf® 5* Enquiries made should be of a most discreet nature in order to avoid arousing any suspicion likely to discredit the Iraqi currency. 6® The numbers of the missing notes are as follows:- Denomination® Value• From.
