It instructs the Resident to let the Regency of Muscat understand that strict neutrality will be observed by the British Government in any disputes which may arise between the Imaum [Imam, Sa‘īd bin Sulṭān Āl Sa‘īd] and his neighbours on the continent of Arabia. The aforementioned enclosure addressed to John Bax, Secretary to Government, Bombay follows on from the letter. The letter states that the Governor General in Council, John Fitzgibbon, is not prepared to allow the involvement of British arms in protecting the continental possessions of the Imam of Muscat against the Wahabees [Wahhabis]. He goes on to state that if both parties are left to themselves then a sense of mutual interest may prevent them from acting upon any differences that may arise between them. He then states that Britain's only concern is with the maintenance of the maritime commerce of the Gulf, and that British maritime superiority would deter from piracy whoever controlled the harbour of Muscat. He states that in the worst case scenario, if the Wahabees were to acquire possession of the port of Muscat and commit acts of piracy upon the Gulf trade, then it would be cheaper and easier to chastise them under these circumstances. It goes on to argue that a decision to protect the Imam of Muscat may draw the British into a system of continental warfare. The letter instructs that the British authorities in the Gulf should maintain a strict neutrality in any disputes that may arise between the Imam and any of his neighbours.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023654665.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
