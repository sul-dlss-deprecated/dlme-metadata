The typewritten notes appear to have been compiled during the 1930s. They consist of excerpts from 19th century British correspondence and memoranda, covering the period 1845-1881, and are primarily concerned with the tribe's relations with the Sultan of Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000016#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
