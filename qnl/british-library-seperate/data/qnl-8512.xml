The file includes cuttings of many of the newspaper articles referred to in the correspondence, most being published in
                           The Times. The correspondence concerns the diplomatic implications (both feared and realised) arising from press articles that are critical of Persia, its government, or the Shah’s rule. Amongst the articles appearing in
                           The Timesthat are included in the file are two written by the travel writer Robert Byron, entitled
                           Middle Eastern Journey: The Glories of Islam(f 101) and
                           Middle Eastern Journey: Hindu Kush by Car(f 102).The file’s principal correspondents are: HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, Reginald Hervey Hoare, Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugesson, Horace James Seymour; the Foreign Office.Also included in the file are cuttings and extracts of articles from the Persian press (in French, with some accompanied by English translations), that were written in response to articles in the British press.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
