I understand you agree that it would be better to await the Pakistan Government’s reply regarding Gwadur before we commence negotiating with enc/ the Sultan, and for your information I enclose a copy of the letter I have to-day sent to Pyman at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, F. A. K. Harrison, Esq. , Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, S.W.l.I560S 5th April, 48 Dear Mr. Pyman, In his letter to me of 50th ultimo on the subject of the Company*s proposed Concession covering its present and future operations at Muscat, Harrison of the Common wealth delations office tells me that he is sending you a copy in view of their responsibilities in respect of the Persian Gulf having just been taken over by the Foreign Office. He mentioned in his letter that you would be glad to learn when we proposed to present the draft to the bultan. It was our intention to do this forthwith, the views of the Political Authorities in the Gulf having already been obtained and embodied in the draft, it seems, however, that the concurrence of the Pakistan Government to our taking over the telegraph tmsiness at Gwadur (for which provision is made in the draft) as well as the postal business, is at present awaited. In these circumstances we therefore feel it would be better for us to defer instructing our bivisivjnal manager to conmiencc negotiations with the Sultan until this point is settled. Harrison is letting me know as soon as the Pakistan Government's reply is received. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) J. INNKS L. F. L. Pyman, £sq., Foreign Uffice, Whitehall, S.W.i.-yA /itft, &amp;■ Dear Iones, Thank you for y-&gt;ur letter of 12 th kerch forwarding a revised draft of your Company's proposed concession for Muscat*/ with reference to the second paragraph of your letter we see nothing in the agreement5 to indicate that the rights conferred therein ajs*e restricted to local coramunicationSjthough the use of the facilities provided must he limited to the requirements of the business of Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Ltd. Tiie latter Company could not, for example, compete with Cable &amp; Wireless. As regards the last paragraph of your letter^the present position is that in reply to a letter of ours of 16th October last the Pakistan Government agreed .to continue post and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur on the present . /basisa basis. It will therefore now be neoessaiy to secure their concurrence to the revised proposal * * that Cable &amp; Wireless should take over responsibility for arrangements there. Me are frhorofsno now asking the G-overnment of Pakistan whether they agree to youtr undertaking these responsibilities and mantionin^ that it~~T5~ &lt; tJs proposal that your Divisional lianager at Karachi should be instructed to obtain detailed particulars of the buildings, etc. and to carry out further i./r; CkAf»(^ a cy LUU* negotiations locally*/^ will let you know as soon as a reply is received. It will of course be necessary for the G-overnment of Pakistan to continue to hold the fort until you are in a M/’t position to take over at Gwadur. I am not quite sure when you are proposing to present to the Sultan your draft concession for Muscat. We 0\ ^ should be glad to hear about this in due course in order that the political authorities in the Gulf may be informed. Meanwhile we are sending a copy of your letter of 12th March and enclosure to the Political Resident. /Asf. As you may be aware, the Foreign Office will be taking over from this Office our present responsibilities in respect of the Persian G-ulf from the end of thia mouthy I am therefore sending a copy of this letter and yours under reference to L.F.L* Pyman at the Foreign Office £ as well as/Miss Bridger at the xost Office. ft /C HAKPJ.WI ITEM RLE BAR 1222.

Regarding the addition to the last sentence of Clause 1 modifying tne exclusive rights under tne Concession, it occurs to us from the extracts relating to Petroleum Development (unan and Dhofar) Limited that they do not entirely preclude the possibility of that Company communicating inter nationally providing that Company possesses international stations. No doubt the intention is that their rights in this connection are restricted to purely local communications, i.e. within tne Sultan's territories, but perhaps you could clarify this point. As implied in my letter of 9th ultimo, we have not yet advised our Divisional Manager of our agreement in principle to establish the Gwadur station and we are deferring this advice pending your reply to our suggestion that he should ascertain what premises would be available for the purpose. * Yours sincerely, F.

Cable and Wireless concession at Muscat. 2. In existing concession, company are granted exclusive licence to operate 'at or near Muscat'. 3. In Clause one of draft forwarded with your express letter under reference,, is term 'Muscat' meant to apply to the whole of the Sultan's dominions (?including) Dhofar and Gwadur, or only to Muscat town and its vicinity? I cannot comment in detail until this point is cleared. 4. I am most anxious that Cable &amp; Wireless should be induced to instal a small wireless station at Gwadur to take the place of the existing land telegraph line, and shall be addressing you separately on this subject in due course&gt; 4./ 1. • Under the 1939 Agreement (Flag A) Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. have exclusive right 'to land, maintain and operate at or near Muscat any telegraph cable or cables the Company may desire for the purpose of comraunieating with any place or places comprised in the Company’s world-wide system of telegraphic communication'. At the time when this Agreement was signed, Cable &amp; .'ireless desired they should operate an emergency wireless station to maintain communication if cables were broken. Permission to instal this was not included in the Agreement, but was granted by the Sultan in an exchange of letters at flag B, 2. In 1942 the B.O.A.C, erected a wireless station in Dhofar for communication with aircraft. Cable &amp; Wireless in their letter at flag C requested that the B.O.A.C. wireless station should be restricted to comiminicat &gt; ons with aircraft only and that they themselves, should handle a 1 l messages for points outside Muscat territory. The Political Resident was instructed to inform the Manager of Cable &amp; Wireless at Karachi that 'although the contention of your Company that they have been granted exclusive rights for connunication by wireless to Muscat is open to questioi^the B,O.A.C. had agreed at the request of H.i .0. to restrict their traffic in l.iuscat territory to messages necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft.* Caole P. Wireless were also informed that h.M.Cr. were noo willing to ask the Sultan to clarify the question as to whether Cable &amp; Wireless had exclusive rights of wireless communication in Muscat territory until after the war.C*'*# 3 In August of this year after long and rather complicated negotiations, Cable &amp; Tireless proposed to prepare a comprehensive scheme^subject to the Sultan s agreement.for the installation of an automatic telephone system in Muscat and Salalah. At present it is not known whether the Sultan has agreed to their proposals.1 4. Taking into account their rather ambiguous position in connection with wireless in Muscat and also their existing cable monopoly and proposed telephone system. Cable ^ Y/ireless have submitted a draft Agreement (flag t ) to consolidate their position. The Agreement itself is * based on the two Agreements already signed with the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrein, but with the following differences:- (a) 0&gt;) (c) The Company intend to ask for a i+C year duration of their concession, largely on the grounds that their cable agreement does not expire until 1987 * In &lt;the case of Bahrein and Kuwait the Agreements were only for 20 years. In their letter at flag E, Cable &amp; tireless agree that a clause must be inserted saving the rights of the B.O.A.C. stations in the case of technical communications with aircraft. In this connection it should be noted that under paragraph 12 of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement, is entitled to appoint its own agents to handle wireless communication with aircraft. In their Agreement with Bahrein and Kuwait, the exclusive rights of the Company were modified in the favour of BAP00 and the KOC, It might be worth considering if Cable &amp; Wireless /concession is to be granted for 40 years whether 'the future rights of Petroleum Development Ltd. i should not also be safeguarded. Free private messages - 1500 words (Kuwait) and 3p,00f (Bahrein)^were allowed to the Slja^khs in the previous Agreements.. Cable &amp; Wireless^expressed their willingness to insert ft similar clause in the case of Muscat. (a)/ /(d) At Bahrein the Ruler insisted on a clause which L afimunj-Misil him to obtain additional telephone lines and apparatus from other sources if Cable &amp; Wireless could not supply them within a reasonable time. 5. Cable &amp; Wireless have expressed fears that as the Agreement is to be concluded between the Sultan acting as Head of the G-ovemment of Muscat*and themselves, it might be possible for Hi*successors to repudiate it. Both the Agreements with Kuwait and Bahrein were drawn up in exactly the same way and in the 1939 Commercial Treaty with Muscat the Sultan signed M on his own behalf' and no distinction was made between his exercise nin iyiwhmite powers as Head of the Government and his own dynastic position. It would appear to be most undesirable to attempt such a distinction in the preamble of the Agreement y if only because it would leave a very unfavourable impression in the mind of the Sultan, especially if he compared the Agreement he was asked to sign with those already signed by the Rulers of Bahrein and Kuwait. i*l*o -■I &lt;1 ' TE M RLE BAR 1222. ‘EMPIREGRAM, ESTRAND, LONDON.' /[■ fo* , {.^“rrfzr :A tJ)&gt; /sY'fc&gt;'/s,ss ^A/f//rr,*//dw/:&gt;&gt;S, COMMUNICATION s ^ ’Addressed to the m. aging director the reference and date of THIS LETTER BEING QUOTED /%v # rli 0 4J l * AlD/T/PB ^DEXED ttW7?. w.c. 2 . 16th October, 47. Dear Donaldson, The Company’s exclusive cable landing rights at Muscat, together with permission for the emergency wireless set there, are at present secure until 51st December, 1987, in accordance with the attached copies of the relative agreement and correspondence with the Sultan, of March 1959. In view of proposals we have on foot for the installation of a public automatic telephone service, as well as the possibility of establishing radio-telephone services later, we feel that it would be as well to set in train at an early date negotiations with His Highness for a comprehensive Concession embracing the whole of our present and future requirements. Using as a basis the Concessions already satis factorily concluded in the case of Bahrain and Koweit, the enclosed draft (in duplicate) has accordingly been prepared and is now submitted for your consideration and that of the political authorities in the Gulf. as regards the duration of such new Concession (Article 1), we should not expect any objection from His Highness to at least forty years, bearing in mind the above expiry date of our existing rights. In connection with the exclusive nature of the Concession, referred to in the last sentence of Article 1(c), may I draw ii. 4. Donaldson, iisq. , C.M.G. , Commonwealth delations Office, King Charles Street, Lonoon, S.W.l.your attention to the second 2 - I nclosed Is copy of the Political Kesident’s letter to omrfDivisional Manager, dated 3rd November, 1942, relating to the nature and extent of traffic agreed to be handled by B.C.A.C. When the proposed negotiations commence, the Political Authorities may no doubt desire to clarify this point in the Concession itself. You will, no doubt, recall that in both the Bahrain and Koweit Concessions this particular • provision was amended to cover the rights of the various oil companies concerned. At the end of Article 5, provision is made for the continued payment to His Highness of the sum of £1 per annum for each cable landed in his territory. I specifically mention this, merely because of the absence of any such payment in the case of Bahrain. As further consideration for the granting of the desired Concession free message facilities will undoubtedly be requested by His Highness. If so, we should be prepared to agree to a limit of 1,500 free words annually as in the case of Koweit, although the number could be extended to 3,000, as at Bahrain, should the Political Authorities consider this necessary. You may feel that this is a point which might be left to the negotiator on the spot. tie do not propose to instruct our Divisional Manager to proceed with negotiating the Concession until we have received the oultan’s approval to the proposed telephones scheme. In the meantime, however, perhaps you would, as in the other two cases, be good enough first to have the draft examined by interested Departments and in due course let me have any observations which may be offered. One matter on which I am not too clear is this: the Deed is expressed to be entered into between the sultan in exercise of his powers as head of the Government of Muscat and Oman and I am wondering to wnat extent it could be considered binding on his successors. Possibly it may be regarded as a matter of little moment and, perhaps from the political aspect, undesirable to suggest any amendment, but is it not just possible that the Deed, as drawn, might be capable of repudiation? enc/ H.

The radio station in question is, we assume, the one installed and operated under the direction of the Government of India (acting on behalf of the Air j inis try) by the . O.A.C. at Salalah (on the Karachi-Aden reserve route) as an emergency rad; and for coinmunieating with our aircraft if and when required. In view of the concessions enjoyed by Cable and Tireless in the } uscat area, we have reminded the Corporation that the traffic they handle should be restricted to messages necessary to ensure the safety of air navigation and the regularity of air traffic.

I snail be grateful, tnerefore, to have your assurance tnat any licence granted 'u ill be subject to those restrictions and that there will be no encroachment upon our field of comm- unications, We had written to the Political Agent, Muscat oh the above subject, but he replied that although he understood unoff icially that the British Overseas Airways Corporation Wirelees in Dhofar will be fully occupied vita their aircraft traffic and do not contemplate taking commercial messages, he could notJ give the assurance asked for as the constructional operations at Dhofar were being carried out under the direction of the Government of India.

DEPt 1/OCT 941I M In fairness to ourselves, we should like to point out tha^prompt replies to enquiries and despatch of orders are not always possible. 1. Letters often take anything from one to ten days to come from different parts of the country, and sometimes as long to return. These delays vary from day to day. 2. Quite a percentage of letters and parcels never arrive. 3. Due to rises in prices, and the necessity of informing customers ^ of this before despatching an order, and to our inability to supply many items, our correspondence is increased tenfold. It is impossible in these times to obtain experienced personnel to handle this satisfactorily, and a delay of several days might be encountered. 4. We often receive enquiries asking if a particular item is in stock. On replying in the affirmative, an order is placed. By the time the order is received, the item is not available, and it is unfortunately seldom that fresh supphes are immediately available. 5. Manufacturers from whom we purchase various parts are unable to keep to delivery dates. This throws our own schedule out, and we in turn are unable to keep our promise. 6. Our skilled staff is sadly depleted, and we are endeavouring to use new blood. This means considerably more supervision and checking, to avoid mistakes which we flatter ourselves are very infrequent. 7. We are also doing our share of War work, and this, of course, must have first consideration. Please be assured that we are all working much harder than ever to keep things running, and that we shall do everything possible to satisfy all old and new friends. pp. PREMIER RADIO COMPANY, B.

I am requested to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter of the j.st instant (Ref.P.Z. j. 109/39) on the subject of n^y Company’s recent proposal to instal wireless at Muscat. From a letter addressed by the Manager of the Muscat Branch to the Company’s Divisional Manager at Karachi, it is learned that the former has already been advised by the Political Agent of the Sultan's verbal agreement to a Wireless Station being erected. It is also understood, however, that the Political Agent is endeavouring to obtain on the Company's behalf a confirmatory letter from His Highness. It is not known whether the Sultan's intention is to issue merely a letter of authority to instal wireless or to put tne matter on a more formal basis by the issue of an actual licence. It is considered that, of these alternatives, the latter would be preferable providing no undue restrictions or obligations were imposed on the Company thereby.

SiSO/x'/PJj. Dear i&gt;a’. Gibson, Ay«- 3012 f3%i I thank you for your ietxer of the 5th CABLES AT IviUSQAT ultimo (Reference P.Z.3013/38) concerning the Sultan of Muscat's reguest for an annual payment in con sideration of the landing in his territory of tue Company's cables, upon consideration of which I suouid like to make the following further ooservations. Firstly, I confirm that, with the exception of Newfoundland which is a special case at present receiving consideration and tnose instances cited in ny letter of the 2nd December last concerning the cables landing in the Dominions and Colonies, no landing fees whatever are paid by the Company throughout the rest of its system. Gibson, Esq., lia Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.One point to which I should like to be allowed to draw particular attention in considering the present request is the fact that, leaving entirely out of account the heavy cost of maintenance of the cables involved, the expenses entailed in maintaining the Muscat branch are alone almost three times the estimated value to the Company of traffic emanating from this source. I mention this because, on referring to the Sultan's letter of the 27th &amp;iay last year to Inajor Watts, the British Consul, I see that he stated that 'it (the cable) now belongs to a Company who run it for profit'. It may also be mentioned that in the e^rly days of submarine telegraphy it was the practice for the Company to receive a subsidy from the places benefiting from telegraphic connection with the outside world rather than to pay a consideration for so doing. Moreover, in taking over the Persian Gulf system from the British Government, the Company assumed that it would enjoy the rights and facilities afforded to the former owners, and since, as I understand, no payment was made by the British Government in respect of the cable prior to its being taken over by my Company,it is hoped that the Government will ^ive the Company its fullest support when the Sultan pursues the matter as, it is understood, he intends to do upon his return to Luscat. In the ii^ht of the above remarks, the annual deficit at this brancn in particular, you will readily appreciate that the Company is averse to paying the Sultan anything; for the right in question, although, as stated in previous correspondence, it would not ooject to a nominal amount as is paid in the case of the Dominions and Colonies. On the assumption that his highness will be agreeable, upon consideration of ail the circumstances of the case, to accept a consideration of say, £1 for each cable landed at this branch, I enclose a draft of a proposed form of licence to cover the landings for a term of fifty years from the beginning of this year. As you will see the grantor has in this draft been termed the Government of the Sultanate of Oman but, prior to submitting it to the Sultan, you will no doubt oe good enough to introduce any amendments you may consider desirable in the general wording of the document.

The Political Agent explained that the matter had been referred to the Resident at Bushire who in turn had forwarded it to the India Office. Secretary said tliat he had no information on the subject, and in any case it was a matter primarily for His Majesty’s Government to decide. Secretary asked the Sultan incidentally what he considered would be a fair remuneration for the use of his territory.

We would refer to Mr. Clauson*s letter to Captain Lawson of the 25th September last (Reference PZ.6016/57) and to the conversation which he had with you and Sir Trenchard Powle on the 21st October on the subject of the Sultan of Muscat's request for an annual payment in respect of the cables landing in his territory. He has, I understand, already explained to you that the question of landing rights, etc., in the Gulf has recently been under consideration here; hence the delay in the present instance which, it is hoped, has caused you no inconvenience* It is quite probable that this request has arisen as the result of the diversion of the Jask end of B£ 8 b. POL. the Karachi cable into Muscat in 1935, although HisHighness^ approval was previously sought and conveyed to us, it will be recalled, in Mr, Clauson's letter of the 12th September 1935. For the right to land cables at other places throughout its system, the Company generally speaking pays only a nominal consideration, e.g. for those stations which fall within the control of the Colonial Office an annual fee of £1. per cable is charged, whilst, in the case of Aden, Bombay, Karachi and Madras, a licence fee of Rs. 10 per annum is payable, irrespective of the number of cables. There is also the question of Customs Duties paid on the apparatus and stores used at the cable station* During the past year a considerable amount of apparatus has been imported into Muscat in order to improve the system and as a result, we have, unlike our predecessors, the Indo- European Telegraph Department, been paying Customs Duties at that place. We are not prepared to dispute His Highness's right to collect such dues on a reasonable basis although we consider that, in our position as successors to the Department, we should continue to be accorded the same privileges as were foraierly enjoyed by the Department. This we feel, applies equally well to the licence question. However, if His Highness would be satisfied with a nominalfee, in the stune way as is paid for similar rights in the Dominions and Colonies, etc., we would not object to such payment, nor to the payment of Customs Duties on a reasonable basis, but, in return, we should be glad if His Highness would grant a formal licence covering a period of 25 years. We would be pleased to prepare the draft of such a licence for submission to His Highness if this course is considered desirable* We should like to take advantage of this opportunity also to mention the question of our position in Fao. This was one of the cable stations included in the Gulf assets transferred to the Company from the Indo Department, at the time, as you know, when Iraq was a Mandated Territory. Chiefly for this reason, the question of a licence in respect of the cable was not pursued but, since this country has now become an Independent State, it occurs to us that, strictly speaking, our position there should be regularised. In the circumstances, we should, therefore, be obliged if, at your convenience, you would be good enough to favour us with your opinion as to what steps, if apy, might now be taken in the matter of seeking a formal licence for the cable landing in this territory.Telephone Number TEMple bar 1222. • /f/ry&gt;, 4/1 //s- 'EMPIREGRAM.

Request of the Sultan of Muscat for payment from Cable &amp; Wireless for the use of his territory traversed by the Company’s cables (I have taken a copy of this note for Bushire files.) —_ c Mr. Clauson. % In view of the correspondence now before me I have somewhat revised the views expressed in’my memorandum No.499-3 of the 25th June, P.Z.4376/37. 2. I am still of opinion that the Sultan technically is due rent from the Company and that appears to be the general view of the other authorities concerned. On the other hand, as between His Majesty’s (Government and the Company, the question of rent would seem to put the former in a somewhat awkward position, vide paragraph 2 of the Secretary, E.&amp; 0. Department’s note of the 17th September, P.Z.60/6/37. The Imperial Communication's Advisory Committee refer to the same point, vide paragraph * 1 * * * 3 of their letter of the 14th September. 3. It is true that in certain cases (the Azores one quoted in G. P. 0. letter of the 10th September,P.Z. 6046/37 and the annual royalty of Rs.8,000 referred to in paragraph 2 of E. &amp; 0. note of the 17th September) substantial payments have been made for the use of territory traversed by foreign cables. At the same time. the actual position in Muscat is that for all practical purposes that State is under our protection and that the cable is largely used by the Political Agent there in the interest of the Sultan and his Government, both in this connection and in others. During the last five years or so for instance we have come to the assistance of theSultan on two important occasions against rebellious Sheikhs in his territory. On one occasion we actually used aimed force (at Khassab) and on the other, mobilised sloops and aircraft (at Sur) the threat of which was sufficient. We would not have been able to do this unless there had been telegraphic communication with the outside world. I think this argument, together with the precedent of Rs.10 rent paid by the Government of India to the Company for landing at Karachi ( vide paragraph 2 of E. &amp; 0. note of the 17th September) and any others of a similar nature which could be dug up, . t #5 would carry weight with the Sultan and might induce him to be content with a nominal rent annually. This would presumably satisfy the Company, ( vide the last paragraph of Imperial Communication’s Advisory Committee’s letter of the 14th September). 4. I suggest that the next step might be to inform the Company of the Sultan’s request and see v/hat their reaction is, after which I shall be glad to discuss the matter with them as suggested by you in your note of the 11th September, P.Z.6046/37. After that the matter might be taken up with the Sultan on the lines indicated in my paragraph 3 above.r memorandum and am reasonably satisfied that they do not mention the point, though, as you probably know, they are very voluminous and complicated. Moreover, I am informed that a great deal of the preliminary discussion of the details was carried on orally with the Company by Sir William McLintock on our behalf and no record of such discussions appears to have been kept here. In these circumstances I think it would be safe to assume that the question of the landing rights at Muscat was never discussed with the Company unless and until they can show that it was. . — , The G.P.0, letter, although somewhat non-committal, increases my doubts as to whether His Majesty’s Government can pass the Sultan’s demand on to the Company without a qualm. It could, I think, be argued that although this point was overlooKed it was the intention of the agreement to hand over the Gulf Cables with all their assets and that we are therefore under a moral right to persuade the Sultan to allow the status quo to continue, the more so as the Company works at a loss in the Gulf generally, and more particularly I expect on the cable to Muscat (which is a branch line from Jask and not the main Gulf cable as I inaccurately stated in my note of August 26). You will observe that in paragraph 6 of the memorandum, His Majesty’s Governmen promised to secure certain rights from the Persian * Government and it could well be argued that the present case would have been dealt with in the same way had it come to light. In putting the matter to the Sultan no ft V -ngj f-.lv* 1 (Fwa( ' ccJlA tfV' (i^ (rx+A** doubt play could be made the fact that the Company earns a loss over the JasK-Muscat section (if indeed that is the case) and that the Government of India only extract a nominal rental of Rs. 10 per annum for landing at (1063 WtMinute Paper Department Karachi. (This was, of course, part of the general settlement and cannot strictly he taken in isolation, hut it would perhaps do for a debating point.) On the other hand^ww^ there are certainly precedents of which the Sultan may he aware^such as the Azores case quoted hy the G.P.0. for a substantial payment in cases such as this* I am afraid the Sultan may have in mind the annual royalty of 3&gt;000 tomans (8,000 rupee paid to Persia from 1868 for the right to use the Jask- Gwadur cable which v/as the property of the Government of India hut lay in Persian territory. You will remember that this royalty was only abandoned by the Persians as a set-off for the handing over of the I.S.T assets in Persia in the negotiations leading up to the agreement of the l?th February, 1932. I assume, though it does not seem to be absolutely clear, that the memorandum places Gable and Wireless under an obligation, whatever happens, to run the Jask-Muscat branch line. If this is not so, and they were threatening to close it down, the Sultan would presumably change his mind quickly enough. The cable is also no doubt of value to the Government of India who, I think, run the Post Office in Muscat. On the whole I think the line suggested in Mr. Clauson’s note of 11th September would probably be best, though I am inclined to think it would be well to make sure orally from the Treasury (Mr. Waterfield) that they have no direct interest in this matter. Subject to anything they or Sir T. Fov/le may say, we might then approach the Company rather tentatively^withTelephone No. . Whitkham. 1234. In any reply please quote Regd.

I wrote on the same subject to Baraford and I now enclose a copy of his reply to me. i I agree with him that no action should be taken until the Company has had an opportunity of furnishing its observations on the position and I doubt if it is worth while for the Departraents concerned to attempt to reach a decision on policy until we hear what the Company has to say. But of course I have no wish to deter you from advising the India Office of your views at this stage if you prefer to do so. I am sending a copy of this letter and the enclosure to Clauson. Yours sincerely. W. Phillips Ksq., C.wi.vi., General Post Office.COPY. IMPERIAL COMMUNICATIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE, KLECTRA HOUSE, VICTORIA EMBANKMENT, LONDON, .C.2. 14th September, 1937, My dear Waterfield, I have your letter of the 9th September, No. E.23672/ 069, on the question of payment by Cable and Wireless Ltd. for telegraph facilities at Muscat. The Company undertook to maintain cable and wireless communications in the Persian Qulf on the termination of the Cis-Indian Joint Purse, and there is no doubt that their business in this quarter is of more importance on grounds of general British policy than anything else. It was hoped that the recent reorganisation would make the business break even, but previously it was run at a loss,. Taken by itself, I do not suppose that the Muscat station pays its way. There is, however, something to be said for the Sultan’s claim for payment. There are precedents for a charge by Administrations for the landing of caoles in their territory? for example, the case of Nevfoundland. It is also common practice to charge a fee for the Licence under which telegraph Companies operate in a particular territory, though I think that, as in the case of the United Kingdom Licence of Cable and Wireless Ltd., this fee is generally nominal. It is also usual for an Administration to impose a terminal tax on incoming and outgoing ■ traffic, and such chargee are imposed in some cases where there are no services rendered by the Administration in respect of collection and delivery of traffic. A.P. Waterfield Esq. OnOn the other hand, it is, no doubt, to the advantage of Muscat to have the Company’s service, and it is doubtful whether we should put it in the Sultan’s power to make the Company pay out any considerable sum for rendering this service. Moreover, the Company speak of themselves in the correspondence (for example, in their letter of the 18th June, 19^, to the India Office) as being in the position of Agents to His Majesty’s Government in regard to communications in the Fereian Gulf. They may consequently claim that either on grounds of law or equity they should, as far as possible, be put in the same position as the Government was previously in operating the service; and it appears from the Resident’s * memorandum of the 25th June, 1937, that the Government has the right to operate the telegraph service in Muscat without payment The terms of the Permit under which the Company now operates in Muscat (referred to in the Company's letter quoted above) may have some bearing on this point. On the whole, therefore, I suggest that the Government should do what it can to protect the Company from making any -ay^ents in Muscat; or, alternatively, to try to confine this payment to a nominal sum. I presume that, in any case, no action will be taken till the Company has had an opportunity of furnishing its observations on the position. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) E. St.J.

L Dear Clauson, I am replying to your letter of the 28th of August to Weston who retired a few months ago. In this country certain telegraph companies are licensed to land cables on the foreshore and the licences include a clause requiring the payment to the Board of Trade of a nominal rental for the landing facility. This is usually fixed at £1 a year for each cable and the relative clause in the main licence to Cable and Wireless Ltd., which covers ten cables landed in Great Britain, reads as follows 'The Company will during the term pay to the Assistant Secretary of the Finance Department of the Board oi Trade in London or to such other person as the Board of Trade may direct on the 1st day of April in each year of the term the sum of £10 sterling in respect of the Cables free of all deductions on account of present or future landlords' or tenants’ taxes rates or impositions.' The rental of 10 rupees paid to the Indian Government by the Company in respect of telegraph cables to the Persian Gulf is a similar payment (your letter F. &amp; 0« 7154/30 of 20 September 1930). It is evidently not a payment of this type that the Sultan of Muscat has in mind./ / U*u /v y/u) Out/ fa du^ £ fa Ct+Hjki«j Af 4u GUA4m /Jvu du* J hs1- AM 'fa fa+SUy / fkMK ei**K+ Ax-U 4 ^ yi£k&amp;*fU CcwaJXa* tisiK, &amp;£*(■* I ti 71* Cc&amp;J ( ^ itU^^ p*J.A ^ -L £***£**. — (c fyd &amp;vW’.'U*, I'X&amp;acr A* 'v °^ ■ c^| ^ : Phere are cases in which substantial charges are made to Telegraph Companies for the right to use territory as a landing point for cables. The Portuguese draw a considerable revenue of this kind from Telegraph Companies whose cables land in the Azores, those islands being well situated for repeater stations on the transatlantic cables and for the exchange of traffic between the various routes. tfe do not know the value of the telegraph traffic of Muscat; but it seems unlikely that a Telegraph Company would normally be willing to pay anything but a nominal fee for the right to land a cable there. You will remember that Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. took over the Persian Gulf cables as part of a bargain which involved the payment of £i50,000 by the Company to the Secretary of State for Iniia. We are not familiar with the details of the negotiations but even if the Company were not promised support in retaining the landing rights existing at the time of the transfer, we should hesitate to accept the opinion of the PoliticalAggnt at Muscat that it is only reasonable that the Company should pay for the use of Muscat territory.— a U Yours sincerely, M.J.
