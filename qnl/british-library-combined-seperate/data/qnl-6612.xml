The next letter, from Roland Tennyson Peel, Secretary for the Political Department in the India Office, complains that this telegram repeated information which his office had already received, and that this repetition could 'compromise the intelligence source'. The final letter in the file (folio 2), from Olaf Kirkpatrick Caroe in the Government of India External Affairs Department, apologises for the repetition and any trouble caused. The file was previously marked secret.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002bc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
