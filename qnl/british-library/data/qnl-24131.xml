Plans for the 1949 British Industries Fair are well advanced; they began before the 1948 event closed its doors. Already application forms for space have been despatched to all previous exhibitors and other interested firms. These are returnable by August 7 and enquiries already to hand indicate that the demand will be exceptionally heavy. Last year more than 600 late applicants could not be accommodated. As already announced the B.I.F.will be held in London and Birmingham from May 2 - May 13, 1949. In 1949, as at previous Fairs, certain trade associations are co-operating with the Export Promo tion Department in the arranging of uniform schemes of presentation. Participation in these special arrange ments is not confined to association members and exhi bitors may wish to take advantage of this and so secure full benefit from the co-ordinated displays. Interested manufacturers who have not received an application form should apply immediately to either the Export Promotion Department (Exhibitions Branch), 27, Old Queen Street, London, S.W.l, or to the Bir mingham Chamber of Commerce, 96, New Street,Birmingham.

In Sir Trenchard*s personal opinion it is to the advantage of the Shaikh for Bahrain to be kept as much as possible before the British public and this is one *ay in which this object can be achieved. Sir Irene hard thinks that the Bahrain Government can well afford the initial cost of the Court and the small annual rental, though that is of course a matter entirely for them to decide. Will you please consult the Bahrain Government, possibly informally in the first instance, and let me know if they are prepared to agree to the proposal. ■ $D.O. No The 22nd December 1937* Please refer to your demi-official letter No. 2491/10/13 undated in regard to the proposed Bahrain Islands’ 'Court' at the Imperial Institute. 2* I have discussed this matter vrith Belgrave and we are some doubt whether the expenditure is justifiable. Though we venture to ag ee with Sir Tren- chard’s opinion that it is desirable to keep the Shaikh of Bahrain before the eye of the public at home» both Belgrave and I very much doubt if a Court at the Imperial Institute will have this effect, since so far as our experience goes it is not a particularly popular resort. Unless, therefore, there is good reason to think that the Imperial Institute is likely to gain popularity in the near future, I should feel some hesitation in ur ging Kis Highness the Shaikh to revise the decision which he has already reached on Belgrave*s advice.

Publicity Matter. Eor the last two years supplies of British Industries Pair publicity literature have been issued to overseas officers on the basis of former requirements, but instances have occurred where these supplies have been found to be inadequate and additional orders have occasionally had to be placed at relatively higher prices than the basic figures at which the original contracts have been concluded. In order to avoid so far as may be practicable the extra expense involved in requisitioning these additional supplies, it would be appreciated if overseas officers would consider carefully the quantities necessary to enable them to carry out effectively their respective publicity campaigns and notify the Department of their requirements at the earliest possible moment. A requisition form for this purpose is attached. In the event of the return not being received by the date by which it is imperative that the orders for the literature must be put in hand, the quantities of each type of material sent in connection with the 1938 Pair will be repeated for the forthcoming Pair.

Exhibits of local industries such as Petroleum - the Pearl Industry - the Date Industry - Leather - Arts and Crafts would, if these proposals are approved, be sent to us for exhibition in a show-case together with photographs and a representation of the Bahrain State flag. I gather from your letter under reply that funds could not be sanctioned for this scheme in 1938. I do not therefore repeat my suggestion that a diorama of Bahrain should be included at a cost of £ 150. Instead I suggest a capital sum of £ 50 for the erection and fitting out of the show-case, together with an annual grant of £ 50 for maintenance, lighting and for keeping the exhibits and labels up to date. In other words, the cost during the first year would be £ 100 of which £ 50 would represent an annual maintenance charge to be repeated in subsequent years. Will you kindly lay these suggestions before the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and let me know whether the Government of Bahrain would be willing to approve the expenditure ? I enclose a leaflet explaining and illustrating the work of our Exhibition Galleries. It is proposed to inaugurate the Bahrain Court close to the Aden Court in our East Gallery. Yours faithfully Sd.

THE EXHIBITION GALLERIES— STORIES AND SCENES OF THE EMPIRE The four Exhibition Galleries of the Imperial Institute are a magnificent centre in which to study interesting facts about the Overseas Empire. Some of these facts are shown in pictures, some as connected stories; some in the form of dioramas and lighted transparencies; some as models and specimens— not just dull exhibits in jars, but exhibits which come alive and link up with other exhibits to tell the story of the Overseas Empire. Each Gallery is divided into large and small Courts, and each Court represents one of the countries of the Overseas Empire. Thus India, Burma and Ceylon are to be found in the East Gallery; the Sudan and Somaliland, the Rhodesias, East African Colonies, the Union of South Africa, the West African and Mediterranean Colonies in the North Gallery; Canada occupies the whole of the West Gallery; whilst the South Gallery accommodates Newfoundland, the West Indies and Falkland Islands, New Zealand, Fiji and the Pacific group, Australia, Hong Kong, Borneo and Malaya. The “story” of each country is centred on a relief-map showing its natural physical features and its relationship with neighbouring countries. The life of the people, their work and play, arts and crafts, are shown by means of window or electric light transparencies, handicrafts, specimens, etc. Nearly every Court has its own dioramas which are coloured and lighted modelsillustrating wild life and scenery, farmers and farming, fruit orchards, forests and timber, and industries—rubber, tin, cotton, whaling and so on. But the industries may also be studied in serial form, from the mine or forest or plantation to the final food or manufacture as we know them in this country. Finally, a series of statuettes of the great Empire-builders of the past runs through all the Galleries. Each statuette is just one-half of life size. Cabot and Cook, Vancouver and Wolfe, Raleigh, Rhodes and Livingstone, Raffles and Clive—fifteen in all—each is shown in his proper Court and his story is told in a printed label attached to the pedestal on which he stands. The Galleries are open to the public every weekday afternoon from 2 to 4.30 p.m.; in the Cinema Empire films may be seen from 3.30 to 4.15 p.m. School parties may come in the mornings too, from 10 a.m., by special anliigement, and Guide Lecturers are available if required. There is no charge for admission to the Galleries and Cinema or for the services of the Guide Lecturers. Canteen facilities also exist. II. THE LIBRARY- GENERAL EMPIRE SECTION The Library of the Imperial Institute comprises many publications of the Overseas Empire, especially those which relate to agriculture, forestry, mining, etc. In addition, a “General Empire” section of the Library is devoted to ‘recent books dealing with the British Empire as a whole; and this should prove of much use to all, whether adults or juveniles, who wish to study the history, geography, and political and economic progress of the Empire.. &lt;y* No.4086-29/28.

R. E. J. Moore. Export Promotion Department, Board op Trade, 35 Old Queen Street, S.W.l. August, 1947. Note .—This circular memorandum has been sent in duplicate to :— (1) All H.M. Trade Commissioner Posts. (2) All Commercial Diplomatic Posts. (3) All Superintending Consular Posts. (4) All Salaried Consular Posts. (5) All Imperial Trade Correspondents. MEMORANDUM Purpose of the British Industries Fair, 1948 The British Industries hair, 1948, will be held primarily for the development of export trade. 1. —Dates and Venues. The Fair will open in London, at Earl’s Court and Olympia, and in Birmingham, at Castle Bromwich, on Monday, 3rd May, and will close on Friday, 14th May. The trades which normally participate are shown in Appendix A. Ihe lighter industries will exhibit in London while the Engineering and Hardware Section will be organised, as usual, by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce in close collaboration with the Department. Exact location of each trade section will be notified to all posts as soon as layout and plans are complete. Hours of admission will be : —London, Daily, 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Birmingham, 10 a.m. to ,6-p.m. The Fair will not be open on Sunday. 2. — Statistics of the previous Fair (ig4j). 1947 Fair.

The success of the Fair will largely depend on the effects of publicity in attracting trade buyers. Officers are therefore earnestly requested to make special endeavours to obtain as much publicity as possible. To assist in co-operation between the Department and overseas officers details are given below of the methods by which the Department will initiate the publicity campaign and will provide material for publication and distribution in all territories. It is hoped that officers will explore every means of supplementing this material by such additional gratis publicity as may be possible.2 4. —Press Advertising. It is anticipated that a grant fronl public funds will be made available, as for the 1947 Fair, for the purchase of paid advertisement space in the press of most overseas countries. SCHEDULES.— A suggested list of media is being prepared in consultation with the Central Office of Information ; British Export Trades Advertising Corporation, and the appointed advertising agents. The following procedure has also been agreed with all interested Departments :—The proposed list of media will be forwarded to overseas officers concerned at the earliest possible moment, so that their comments and advice may be sent by cable or airmail for incorporation in the final schedule. As amendments can only be incorporated within the limits of funds available it would be of great assistance if priority is indicated for those alterations which are considered most important. COPY.— English proofs of the copy for the advertisement together with a translated version submitted by the advertising agents will be sent to certain officers for their comments. It is hoped that the enclosure of a suggested translation may simplify the work of correction. If time permits, after the above has been returned to the Department, a second proof will be forwarded for final approval of the translated copy. 5. — Orders, Matrices, Etc. It is considered necessary that final distribution of orders for advertising space, matrices, etc., should be made direct from U.K. to the publishing houses irt each territory or in many instances to their agents in London, with a consequent saving of hard currencies. Exceptional circumstances may justify other procedure but it is emphasised that simplicity of administration is essential. 6 . —C entralisation. Officers will appreciate the need for centralising in order to co-ordinate world publicitv, and also the need for a uniform and direct procedure in the placing of orders, to ensure the control of expenditure as required by the Treasury. 7. —Display Material, Etc. It is intended to produce the following, in several languages where practicable. (a) Poster for distribution and display under local arrangements with banks, shipping companies, railways, etc. (b) Showcards, folders, etc., distribution as above. Folders may possibly be circulated by British firms with their correspondence. (c) Poster Stamp. Intended for use on officers’ outgoing correspondence and similarly by local British firms, Chambers of Commerce, etc. The stamp should be fixed to the letter rather than the envelope which is not normally seen by the heads of firms. {d) Menu cards. For local distribution as acceptable in hotels and clubs. (e) Special Supplements, etc. Bulk supply will be made available if quantities permit after distribution by direct mail. (/) Invitation cards. Bulk supply will be distributed to overseas officers. 8 . — Production and Delivery. It is necessary to emphasise that the Department is aware of the time required for distribution of this material, and that every effort will be made to secure delivery well in advance of the vital period for display, according to distance from U.K. Printing delays in U.K. are not yet reduced, and the period required in transit cannot always be accurately estimated. Packages will be marked according to contents and addressed with a view to exemption from customs duties. 9. — Quantities. Officers are requested to return by air mail, the requisition form which is enclosed with this memorandum. It is intended that this requisition should be used as a guide, and supplies will be despatched in proportion to the paper available. Showcards, posters, etc., should be very closely estimated according to facilities obtained for free display. The Department is again approaching the headquarters in this country of British Banks, Insurance companies, etc., requesting them to ask the managers of their overseas branches to co operate with officers in making the Fair known. A list of the organisations which have agreed to co-operate in this way will be forwarded in due course. Limited distribution may be made direct from the Department only in response to late requests by agents in U.K. of overseas organisations. All propaganda material, which may be used in addition to the above, should give prominence to the initials BIF and the key design which is the emblem of the Fair. It is intended that information officers should receive with other material for editorial publicity, photographic reproductions of the designs employed for 1948-. The key emblem will be prominent in the poster and poster stamp.10. — Direct Mail Publicity. As in previous years a series of letters with enclosures will be addressed to business men in most territories according to lists provided by officers overseas and trade organisations in U.K. These letters will be despatched on a schedule based on the estimated travelling time from each country to U.K. For the 1948 Fair three letters will be mailed enclosing a reply card and folder, a brochure, and an invitation card. Certain posts will be requested to assist in the work of the translation of this material and will receive advance copies of the items enclosed. Additional supplies of the brochure will not be available for delivery in bulk to Overseas Officers. 11. — Catalogue. It is again proposed to publish, though on a reduced scale, an advance edition of the catalogue for the London section of the Fair. This edition will have a translated index and will be available about six weeks before the Fair, for despatch to those officers who may receive them in time for distribution before buyers leave for England. Copies will also be posted direct, by the Department to overseas buyers on request. 12. — Editorial Publicity. A considerable development of editorial publicity is intended to support the increased propaganda for post-war Fairs. It is appreciated that the success of this effort must vary according to local circumstances, timing and the suitability of the material provided. Results for the 1947 Fair were satisfactory in many areas and it is expected that the Department may be able to provide improved service which will ena!ble officers to obtain even wider publicity in 1948. The following notes, which indicate the methods by which material is obtained and transmitted, may be of particular interest to Information Officers. All material originates from this Department where a centralised BIF publicity section is integrated with the Overseas Information Division of the Board of Trade. This section is in close liaison with the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, etc., so that information is first passed to Central Office of Information and subsequently transmitted in various services on a co ordinated plan. All Information Departments concerned are therefore able to comment on the basic material, for editorial publicity, by direct reference to this office for policy, or to Central Office of Information for service. , 13. — Press Notices. Press notices are published by the publicity section with increasing frequency as the Fair approaches, and are distributed to all services of the Central Office of Information, and to departments concerned, as well as to U.K. press, overseas correspondents, and B.B.C. according to suitability. A copy of such notices will also be mailed direct to Commercial Diplomatic Officers, Trade Commissioners and main Consular posts to assist in a “ build-up ' of information and for publication where possible. To meet enquiries these notices may include the name of a manufacturer. 14. — Information Officers. Information officers will normally receive all material for publication through the usual channels*- and this will include the substance of material mailed to other officers for information as noted above.. 15. — Timing. The first object of editorial publicity must be to attract attention to the Fair in time for intending visitors to make travel arrangements. It is understood that for this purpose many information officers would require suitable material as much as five months in advance. This presents a difficulty inherent in the organisation of the Fair, since, apart from some general information all details depend on the development of administrative preparations. Advance news items of journalistic value can only be obtained from the more co-operative exhibitors and trade associations when they have decided on their exhibits. This is rarely possible until several weeks after allocation of space. At the earliest, in 1948, it may be possible to announce the acceptance of exhibitors, and space allotted, about four months before the Fair. There may, therefore, be only twelve effective weeks for editorial publicity, but every effort will be made to provide some material which would enable officers to obtain the earlier press publicity which is so important. 16. — Overseas Correspondents. Correspondents will be interviewed by the Department. It may be possible in some cases to suggest to the head offices overseas that their representatives in U.K. should obtain advance information to ensure timing of publication according to the requirements of local trade buyers. 17. — Broadcasts. Arrangements will be made for advance propaganda by the B.B.C. in a maximum number of overseas services. It is hoped that officers may obtain additional publicity on local broadcast systems.18. — Films. It is unlikely that a prepared feature can be distributed but news films will be arranged, as early as possible, for normal circulation and the Central Office of Information may use available material for a “ trailer.” 19. — Photographs. It will be obvious that only a limited number of suitable exhibits can be photographed in advance of the B.I.F. but constant efforts will be made to provide more pictures at an earlier date than in 20. —Editorial Publicity in 194 J. Many visitors stated that they had been first informed of the Fair by editorial publicity. Over seas press cuttings are generally difficult to obtain and many months elapse before an estimate can be made of the success of the methods employed. The fuel crisis in 1947 had a marked effect in delaying the issue of material and in this respect an improvement can be expected in 1948. In addition it would be of great value if information officers are able to inform their departments of progress and to submit minimum reports, sufficient to contribute to a more effective campaign in future. 21. —Concessions to Buyers. It is not possible in post-war circumstances to offer travel and other facilities such as were available in 1939. 1 he value of these facilities is fully appreciated and the Department will seek to secure them again as soon as conditions are sufficiently improved. The early reservation of accommodation through the established agencies is of the utmost importance. Details of travel concessions obtained for 1948 will be circulated later. Free Passport Visas. It is anticipated that this facility will again be granted to buyers visiting the Fair. 22. —General Appeal to Buyers. The special work of the overseas officers by speeches, interviews, broadcasts and correspondence in stimulating interest in the hair in their territories, and encouraging buyers to visit the Fair, is of great importance and has been attended by successful results. With a view to increasing the value of the B.I.F. for the more competitive years ahead it is desired that this special work should be renewed and where possible intensified and varied. Officers will be aware of other important buyers of the particular class of goods included in trade schedules of the Fair, and they may wish to pay special attention to the departmental stores which, in many countries, are large buyers of products shown. It is suggested that those firms which canno.t arrange to send buyers to the Fair may be persuaded to instruct agents in the U.K. to visit the Fair on their behalf.'

Hotel Accommodation for Overseas Buyers - B.I.F, 1948 Enquiries have been received by the Reception Branch from time to time on the above subjects and a copy of two relevant memoranda are enclosed for background information and assistance in replying to queries on these points. The Board of Tra.de, Export Promotion Department, 35, Old Queen Street, London, S. w. 1. 14th January, 1948. Circulated to: Trade Commissioners, Commercial Diplomatic Officers. Superintending Consular Posts. / i 13 - 13/1A8BRITISH INDUSTRIES Fi.IR 194-8 ( 3rd - 14th r.^Y ). HOTEL ii-GC OLii.iOD^T ION FOR G^TRSE^S BUYERS Overseas Buyers to the British Industries Fair are strongly urged in their own interests to book their hotel accoixiodation in London and/or Birninghan and their return passages prior to leaving for the United Kingdom. This my be effected either through their United Kingdom connections or through any recognised travel agency. Should their efforts prove unavailing, the Reception Branch of the Department is prepared, in an emergency, to endeavour to assist in securing hotel accommodation in London provided that it is given the full names of the overseas buyers the date of arrival in the United Kingdom and the inclusive dates for which the reservation is required. As much prior notice as is possible should be given. It should, hov/ever, be fully understood that the onus for securing hotel accommodation for overseas buyers must be a matter for the recognised travel agencies and only when those concerns are unable to assist should recourse be made to the Reception Branch. For obvious reasons while the Reception Branch will use its best endeavours to secure suitable accommodation this service cannot be allov/ed to compete with the travel agencies. ' It should also be pointed out that it will be very unlikely that the • Reception Branch will be able to secure reservations in the principal and better known first cLass hotels and, although every endeavour will be made to satisfy overseas buyers, no responsibility, financial or otherwise, can be accepted in regard to the accorxiodation booked on behalf of applicants. In regard to hotel reservations in Birmingham applications should be addressed direct to: - The Accorxiodation Officer, British Industries Fair, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, 95, New Street, Birmingham, 2. England. Information regarding the securing of Ration Cards or Ration Books and Identity Cards, petrol allowances, &amp;o., may be obtained on enquiry at the Overseas Buyers Club, British Industries Fair, Olympia and Earls Court, ox- at the Reception Branch at the Department. 9 - 16/12/47.PETROL iiLLOViuTCLL TOR O’vLROL^S BUBIiMLSS VISITORS As a result of enquiries received fror.i certain Overseas Officer's, the follovlnfi; note is circulated to all Overseas Officers for their background information only:- The Reception Branch of the Export Promotion Department are prepared to consider and sponsor to the appropriate Regional Petroleum Officer of the Ministry of Duel &amp; Power approved applications from Commercial Visitors from overseas for allowances of petrol, provided of course, that the petrol is used entirely on journeys in the interests of export trade. Petrol granted for these journeys should not be used in the London Area since the above-named Ministry are of the opinion that sufficient public transport is available to meet all x^op.onable needs. The final decision as to whether or not an allowance and how much is granted naturally rests with the Ministry of Fuel and Power. If commercial visitors intend bringing their own cars v/ith them they would be well advised, in the first place, to approach their own National Automobile Association, of which they are no douba Member asking them to arrange with the Automobile Association of Great Britain, with whom their own association are doubtlessly in close contact, for an allowance of petrol and an Internation Circulation Permit to be made available for their Member at his port of disembarkation. This allowance, though small, would probably enable him to reach London, he should then call at this Department and discuss his future requirements with tne Reception Branch. In those cases where overseas buyers are arranging to borrow cars from their business associates in this country, the Reception Branch, before sponsoring the application for petrol, would require a letter from the registered owners stating that such and such a car has been placed at the disposal of the particular buyer with the proviso that the latter must make his own arrangements for the necessary petrol. The overseas buyer would present this letter with a completed form R(M3) 1 (which can be obtained from any Post Office) and the log book of the car to the Reception Branch who would then be in a position to consider the application with a view to censoring it to the appropriate Regional Petroleum Officer. TOURIST OR HOLIDAY VISITORS . In the case of tourist or holiday visitors to this country procedure similar to that for commercial visitors with their own cars should be followed but with this difference that the Automobile Association here will arrange for such an allowance of petrol to cover approximately an average itinerary of 2?0 miles per month for three months only plus an allowance to cover the journey from the port of entry to the furthest destination and back by the direct route. In all these cases the Reception Branch are not in a position to assist.

By Malcolm Logan, M.A. Thirty-three years have passed since a national emergency gave birth to the first British Industries Fair. The history of Britain’s shop window is a story of small beginnings and patient effort, rewarded by achievements that are unique in the annals of industrial showmanship. D URING the coming weeks, thousands of overseas buyers will flock to Britain for what has now become an annual world event—the British Industries Fair. This 1948 edition promises to be at least as large as, and better stocked than, its immediate predecessor. This year, too, will see the visitor in a changed mood. Many of last year’s buyers arrived under the impression that Britain, after six years of war, had burned up her industrial energy, and now lagged in the race for world markets. Those who visited the Fair know what they found. The general reaction to the 1947 B.I.F. was one of astonish ment at the vitality and resilience of British industry. One may prophesy that 1948 will underline that story. The healthy state of our industry, however, is only one side of the B.I.F. picture. Much has and always will depend on the organisation of the Fair itself, and this in turn rests upon a tradition that is more truly national than that of any existing fair of its size in the world. Foreign buyers who travel long distances to visit the B.I.F. may care to know something of this history, how the Fair began, and how it grew into the vast national shop window which draws the world of commerce each year. Early Exhibitions The ancestors of the B.I.F. were a series of exhibitions held in London shortly after the outbreak of the first world war. The exhibits, far from being of British manufacture, were all samples of foreign goods whose import had suddenly ceased through the exigencies of war. At the first of these exhibitions, which were known as “exchange meetings,” manufacturers and shippers inspected some 4,000 specimens of foreign manufacture and then went away to consider the ques tion of home production in these fields. Their ideas were quickly translated into action. A year later, the results of their efforts were on show, this time in an exhibition of all-British goods. Thus in May 1915 the first British Industries Fair was born in the Royal Agricultural Hall in London. Even at this early stage the subsequent features of the B.I.F. were established. First, it was an officially inspired effort to increase British trade. The exhibi tion was confined to goods of home manufacture. Sec ondly, exhibits were confined to the actual manufacturers, which meant that any particular make of article was only displayed once. The success of the Fair was immediate and during its ten-day run some 34,000 visitors flocked to view the wares of 591 exhibitors. The exhibits were in five sections: Fancy goods; jewellery, cutlery, electro plate ; pottery and glassware; toys and games; and stationery, printing, and publishing. The infant B.I.F. had more than proved its worth, and exhibitors pressed the Government to make it a permanent event.f A Specialised Journal for Specialised Buyers The subscription rate for one year is 15s.

TZeteU MebcktotMse No section of British Industry is so well equipped and able to meet the needs of over seas buyers as the Drug and Chemical Trades and the many industries associated therewith. Manufacturers in these trades have greatly enhanced their reputation for quality products during and since the War, and tremendous strides have been made in many directions during the last few years. Buying for “ Drug Trade ” requirements is a highly specialised job, and information about new developments, market trends and novel lines is a prime essential. Specialised buying needs specialised information such as is found in the only British monthly publication published exclusively for overseas buyers of these products. The Chemist and Druggist EXPORT REVIEW provides a monthly resume of concise, accurate and essential information about these markets. Month by month it brings up-to-date news, and is a most reliable guide to available supplies from a variety of sources. This is one of the “ essential ” journals you MUST have if you are to be kept fully posted as to latest developments. Chemist &amp; Drup^ist EXPORT REVIEW Published monthly at 28 ESSEX STREET, STRAND, LONDON, W.C .2Despite the comparatively short annual life of the Fair, ita planning and organisation required, even then, the best part of the twelve months. Within ten days of closing the first plans for a 1916 edition were being eagerly discussed. But as the stringency of war was now making itself felt, the following year’s Fair had to be reduced in size. The Government’s wartime habit of taking over public buildings had left the organ isers with a somewhat limited choice of accommodation. The year 1916 saw the Fair installed among the statuary of the Victoria and Albert Museum, which some decades later was to house another famous trade exhibition— Britain Can Make It. By now, the annual tradition was established, and the following year saw the Fair still housed among the austere beauties of the museum. In this year also, the first satellite appeared, when a subsidiary exhibition, devoted largely to textile pro- ducts, was held in Glasgow. It says a good deal for the tenacity of all concerned that the B.I.F. was held at all in the fourth year of the war. When one considers the conditions under which it was held, their persistence is all the more amazing. By 1918 , troubles had begun in earnest. The museum had been taken over by the military authorities and in their search for accommodation, the organisers were forced to descend from the sublime to the purely utili tarian. We find them, some miles from the heart of London, setting up shop amid an odour of raw hides in a shed at the London Docks. This unusual setting saw, what was for those days, an even more unusual spectacle. Women, still regarded as by far the weaker sex, were to be seen with saws and hammers doing much of the work on the stands. Labour was short; materials were short. The gaunt dock shed allowed a little more floor space and a few more exhibi tors ; but there its advantages ended. The Fair opened in bitter February weather. There was no heating of any sort, and the rudimentary lighting did nothing to add to the gaiety of the surroundings. In addition to attempting a display against this background, the organisers found themselves at war with an army of rats. Cats were hastily recruited, but the situation proved beyond them, until they were rein forced by unofficial hordes of dockside cats who rushed unbidden into the fray. As these latter were battle- scarred veterans of moth-eaten appearance, they added nothing to the tone of the exhibition. The Fair spent two years in its dockside home. In 1919 , the floor space was increased to a little over 80,000 square feet, which was only 8,000 square feet short of its original area in 1915 . Conditions were a little better than in the previous year, and justified a modest official bulletin to the effect that the Fair had done “As well as could be expected.” By now it was becoming used to a nomadic life, and next year, it moved again. At the Crystal Palace . The new site could scarcely have been in greater contrast. The Crystal Palace, which had done duty as a naval training centre, had now been released by the Admiralty. For those who had known the rigours of dockland, it must have seemed like a transition from the pole to the tropics. The work of setting up the exhibition went on beneath acres of shining glass. Stands rose amid the greenery of palms and exotic plants. Daylight flooding through the crystalline dome seemed to spread an infectious cheerfulness, and the tap of hammers and the whistle of the workmen blended with bird song from the aviary. This rather pleasant air of unreality was heightened by the presence of great statues around which the Fair had to be built. Here, a row of exhibits rested against the knees of some impassive Egyptian Pharaoh; and here, the contours of a stand, were surprisingly inter rupted by the bronze legs of a horse. Despite this surrealist atmosphere, there was a cheerful breath of life in the place, and the B.I.F. of 1920 outshone all that it had achieved before. The Birmingham Section Although the Palace had in the meanwhile been moved bodily from Hyde Park to Sydenham, these same surroundings had once witnessed perhaps the most famous industrial exhibition of all time—the Great Exhibition of 1851 . Now, on a floor space of 230,000 square feet they housed no fewer than 1,167 B.I.F. exhibitors. To the original five sections of the first London B.I.F. another five were added. For the first time, drugs, chemicals, scientific and optical instru ments and photographic goods were numbered among the exhibits. Exhibits from the brush industry, which was now engaged in a stiff fight for foreign markets, were also added to the list, with the further addition of furniture and musical instruments. Another innovation was the appearance of heavy industry in the Birmingham section which was held on the aerodrome site at Castle Bromwich, increasing the size of the Fair by an addi tional 85,000 square feet (bringing the total up to four times the 1915 figure) and the number of exhibitors by 625 . From this point, the organisation of the B.I.F. had begun to take something of its present shape. A Board of Trade Committee of Inquiry under the chair manship of the late Sir Frank Warner recommended that the Fair should be run on an annual basis in two main sections, one in Birmingham and the other in London. The Glasgow section was discontinued, while the Birmingham section has since then been held at Castle Bromwich in the vast single floored exhibition building which is now the largest of its kind in the world. For the next eight years, until 1929 , the London section was held in the White City, a large building on the west side of London which had originally been erected for the Franco-British Exhibition at Shepherds Bush. W T ith its housing problems settled, the B.I.F. was faced during the next six years with difficulties of another kind. Trade was on the ebb, and the growing signs of depression were reflected in fewer exhibitors and a decrease in the size of the Fair generally. Pub licity became a matter of importance, and of anxiety, as it now became clear that the average yearly expendi ture of ^ 5,000 was insufficient. Publicity Campaign What should have been the B.I.F.’s tenth anniversary was marked by a break in the annual tradition. In 1925 the London section of the Fair was not held owing to the presence of the vast British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. The pause, however, gave the organisers a chance to tackle the Government on the question of the B.I.F.’s future and their efforts were successful ton The weekly business newspaper for Principals, Managers and Buyers in the Hardware, Metal and Tool Trades Reliable news and sound technical articles are the key-notes of THE IRONMONGER. In addition each issue carries a regular feature introducing new goods, a weekly metal market report with current prices of steel and non-ferrous metals, and other features which provide a first-class service for business men interested in the British aspect of this trade.

The campaign for the 1926 Exhibition was by far the biggest yet attempted. It included a world wide press advertising drive, combined with a broadcast distribution of brochures, circulars and distribution folders, and the dispatch of tens of thousands of follow-up letters to overseas buyers throughout the world. The results were amazing. Despite difficult times, the B.I.F. of 1926 was a striking success which was followed by even more encouraging results in 1927 . Though still behind the 1921 figure, the number of exhibitors and the floor space area were increasing. This year also saw a notable addition, when goods from the British Empire were displayed in a special Empire section. Chemical Exhibits After the lean periods of the early ’twenties, the efforts of the organisers were now rewarded. Publicity had made a remarkable change in 1926 and 1927 . Orders began to increase, and the full result of this was seen by a record expansion of the Fair in 1928 . For the first time since its inception, the exhibiting area increased to a figure of half-a-million square feet and the number of exhibitors was nearly four times the 1915 figure. A new feature was the separate areas for composite exhibits of tobacco, foodstuffs and raw materials from the Dominions. For the first time, a composite section devoted to chemicals made' its appearance, in company with similar sections for foodstuffs, wireless, clothing and textiles. By now the organisers had thrown their net so wide that it was found necessary to print the catalogue in no fewer than nine languages. The modest catalogue of 1915 had appeared in two languages—English and French. While increases in floor space were gratifying signs of expansion, it was found that they were not indispensable factors to business. This was shown when two years later, the London section of the Fair moved to Olympia. Here, there was an actual decrease in available floor space, yet new records were achieved in the attend ance, and in the actual business done. Over 200,000 visitors (from home and overseas) were recorded at Olympia, as compared with 147,000 at the White City in the previous year, while a similar increase occurred in Birmingham. The Key Symbol Despite the approaching shadow of another world trade depression, the B.I.F. continued to increase in area from 1930 onwards. In 1931 the Fair was held for the first time at Olympia, White City and Castle Bromwich simultaneously. In response to offers from the British Poster Advertising Association and the railway companies, large posters now began to appear all over the country. A year later the public had their first glimpse of the characteristic B.I.F. lettering, and two years later, the now famous B.I.F. key made its appearance—the symbol of the B.I.F. opening the door to world trade. Incidentally the detailed design of that key has changed with succeeding Fairs, and perhaps this too is symbolic, for nothing remains static in the world of commerce, and the organisers of the Fair have never been content to rest upon their laurels. Each succeeding year, they were to strive for something bigger and better, and for new and more ingenious ways of expressing Britain’s trade message to the world. Year by year, the B.I.F. continued to grow. Appro priately enough, the jubilee year, 1935 , saw all records surpassed. The exhibits in the London section alone covered twelve acres, over which no less than twenty-one miles of six-foot canvas was employed in the form of stand coverings. The erection of these stands had engaged 20,000 workmen. 15,000 lamps were used for lighting, the whole vast power system being linked by 161 miles of electric wiring. The Fair was attended b}' represen tatives of seventy-three countries while visitors came from as far afield as Morocco, Persia and China, which, it should be remembered, were not then served by as swift and regular air routes as they are today. Most important of all, record orders were taken upon this occasion. Among them was one for 25 , 000,000 razor blanks of special Sheffield steel, and from the scientific instru ments section, an order for five tons of optical glass. The Earls Court Building The year 1938 saw the exhibition housed in what have since become its traditional surroundings. In that year, the White City was abandoned in favour of the splendid, modern, and fully-equipped exhibition building at Earls Court. The two floors of this enormous white structure provided twelve acres of space, enough for all the stands and for 40,000 people to move with uncrowded ease along the gangways. The nearby build ing at Olympia was also brought up-to-date at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds sterling. The improve ments included a six-storey service garage with accom modation for 650 cars. This activity was also reflected at Castle Bromwich, where the ten extensions that it had received since its inception in 1920 had transformed it into the largest single-storied exhibition in the world. Trade banquets, lunches, dinners, receptions; three vast industrial show palaces, overseas buyers’ clubs, special trains, information bureaux, restaurants, and a magni ficently produced catalogue in ten languages—such was the established tradition of the B.I.F., by now the most important national trade fair in the world. What a transformation from the cold, rat-infested sheds of the London Docks! The Fair was to enjoy only three years more of its new found glory before it was brought to a complete halt by the second world war. For five years, the administrative machine which planned and executed this superb piece of industrial showmanship went into a state of suspended animation. West London had its share of high explosive, but both Earls Court and Olympia escaped major damage. 1946 saw the planners at work again, and the organisation came to life with a large proportion of its original staff. No history of the B.I.F. would be complete without a word about the work of these people. All centralised planning is carried out by a special Exhibition Branch of the Export Promotion Department of the Board of Trade. Local arrangements for the Birmingham section of the Fair are undertaken by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. A Vast Programme The present scale of the B.I.F., and its significance to the economic life of Great Britain, calls for a vast programme of minutely detailed and carefully timed planning. Twelve months before the curtain went up on the first post-war Fair, this work was already wellunder way. The broad policy for each new Fair is settled by a B.I.F. Advisory Committee of Government and trade experts. The next step was to get the exhibitors; and in the early part of 1946, 10,000 application forms for space at the coming Fair went out to manufacturers all over Great Britain. In the meantime, another part of the organisation turned its attention to the overseas buyer. Advertise ments, photographs, and press bulletins were sent out to sixty-three foreign countries. In addition to this, a direct mail campaign was addressed to 100,000 poten tial foreign buyers, the letters being in nine different languages. Each buyer on the mailing list actually received three letters, the last of which enclosed his official invitation card. Buyers who announced their inten tion of attending the Fair also received before setting out upon their journeys a copy of the bulky comprehensive B.I.F. catalogue, printed in nine languages and weighing close on 2 lb. For the benefit of those who have to carry it around with them, the weight of the catalogue is being reduced this year. Elaborate Preparations In addition to advertising and direct mail, thousands of posters, menu cards and other display materials, printed in twelve languages, were sent out to all British embassies, consulates and trade missions abroad, as well as international organisations of all kinds. Travel facilities, and a constant flow of information for potential visitors, were also arranged through embassy, consular and trade commissioner channels. At home, each ex hibitor was supplied with a range of publicity material to send to his own overseas clients. While the world of commerce was being invited, elaborate preparation had to be made for their reception in this country. Accommodation and travel facilities were organised, including a special B.I.F. train running between London and Castle Bromwich for the duration of the Fair. Ihis period of the Fair also involved a round of social activities, notably the Lord Mayor of London’s and the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce banquets, in addition to trade receptions, and lunches; including the B.I.F. ball at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Elaborate preparations were made to keep foreign visitors informed. Inquiry bureaux were set up at the Euston and Paddington railway stations in London, and two more at New Street and Snow Hill stations in Birmingham, where interpreters met the main line trains. In Birmingham, too, there was a central inquiry bureau at the Chamber of Commerce, and a specially laid out service centre within the Fair itself. A special corps of interpreters was in attendance at all three Fair buildings, between them speaking twenty-three lan guages including Esperanto. There is no record as to whether this latter expert was called upon to exercise his talents, although a colleague once had to be sum moned to the aid of a home buyer who could speak little besides his native Welsh. Building the Fair A month before the hair is due to open, the organ isers take possession of the exhibition buildings. From this point, the preparations resemble the setting up of some gigantic stage spectacle. A visitor behind the scenes would first see the great empty acres of floor space filled in with innumerable chalk lines. When the floor plan is chalked in, carpenters, builders, decorators and electricians take over. Throughout the next ten days and nights the scene materialises. Each detail of decoration and design has been carefully thought out, and subsequently approved by the special Architects Committee of the B.I.F., down to the very type of lettering used on the fascias and sign boards. Shortage of materials led to a great deal of necessary impro visation in 1947. Some of the new materials used in stand construction actually proved better suited to their purpose and have come to stay. The exhibits begin to arrive a week before the Fair opens. The contents of a stand may represent many crate-loads or be accommodated in a small suitcase. The movement of this huge mass of merchandise into the Fair buildings calls for a nice piece of organisation that is hardly less complex than that involved in the move ment of an army corps. In the space of a few days, thousands of lorries bearing numbered packing cases converge upon the Fair buildings into which they are driven with their loads. At the entrances, they are met and directed by special traffic officials some of whom are also on duty in the building. As soon as the crates are unpacked, they are stored in carefully numbered sequence so that the whole reverse process of packing up can proceed smoothly. Many of the larger exhibits have to be hoisted into place by cranes. The giahts of heavy industry, such as the thirty-four-ton propeller shaft shown in the Birmingham section, must have their stands built round them. The 1947 Fair broke many of the existing B.I.F. records and drew nearly 17,000 overseas visitors, 10,000 more than came in 1939. Floor space in the two London buildings alone exceeded half-a-million square feet. A feature of the Fair was an increase in the chemical exhibi tors, and an imposing display by members of the Scientific Instrument Makers’ Association. The centrepiece of their composite stand was the dominating feature of the Olympia Building, a towering piece of lighthouse equipment built by Chance Brothers for the Norwegian Government. Britain’s prowess in the field of scientific, optical, surgical, and surveyors’ instruments was also strikingly demonstrated by the exhibits of the Sciex Group (Scientific Exports of Great Britain, Ltd.), an export organisation composed of leading scientific and surgical instrument makers in this country. The B.I.F’s Message The results of the 1947 B.I.F. more than justified the hopes and efforts of those who took part. Before the Fair had ended, 1,000 exhibitors, out of the total of 3,363, had already applied for over 400,000 square feet of space for the following year. Even better things are anticipated in 1948. And that, briefly, is the thirty-three year story of Britain’s great trade fair. Since its birth, it has grown out of all recognition, and its purpose too is wholly changed from that which brought it into being in 1915. At that time, its aim was to encourage the home manu facture of goods which had formerly been purchased from foreign sources. Today, the purpose of the B.I.F. is to show the world the strength of British industry, the craftsmanship, the design and the quality that is implied in the words “British Made.’’Technically the Leading Paper in every branch of Engineering For almost a Century THE ENGINEER has faithfully reflected the progress of the many branches of the great industry which it serves.

The Fair will open in London at Earls Court and Olympia, and in Birmingham at Castle Bromwich, on Monday, 2nd May, at 9.30 a.m. It will close on Friday, 13th May, at 4.0 p.m. Hours of admission in London and Birmingham will be 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The Fair will not be open on Sunday. 2.— Conditions of Admission. Overseas Trade Buyers. On the advice of the Exhibitors’ Advisory Committee, the Department and the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce have agreed to dispense with the charge for admission to buyers from overseas. On presenting an official invitation or business card at any entrance, the visitor will receive an overseas buyers badge which will ensure admission, free of charge, throughout the Fair. V.K. Trade Buyers. After first payment of 2/6d. a home buyers badge will ensure admission throughout the Fair. Public. The general public will not be admitted in London except on Wednesdays and on Saturday, at a charge of l/6d. per building. In Birmingham they will be admitted daily after 2 p.m. at a charge of 2/6d. 3 —Trades Exhibiting, The trades which normally participate are shown in Appendix A. The lighter industries will exhibit in London, while the Engineering and Hardware Section will be organised, as usual, at Birmingham by the Chamber of Commerce in collabora tion with the Department. The exact location of each trade section will be notified to all posts when plans are complete. (Lists of exhibitors will be distributed in December, see*para. 12(a).) Special Textile Display. In 1949 the Fair will include a major display by the Textile and Clothing industries, which can be confidently expected to surpass the successful exhibit of 1947. Every opportunity should be taken to inform likely visitors to the Fair,2 who are interested in these industries, that this important co-ordinated demonstra tion by the U.K. textile industries cannot be repeated annually on so comprehensive a scale. 4 — Catalogue. The final edition of the London and Birmingham catalogues will not be available before the opening of the Fair. Every overseas visitor will be given a copy, free of charge, on first presenting his business or invitation card at the entrance, or on obtaining his admission badge. (For overseas distribution of the advance edition see para. 10(1).) 5. — Attendance at the previous Fair (1948). In comparison with the first post-war Fair of 1947 the attendance of overseas trade buyers did not fall as much as was anticipated, and total attendance was maintained high above the pre-war average. The figure of overseas visitors to Birmingham does not include those who were first recorded in London. Fair in London.

Free visas will again be available to B.I.F. visitors, but travel concessions may not yet be possible. Detailed information will follow where concessions are secured. Visitors should generally reserve hotel accommodation through the normal agencies, and it cannot be over-emphasised that reservations should be made many weeks in advance. The Department may be able to find accommodation for “ last minute ” visitors if notified by telegraph, but this facility should be used by Overseas Officers in exceptional cases only. ORGANISATION OF ADVANCE INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY OVERSEAS, 1949. 7 —General Appeal to Buyers. The success of the Fair will depend primarily on the results of publicity organised to attract trade buyers. The special work of Overseas Officers in stimu lating interest by speeches, interviews, broadcasts and correspondence is of the greatest value and has been attended by excellent results. In view of the particular importance of the Fair during competitive years ahead it is earnestly requested that this work should be renewed and, where possible, intensified. To assist in co operation between the Department and Posts overseas some details are given below of the methods by which the Department will initiate the publicity campaign, and provide material for publication and distribution in all territories. In larger Posts much of this information will be the particular concern of Information Depart ments ; where necessary full details will follow by correspondence. 8—Press Advertising Campaign. (i) The campaign will consist of at least one main advertisement produced in 30 languages and 120 sizes, for repeated insertion in more than 1,000 of the most appropriate national and specialised publications of 63 territories, according to the schedules approved by the main posts concerned. (ii) Organisation. (Sub-agents ; space buying ; and despatch of matrices.) The following detail of organisation is included for reference only in the event of misunderstanding :—3 'So under the direction of the Department advertisement layouts and matrices are prepared by an advertising agent. Contracts for advertising space, and despatch of matrices to the press overseas, are made by British Export Trades Advertising Corporation, which is also responsible for collecting voucher copies after publica tion, with accounts for payment by the Treasury. In a few special cases B.E.T. A.C. will appoint local sub-agents for these purposes exclusively. The names of sub agents proposed for 1949 have been submitted to the Posts concerned for approval. In many instances, however, by dealing with the London agent of a publication overseas B.E.T.A.C. can effect the entire payment in sterling. The normal commission due to B.E.T.A.C. as agents is not an additional charge but is deducted from the quoted costs of space, and represents an overall saving in foreign currency of more than 10 per cent. (iii) Uniformity. To ensure economy in administration and production it is essential that, within reasonable limits, a high degree of uniformity should be retained throughout the publicity campaign. It will be appreciated that, although local variations or addresses may be helpful in certain cases, this must be considered in relation to the above, and the complications which would arise, for example, where a publication circulates over an area which includes a number of British Government Posts. (iv) Schedules of Media. (Preliminary Schedules.) According to the annual appropriation for each territory a preliminary schedule of publications will be prepared and submitted to the main Posts concerned for advice and amendment, within the expenditure proposed. Schedules will be based on previous campaigns, and will include advice received subsequently. Two copies of this schedule will be air mailed to Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Trade Commissioners at the main Posts concerned, in the first week of September, and to facilitate consultation additional copies will be passed to the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office for transmission to Information Officers. (v) Final Schedules. For reference, and confirmation, final schedules will be air mailed as above, with one copy to Information Officers for their assistance in placing editorial publicity. (vi) Dates of Publication. (Main campaign, and preliminary insertions.) Unless otherwise advised, dates will be as nearly as possible according to the previous campaign. In certain distant territories a few small preliminary announce ments will be published, generally in early December, to help those most concerned with early booking of passages. Publications proposed for these insertions are marked on the main schedules. (vii) Translation of Advertisement Copy. The production and despatch of matrices cannot proceed until the translation, submitted to the main Posts con cerned, has been approved or amended. As a precaution against delay of mails, and in the hope of saving Posts the work of obtaining a complete translation in every case, a translated version will be first obtained in U.K. and will be forwarded (in duplicate) as a printed proof together with the English version, for final approval by cable if possible, or by air mail with corrections. It is hoped that the U.K. version will not prejudice local expert advice. Hand-written alterations should be repeated, and clearly explained in a typewritten enclosure. It is emphasised that, as far as possible, advertisements will be published exactly as approved. Time does not permit submission of final proofs, or the consultation of certain distant Posts. 9.— Direct Mail Campaign. (i) Circular Letters and Enclosures. A series of three “ follow-up ” letters with enclosures will be addressed from U.K. direct to business men in most territories according to lists provided by Overseas Officers, and Trade Organisations in U.K., including also the names of all previous visitors to the Fair. It is planned to mail these letters on a time schedule to arrive before and during the period of press advertising. The letters will enclose an addressed invitation card, a reply post-card, and a booklet of general information. (See para. 10.) Certain Posts may be re quested to assist in translation of this material, and copies will be forwarded to all Posts. (ii) Mailing Lists. It is not possible to distribute to all Posts copies of the addresses to which the above have been mailed, as the list totals nearly 100,000 names ; but the index will be revised for B.I.F. 1950, and during October, 1948, two “ galley pulls” will be sent to the senior Posts concerned. These will contain the names of all those who will receive invitations by direct mail from U.K. in 1949, one copy of the galley pull will be for retention and the other for revision and return to the Department.10 —Bulk Supplies. (Catalogues, Invitations, and Requisitions for Display Material.) The following will be despatched in bulk, according to requisition, or as supplies permit. (i) Catalogue, Advance Edition. An experimental re-organisation will permit publication, at the end of January, of the advance edition of the London catalogue, limited to 7,500 copies for world distribution. The advance list of Birmingham exhibitors will also be available in January. A despatch of bulk supplies will be sent immediately, in proportion to attendance at the previous Fair, to the senior Posts in every territory which can be reached before April 1st. Posts will be requested, separately, to advise on this proposal in advance. It is considered that for each territory only one package should be sent, for redistribution by the senior Posts, in order to avoid the higher proportion of delay, which would be incurred at ports of entry by many smaller packages. All requests received in U.K. for advance catalogues will be passed to the Overseas Officers concerned. (ii) Reference Copies. (Separate Distribution.) No further catalogues will be available in quantity, but in addition to the above an immediate despatch of one or two advance catalogues, for reference, will be made by the quickest routes to all Posts. During the Fair specimen copies only of the final catalogue will be similarly distributed. The balance of copies of the final edition only will be sent from U.K. to individual requests after the Fair. (iii) Posters. Will be produced in three sizes, and ten languages, for free display under local arrangements. (iv) Poster Stamps. Intended for use on Officers’ outgoing correspondence, and similarly by local British firms, Chambers of Commerce, etc. (v) Showcards. For free display especially in official offices, etc. (vi) Menu Cards. Owing to paper restrictions it is not possible to produce these in the most suitable sizes for every territory. A slightly larger card has been printed for 1949, decorated with Coats of Arms of the Fair and the Cities of London and Birmingham. It is hoped that the card will be offered exclusively to hotels, clubs, etc., frequented by business men. (vii) Booklet. Instead of the folder previously supplied a simple booklet of eight pages is being produced in ten languages, incorporating as much information as was available at the time of ? printing. (viii) Invitation Cards. A large proportion of the cards handed in at the Fair had been distributed by Overseas Officers, but many visitors presenting these cards are not recorded because their name and address had not been entered on the invita tion. Special attention to this point will be greatly appreciated. (ix) Special Supplements. In the first week of January The Times will publish a special supplement of the Fair ; this will be mailed, by The Times, direct to 40,000 trade buyers in proportion according to territory. Limited supplies available to the Department will be despatched in bulk to Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Trade Commissioners and to Information Officers through the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office. (x) Requisitions. (Time of Transit.) Forms for the requisition of supplies of the above (excepting the catalogue and Times Supplement) were sent to all Posts in June. Where full quantities are not available, these requisitions will be used as a guide for distribution in proportion. As the Foreign Office bag is definitely not available for transport of this material, and since economy prohibits general use of air freight, every effort is made to ensure despatch at the earliest moment. This will begin seven months before the Fair, and the balance of supplies available will be offered to head offices of international organisations in U.K. for transport to their branches overseas. 11. — B.I.F. Symbol. It has been decided to suspend the use of the “ key ” symbol for the 1949 Fair, and to substitute a new design which may prove to have advan tages in use. The new “ gearwheel ” motif will therefore be used exclusive ly, and line drawings of the design will be distributed to assist Officers in taking every opportunity for promoting its use.5 12 .—Enquiries resulting from Publicity. First enquiries may be expected to reach distant Posts as early as December. Although few details can be known six months before the Fair considerable effort will be made to support overseas Posts with information as it becomes available. As some of this may be overlooked the following notes indicate sources of informa tion which should be available for consultation in December and January :— (a) Available to all Posts :— This Memorandum (reference B.I.F.748/48). The Board of Trade Journal. Booklet of Information. Duplicated List of Exhibitors in Trade Groups. Copies of Press Notices issued in London. Catalogue and Times Supplement will be mailed in January. {b) Available, in addition to the above, to many Senior Posts :— Frequent cable messages, in Transmission 6, through the Central Office of Information, for redistribution by Information Departments. 13.—Editorial Publicity. Editorial publicity is probably the most effective in finally influencing trade buyers to visit the Fair. The exceptional efforts made in this field by many Posts is reflected in the evidence of press cuttings, which are generally in direct proportion to the attendance of visitors. The co-operation of Information Officers has been particularly appreciated in the return of some 3,000 cuttings within eight weeks of the Fair. These, with subsequent reports, have enabled plans to be made for further improvement in the promotion of editorial material for 1949. 14—Timing. The most valuable publicity is that which will attract attention to the Fair in time for intending visitors to make travel arrangements. It is impossible to provide more than general information of the Fair until exhibitors can be approached individually, and then only a very small proportion are prepared to give the required information of their exhibits. First enquiries will, however, be made in December this year : six weeks earlier than previously. 15—Central Office of Information Services (Photos, Features, etc.) Almost every service of C.O.I. will begin to produce B.I.F. material, as far as possible, six months before the Fair. If Information Officers have not already emphasised their requirements of any particular type of material this should be done now. The Department will request C.O.I. to provide a programme of issues intended. 16.—Overseas Press Service. Transmission 6 should provide by far the most valuable source of information on the Fair, and it is hoped that the most factual extracts will be circulated to Officers in every Post who may have to deal with B.I.F. enquiries. ^ 17—Broadcasting. The B.B.C. will broadcast information in all overseas programmes, including a long series in the North American and Overseas wavelengths, the times of which will be first advised in O.P.S. Transmission 6. Copies of scripts can only be provided, on request, after the broadcasts. The personal effort made by many Officers in arranging for broadcasting from local stations for the previous Fair is much appreciated by both the Department and the exhibitors.18.— Films. The Shell Petroleum Co. has made a 20 minute “ straight ” news report of the 1948 Fair. The film, which is definitely above average for such documentaries, and is free of commercial propaganda, was released in August. It has been adopted by C.O.I. for re-issue with commentary in the following languages :— There are also English copies with a preamble in Mandarin Chinese. Apart from current newsreels no other film will be available before B.I.F., 1949. 19. —Press Correpondence. Information Officers, in particular, may find opportunities of suggesting, occasionally, to publications with London correspondents that their representatives in U.K. should obtain advance information by interview or telephone, according to requirements of local trade interests. 20. —Publicity Officer.

I.F.788/48 The Index of organisations, firms and individuals in overseas countries, which is maintained in the Department for the purpose of publicising the British Industries Fair by means of an annual direct mail caiApaign is due for revision, in sufficient tine for use in connexion with the 1950 British Industries Fair. Two galley pulls of the relevant portion of the Index are, therefore, beir sent to each post concerned and it is requested, that these pulls be checked with available records or books of reference for amendment^ where necessary. One amended galley pull should be returned by Air M^ij- as soon as possible and in any case not later than March 1st, since considerable preparation in the Department is needed oefere the amended galley pull can be finally incorporated in the main index. The revision should also be undertaken with a view to providing additional names and addresses of firms and organisations suitable for addition to the index. It will assist in the preparatory work on the J lists of new names if the full addresses, including the tov/n and country- can be added in each case. The index includes importers, Departmental Stores, public Authorities, public Utility undertakings, Universities, Technical Schools and firms in F mo ire end foreign countries who are interested in import trade or who are in a position to influence such trade. Previous visitors to the Fair are also included. It is appreciated that the revision of the British Industries Fair ^ Index throws a.dditional work upon the staffs of Overseas Officci^, ^Irc.-y heavily pressed. In view however, of the undoubted importance of the direct mail campaign in British Industries Fair publicity, it is earnesuiy required that Overseas Officers will be good enough to ensure that o review of their portion of the index receives the earliest attention.

As you have already received advance literature about the Exhibition you are probably fully acquainted with its objects and I need not therefore recapitulate them here. I would, however, like to take this opportunity of assuring, through you, all visitors and Trade Buyers with whom you may be in contact that they can count on a warm welcome on their arrival at the Exhibition; no effort will be spared to give them the maximum attention and service and every possible facility will be placed at their disposal. Comfortable Hotel and other accommodation will be available in Glasgow and for the convenience of Buyers and Sellers and their friends, there will be in the Kelvin Hall a comfortable and well-equipped Club Room in which discussions can take place. A primary objective of the Exhibition is, of course, to assist H.M. Government's Export Trade policy and I have no doubt that you will continue to stimulate the interest you have already attracted. Any information you may wish will gladly be provided and our Publicity Officer is eager to answer any enquiries you may have from time to time.

Besides the members of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers,* a number of smaller independent houses will also show during the same week. Continuing the effort to build up London as a fashion centre, H.M. Government has again undertaken to assist with overseas publicity arrangements and will give n official reception for the participants and their overseas visitors on Thursday, July 28th. Copies of the printed programme for the week will be available very shortly and will be despatched to posts as soon as possible. The programme consists of two or more showings by individual couture houses each day of the week, together with such events as an exhibition ’’Background to Design,' staged by the Rayon Design Centro and a display of fine handwork, organised by Lady Reading of Women's Home Industries. There will be no collective displays on the lines of the Coliseum presentation during the recent London Fashion Fortnight, invitations being issued to showings from the salons of individual houses. Also there will be no information bureau at Dorland Hall and no printed invitation cards will be sent from this Department. Buyers and fashion journalists anxious to be present at any of the openings should be referred to Miss Lillian Hyder, Secretary, The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, 193, Regent Street, London, W.l. (Telephone; Regent 3816) Press notices are being issued to overseas posts through the usual channels, and all officers are requested to ensure the widest possible publicity for the London Fashion Openings Week.

Service London Fashion Fortnight In accordance with the request made in S. &amp; F. 283 / 5 / 48 , we have now received from the majority of posts the revised mailing lists for invitations to the London Fashion Fortnight* We are glad to see that man/ 01 these have been drastically revised, and that, for example, piece-goods and men’s wear buyers have been cut out* Nevertheless there has been some difficulty over defining precisely the type of person to whom Fashion Fortnight publicity should be addressed. After discussion with the Trade we have come to the conclusion that in the main the following are the chief classes ( 1 ) Department stores (merchandise manager or fashion buyer); (2) Speciality fashion shops and medium-size retailers; ( 3 ) Importer-wholesalers who supply small retailers (we are not sure that this is at all an important class, but it may be so in some countries)* If these definitions lead you to revise your lists once more we would appreciate your treating the matter as urgent, so that we can base our despatches this year as far as possible on the B.I.F, mailing schedule. We hope, too, that you will continue to send us selected names and addresses as they come to your knowledge, bearing o.n mind always that our appeal is to the buyer of women' 3 fashions and not to other branches of the textiles and clothing trades*V Reference : B.l.F. 470/49. a WF?

(4) All Salaried Consular Officers. (5) All Imperial Trade Correspondents. (6) Information Departments in U.K. for all Information Officers. MEMORANDUM The primary object of the British Industries Fair is the development of United Kingdom Export trade and, in present circumstances the particular development of dollar and other hard currency earning exports. In conjunction with the Dollar Export Board the exhibitiors at the Fair are being asked to accent in their displays those goods especially suited to hard currency markets. At the same time the general purpose of the Fair to encourage exports in all world markets must be maintained and overseas officers- in all territories are urged to continue their maximum efforts to secure the greatest possible attendance of buyers from their particular area. 1. —Venue, Dates, and Hours of Opening. The Fair will open in London at Earls Court and Olympia, and in Birmingham at Castle Bromwich, on Monday, 8 th May, at 9.30 a.m. It will close on Friday, 19th May, at 4.0 p.m. Hours of admission in London and Birmingham will be 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The Fair will not be open on Sunday. 2. —Conditions of Admission. Overseas Trade Buyers. The Department and the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce have once again agreed to dispense with the charge for admission to buyers from overseas. On first presenting an official invitation or business card at any entrance, the visitor will receive an overseas buyers badge which will ensure admission, free of charge, throughout the Fair. U.K. Trade Buyers. After first payment of 2/6d. a home buyers badge will ensure admission through out the Fair. Public. The public will be admitted to the Fair in London only on Saturday, May 13th and Wednesday, May 17th. In London the admission charge to each building will be l/ 6 d. In Birmingham, the public will be admitted after 2 p.m. daily at a charge of 2/6d. Public admission is restricted to these times for the convenience of buyers and in keeping with the trade character of the Fair. 3. —Trades Exhibiting. The trades which normally participate are shown in Appendix A. The lighter industries will exhibit in London, while the Engineering and Hardware2 Section will be organised, as usual, at Birmingham by the Chamber ot Commerce in collaboration with the Department. The exact location of each trade section will be notified to all posts when plans are complete. (Lists of exhibitors will be distributed in December, see para. 12 (a)). Textile Display. In continuation of the policy of the textile and clothing industries the major display organised at the last Fair will not be repeated until 1951. Nevertheless the textile and clothing display now in preparation for the 1950 British Industries Fair will remain one of the larger sections of the Fair, and will be located at Earls Court, London. Civil Engineering Contractors Plant. At Castle Bromwich the addition of a considerable area in the open air section will accommodate a special display of civil engineering contractors plant. 4.—Catalogue. Advance and final editions of the British Industries Fair catalogues are published covering the London and Birmingham sections of the Fair. The advance editions will leave United Kingdom in February, 1950, and will be distributed in limited numbers to United Kingdom Government representatives overseas, for the use of overseas buyers before starting their journey to the Fair. This edition is fully indexed in English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, Danish and Swedish. (For overseas distribution see para. 10 (i).) The final edition of the catalogue will be available only at the entrances to the Fair. Overseas buyers will receive a free copy with their Overseas Buyers Badge.

The attendance of overseas trade buyers reached the record of 17,061 and total attendance was maintained high above the pre-war average. The figure of overseas visitors to Birmingham does not include those who were first recorded in London The actual attendance of buyers at Birmingham is consequently much higher than is shown.

Free visas will again be available to British Industries Fair visitors, but travel concessions may not yet be possible. Detailed information will follow where concessions are secured. Visitors are advised to make reservations for hotel and travel accommodation as early as possible through the established agencies. The Department may be able to find accommodation for “ last minute ” visitors if notified by telegraph, but this facility should be used by Overseas Officers in exceptional cases only. To supplement these facilities, the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce have appointed an accommodation officer who has a complete record of all Birmingham hotels, boarding establishments and private houses with rooms available for visitors at varying rates. All enquiries should be addressed to the Accommodation Officer, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, Inc., 95, New Street, Birmingham, England. Application during the period of the Fair may be made to the Accommodation Officer, B.I.F. Service Centre, Castle Bromwich.3 ORGANISATION OF ADVANCE INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY OVERSEAS, 1950. 7. —General Appeal to Buyers. The success of the Overseas Officers in bringing the Fair to the notice of overseas trade buyers is reflected in the record attendance in 1949. It is earnestly requested that these efforts should be renewed and, where possible, intensified. The work of promoting the Fair has shown a direct return and references in speeches, interviews, broadcasts and correspondence are of considerable value. It is hoped the following outline of the publicity campaign for 1950 Fair will be of use to the posts in initiating their own programmes. In larger Posts, much of this information will be the particular concern of Information Departments and the importance of co operation with the Commercial Departments cannot be over-emphasised. 8. —Press Advertising Campaign. (i) The campaign will consist of at least one main advertisement produced in 30 languages and 120 sizes, for repeated insertion in more than 1,000 of the most appropriate national and specialised publications of 63 territories, according to the schedules approved by the main posts concerned. (ii) Organisation. (Sub-agents ; space buying ; and despatch of matrices.) The following detail of organisation is only included for reference in the event of misunderstanding :— Under the direction of the Department advertisement layouts and matrices are prepared by an advertising agent, except for the U.S.A., where special arrangements are made. Contracts for advertising space, and despatch of matrices to the press overseas are made by British Export Trade Advertising Corporation, which is also responsible for collecting voucher copies after publication, with accounts for payment by the Treasury. In a few special cases B.E.T.A.C. will appoint local sub-agents for these purposes exclusively. The names of sub-agents proposed for 1949 have been submitted to the Posts concerned for approval. In many instances, however, by dealing with the London agent of a publication overseas B.E.T.A.C. can effect the entire payment in sterling. The normal commission due to B.E.T.A.C. as agents is not an additional charge but is deducted from the quoted costs of space, and represents an overall savings in foreign currency of more than 10 per cent. (iii) Uniformity. To ensure economy in administration and production it is essential that, within reasonable limits, a high degree of uniformity should be retained throughout the publicity campaign. Local variations are complicated by the wide circulation of many publications. (iv) Schedules of Media. (Preliminary Schedules.) According to the annual appropriation for each territory a preliminary schedule of publications will be prepared and submitted to the main Posts concerned for advice and amendment, within the expenditure proposed. Schedules will be based on previous campaigns, and will include advice received subsequently. Two copies of this schedule will be air mailed to Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Trade Commissioners at the main Posts concerned, in the first week of October, and to facilitate consultation additional copies will be passed to the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office for transmission to Information Officers. (v) Final Schedules. For reference, and confirmation, final schedules will be air mailed as above, with one copy to Information Officers for their assistance in placing editorial publicity. (vi) Dates of Publication. (Main campaign, and preliminary insertions.) Unless otherwise advised, dates will be as nearly as possible according to the previous campaign. In certain distant territories a few small preliminary announce ments will be published, generally in December, to help those most concerned with early booking of passages. Publications proposed for these insertions are marked on the main schedules. (vii) Translation of Advertisement Copy. The production and despatch of matrices cannot proceed until the translation, submitted to the main Posts concerned, has been approved or amended. As a precaution against delay of mails, and in the hope of saving Posts the work of obtaining a complete translation in every case, a translated version will be first obtained in U.K. and will be forwarded (in duplicate) as a printed proof together with the English version, for final approval by cable if possible, or by air mail with corrections. It is hoped that the U.K. version will not prejudice local expert advice. Hand-written alterations should be repeated and clearly explained in a typewritten enclosure. It is emphasised that, as far as possible, advertisements will be published exactly as approved. Time does not generally permit submission of final proofs.9. —Direct Mail Campaign. (i) Circular Letters and Enclosures. A series of three “ follow-up ” letters with enclosures will be addressed from U.K. direct to business men in most territories according to lists provided by Overseas Officers, and Trade Organisations in U.K., including also the names of all previous visitors to the Fair. It is planned to mail these letters on a time schedule to arrive before and during the period of press advertising. The letters will enclose an addressed invitation card, a reply post-card, and a booklet of general information. (See para. 10). Certain Posts may be requested to assist in translation of this material, and copies will be forwarded to all Posts. (ii) Mailing Lists. It is not possible to distribute to all Posts copies of the addresses to which the above have been mailed, as the list totals over 100,000 names. 10. —Bulk Supplies. Requisition for Display Material, Catalogues and Invitation Cards. The following will be despatched in bulk, according to requisition, or as supplies permit. Posters, showcards, booklets and menu cards are produced in numerous languages. (i) Catalogue, Advance Edition. It is hoped to effect publication by the end of January of the advance edition of the London catalogue, limited to 8,500 copies for world distribution. The advance edition of the Birmingham catalogue complete with the Classified and Foreign Languages indices of exhibits should be available for distribution in December. A despatch of supplies will be sent immediately, in proportion to attendance at the previous Fair, and should reach Posts during March. A special allocation has been arranged for the U.S.A. All requests received in U.K. for advance catalogues will be passed to the Overseas Officers concerned. (ii) Reference Copies. (Separate Distribution). No further catalogues will be available in quantity, but in addition to the above an immediate despatch of one or two advance catalogues, for reference, will be made by the quickest routes to all Posts. During the Fair specimen copies only of the final catalogue will be similarly distributed. A proportion of the balance of copies of the final edition will be sent to overseas posts, the remainder being sent from U.K. to individual requests after the Fair. (iii) Posters. Will be produced in three sizes, for free display under local arrangements. (iv) Poster Stamps. Intended for attachment on overseas outgoing corres pondence, and similarly by local British firms, Chambers of Commerce, etc. (iv) Showcards. Produced for free display especially in official offices, etc. (vi) Menu Cards. To meet the increasing demand for a larger card, it has been decided to produce two sizes for 1950, one larger and the other smaller than in 1949. It is hoped that the cards will be offered exclusively to hotels and clubs, etc., frequented by business men. (vii) Booklet of Information. A more attractive and comprehensive booklet has been produced ; the main feature being the reduction in size, with an increased number of pages of information. (viii) Invitation Cards. A large proportion of the cards handed in at the Fair are issued by Overseas Officers. It is requested that they should take particular care when making this distribution to ensure that the complete name and address of the prospective visitor is entered on the invitation. It will also assist the Department if the issuing office would endorse the cards with their official stamp. Special attention to these points will be greatly appreciated. . (ix) Special Supplements. In the first week of January The Times will publish a special supplement of the Fair ; this will be mailed, by The Times, direct to 50,000 trade buyers in proportion according to territory. Limited supplies available to the Department will be despatched in bulk to Commercial Diplomatic Officers, and Trade Commissioners and to Information Officers through the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office. (x) Requisitions. (Time of Transit). Forms for the requisition of supplies of the above (excepting the catalogue and Times Supplement) have been sent to all Posts. Where full quantities are not available these requisitions will be used as a guide for distribution in proportion. Supplies of all material will be parcelled separately and despatched direct to all Posts by the Central Office of Information bag. These parcels will contain a delivery note, the duplicate of which should be signed and returned to C.O.I. Where necessary a specimen supply of material will be despatched by air freight, but every effort will be made to ensure despatch at the earliest moment.5 wmmam mmm II —B.I.F. Symbol. It has been decided to retain the “ gear wheel ” motif, used for the 1949 Fair. Line drawings of the design will be distributed to assist Officers in taking every opportunity for promoting its use. 12. —Enquiries resulting from Publicity. First enquiries may be expected to reach distant Posts as early as December. Although few details can be known six months before the Fair, considerable effort will be made to support overseas Posts with information as it becomes available. As some of this may be overlooked the following notes indicate sources of information which should be available for consultation in December and January :— (a) Available to all Posts :— This Memorandum (reference B.I.F. 470/49). The Board of Trade Journal. History of B.I.F. Booklet of Information. Copies of Selected Press Notices issued in London. Advance edition of Birmingham catalogue will for the first time include exhibitors' advertisements, classified list of exhibitors in trade groups and index of exhibits in nine languages. The Times Supplement and the advance edition of the London catalogue will be mailed in January and February respectively. (b) Available in addition to the above, to many Senior Posts :— Frequent cable messages, in Transmission 6, through the Central Office of Information for redistribution by Information Departments. 13.— Editorial Publicity. Editorial publicity is probably the most effective in finally influencing trade buyers to visit the Fair. The exceptional efforts made in this field by many Posts is reflected in the evidence of press cuttings, which are generally in direct proportion to the attendance of visitors. The co-operation of Information Officers has been particularly appreciated in the return of some 5,000 cuttings within eight weeks ofthe Fair. These, with subsequent reports, have enabled plans to be made for further improvement in the promotion of editorial material for 1950. 14. —Timing. The most valuable publicity is that which will attract attention to the Fair in time for intending visitors to make travel arrangements. It is impossible to provide more than general information of the Fair until exhibitors can be approached individually, and then only a very small proportion are prepared to give the required information of their exhibits. First enquiries will, however, be made in October this year : two months earlier than previously. 15. —Central Office of Information Services. (Photos, Features, etc.) Almost every service of C.O.I. will begin to produce B.I.F. material as far as possible, six months before the Fair. If Information Officers have not already emphasised their requirements of any particular type of material this should be done now. The Department will request C.O.I. to provide a programme of issues intended. 16.—Overseas Press Service. Transmission 6 should provide by far the most valuable source of information on the Fair, and it is hoped that the most factual extracts will be circulated to Officers in every Post who may have to deal with B.I.F. enquiries. 17.—Broadcasting. The B.B.C. can be expected to broadcast information in all overseas programmes, including a long series in the North American and Overseas wave lengths, the times of which will be first advised in O.P.S. Transmission 6. Copies of scripts can only be provided, on request, after the broadcasts. The personal effort made by Officers in arranging for broadcasting from local stations for the previous Fair is much appreciated by both the Department and the exhibitors.6 18.—Filins. It has not been possible to produce a film which would be available before B.I.F. 1950. 19 — Co-operation by Associated British Chambers of Commerce. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is fully alive to the import ance of the B.I.F. to our export trade, and is anxious to do all it can to promote the success of the Fair. Through its affiliation with British Chambers of Commerce overseas, the Association hopes to play an increasingly active part in stimulating the interest of overseas buyers. 20— B.I.F. 1951. In 1951 the year of the Festival of Britain, the British Industries Fair will be held, from 30th April to 19th May. It should be stressed that hotel accommoda tion should be reserved considerably earlier as a great increase is expected in the number of visitors to Britain at that time. 21. —Press Correspondence. Information Officers, in particular, may find opportunities of suggesting occasionally, to publications with London correspondents that their representatives in U.K. should obtain advance information by interview or telephone, according to requirements of local trade interests. 22. — Publicity Officer. The Press and Publicity Officer for the Fair is Mr. Neville Shepherd at The Commercial Relations and Exports Department, Board of Trade, Horseferry House, Thorney Street, London, S.W.l. Telephone : Victoria 6800, Ext. 6.APPENDIX A BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR, 1950 LONDON OLYMPIA AND EARLS COURT MAY 8th to 19th Schedule of Trades Group 1 .—Brushes and Brooms. Group 2.— Chemicals. Acids.

BRITISH INDUSTRIES PAIR.At U.i.p'. last year In 1949 over 17,000 trade buyers from 130 territories visited B1F and saw the latest products of 90 industries on show at the Fair’s three centres —Earls Court and Olympia in * London, and Castle Bromwich in Birmingham. Among the record total of trade buyers were from Buyers in more than a hundred countries are once again making their plans to visit Britain for the annual British Industries Fair, which will in 1950 be held from May 8 /o 19 in London and Birmingham. Background The story of the British Industries Fair goes back 36 years to the Autumn of 1914. War had engulfed most of Europe. Britain, long dependent for certain classes of manufactured goods on Germany and Austria, found herself cut off from her traditional sources of supply. To encourage United Kingdom manufac turers to make these goods themselves, the Board of Trade began holding a series of _ v j small exhibitions up and down the country so that manufacturers could examine the types of foreign article needed. Firms went to work in the winter and some were actually in production at Christmas, 1914. A notable feature of much of this new production was the outstanding quality, and it was this factor which led the Board of Trade to consider seriously the opportunity now presented of meeting not only home demand but also the requirements of other countries who had formerly obtained these goods from “ the enemy.” To the original object of encouraging more and more new production the Board of Trade therefore added a subsidiary export theme, planned a national fair for early 1915, and sent out invitations to I0,(X)() overseas buyers.

On May 7th, 1915, a German torpedo sank the liner Lusitania, bound from New York to Liverpool, off Kinsale, Southern Ireland. Of the 2,000 passengers (1,600 of whom were Americans) were saved. only about 500 The Lusitania tragedy destroyed hopes of a good attendance of Americans at the first B.I.F. No one was surprised when only four appeared in the list of 285 overseas trade buyers, representing 23 countries, who attended the Fair at London’s Agricultural Hall from May 10th to 21st. The first British Industries Fair took place against a backcloth of almost continu ous sensation. Only a few hours before it opened, a German airship, nosing its way toward London, dropped 100 bombs on Southend ; the Allies opened the great Ypres offensive on the Western Front ; the Invasion of Gallipoli was front-page news. During the Fair the Italian Cabinet collapsed ; the British Cabinet reshuffled ; ^ insurrection broke out in Portugal ; the German spy, Kuepferle, hanged himself in Brixton Gaol ; Smith, the notorious “ Brides in the Bath ” murderer, was committed for trial. Within three days of the Fair closing, Italy had declared war on Austria. Her Majesty Queen Mary, one of the most regular annual visitors to the British Industries Fair, was among the first into the B.I.F. on May 10th, 1915. She spent several hours among the 591 exhibitors’ stands (which occupied 88,714 square feet), and expressed great interest in the Pottery and Glass section where chemical glass, formerly a German mono poly, was on show for the first time as a British product. THE FIRST ORDER AT FIRST B.I.F. M The Pottery and Glass section drew the first order ever booked at a B.I.F. It was placed by a French buyer within a quarter of an hour of the Fair’s opening. Another early order was also placed by a French buyer : it was for 10,000 gross of buttons. One of the biggest attractions was a working exhibit of button-making and fastening machines. Considerable technical interest also attached to the rolled-gold work in the Jewellery section, much of which represented the installation of new. '• .iaMMMMMBMeiHHnqgjpBBMMKL. 3 machinery, and to a display of cheap spoons made at Sheffield by a new process. A copy of the original catalogue, now in the archives of the British Industries Fair headquarters in London, shows that there was a fairly strong emphasis on new inventions at that first B.I.F., which persisted at subsequent Fairs. Among ideas, new then, which strike a novelty note even ^ to-day were : an article for holding down a sleeve while putting on an over-garment ; a special pillow for insomnia sufferers ; hot-air radiators for beds, motorcars, eyes, hands, feet and muffs, which can be converted into refrigerators ; a typewriter with instantly interchange able typebars and keyboard whereby one machine may be equipped by the operator with type for all modern languages ; keyless watches for astronomical and exploration purposes. When the Fair ended 34,000 people had passed through the building. The news papers reported that many large orders had been placed in the Pottery and Glass and Toy sections, and that cheap jewellery and cheap leather handbags had been in demand. One Birmingham metal goods manufacturer - was said to have received enough orders to keep his factory going for fifteen months. Exhibitors had been surprised at the volume of business done at the Fair, and this, if no other factor, ensured that B.I.F. would continue. The early years of development of the British Industries Fair were a continuous struggle for space. Wartime restrictions forced the second Fair, held in 1916 at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, to reduce its size to less than 50,000 square feet, and the number of exhibitors to 352. Some expansion was possible in the following year, when the Fair was moved to the Victoria and Imperial Institute : room was found for another 100 exhibitors. Expansion continued in 1918 and 1919, when the London docks provided a home for B.I.F., even if it was the most uncomfort able home it had occupied. The buildings were old, unheated, and rat-ridden. It was not until 1920 that the first serious steps were taken toward making the Fair a permanent feature of the British export trade drive. That year marked the establish ment of a special section for heavy engin eering products at Birmingham, where an airdrome site was found at Castle Bromwich that added 85,000 square feet of exhibition space. ENLARGED FAIR, MORE TRADE GROUPS In 1920, too, the growing demand by United Kingdom manufacturers to be represented at the B.I.F. was met by transferring the London section from the docks to the Crystal Palace, which offered three times the space. It was now possible to accommodate 1,792 exhibitors, and to add another five trade groupings to the original five of 1915. The exhibitors were now grouped under— Fancy Goods ; Jewellery, Cutlery, Electro plate ; Pottery and Glassware ; Toys and Games ; Stationery, Printing, Publishing (these were the original 5) ; Drugs ; Chemicals ; Scientific, Optical and Photo graphic ; Brushes ; Furniture, Musical Instruments. In the next five years, having moved in London once again to the White City, the B.I.F. settled for a period its difficulties of4 space, but encountered other problems which had not presented themselves before. These were, primarily, problems of dwindling trade, depression, fewer exhibitors. NEW MARKETS MEANT MORE PUBLICITY It was then realised that, however good a Fair the B.I.F. was, it needed publicity to make people—and especially overseas buyers —realise its potentialities. There were many markets abroad which could use British goods but which, hitherto, had been over looked in favour of the established selling areas. Buyers had to be told about British goods and about the B.I.F. which assembled them for convenient viewing. Up to this point the average expenditure of the Fair on publicity had been a mere £5,000 a year. It was clearly not enough. In 1925 came the great Empire Exhibition at Wembley, and it was decided to suspend the London section of the Fair in that year. The decision gave the organisers a chance to frame their publicity plans and to approach the government for financial assistance. The government were won over, and authorised an expenditure on publicity of £25,000. B.I.F. EXPANSION CONTINUED Progress was maintained over the next three years and 1929 saw' a new record for space set up with the B.I.F. covering, for the first time, more than half-a-million square feet of actual stand space. The number of exhibitors in that year was also a record for the Fair—2,368. In 1930, the London section moved from White City to Olympia but found the building too small and, consequently, the next year took in White City as well as I’liti.icrn :t:t laugruagres For the 1950 B.I.F. a world campaign of publicity will utilise : 7.250.000 stick-on poster letter stamps ; 700.000 information booklets in 10 languages ; 300.000 invitation cards in 10 languages ; 200.000 menu cards in 2 sizes and 12 languages ; 80.000 posters in 3 sizes and 10 languages ; 50.000 showcards in 10 languages. In addition Press Advertisements will appear in sixty-three countries using 33 languages ; 121,000 reply postcards in 10 languages will be used in the Direct Mail campaign to overseas trade buyers ; 15.000 advance catalogues of the Fair will be issued overseas before the Fair and a further fifty thousand at the Fair. Other activities include a world news, photo, article and matt service. Olympia. The London sections ran at both halls from 1931 to 1937, when the recently- completed building at Earls Court, offering 250.000 square feet, was exchanged for White City. Since 1926, the old airdrome site at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, had been enlarged year by year until, in 1939, it provided 304,526 square feel and had .4^ become the largest single-floor exhibition building in the world. Meanwhile, the Olympia building in London had also been enlarged : by the outbreak of World War II it could offer 300.000 square feet. CLOSED FOR THE DURATION The war forced the British Industries Fair into cold storage for a spell of seven years. But, in 1946, after the bombs had damaged much of London and even areas5 of Birmingham but, miraculously, had not harmed any of the Fair’s buildings, the organisers went to work again. A year later, in 1947, B.I.F. reopened and proved to be larger in size and a bigger draw than ever. The space actually occupied by stands was 847,754 square feet ; the number of exhibitors had reached 3,410 ; and 16,751 overseas trade buyers attended. | From the buyers’ point of view it was, of course, a special occasion. The world was genuinely surprised that a country which had been a principal target of the enemy for so long could recover to this extent in so short a time. Consequently, there was some surprise when the overseas attendance ligure in 1948 did not drop as sharply as expected. In fact, 14,500 buyers came to B.I.F. in 1948. They found that the Fair had grown again —by 100,000 sq. ft.—to 937,414 sq. ft. of actual stand space. STILL MORE OVERSEAS BUYERS COME Attendance of overseas buyers at the 1949 Fair was not expected to be more than the figure for 1948. No one anticipated that a new record would be created, sur passing even the exceptional attendance of the first post-war Fair, with a total of 17,061. If these overseas attendances, running at about three times the pre-war rate, show anything it is that the world has been very confident in the ability of British industry to produce the right goods at the right price and to deliver them at the right time. The first post-war Fair showed an amazing variety of products, but delivery dates were delayed. The second Fair showed considerable improvement in quality and prices. By the 1949 B.I.F., delivery dates had further improved and. in some lines, were almost as good as before the war. The 1949 Fair added two new and inspiring chapters to the history of Britain’s industrial progress. Buyers saw, for the first time, the physical results of world-wide market research conducted by United Kingdom firms with the object of finding out the special requirements of particular markets and of making goods to meet those needs. Buyers also saw a record achievement in the production of new ideas. It takes time to overcome the immense difficulties of completely converting a country’s industry after seven years of war production, and to find ways and means of counteracting inflationary tendencies which have pushed up the prices of raw materials to 3i times what they were in 1939. But British industry is tackling these problems vigorously, and the post-war attendances of overseas trade buyers is a high tribute to the effectiveness with which it is doing so. 1050 It.I.F. to s&gt;liow Britain making' the good* to meet world need* Designing for the needs of overseas markets now has first call on Britain’s resources and skill, and 1950 B.I.F. will offer more than 1,000,000 square feet of actual stand space for the display of the latest products of 3,000 exhibitors. Ninety British industries will be represented. Exhibits will be displayed in 32 groups of closely allied trades for the convenience of buyers. Extensions at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham section of the Fair will allow the presentation of a special display of civil engineering con tractors’ plant, largest show of the kind ever held at a B.I.F.B.I.F. Organisation aims exclusively at service for the Buyer The tradition of British business that “ the customer comes first ” is well reflected in the spirit which dominates the entire organisation of the British Industries Fair. From start to finish the conception, planning and creation of this world’s largest national trade fair are directed at providing service for the buyer. Months before the B.I.F. opens in London and Birmingham in early May (May 8th to 19th, 1950), more than 120,000 overseas trade buyers are sent invitation cards, booklets describing the coming Fair, letters placing them in touch with United Kingdom government representatives for further first-hand information on such matters as travel and accommodation, schedules of trades exhibiting, advance catalogues. Special arrangements are made for the free provision of visas in those territories where a charge is normally made for visas. Arrangements are also made for petrol and food rationing and details sent to U.K. government representatives to pass on to buyers at first-hand. An intensive campaign of information for trade buyers is carried out in 33 languages in the Press of the world, and through display material distributed to leading banks, insurance houses. trade associations, chambers of commerce, airlines and shipping companies. When the trade buyer arrives in the United Kingdom he finds inquiry bureaux set up for his benefit at leading rail terminals in London. A special train service is run from London direct to the Castle Bromwich, Birmingham section of the B.I.F. Through bookings are also possible from Harwich. Airline services operate daily between London and the airdrome attached to Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. Frequent trains and buses run from central London to Earls Court and Olympia, and a link service of free buses enables the buyer to move from one hall to the other in a few minutes. For the overseas trade buyer admission to the B.I.F. is free. When he presents his invitation card or trade card, he is given an admission badge and free copy of the Fair catalogue (with classified index in 9 languages). Overseas Buyers’ Clubs are provided at each centre of the Fair, and the buyer is invited to utilise these as temporary headquarters during the period of the Fair. The clubs are comfortably furnished, light refreshments are obtainable, and copies of the leading newspapers, home and over seas, and of trade journals, are obtainable free. Free also are the services of interpreters speaking all European and several Oriental languages, the services of shorthand-typists. Postal, telegraph, cable, and long-distance trunk and international telephone services are also available. liOixIon Fashion Fortnight, 1050 Ten days after the 1950 British Industries Fair closes, Britain’s fashion event of the year—the London Fashion Fortnight—will open to trade buyers from all over the world. Dates of the 1950 Fashion Fortnight have now been fixed—May 30 to June 12. The Fashion Fortnight Committee are preparing a welcome for overseas buyers to a festival of British fashion. Buyers will be given a preview of the autumn collections of a wide range of British fashion houses, both in collective parade and in individual showrooms. Further information of the 1950 London Fashion Fortnight may be obtained from United Kingdom overseas representatives.7 Schedule of Trade* Represented at B.i.F.

The concession provides for the visa to be valid for a period of three months from the date of issue and includes families (wives, and children under eighteen years of age) even though they may travel on separate pass ports. TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS A continuous service of motor coaches will carry visitors without charge between Earls Court and Olympia. Birmingham is 113 miles (180 kilometres) from London; express trains make the journey in a little over two hours and call specially at Castle Bromwich. An air taxi service will also operate between London and Castle Brom wich. Overseas visitors who disembark at Harwich or Liverpool can go direct to Birmingham if they wish, but, if landing at Southampton, they are advised to travel through London. In all cases they should book tickets direct to Castle Bromwich. Visitors who intend to bring their cars with them should approach their national Automobile Association and ask for arrangements with the Automobile Associa tion of Great Britain for an International Circulation Permit and an allowance of petrol to be made available upon dis embarkation. The Reception Branch of the Board of Trade is prepared to sponsor to the Ministry of Fuel and Power applica tion for additional petrol in cases where the cars are used for journeys in the interests of export trade. Petrol will not be granted for the London Area as it is considered that sufficient transport is available. ENQUIRY BUREAUX There will be enquiry bureaux at Victoria, Waterloo, Liverpool Street, St. Pancras, Euston and Paddington stations in London, and at New Street and Snow Hill stations in Birmingham, where interpreters will meet the principal trains. The Board of Trade are staffing enquiry bureaux where buyers and exhibitors can obtain information regarding the various regulations affecting export trade, and in particular details of import restrictions, invoicing requirements, certificates of origin, etc. Officers of the Export Credit Guarantee Department will also be available for the purpose of supplying information with regard to the guarantees offered by that Department in connection with the export of goods wholly or partly produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom. In Birmingham, too, there will be a Central Enquiry Bureau at the Chamber of Com merce and a Service Centre within the Fair.

The Memorandum gives general information of use in answering enquiries, outlines the methods and material available for publicity and suggests ways of stimulating local interest. Two copies have been sent to:— ( 1 ) United Kingdom Trade Commissioners ( 2 ) Commercial Diplomatic Officers ( 3 ) Superintending Consular Officers ( 4 ) Salaried Consular Officers ( 5 ) Imperial Trade Correspondents (6) Information Departments in the United Kingdom for all Information Officers. The Department welcomes reports from Overseas Posts on its publicity campaign overseas and suggestions which will help to make the campaign more effective in future years. British Industries Fair Publicity Office, Board of Trade, Lacon House, Theobalds Road, London, W.C.l. September, 1950. MEMORANDUM The primary object of the British Industries Fair is to increase United Kingdom exports, particularly, in present circumstances, to dollar and other hard currency markets. The Board of Trade and the Dollar Exports Board have asked exhibitors to show to best advantage goods suited to hard currency countries. Nevertheless the Fair must also help exports to other markets and we urge each Overseas Officer to persuade as many buyers as possible to attend the Fair. British Industries Fair, 1951, will be a prominent event at the opening of the Festival Year. United Kingdom manufacturers know that they have a unique opportunity to show their goods to the world and a record number of applications to exhibit have been received. The official opening of the Festival of Britain will take place during the period of the Fair and visitors from all over the world will be arriving in Britain at that time. We therefore ask Overseas Officers to stress the importance of making early reservation of travel and hotel accommodation. 1. —Venue, Dates, and Hours of Opening. The Fair will open in London at Earls Court and Olympia, and in Birmingham at Castle Bromwich, on Monday, April 30th, at 9.30 a.m. It will close on Friday, May 11th, at 4.0 p.m. Hours of admission in London and Birmingham will be 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. except on the final day when the Fair will close at 4.0 p.m. The Fair will not be open on Sunday. 2. —Conditions of Admission. Overseas Buyers. Overseas Buyers will be admitted free. On presenting an official invitation or his own business card at any entrance, the visitor will receive an overseas buyers badge which will give free admission to all three centres throughout the Fair. He will also be given a copy of the catalogue free of charge. United Kingdom Trade Buyers. Home Buyers on payment of 2/6d. will receive a home buyers badge which will ensure admission to all centres of the Fair. They will also pay 2/6d. for each catalogue. Public. Public admission is restricted, since B.I.F. is a Trade Fair and the convenience of buyers is the first consideration. As at present arranged, the public will be admitted to the Fair in London (Earls Court and Olympia) on Saturday, May 5th, only; the admission charge to each building will be l/6d. (There may be some amendment to this arrangement after discussion with exhibitors’ committees, but there is unlikely to be any material extension.) In Birmingham, the public will be admitted after 2 p.m. daily at a charge of 2/6d.2 3. —Trades Exhibiting. The trades which will participate are shown in Appendix A. The lighter industries will exhibit in London, while the Engineering and Hardware Section will be organised, as usual, at Birmingham by the Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the Department. Special Textile Display. There will be a major display by the textile industry at Earls Court and Overseas Officers are asked to stress this most important feature to business men interested in this industry. This display of textile products will almost certainly prove to be the finest ever staged in Britain. Civil Engineering Contractors Plant. At Castle Bromwich the addition of a considerable area in the open air section will accommodate a special display of civil engineering contractors plant. 4. —Attendance at the 1950 Fair. The attendance of overseas buyers reached the record of 19,005; details of attendance from individual countries are shown in Appendix B. Of this total, 3,434 visited the Birmingham section of the Fair. Home Buyers and the public also attended in considerable numbers:— London. Birmingham. Home Buyers ... ... ... ••• ••• ••• 76,072 37,030 Public (Limited Admission) including Work Parties ... 32,611 69,429 5. —Visas, Travel Concessions, and Accommodation. Free visas will again be available to British Industries Fair visitors. Certain travel concessions may be available to visitors from Europe; detailed information will follow where concessions are secured. Exceptional numbers of overseas visitors are expected to visit Britain in Festival Year and businessmen wishing to attend B.I.F. should make early reservations of travel and hotel accommoda tion. IN LONDON the London Hotel Information Service (47, Leicester Square, S.W.l; ’phone Whitehall 4813) will help visitors who have difficulty in finding accommodation. IN BIRMINGHAM the Chamber of Commerce has appointed an Accommodation Officer who has a record of all Birmingham hotels, boarding establishments and private houses, with rooms at varying rates available for visitors; enquiries should be addressed to the Accommodation Officer, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, 95, New Street, Birmingham, England. During the Fair application may also be made to the Accommodation Officer, B.I.F. Service Centre, Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. ADVANCE INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY. The record attendance in 1950 reflects the efforts made by Overseas Officers to bring the Fair to the notice of business men in their territories and we again ask Officers for their energetic support in making B.I.F. in Festival Year an outstanding success. References to the Fair in speeches, interviews, broadcasts and correspondence help to make it known; the most valuable publicity and often the most difficult to obtain is that which attracts attention to the Fair in time for intending visitors to make travel arrangements. 6. —B.I.F. Symbol. In 1951, the gear wheel will again be the symbol of B.I.F. and line drawings of the design will be sent to Overseas Officers. The design is not copyright and its use should be encouraged wherever possible. 7. —Press Advertising Campaign. (i) The campaign wall consist of at least one main advertisement in 30 languages and 120 sizes which will be inserted several times in more than 1,000 national and specialised publications of 63 territories. To conduct a world-wide campaign economically, a large measure of uniformity is inevitable, and local variations in advertising are difficult to arrange. (ii) Organization. Advertisement layouts and matrices are prepared by an advertising agency under the direction of the Department. British Export Trade Advertising Corporation make contracts for advertising space, despatch matrices to the Press overseas, collect voucher copies after publication and submit accounts for payment by the Treasury. By using the services of B.E.'I.A.C. we save foreign currency on agency fees, but in a few special cases B.E.T.A.C. appoint sub-agents who are approved by the Posts concerned. (iii) Schedules of Media. In October, Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Trade Commissioners at the main Posts concerned will be sent preliminary schedules of publications in which it is proposed to insert B.I.F. advertisements. Copies of the schedules will be sent to the horeign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office for transmission to Information Officers. Any changes which Posts wish to make to these schedules should be notified by airmail. The final schedules will be sent to Commercial Diplomatic Officers, Trade Commissioners and Information Officers at the main Posts.(iv) Dates of Publication. Unless otherwise advised, dates will be as nearly as possible the same as in 1950. In certain distant territories where very early booking of passages is necessary, a few small preliminary announcements will be published, generally in December; publications proposed for these insertions will be marked on the main schedules. (v) Translation of Advertisement Copy. The production and despatch of matrices cannot proceed until the translation has been approved. Two copies of a proof of a translated version of the advertisement together with the English version will be sent to Posts for advice. Posts are asked to cable approval, or to return a corrected proof by airmail if this is necessary. Hand-written alterations should be repeated and clearly explained in a typewritten enclosure. As far as possible, advertisements will be published exactly as approved; time does not generally permit submission of final proofs. 8. —Editorial Publicity. Editorial publicity is probably the most effective way of influencing trade buyers to visit the Fair. The co-operation of Information Officers in returning over 6,000 cuttings within eight weeks of the Fair has enabled plans to be made for further improvement in editorial material for 1951. 9. —Direct Mail Campaign. A series of three letters with enclosures will be sent from the United Kingdom to all previous visitors to the Fair and to overseas firms whose names are provided by Overseas Officers and by exhibitors in the United Kingdom; these letters will arrive before and during the period of Press advertising. They will contain an addressed invitation card, a reply post-card, and a booklet of general information. Certain Posts may be asked to check translation of this material, and copies will be forwarded to all Posts. The Direct Mail list contains over 100,000 names and it is not possible to distribute copies of it to Posts, except periodically for checking. 10. —Catalogues, Display Material, Invitation Cards, etc. Publicity material for the 1951 Fair will be similar to that available in 1950. Posters, showcards, booklets and menu cards will be produced in various languages. (i) Catalogues. Advance and final editions of the catalogues are published separately for London and for Birmingham. Immediately the advance catalogues are printed one or two copies will be sent by the quickest routes to Senior Posts and further copies, for the use of overseas buyers, will be sent to reach all Posts by February. The final catalogue will not be available until the Fair opens, but individual copies will be sent to Posts and more will be sent on request if there are stocks remaining after the Fair. Both editions of the London catalogue and the advance edition of the Birmingham catalogue are indexed in Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish. (ii) Posters. These will be in three sizes, for free display under local arrangements. (iii) Poster Stamps. These are for sticking on letters sent out by Overseas Officers, by local British firms, Chambers of Commerce, etc. (iv) Showcards. These are for free display in offices, banks, etc. (v) Menu Cards. These will be in two sizes and are for the use of hotels and clubs, etc., frequented by business men. (vi) Booklet of Information. Besides dealing with facilities for business men at the Fair, the Booklet will include information about other events which will interest visitors to this country for the Festival of Britain. (vii) A background booklet. Last year’s Background to B.I.F. is being printed in expanded form for 1951. It will contain statistics about the Fair since its inception, a survey of its importance in the country’s economy, and other information which will be useful to journalists preparing Press articles. Copies will be sent to Overseas Posts in December. (viii) Invitation Cards. Overseas Officers are asked to endorse each invitation card issued with their official stamp and to enter on the card the name and address of the prospective visitor, so that he may be included on the Direct Mail list for future campaigns. (ix) Special Supplements. In the first week of January The Times will publish a special number on the Fair; this will be mailed, by The Times, direct to 50,000 trade buyers overseas. Limited supplies available to the Department will be sent in bulk to Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Trade Commissioners, and to Information Officers through the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office. (x) Bulk Supplies. Requisition forms for the above (except for the catalogue and Times Supplement) have been sent to all Posts. Where full quantities are not available distribution will be made in proportion to these requisitions. (xi) Despatch of Publicity Material: (a) Supplies of publicity material will again be distributed for us by Central Office of Information, mainly through Information Services Bag. For 1951, however, C.O.I. have undertaken, in the case of Commonwealth Posts (Trade Commissioners and Imperial Trade Correspondents), to send bulk supplies direct to Posts in towns where there is no Information Officer.4 (b) Strict economy makes it necessary to keep despatches by air mail to a minimum. Small parcels sent by air attract “ minimum rates.” If, therefore^ because of late deliveries from the printers, or for any other reason, it becomes necessary to despatch small parcels by air, these will be sent through Information Services Bag for re-direction to Posts locally. There will be one exception to this rule; one copy each of the London and Birmingham advance catalogues will be sent to each Senior Post direct by air early in the New Year. Overseas Officers are asked to advise Information Officers in their areas that the Information Services Bag will from time to time contain parcels of B.I.F. publicity material addressed to Overseas Posts. 11. Central Office of Information Services. (Photos, Features, etc.) Almost every service of C.O.I. will begin to produce B.I.F. material six months before the Fair and Information Officers should notify their requirements of any particular type of material now. The Department will ask C.O.I. to provide a programme of material they intend to issue. 12. —Overseas Press Service. Transmission 6 provides valuable information about the Fair, and senior Posts who receive these messages are asked to circulate them to every Post which may have to deal with B.I.F. enquiries. 13. —Broadcasting. The B.B.C. will broadcast information in all overseas programmes (including a long series on the North American and Overseas wavelengths) the times of which will be advised in O.P.S. Transmission 6. Copies of scripts can be provided on request, but only after the broadcasts. The personal efforts made by Officers to arrange local broadcasts about the 1950 Fair were much appreciated by both the Department and the exhibitors. 14. —Films. Film shots of the 1950 Fair will be shown in C.O.I. newsreels in overseas countries at the time business men are deciding whether to visit the Fair. 15. —Lantern Slides. Lantern slides may form a valuable medium of publicity where free exhibition can be obtained in cinemas or in connection with special film shows or meetings. As an experiment, arrangements have been made to supply slides, in colour, giving the dates and location of B.I.F. to Posts which send details of their arrangements for display and numbers required. Foreign language versions or special wording or designs can be supplied if a Post forwards a draft of its requirements. (The cost of such slides to the Department varies according to quantity from 5/- to 10/6d.—plus postage.) 16. —Co-operation by Associated British Chambers of Commerce. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is anxious to do all it can to promote the success of the Fair. Through its affiliation with British Chambers of Commerce overseas, the Association hopes to play an increasingly active part in stimulating the interest of overseas buyers. rs 17. —B.I.F. 1952. The campaign to publicise B.I.F. is a long term one; Festival Year will bring a record number of visitors but Overseas Officers will realise the importance of looking ahead to 1952 when Britain will not have the same attractions for visitors. 18. —Press Correspondents. Information Officers may be able occasionally to suggest to newspapers, etc., that their London correspondents should obtain information about the Fair whifh would be of local interest. 19. —Campaign in U.S.A. The 100,000 dollar campaign in 1950 attracted 50 per cent, more visitors from the U.S.A. than in 1949. A special campaign is again being organized in 1951. Many organisations such as tourist agencies, airlines, shipping companies, etc., are co-operating to bring B.I.F. 1951 to the notice of Americans. Film shots taken at B.I.F. 1950 will be shown in television programmes. 20. —Special Local Activities. The man on the spot can often take advantage of local conditions to gain excellent free publicity for B.I.F. in his area. Examples of what has been done along these lines in the past include:— (i) A prominent window display of British products built round a notice of the forthcoming Fair. (ii) A locally prepared B.I.F. leaflet circulated to delegates attending a national conference of business men.5 (iii) A coffee-party given by the local Chamber of 1 rade to enable trade buyers returning from the Fair to meet stay-at-homes and the Press. (iv) Preparation of lantern slides from photos taken by the chairman of the Chamber of Trade on his B.I.F. visit, which was made the subject of several addresses to influential audiences. (v) A 40-ft. x 6-ft. street banner flown annually to publicise B.I.F. during the city’s British Trade Week; and used again on the hull of a ship embarking B.I.F.-bound passengers. (vi) B.I.F. photos enlarged, mounted, captioned and displayed in the lounge of the Businessmen’s Club. (vii) Leaflet bringing B.I.b. to the notice of traders who deal in goods on which import restrictions have been relaxed. 21. —Enquiries resulting from Publicity. First enquiries may reach distant Posts as early as December. Few details can be known six months before the Fair, but overseas Posts will be given information as it becomes available. The following sources of information should be available in December and January:— (a) Available to all Posts:— This Memorandum. A background booklet. Booklet of Information. Copies of Selected Press Notices issued in London. Advance edition of Birmingham catalogue. The Times Supplement and the advance edition of the London catalogue will be mailed in January and February respectively. [b) Available to many Senior Posts:— Frequent cable messages, in Transmission 6, through the Central Office of Information for redistribution by Information Departments. 22. —Publicity Office. A Press and Publicity Office will be open throughout the year at:— British Industries Fair, Board of Trade, Lacon House, Theobalds Road, W.C.l. Telephone: Chancery 4411 Ext. 793. From about the middle of April until the end of the Fair, Press Offices will be open at Earls Court, Olympia and Castle Bromwich. i6 APPENDIX A BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR, 1951 APRIL 30 th—MAY 11 th SCHEDULE OF TRADES EARLS COURT AND OLYMPIA LONDON Group 1 .—Brushes and Brooms.

The Fair will be the finest ever held, and as 1951 is Festival Year our Posters will be more gaily coloured than in 1950; the Booklets and Menu Cards will include a list of events which will be of interest to visitors to Britain. 2. Demand for Publicity Material: — Enclosed is a requisition form which gives details of the .various items of publicity material which will be available. ~ 1?ill you please show on the form your requirements of each item and return it to this office as soon as possible. Should it be necessary, in the case of the more distant posts, for us to despatch publicity material before your requisition is received, the quantities supplied to you last year will be taken as a guide to your requirements for 1951 . b• Despatch of Publicity Material: (i) Supplies of publicity material will again he distributed for us by Central Office of Information, mainly through Information Services Bag. For 1951, however, C.O.I. have undertaken, in the case of Commonwealth Posts (Trade Commissioners and Imperial Trade Correspondents), to send bulk supplies direct to Posts in towns where there is no Information Officer. (ii) Strict economy makes it necessary to keep despatches by airmail to a minimum. Small parcels sent by air attract 'minimujn rates'. If, therefore, because of late deliveries from the printers, or for any other reason, it becomes necessary to despatch small parcels by air, these will be sent through Information Services Bag for re-direction to Posts locally. ^ There will be one exception to this rule; one copy each of the London and Birmingham advance catalogue will be sent to each Senior Post direct by air early in the New Year. 4. You will probably think it advisable to consult the Information Officer in your area before completing the requisition form and also to advise him that some publicity material may be sent to you through the C.O.I. Bag. 5. Further Information: Overseas Officers will shortly be receiving a Memorandum giving further information about B.I.F. 1951. This letter has been sent to the following Posts: U.K. Trade Commissioners, Imperial Trade Correspondents, Commercial Diplomatic Officers and Consular Officers. It has not, however, been sent to Imperial Trade Correspondents in the West Indies or in Central America; nor to Consular Officers in—&gt; towns where there is a Commercial Diplomatic Officer; nor to Consular Officers in Chile, China and Japan.
