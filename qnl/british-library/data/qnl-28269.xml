As regards reinforcements Baratoff said drafts co-. tinually coming up the road but I think that these are to complete not fresh units. He said that strong re inforcements had been promised.

My telegrams Nos. 259 C. and 284 C. If direct route used, mule transport essential. Unanimous opinion of officers from our recent experience is that column too small to safeguard long line of hired camel transport with undisciplined drivers in hill country where chance of attack possible. Grahams can purchase 300 mules and possibly 600 in about 20 days, but they would hardly reach Kerman and be ready to start under two months*from now. Moreover awaiting information of supplies being laid out between Saiabad and Shiraz obviously involves much delay from lack of telegraph. Camel transport which can be collected in month could be used safely as far as Yezd or even to Dehbid and supplies would present much less anxietv, as telegraph officials would arrange to their being laid out throughout. If object of Government is that column move as soon as possible from Kerman to Shiraz, I calculate that by use of camels to Yezd I should gain one month by longer route and run infinitely less risk of supplies failing. Mules purchased by Grahame would meet me or elsewhere on the way.3 lilt, ■# depart* Serat 3 left lined dave of e. 23th iela- iion of 'egiiarf :ounttf ifelf ® anxietfi le fi® jaifl o® '0 ynv&gt;- 156 flteceived with Arniy department memorandum No. H. 5826, dated the 1st July 1916.)

The presence of cavalry is, in his opinion, particulary necessary, as Germans are well acquainted with and have frequently used tracks into Persia from Yazdan. The interval between Rum and Birjand, the former being the southernmost point occupied by Russians, need to be watched especially care fully. I fully concur in these views.

I may be of interest to note that the rebellion of the past year is only the climax of a long series of lawless acts. The tribe has learnt from past experience that the Persian Government can he flouted with perfect impunity. Should it learn as a result of this business that the British Government can be treated in the same manner, I submit that the position of British officials and other British residents in Bushire will become quite impossible. In view of the telegrams which I have despatched from time to time, I need hardly say that I am in hearty accord with Mr. Chick as to the urgent necessity of punitive measures against the tribe. Provided that the arrears of revenue were recovered and a fine in addition, the actual method of inflict ing the punishment and its nature would have to be left to the Commander of the troops. I am informed that a small mobile force of two battalions infantry, one or two squadrons of cavalry and two mountain guns would he quite sufficient to carry out the punishment, and as a matter of fact except for the guns this force could be provided from the present garrison of Bushire. I trust that as soon as the state of affairs in Mesopotamia permit, an expedition against the tribe will be sanctioned. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, A. P. Trevor, Major, Acting Consul-General. :Sir C. M. Marling, G.C.B., C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Tehran. Beasons for the Punishment of Tangistan and Measures Suggested. The case against Tangistan. The lawlessness of Tangistan has been proverbial in Southern Persia for half a century, and more. When Bushire was governed by the Arab Shaikhs there was only one quarter of the town, that farthest from Tangistan, which did not suffer from their frequent raids. The southern face of the town was walled, up to a comparatively recent date, as a defence against their depreda tions : and the townspeople were unable to reside freely in the outlying parts of the island. Under their Khan, the Tangistanis defended the fort at Beshire against the British force in 1856, and most of the British casualties occurred there, mainly owing to misuse of the white flag. In the march of General Outram’s troops towards Chahkutah and Borasjun, the tribe, however, escaped all punishment, their district lying to the South. There are some 25 villages in the interior of the district, none of them, save Abram, the principal one, possessing more than 200 habitations at the present time, and most of them less than 50 j in addition there are a dozen small hamlets on the coast. But the population has from long ago been made up of different tribes, who are most prone to fight against one another, and cherish blood feuds : one village will be on most bitter terms with its neigh bour a rifle-shot away : and in many cases the same tribe, in the same village, has split into settlements hostile to each other, and every opportunity is taken to pay back old scores.6 —■' ■' “ ,T - i I ■ The tribesmen are particularly hardy, and of fighting stock: revengeful and predatory. In 1909 at the invitation of a Mulla in Bushire they poured into that port, terrorised it for some days, and carried off considerable plunder from the bazaars: they escaped all punishment. Unlike the other districts of the Bushire littoral, they never during the past 40 years seem to have been under any real Control by the ruling family, in their case the Khans of Tangistan, who were Zabits on behalf of the Persian Government. Prom 1890 onwards, more especially, the two last Zabits of this family ruled so unwisely that they lost the adherence of the tribesmen, and raised up enemies for themselves in the village headmen. The latter ceased to pay revenue, were not brought to book, gradually threw off their allegiance, and became independent of the Khans. Village warred against. village, and headmen were put up to kill off other headmen. This coincided with a period when the arms trade began to make its appearance ; and a few years later the Blegian regime over the Customs, and the Tariff, made certain Tangistani ports, particularly Dilwar, a great smuggling depot. . Village head men became wealthy through the trade in prohibited articles with the interior: they obtained large supplies of rifles and ammunition, and their men were well armed, and have been until recently (when the war with Germany, and the Maskat arms warehouse arrangement cut off most means of supply). The Persian Governors of the Ports and the Central Government allowed the state of Tangistan to go to rack and ruin : provided a certain sum was paid as farm to Tehran, and to the Governor by the Zabit, they did not interfere. The Bushire Government was left without a force : its guns were not provided with sufficient ammunition. When the Governor did find the revenue in arrears, or his own pocket empty, and took out a single gun and a small number of riflemen with the intention of punishing Tangistan, he was soon turned from his purpose by being bought off by some guilty headmen, or, Persian fashion, by the women throwing themselves across the gun, and asking pardon. As often as not, he played one Khan, or one Khadkhuda off against the other : the present Governor, Darya Begi, is largely to blame for this procedure. In the end, the Governors ceased attempting to levy the revenue at all, particularly after the regular salary was assigned them, and they no longer had to worry about the sum for which the Provincial Govern ment was farmed. The fact that Tangistan was nominally part of the Gov ernment of Pars, which is far removed from all knowledge of the situation there, and not under the Government of Bushire and the Ports, only served to diminish Government authority in the district. In 1902 Nizam-us-Sultaneh, then Governor of the Ports, managed to take Zair Khidar, the present rebel chief, and confined him as a prisoner at Bushire: but he soon escaped. In 1903 this man, a mere Kadkhuda (or village headman) of Baghak led a revolt against the Khan of Tangistan, and, supported by Darya Begi, soon obtained the upper hand. The rest of the headmen did not support the Khan, who was pushed aside, and ignored hence forth. In 1905 Zair Khidar was placed in charge of the district, and entrusted with the duty of collecting and paying in the revenue. Payment of the revenue has entirely ceased now for the past six years : whatever he has been able to extract for himself from the headmen, who consider themselves his equals, has been due to his being the strongest, and wealthiest among them. The income derived from profitable sales of smuggled arms, ammunition and tea through the port of ; Dilwar made him rich enough to leave the others to their own devices. Prom 1907 to 1912 Zair Khidar personally was at hitter feud with his present ally Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah, a small district some 10 miles from Bushire on the Shiraz road : raids on each other’s territory were constantly taking place. ? , . As to the relations between him and his followers, on the one hand, and the Persian Government representatives in Bushire and the British Govern ment, on the other. In 1909 the tribesmen en masse seized Bushire, im prisoned the Governor and looted the bazaar, being turned out only by alanding of blue-jackets from H. M. S. “ Fox A small party of Tangistanis shortly afterwards made a landing from the sea with the intention of seizing the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Customs, and were driven out after fighting. In 1911 Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Pars, who enjoyed the goodwill of the British authorities at that time, sent a tribal expedition against Zair Khidar, distroyed his village of Shamshiri, and chased him to the hills, where he remained some months, until Nizam’s removal from Pars allowed him to return to his former position in Tangistan. In 1912 a gross case of piracy and murder against an Arab dhow led to the bombardment of the guilty coast village of Bustami by His Majesty’s ships. Other villages of Tangistan, Hilwar and Madumari joined in, and were also bombarded : but the efiect produced was, as in the case of the second bombard ment of Dilwar in 1916, only temporary. It costs little on the Persian coast to rebuild stone and mud buildings and mat huts. The pirates were never caught, and the pearls and money taken were divided among Zair Khidar and other headmen. In none of the reprisals was any lasting effect produced, or salutary punishment inflicted, either by the Persian or British Governments; with the result that the Tangistani tribesmen and their leaders, while regarding both Governments as ill-disposed towards them, were emboldened, and im pressed with their own fighting strength. It has never been possible in such circumstances for the .Residency at Bushire to maintain the same cordial terms as with the Khans and inhabit ants of other districts^ Shortly after the outbreak of the European War, the headman of Dilwar was corresponding with the German Consul at Bushire, and offering to attack and kill the British troops then peaceably quartered there, as a Consular guard. Wassmuss, before he reached the Persian littoral, wrote to the German Consul, enquiring if Zair Khidar could not be used for operations against the British m Bushire, supposing arms could be provided. HZ After the arrest of the Germans at Bushire, a friendly letter^ explaining the reasons for the step was sent by the Residency to Zair Khidar. his reply was violent reproach, and a demand for reparation. Within two months he had joined a confederacy to obtain the restoration of the German deportees by force, if necessary ; and had welcomed Wassmuss, and announced his hostility to the British. The ambush laid for a British patrol when two British officers were killed near the Residency by the headman of Diiwar, was the first of a series of raids and attacks by Tangistanis and their allies, organized largely by Zair Khidar, against the British lines round Bushire, and these have continued from July 1910 ti l early m 1916, when Zair Khidar and the Chahkutahi chief seeing that the British force and defence at Bushire had been strengthened began to confine themselves to maintaining a number of men, varying from 60 to 300, about 12 miles from Bushire, ready to oppose any advance against them by the British troops. The strong and remote position from Busbire of the fort of Zair Khidar near Ahram made it the place chosen for the imprisonment of the British taken captive at Shiraz. The fact that he is their jailer, and that for 6 months he has seen the British authorities unable to obtain their release, has enhanced Zair Khidar’s opinion of his own importance. He has demanded a number of conditions in return for their surrender, and apparently considers the captives as pledges, with whom he will always be in a position to buy off his pardon from both Governments. Oae other point needs observation: during his campaign, Zair Khidar has only been able to rely on a certain number o£ vil ages in langistan lor his force: several of the more important villages have held aloot, and sent M men to take partin raids in fighting, out of their hostility towards Zair Khidar himself, and their inter-tribal feuds. Zair Khidar’s following in iangistan has been limited from the beginning. Many headmen would be glad to see him killed, or removed, but co-operation among themselves is beyond them. .wm B Reasons for the suggested punishment. The need for extensive, radical measures in suppressing lawlessness in Tangistan must seem plain from the summary given above. The Persian Gov ernment are not, and will not be for years, in a position to command the means of restoring order there : they have no regular troops; and tribal chief tains with shadowy power like Soulet-ud-Douleh, whose winter encampments lie many miles across the mountain ranges, could not under the most favour able circumstances get their tribesmen to suppress in an effective manner a district of the plains of the coast. The coastal tribesmen in their own districts are fully a match for the Qashqai: a few raids, and villages looted, and then the Qashqais would be tired, and bought off by bribes: the Tangistanis would return from the coast hills, and the position would be no better than before. A Qashqai force too, of any size, would only be procurable between the months of November and March. The Governor of Bushire could collect a force of the loyal districts, which have been friendly to the British throughout the rebel lion, and would be only too glad to see their Tangistani enemies severely punished. But for the Governor to be able to collect such a force, and march them into Tangistan, His Majesty’s Government would have to supply— (i) Field guns, machine guns and ammunition. (n) British troops to work these guns. {iii) Mofiey to pay for the wages of the men employed and provisions for the force. Guns are essential, because it is impossible for Persian tribesmen armed with rifles only to capture thick stone or mud forts, well defended by other tribes men. Guns are the one arm that Persian tribesmen fear. Moreover, previous experience of Persian Government expeditions makes it certain that even with a properly equipped force, only half-measures would result: a Persian Governor, like the Darya Begi, is incapable of doing such a task thoroughly: the tribesmen, whom he might lead, would have no con fidence in him. They have insisted for months past on their readiness and desne to maich, and settle with the situation once and for all, but in co-opera tion with any British movement. Further prolongation of the present unsatisfactory situation will prove most deleterious, both for the Persian and British Governments. All in this part of Persia are well aware that the force at the command of the rebel chiefs when unattacked as at present, does not exceed 300 Tangistanis, and some 200 Chahkutahis and Gendarmes : while it is equally well known that if attacked by a force from Bushire, many of these men, who are now serving under compulsion or for wages and are bound by no ties to the rebel chiefs would desert them, and scatter. * . To , kee P, a force of some 2,000 well-armed British troops on the defensive in the face ot such an insignificant enemy for months together, when it would be easy to deal with them, seems not only waste of men ; it makes the rebel tribesmen think we are afraid of them, and has conveved the worst possible impression of timourousness on the part of the British force throughout all Fars, and all the shores of the Gulf. ° The rebel chiefs realise that they committed themselves from the dav when they began attacks against us and are outlaws : they will continue to maintain men under arms, and to treat Bushire as an enemy district as Ion 2 as they see us maintain so large a force there. In the meantime they have ull scope for intrigue, m the hope of setting themselves right with their own Government, inconsistent at all times : and they can play on our feelings by using their treatment of their British captives, and their desire for release as a bait. 9 . The continuance of the present state damages Persian interests, as it is obviously impossible to allow passage along the caravan routes from up- country, which traverse the hostile districts and then cross our outpost lines. VV e cannot afford to have any of the enemy inside Bushire Island, especially a night. and tor several reasons it would be impossible to prevent this if tbecaravan routes were thrown open. The result means the stoppage of trade With the interior, and severe loss to the Customs.On the other hand, it is unthinkable that a great Empire should make terms with an outlawed village headman with a few hundred followers, merely because he holds a few British captives in his hands, when the British force only 25 miles away is five or six times more numerous. It is certain that such terms would insist on Zair Khidar and his accomplices being guaranteed from all punishment by both the Persian and British Governments, and on his being again granted the Zabitship of Tangistan. The result would be disastrous to both Governments. The Tangistanis would be able to dictate to the Governor of Bushire, to raid and smuggle as they liked and to pay back old scores against the loyal tribal districts. The effect would spread over the whole region: and, instead of order being restored, districts now loyal to a certain degree would refuse to pay revenue, and imitate Tangistani methods. The position would be intolerable for British officials and traders. Unless a regiment or more of British troops were kept as a permanent guard, the Besidency officials would hardly be safe from attack, or robbery in their houses, by tribesmen, w r ho would be sure of immunity from punishment. In fact, a loop in the cable, and the removal of the Besidency to Kharg Island as in 1838-184^, would be far more satisfactory, and dignified. To agree to terms in Persian eyes w r ould mean to be beaten, and Bushire v r ould be treated accordingly : a renewal of friendly intercourse is not understood by lawless Tangistani tribesmen: and Bushire is exposed to the interior for 6-8 miles on its eastern side. It does not do to forget that whatever success we have in the Mesopotamia or European campaigns w r ill be of little interest to tribal Persian : they see no further than their own immediate environment, and their own hostilities. The rebel chiefs have all along spread the news assiduously of the losses inflicted by them on our troops “ 655 men killed at the landing at Dilwar ”, “not a man w T as able to return to the boats ”, ten and twenty men killed in each raid, etc. We have been loaded with opprobrium and we possess the letters of Zair Khidar and Ins ally, telling 1 ersians that « we consider the best of their (English) Generals worse than dogs Suggested punishment. With the situation as it is to-day in Central Persia, and beyond the coast range, opinion is unanimous in Bushire, and in the friendly districts surrounding the rebel tribesmen, that it would be an easy matter for the British force, to deal effectively and decisively with Tangistan, without the least chance of any complications arising with langistan. The greatest possible service would be done to the Persian Government, and the restoration of order: the Persian officials in Bushire and Ears desire it, and it would be easy to give the Persian Government a share in it. To secure a lasting and tranquillizing effect on Tangistan the following objectives should be attained : (II Zair Khidar should be captured and executed by the Persian Governor without delay. Bis two sons, and his other relations and principal supporters, who are all known by name, should be deported, and imprisoned for several years, in some suitable place in the Gulf. Bis fort and village should be destroyed. (2) Each villa^e in Tangistan should be surrounded, and the headmen V ^ required 0 under pain of drastic measures, to surrender a number of rifles, based on the list, attached to this. The upper stories of forts removed. (3) The Governor, or Einancial Agent, of the Ports Government present with the force, should require each village to pay then and there revenue for the current year, and past year, according to the list given herewith. (4) Two principal inhabitants from every village, selected from the names in the list attached, should be removed as hostages tor the good conduct of the village, or settlement, and deported tovarious ports in the Gulf where they would be maintained and fed in special buildings, under surveillance, but with a certain amount of liberty, for one or two years. It would be an excellent thing if, in addition, one or two boys of principal inhabitants of the villages could be sent to India, Basrah or Mohammerah to school. (5) A Persian force of Government tufangchis under a responsible man, properly paid, should be stationed at Dilwar. There is little doubt that if the above measures are adopted and can be effectively carried out, Tangistan will be reduced to good and lasting order, Bushire will be rendered secure from all danger on that side, and the British garrison could be greatly reduced. Measures (2), (3) and (4) are particularly important. There is no more cogent method of making Persian tribesmen recognise the. existence of their Government than by exacting the full payment of revenue. The disarma ment of the villages will remove the means for their lawlessness, and the possession of hostages from each village will ensure individual obedience, wdiich is very necessary in a district, where most villages are separate units, and composed of different tribes.

I have received from Trevor the following telegram, No. 1358, with contents, of which I generally agree '—Begins. I beg to make a few remarks on Minister’s telegram. No. 215. My reference to Baghdad ladies referred simply to fact that in my opinion they have had to put up with almost as bad climatic and other conditions as prisoners at Abram and for a much longer time. If analogous case is required that of Solium prisoners is more to the point. They were captives of far more savage tribe and had to undergo far more severe sufferings. I am not aware that we negotiated with tiibe for their release or offered concessions. Prom accounts in the press I gather that we simply bided our time and rescued them by a raid. Ahram prisoners are fewer in number and much nearer. Points 1 and 3. I think I am justified in thinking that Khans would escape punishment. 2. It is to he hoped Germans, etc., will remain in confinement, but not (I think) certain. They are said to be living comfortably in one of Kawam s gardens. 4. Khans are already having success with P(arman) P(arma) especially Borasjun. _ . , . 5. All I can say to this is we speak here from knowledge derived from ■daily correspondence. 6 Two Khans would recover ten thousand tomans and 30,000ib. tea, respectively, besides knowing their villages would not be destroyed. As for IVarman) Ftarma) we know bis expeditions : that in 1898 against. Tangistams, was a failure ; Hesident, in Administration Report of that year m reporting its return to Shiraz, states “that little appears to have been effected as far as the punishment of Tangistanis is concerned ; and expedition m 1905 to punish Lurs who attacked Douglas and Lonmer did not achieve anything.

The fight was not actually seen by him; one of his men, whom he sent out on hearing firing in Larumba Pass direction, supplied him with his information. I have received no news from Captain James though fight, which began at 10 A. M., was said to be still going on at 6 p. m. yesterday. This information reached me at 10 A. M. to-day at Kasimabad, to which place I had gone with a view to driving off from moving towards Sangun as many of the Yar Muham- madzai as possible. On hearing the news I returned direct to Khwash. I am doing what I can to discover what happened ; but, until I have more difinite and reliable information regarding the fight, and know whether the 150 men 106ih Pioneers will come, I do not propose attacking the Yar Muhammadzai, who are said to he now in the Sar-Drokan between the two parallel ranges of the Morpish Eange. Unless I go out against them, which I propose doing as soon as I can possibly do so, the Yar Muhammadzai may possibly join the Ganshadzai, and again trouble the Lines of Communication. There were with Captain James and Lieutenant Uloth, two non-com missioned officers and 12 men of 19th Punjabis and two troops of 28th Cavalry, together with five Chagai Levies, and four prisoners whom the enemy released.

According to Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, no adequate reinforcements can be sent, nor, according to priva e in orm ation received from Lake by Military Attache, can Lake make a diversion from Mesopotamia.

From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire, «p 0 The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. 118 0., dated 24th April 1916,1 have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the follow ing further information regarding the murder of Khan Bahadur Agha Badr and his brothers. As stated in the abovementioned letter His Excellency the Darya Begi left for Lineah in the Persian Government vessel “Persopolis” on the 12th Anril and arrived there on the 16th after calling at some intermediate ports to make enquiries. His Excellency did not hear anything at these places, but after enquiry at Lingah, he arrested 10 persons at Lingah, two of whom he considers participators in the murders and the remaining eight accessories to the crime I may here mention His Excellency was prepared to execute the two participators forthwith, but in consultation with Sir _ P. Cox it was decided that it would be better to defer this in case the Tangistams should take reprisals on the British prisoners in their hands. The six prisoners were accordingly brought to Bushire by the Darya Begi on his return and have been sent to Basrah for confinement. Darin' his enquiries His Excellency convinced himself that the murderers 'were instigated to commit the crime by letters from Tangistan. His Excellency elicited the fact that a certain Nakliuda Gharib Saiya langis- t-mi a relative of Rais Hussain Dooli, who was the actual leader of the to fan 'ehis though Haii Khan was the titular chief, and who was killed durin' the attack on the Deputy Governor’s house arrived at Lingah from Tangistan while His Excellency the Kawam was there with letters for the tiifano’chis He lived with Rais Hussain Dooh and His Excellency thinks he was an emissary from Zair Kbidar or Vassmuss. Prom an admission made hv one of the prisoners, the Darya Begi thinks that the plot was to murder the Kawam and the Residency Agent. But apparently the Kawam had many faithful adherents round him, and the murderers did not dare to attack him. All efforts to catch this Nakhuda Gharib Saiya have unfortunately failed so far • he was reported to have gone to Kuwait, but has not been heard of there. ' After the Darya Begi’s departure from Lingah news was received that the murderers had gone to Cbiru and taken boat from there to Sinwuh proceeding thence overland to Tangistan, where they apparently arrived in the be'inning of May. The Darya Begi was accordingly asked o call at these ports on his return journey and ascertain if the various Shaikhs had helped the murderers. . _ „ , 7 , Meanwhile news was received here of the arrival of the murderers m Taroistan and I reported the fact to Government m my telegram No. 1058 of the 7th May. His Excellency the Darya Begi after a trip to Bunder Abbas and Jask returned to Lingah and left there for Bushire on the 12th May. On his way4 he made enquiries and found that the report that the murderers had taken boat at Chiru was true. His Excellency tound in spite of orders the Shaikhs of Chiru and Shiwuh had helped the murderers, the latter had passed them on to Gaobandi where Shaikh Mazkur helped them with cash and food and new clothes, Sc. Afterwards they went to Gilladar where they were Violned hv Ali Akbar Khan : this individual, who is a strong adherent of Soulet-ud-Douteh,^ 1 reported to have offered them 200 men to Lingah and complete their nefarious work there. Irom thence they have gone by Jam and Biz to Tangistan. Bis Excellency the Darya Begi was much incensed the behaviour of Shaikhs and 'on his return to Bushire informed me that he would remove h lhail If Chiru and Shiwuh putting these places in charge of Shaikh Ibrahim of Kalat and take the comparatively well-to-do ports of Asalu and Nakhl-Xaki out of the hands of Ali Akbar Khan and put them in charge of back seem to to Lit v 3d on 11 A U G 1316 With IKDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter. No. ^3 M feted 14 JSJL 1916 Letter. Fated2 ' Shaikh Muhammad Ahmed Khalfan. His Excellency added, howerer that to do so he would require the support of one or two of H. M. ships/ The Commodore, who visited the Darya Begi with me, readily agreed to do this and it was accordingly arranged. The Darya Eegi accordingly left in the “ Persepolis ” on Saturday, 17th June, for Tahiri and Asalu, and H. M. ships “Juno ’ and “ Bramble ” followed on Wednesday, 21st. X have just heard that the cpeiations at Asalu have been completely success* ful, the Darya Begi having gained a bloodless victory. Ali Akbar Khan and Shaikh Mazkur, who had apparently come to his assistance were driven out of Asalu and Nakhl-Taki and Bidakun and Shaikh Muhammad Ahmed Khalfan installed on the 23rd instant. The ships have now proceeded to Shiwuh and Chiru. It is not anticipated that any difficulty will be experienced in dealino* with these two places. To revert to the murderers of the late Khan Bahadur j on arrival in Tangistan Haji Khan and his 11 followers were received with open arms first by Shaikh Hussain who is reported to have given them clothing and presents and 50 Tomans to the leader, and subsequently by Zair Khidar who has “given ” the village of Pakhushi, only about 12 miles from our outpost line to Haji Khan for their maintenance. Since their arrival one of their number Abdu, a native of Halileh, the village on the southernmost part of the island has headed two night raids on the village, the last occurring only a few* mights ago. Both Haji Khan and Rais Hussain Dooli (and probably most of their followers) had bloodfeuds on in Tangistan and did not dare to return to their homes—judging from their welcome on their return I think one would not be far wrong in surmising that they were tempted by Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain to commit their crime with promises that bygones would be bygones and of being able to return home safely and. be given rewards and land on arrival. There has been some correspondence lately regarding accepting the terms offered by Zair Khidar and Shaikh Hussain in connection with the release of the Shiraz prisoners. I strongly deprecate doing so, but if it is decided to do so, it will only be necessary to call on these rascally Khans to give up Haii Khan and his cut-throats in order to obtain a fresh reason for punishing them. In conclusion, I beg to attach, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a despatch (No. 64, dated 20th May) regarding a demand for indemnity from the Persian Government for the Khan Bahadur and his brothers which His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has sent to the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs. I also attach a copy of my telegram No 23Q 1 ‘^iq dated 22nd June, to Sir Charles Marling giving him some furthei particular* regarding the services of Agha Ali. ^ Enclosure No, i. Ko - 64i Tehran, Slr ’ 20th May 19161 r»n 1° n y te3e S ra “ No - 228 of 10th April, I have the honour to report that on 16th April an attack was made hy a party of about 14 Taimstani riflemen employed by the Deputy Governor of Lingah on the Acting Agent of the British Residency, Khan Bahadur Agha Badr. They killed liim a and his two brothers, Khan Sahib Agha Ali and Agha Ibrahim. ^This took place in Agha Badr’s private house. The Tangistanis then went to the quarter of Tlfev ako C n°tt S et at f t1 Ua Ti aD * ^ lled tW ° Sep ° yS and woun(led three others. They also attacked the Deputy Governor and the private house of Mr. John ston, Assistant Surgeon and Quarantine Medical Officer. They lost two of their number and had several wounded. The Deputy Governor and the Darya fhem Mr d H n ow 1 w- m ® au , t!l ° rities n !n th e surrounding country to amfst , ,, ’ ' Hobson, His Majesty s Vice-Consul, proceeded at once from Bunder bbas to Lingah and has offered a reward for the apprehension of the mis creants. He was accompanied by Captain Durham and a party of Indian sowars and Persian riflemen. The Commodore is having the coasting Dhowsbetween Lingah and the Tangistan coast searched by one of His Majesty’s ships as it is thought that sooner or later the men will try to get home by Bushire. So far there is no trace of them. The question of claiming an indemnity from the Persian Goyernment presents itself. Mr. Howson, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Lingah, has for the last year also been in charge at Bunder Abbas, and has spent most of his time at the latter post. During his absence Bahadur Khan Agha Badr was in charge of the Agency and was so acting at the time of the outrage. Khan Sahib Agha Ali has also held charge of the Lingah Agency and had been dragoman at Maskat and Bahrain, but he was not actually in our employ when he was killed. Agha Ibrahim was clerk of the Lingah Vice-Consulate and has left his family very badly off. The Acting Consul at Bushire suggests that £5,000 or Tomans 25,000 should be claimed from the Persian Government for the death of Agha Badr (on the analogy of Gholam Ali at Shiraz) and £2,000 or Tomans 10,000 for each of the brothers. £500 and £200, respectively, would be claimed for the relatives of each of the killed and wounded sepoys. While I concur in the suggested scale of compensation, as regards the victims who were in the service of His Majesty’s Government when they met their death I feel very doubt ful whether we can legitimately make a claim against the Persian Government on account of Khan Sahib Agha Ali’s family and dependent. Although there is as yet no proof that the attack in the course of which he lost his life was the work of enemy agents, Major Trevor thinks that it may fairly be attributed to them and I myself feel morally certain that this was so. Khan Sahib Agha Ali then suffered on account of his known connection and partizanship for us, and it would I think be politic in the circumstances if a compassionate grant of say £1,000 could be made to his family, which is left in very straitened circumstances. I should add that the title of Khan Sahib was conferred on Ali Agha for good work as Acting Residency Agent at Lingah and dragoman at Maskat and Bahrain. I have the honour to he, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, Charles M. Marling. The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart, K.G., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.

Am afraid I did not make it clear that prior to opening of Vice-Consulate in 1910 Khan Bahadur Agha Badr and his father before him were what we call Residency Agents at Lingah for 50 years or so. Post was started before we had Consular functions here and so was called Residency Agent, but it corresponded to Consular Agent. Agha Badr remained Residency Agent for the “ Shib Kuh ports ”, i.e , some ports and islands on coast of Pars between Lingah and Bushire* There are Hindu and Indian Muhammadan traders at many of these ports and Indian dhows trade with them, so there are frequent cases to attend to at one or other of them. Since establishment of Vice-Consulate whenever Agha Badr had to take charge of that his second brother Agha Ali used to do the “ Residency Agent ” work and go to the ports about cases, etc. So I think we could consider him in our employment at the time of his death.psnpMHMnnPVRf 3 183 No. 228 C., dated Bushire, the 27th June (received 4th July) 1916 (Confidential), From— Major A.

A democratic party was working on h en ua y against the British and Russians. Our Sufi was also with it, i C i^ 1 /' 0U ^ d 110 ^ ca ^ ck him then. When Wassmuss and three-four o a* 3 ! n (patriots) stepped in here, British influence w r as swept away n eiman Consulate established. But Mr. Wassmuss was transferred to us me an one by name Wustrou, a loafer, enemy of his own nation and a deserter, arrived m Shiraz. Perhaps he was of English blood. Seeing that he me ac neved success he thought of becoming himself king of the place, ersiansu em very much surprised to see this and w'ere badly impressed to take all Germans m the same light. The Indian “ Desh Bhagts ” advised them not to think much of it. Mr. Wustrou gave lot of money to the Shiraz aiy oi ee. Ihcre were some patriotic Persians in the force who believe^+w Hermans had come here to cause troubles and defeat to British and that Gei £ t j jiilitarv force and the democrats joined them. Mr^Wus'trou'told 0 them to arrest the English Consul and hand him over to Mr. vvustrou a inexperienced men m tlie force who at Gel , with the arrest and made the Consul over to Germans who wexe very gTad of it. The' Military force acted here against the wishes of the “Huhoomat” who stopped sending them money. The second deed was that Mr. Wustrou wrote to Kawam, the Governor here, that he (Kawam) had received money fropi the English and that he was their friend Kawam replied to say that he was no tnend ot English bu servant of his Government only. He did not know under whose orders he troops went to behave in the way they did. If it were under orders of the ‘ Hukoomat ” he should have received some telegraphic instructions The Consul replied that he understands it. When our “ Desh Bhagts and the old “ Tlesh Bhast,” a man of great experience in Persia especially in Shiraz, went te^ee Hie Consul we advised him to make the Kawam agree with us but the loafer (Mr Wustrou) remarked that Indians were all faithful friends of English and were'deceiving the German Government, a fact that he would report In his Government. This resulted in a friction between the Consul and ourselves and he may have reported ns as he liked. Mr. Wustrou instigated the Military force to surround the Governor^ house with a view to arrest the Governor who had many Persian followers with him. The Governor after a r* ht that lasted 12 days fled and went to Bushire via Bunder Abbns and be came a thick friend of the British. Mr. Wustrou at the head of the force went against the Democrats even* and started collecting money by force from the rmblic 'When the news reached Tehran, Russians at once brought 4,000 men and tok the “Hukoomat” of Tehran in their hands. The Persian Parliament is full of Russia’s friends. The German Minister at Tehran left the place. Instructions from Tehran to the effect that Russians were friends and that Russian troops will he sent to each and every city made the people of Shiraz shiver with terror. Russians at once proceeded and surrounded the road to Baghdad. Wustrou gave some “yarns” to Persians that he was going to Baghdad*to bring money and ammunition and cleared away. There was no costal communication and there was no news from any place. Kawam rime from South with Arabic troops and British munitions, Russians from North and Soulet-ud-Dauleh from west with Persian Turks and surrounded Shiraz which is now controlled by British Kawam fell from his horse and died.

Najef Kban (the Indian officer sent by Intelligence Branch with Kawam to Shiraz) in his report, dated 18th June states that among other things that— (1) Soulet is in brisk correspondence with Mirza Muzaffar Khan of the Bussian Consulate, Ispahan. (2) He has become great admirer of the Russians, he announced that Bussians captured Baghdad on 15th May and generally extols their prowess. (3) He and Kawam and other notables of Shiraz, are now more in favour of Bussians than ourselves. In a later report, which is dated 25th June, Najef writes — (1) That Kawam was ordered to make over arms and arsenal to Barman Barma’s deputy, but be declined on ground that his father gave us a receipt for the weapons. (2) That since this event there has been reapproachment between Kawam and Soulet and they have made posts and placed pickets of riflemen in various parts of the town. (3) That they have spread reports that Barman Barma has been killed on the way to Shiraz and there is trouble. Najef anticipates trouble in Shiraz. I am not in a position to say what reliance can be paid to these statements. Bact that Soulet is in correspond ence with Bussians and pleased in their kind treatment is confirmed by H. Malcolm.

Jume Khan,12 Ismailzai, has been summoned by General Dyer to come with armed force, and messages to Shabaz Khan and Jalal of Jalk have also been sent to join General Dyer with their lashkars. He considers, therefore, they may be depended on. The only cause which in my opinion would he likely to range Rekis or Ismailzai against us, is either a reverse in battle or prolonged inactivity. After the ambush, it was a Reczi who brought in 2 rifles and 4 stray horses. Summing up, if the 106th Pioneers can be kept at Khwash, this accession of strength puts matters on a safe footing; and I see no reason to think prospects are much worse than they were.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. y My telegram 441. Political situation is far from stable though there has been no further Turkish advance. Tehran and apparently many parts of country also have received news of reverse with considerable satisfaction. Kind of intrigue to which even Parman Parma is, I fear, not a stranger is on foot against cabinet which has been rapidly losing such popularity as it once possessed. It will be difficult to maintain present cabinet if Russians are compelled to retire again. It is difficult to forecast com position of a new ministry. A strong body of opinion in Tehran, however, realises that Turkish advance can only be temporary and sees the advantage of keeping on good terms with two Powers. This view is held by Bakhtiaris here and I believe, after having sounded them, that we could secure their loyal support; there is, however, strong disinclination on the part of Persian Govern ment based on personal feeling and interests which unfortunately has been receiving some countenance from Russian Legation. Russian Minister has been urged by me that we should send Jang and Bahadur to Bakhtiaristan. To this course he has agreed but only in event of Russian troops now at Ispahan being recalled. In the event of their being withdrawn Jang should I consider, be appointed Governor of Ispahan. This would tend to secure loyalty of tribe, but it would be distasteful to Minister for Poreio-n Affairs and to his father as well as to the Russians. &amp; Considerations of ill results, which would ensue in other parts of Persia particularly in Pars, if Bakbtiaris with whom we have such intimate relations should break away from us, influenced me in urging importance of securing this tribe. a Addressed to Foreign Office; sent to Petrograd, Basrah, Ispahan. 208 Telegram P., No. HI F., dated the 9th (received 10th) July 1916.

My telegram immediately preceding. Of effect on Pars situation of Russian retreat from Kermanshah I have no indications yet, but there as elsewhere it will have its contrecoup. Latest reports from Shiraz indicate that owing to movement among his own near relatives against him Soulet is more amenable. Kawam, who seems to some extent under Soulet’s influence, is loyal enough, but wishes to leave Shiraz and go to his summer quarters. No signs of uneasiness are hitherto evinced in Deputy Governor’s reports to Farman Farma. But Kermanshah news may shake whole, and as Soulet is very dis contented and is certainly in communication with German prisoners in Kawam’s hands, he may decide to take up German cause again and if he has time might seduce Kawam also. Though Deputy Governor can be trusted to make every effort to prevent this, he has only the loyal gendarmes under Fath-ul-Mulk to support his authority. His hands would, I think, be much strengthened if Gough now left Ispahan for Shiraz without waiting for Farman Farma. He informs me that road is at present safe. May I instruct Gough to proceed ?

Please see telegram, 1442, of July 9th, from Bushire. The proper course in my judgment is that negotiations should now be left in the hands of the military authorities under direction of Army Commander, as the Tangistani prisoners for exchange are military prisoners some of whom are now at Basrah and others on the way here from India. From his personal knowledge of Persia and of situation the General Officer Commanding at Bushire, General Douglas, is fully qualified to conduct these negotiations and will be in constant touch with Deputy Eesident. Seeing that we have 12 Tangistanis against 6 British, prisoners I presume that negotiations will start with endeavour to secure simple exchange and gradually increase inducement if it is probably necessary vide Army Com mander’s telegrams 3143 and 3187 to Chief of the General Staff.

You should reserve No. 3, which in any case should be conditional on continued good behaviour, for purposes of bargaining. You may concede full pardon if this is essential to release of prisoners, but a warning should be added that, if hereafter Khans misbehave, the promise will not hold good. In order that no question of a breach of faith may arise hereafter, this warning should be put in writing. 109 Telegram, No. 88 F., dated the 22nd (received 23rd) June 1916.

Out of the 10,000 tomans belonging to Sheikh Hussain which was depo sited with Rais-ut-Jujjar here and attached during occupation, about 2,000 were paid out to British subjects as compensation for horses and other property carried off by Sheikh Hussain’s raiding parties. Should I offer him balance remaining or return whole sum intact? In last letter Khans have not specifically mentioned assurances of pardon. Perhaps they think (and they would not in my opinion be far wrong if they do) that reopening of road and resumption of friendly relations with their tribesmen would preclude hostile action—or perhaps our (from their point of view) pusillanimous inaction here has induced such contempt for us that they think that they have nothing to fear from us. The Khans made such a point of pardon however until recently that I think that first alternative is correct one, though perhaps they will raise question again during negotiations.

Although one hearsay report mentioned three parties most reports indicated that mission left in two only. With regard to the discrepancy between number of Germans remaining in Kabul and number leaving, this is due to the fact that in earlier reports officers and subordinates were not distinguished. It is shown by credible reports that only 5 officers were in Kabul, remainder being subordinates or servants. It is reported that with each party which left Kabul there are a few subordinates or servants. Names of the 5 chief members of the mission are Niedermeyer II, Yon Hentig, Bayer, Wagner and Yoight or Eolkner. The following may explain the splitting up of mission and roundabout routes taken:— The Germans are reported to be systematically collecting information about Afghanistan. 123 Telegram P., No. 90, dated the 23rd (received 25th) June 1916.

Your telegram No. 78 to Government of India. Censor has intercepted letter concealed in newspaper^ addressed to Mr. Lewis, 436 Hill Street, San Francisco from Indian seditionists at Shiraz. {The address is that of seditious newspaper “ Ghadr ”, we believe.) W inter says that Sufi is arrested, that they badly need money to secure his escape and prevent their own arrest. They ask that money should be sent care of Haji Company (Safa) or care of Ghulam Ali Behbehani, Shiraz, by cheque. Shiraz representative of this Behbehani firm, Haji Ghulam Hussein, was local Turkish representative there and has given lot of trouble. I suggest Deputy Governor-General and Kawam should be instructed to put screw on this individual and make him divulge where seditionists are concealed. Pressure might also be put on Mirza Muhammad Hussein, Spinafarosh, who is mentioned as receiving letters for them. If found, they should be arrested.. Other intercepted letters show that there are three at large whose Indian names are Kader Khan, Ali Khan and Kader Ali Khan and of whom first two now style themselves Mahommed Ali Khan and Mahommed Hussein Khan. Letter is long rambling account of recent events at Shiraz. Writer has apparently great admiration for Wassmuss and contempt for his successor Wustrow. It is important that these rascals should be arrested as letter men tions that they are trying to get round Najef Khan and Indian gunners and soldiers sent with Kawam.

Donlat Khan, inhabitant of Dera Ismail Khan and an Afghan Maldar, arrived here yesterday reporting that he was with caravan from Quetta to Sistan in February which was attacked by Sarhaddis and looted. . He fled to Afghanistan and arrived Girishk about IVlarch 15th. At that time Afghans believed Germans to have joined Sarhaddis and to have cut communications between India and Sistan also that Germans were successfully advancing on India. At end of April news reached Afghanistan of conquest of Sarhad by British and of submission of Jiand and death of his son. This news was at once despatched to Kabul. At that time the last party of Germans to enter Afghanistan, three in number, were constructing a fort at Kalalnkang near Nasratabad and also were enlisting men in their service. Amir on receiving new r s of British conquest of Sarhad sent orders at once forbidding men to enlist under Germans and ordered Germans to proceed Kabul. Latter started under escort for Kabul. Another order from Amir reached them en route saying that Germans already in Kabul had been ordered to leave Afghanistan and to join part Y of three who were then en route for Kabul whole party were to be escorted bv Afghan troops to frontier. Amir ordered no person was to speak to Germans. When^Germans were preparing Kalahikang Fort, Afghan Sardars of Helmund District were preparing to attack and raid British posts and Line of Communi cation west of Quetta. This news reached Amir who immediately ordered Gov ernor Kandahar, to arrest those Sardars and send them to Kabul. Ibis was done ’ Amir also issued decree that any person spreading rumours re hostility■ . I ' 1 ' 1 ' ll ' 'between Britisli and Afghans was to be fined 100 rupees and sent to Kabul as a prisoner.

Dated the 12th June 1916. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To— Zair Khidar, Tangistan. After compliments .—I have received your letter of the 7th Shabban in which you give an awswer to my letter of 3rd Shabban and also allude to my letter of the 1st Rajab. You inform me that the reason you did not reply was because my letter was threatening. You are, however, aware that I am here a servant of the British Govern ment and what I said in my letter of the 1st Rajab was what I was authorised to say by the High Government. The remarks are not in point of fact threats but simple statements of fact. It is a fact that the longer you keep the British Consul and colony of Shiraz prisoners the more displeased will the Persian and British Governments be, and consequently, as I remarked, the worse it will be for you. Am I to understand from your letter that you decline to make simple exchange of the British prisoners for the Tangistani prisoners without other conditions ? Is so, am I right in understanding that you now propose to make a settle ment on the basis of exchange of prisoners plus return of the goods confiscated and that all extraneous questions such as friendly or hostile relations between the British Government and yourselves the route for caravans, etc., are eliminated ? I wish to get this answered clearly and definitely so that I may telegraph to the British Minister at Tehran and the British Government stating what your proposals are. Enclosure No. 3. Telegram, No. 229—1285, dated the 16th June 1916. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran [repeated Basrah, India (by post) ]. Following received secretly to-day from O’Connor for you, dated Ahram, 11th June:— Begins. I gather from Major Trevor that no effective action is likely on the part of the Persian Government. If this is so, or if any such possible action seems likely to be unduly delayed, may I venture to hope that Your Excellency will instruct Bushire authorities to endeavour to arrange matter with Khans on some such lines as those which I have already suggested. I will also do my best here to induce Khan of this place to listen to reason but ever since threats launched against him by General Officer Commanding,T~ 8 Bushire and futile raid wliich took place on April 27tli he has become very suspicious and settlement which was at that time within sight has been rendered much more difficult. If Khans should now insist ou some assurance of future safety as one of conditions for releasing us, I venture to submit, for consideration, whether it might not be preferable even to ao-ree to this rather than to permit indefinite detention here of British Consul and subjects under such humiliating conditions. Punishment of Khans could in that case be left to Persian Government whenever it is in a position to take action and in any case they will presumably be made to pay indemnities which we shall eventually require for our illegal imprisonment and moral and intellectual damages. I earnestly trust that Your Excellency will five the question your consideration and will issue such instructions as vou consider advisable for guidance of Bushire authorities.. And I. again venture to urge that, if this has not already been done, langistani piisoners may be brought immediately to Bushire and held there in readiness for ex change whenever matter has been arranged. O Connor. Unds. Enclosure No. 4. Telegram, No. 230—1286, dated the 16th June 1916. From— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, rp 0 Hi s Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran [repeated Basrah and India (by post)]. My immediately preceding telegram. As stated in my telegram 217 I wrote to Zair Khidar asking for a reply to my letter of May 4th, and ou June 10th I received vague and insolent reply. I have now asked him to state definitely whether he would agree to an exchange of prisoner or not. I am afraid I do not anticipate any satisfactory reply as Wassmuss will probably try and prevent it even if Khans are prepared to agree. I think Colonel O’Connor is under misapprehension when he says agree ment was nearly reached at end of April. Khans were at that time demanding assurance of immunity from punishment in letters to me though apparently point was not mentioned to O’Connor. To yield to this demand would in my humble opinion transfer the humiliation to the British Government. I may mention that another man who came from Ahram yesterday con firms report that prisoners are well treated, and are allowed to bathe daily and “ play ball” : they get their drinking water from Ali Changi spring, the best anywhere in these parts. They can buy provisions and receive stores, papers and books from here and letters from home fairly regularly. In these circum stances, the extreme irksomeness of their detention and the climate seem to be the chief hardships they have to endure. I do not see that their imprisonment is more humiliating than that of many other prisoners. I had been working for some time with headmen on Dashti border to be ready to receive prisoners should they escape, and with some success. But in his letter to me O’Connor says “ two or three of us could escape easily enough, but whole party cannot possibly do so and I fear those left behind might be ill-treated”. He does not say why whole party cannot escape, but apparently idea of escaping has been dropped. Beason why Tangistani prisoners were sent away in first instance and why they have not been got back here is because we have no suitable sate place to keep them and fear they might escape. Enclosure No. 5. Dated the 15th Shabban, 1334 [=17th (received 18th) June 1916]. From— Zair Khidar, Tangistani, To— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Your letter, dated the 14th Shabban (16th June), has reached me. I have Understood its contents, and am much obliged. » rAs regards the matter of the conditions of peace and general tranquillity, you had asked for explanations. The simple truth is what you have written yourself. Firstly .—The opening of the “ Shahi ” route, and the traffic to and fro of the poor people of Tangistan and Chahkutah, and relieving the people from the suspense. Secondly.—The exchange of the captives on both sides, and the return of the money of Shaikh Hussain Khan, and the tea confiscated in Bahrain. As at present you feel inclined to make peace and restore tranquillity, therefore, on this side also, we have been and are inclined towards a general peace and tranquillity. I am awaiting your answer. (Sd.) Httssain, Chahkutahi (not Shaikh H.’s writing). Khidar, Tangistani.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I can see no considerations urged in your telegram No. r 8 - 8 - 8 (133S ?) which had not occurred to me and therefore probably also to Foreign Office and India Office. I see no analogy with case of British ladies at Baghdad and if there is any I fail to see its application. As to your numbered points :— 1. You take it for granted Khans will escape punishment. 2. Surely not with some 20 Germans and Austrians in prison at Shiraz. 3. Again you take their immunity for granted. 4. They will not have much success with Persian Government, but they may do a little in way of exactions for time. 5. Not more so than by our persistent inaction. 6. I doubt it. Khans are making nothing out of their capture. I have also more faith than you in P(arman) F(arma) taking action against them. 7. I concur entirely. 8. We have got to bear consequences of our previous inaction even if it affects our police scheme. 9. Possibly for a time. 10. See 5 and 8. I think you are overlooking the circumstances attending the whole of the Pars question and are forgetting that movement against us was engineered by foreign agents who spent lavishly and was backed by gendarmerie. Such a state of things is not likely to recur, and I am not apprehensive without such instigation and support Khans wdll find courage to defy us in future.. If they do, I presume Government of India will welcome opportunity of giving them lesson. In the circumstances you should open negotiations at once.

Direct route probably quite feasible and wishes of His Majesty’s Government shall be carried out at earliest possible date, though longer route seems to me better for reasons given. Am ordering mule transport from Ispahan and Shiraz, as it is procurable locally in very small quantity only. I will try to lay out supplies to Niriz, but supplies from Shiraz to Niriz must be laid out. Sirjan-Niriz section very difficult for troops. Lorimer must obviously take over charge, his being delayed causes heavy strain. Date of starting depends on his arrival and on activity of F(arman) E(arma) perhaps late July possible. I might march ahead to Shiraz from Sirjan with mounted troops if country quiet. There is some risk of course in leaving Kerman so soon with only 25 sowars for Consul, but I cannot afford to weaken the column further. Presence of column at Shiraz will reopen Bushire route I hope. As regards Bunder Abbas, road to Daulatabad can only be held by hot countryman so propose that Buck should command as per my telegram of June 18th, No. 236, Durham will shortly proceed to Kerman. Two British officers, 20 Indian instructors, about 250 Persians is the present strength. 134 Telegram R., No. 285 C., dated the 27th (received 2£th) June 1916. From— Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Kerman, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Journey to Shiraz by direct route depends greatly on quickness of Farman to lay out supplies between Shiraz and Niriz at stages about 12 miles apart and with double supplies at larger centres. I will try to arrange for supplies as far as Niriz. Two postal sowars should be posted at each stage. Farman should arrange immediately for Mamur’s responsibility for good behaviour of tribes and supplies to start for Sirjan and Kerman to meet me. They should bring 300 mules for use of column. __ Grahame to provide the balance. Farman should arrange for N amen building and garden for gendarmerie and headquarters garden and buildings to be made ready for us. Addressed to Tehran.

The halt or two days at Sarrsil vr erind enabled the Turks to retire with almost all their transport and the whole or their Torce. The cavalry mirmiit was hair-hearted. The two columns which had been sent to the Perth of the Bagdad road wandered about in the hills and arrived too lat© to cut off the retreat of the Turks.

In continuation of my telegram No. 372 G. of to-day’s date, I have tFe honour to enclose translations of the unofficial letter addressed to me by the Karguzar (and Acting Deputy Governor) of Sistan and its enclosure about the refusal of Sardar Khudadad Khan, Narui, to pay revenue. 2. I will do my best to make the Sardar act reasonably, though he has always been rather contumacious and independent. I can hardly address him, however, until I know whether he considers himself also to have been made a British subject or protege, as he claims that General Dyer has made the Sarhad Sardars.

After compliments. —I beg to trouble you in continuation of my verbal representation of yesterday and submit herewith a copy of the Eevenue Department’s letter. I request respectfully that you will take necessary action to achieve the desired thing.— Usual ending. Sub-enclosure. Copv of a letter from the Revenue Director, Sistan, to the Deputy Governor, Sistan, No. 634, dated the 2nd Jauza 1295 (23rd May 1916). I heg to inform you that Sardar Khudadad Khan is entirely unwilling to pay Government revenues. The late Finance Agent had also complained against his evil actions and the file of his disobediences is complete in this department. I am also very annoyed on account of his improper acts and have particularly complained to the Ministry of Revenue, Tehran. As this is the time for the gathering of produce, I trouble you in order to acquit myself of the responsibility, and request you to help and assist actively in the recovery of the revenues. As his affair was settled last year also by the assistance of the Hukumat (Deputy Governor), that office (ILukumat) should assist like then, so that perhaps the Government revenues may be recovered. In this case it is good that you should summon either Sardar Khudadad Khan himself or his brother, so that with your co-operation I may find out his outstandings for the past and the present year. He may then return home after settling his affair. This man has clearly been evading payment of revenues and is not obedient. This rests with the Government office to bring him to book. The sooner vou take steps, the more effectively will you be safeguarding the Government interests, and you will confer obligation on me. I await your energetic measures and the result of the same. 64 No 374 C., dated Sistan, the 25th May (received 13th June) 1916. From-LIEUTENANT-COLONEL F. B.

I do not know yet whether the Indo-European Telegraph Department will insist on the charge of the line being entrusted to some other petty Sardar, but if they do, the feasibility of rewarding Ali Shah Khan (to the latter’s satisfaction) in the event of his rendering good service as a News Agent in the near future becomes rather remote. 3.

Sardar Khudadad Khan did very good service indeed, and quite deserved the reward he received. Ali Shah was not well received by me, nor have I re engaged him, but I told him to go away and try to redeem his character by doing what he can to help my Intelligence Officer as his future will depend on what he does. He receives no pay. I will be glad to make use of your News Agent at Dehaneh Baghi, if he will place himself in touch with me at Khwash. 65 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. H. 5037, dated the 13th June 1916.)

Your telegram 205 C. of May 25th. At this stage broad scheme and broad estimates are all that is required, and it is hoped that practical experience you have now gained will enable you to draw up general scheme for permanent policing South Persia. Object of Military Police is to replace rebel gendarmerie to restore order in South Persia generally and especially on the main trade routes, to rehabilitate British prestige and to balance Russian Cossack force in the north. Your proposals should now be telegraphed indicating in particular (1) approximate number of officers and men you consider required, (2) general distribution, and (3) main rates of pay and terms of service. As regards (1), we should regard 10,000 as limit up to which we reserve right ultimately to raise the force; for the present we should legislate only for the practical needs of the more immediate future. Escort and special instruc tional staff can presumably be dispensed with once force is started. As regards (2), policing of main trade routes, Bunder Abbas-Kerman and Bushire-Shiraz roads and possibly beyond to north, is immediate objective. Largish garrisons will, therefore, be required probably at main towns with smaller posts at intermediate stations. As regards (3), pay should probably not materially exceed pay of late gendarmerie, service should apparently be for anywhere in Persia and be non- pensionable. Proposals now asked for are separate from detailed budget estimate of your proposed expenditure for current year, which is under separate consideration. 73 Telegram R., No. 224 C., dated the 15th (received 16th) June 1916. From— Brigadier General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Kerman, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Prospect of raising Police in this Province excellent owing to my long residence in it. In Shiraz I am unknown, population unfriendly. Prom point of view of raising Police, consider it most important to enlist considerable force here before attempting Pars where conditions are distinctly unfavour able, moreover I cannot absorb 100 at liberty dismissed gendarmes into a new force except at considerable risk to prospects (of ?) scheme. Owing to Parran being only officer available for superintending drill, propose to utilize officers and non-commissioned officers of column with approval of their Officer Commanding. Allowances would be given. 74 Telegram P., No. 411 C., dated the 15th (received 16th) June 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Baluchistan; and sent to General Officer Com manding, Kacha Koh, by post). Is there in opinion of Government of India real likelihood of Turco- German Mission attempting to return from Afghanistan to Persia ? To me it seems most improbable.My ideas as to withdrawal of troops from Birjand to Sarhad where they are needed, and those at Neh to Bandan as soon as levies can take over line are being invited by General Officer Commanding, Kacka. I believe levy corps can almost take over sole charge of this province when more officers arrive. I propose to offer to relieve Biriaud detachment at once. On my proposals to recruit more Hazaras and also one hundred Bahluris I would be glad to receive orders of Government of India (vide mv telegram, dated the 31st May, No. 388 C). V 1 Hazara recruits would be quietly and individually enlisted through levies now in corps. We could let troops at Neh and Sistan withdraw entirely to Sarhad if mv Consular Guard of 20 men from 106th Hazara Pioneers could be increased to 100 men. 75 Telegram P., No. 13 F., dated (and received) the Idth June 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Meshed, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Your telegram, 411 C. of the 14th June. If German Mission are dissatisfied with their treatment in Afghanistan, they will very probably try to escape though I cannot say whether they are returning to Persia. There is also the chance that they are being expelled by the Amir. Proposal to remove regular troops from cordon is in my opinion most inopportune and Bussians will probably protest strongly especially as the first troops to he relieved are those in immediate touch with them and are at most probable point of German exit. Levies should not, I think, be left on such an extended line without a stiffening of regulars, though I hesitate to judge the former not having seen them.

Pour weeks have elapsed since he received £5,000 agreed to in your telegram 157 S. of 9th May and it is very expedient to continue giving him evidence of our support and confidence especially as Soulet’s attitude is still dubious. I recommend that a further £5,000 of £20,000 destined for this purpose be sent to him at once to be followed, as occasion demands, by further doles. 78 Telegram P., No., 14 F., dated the 16th (received 17th) June 1916.

Telegram No. B. M. 29 of 11th June to Chief of the General Staff and Baluchistan from General Dyer. Sarhaddis, it appears, are not carrying out undertaking made on April 30th which becomes null and void accordingly. South Persia Military Police force will eventually comprise 10,000 men, I understand. No permanent settlement which will restrict liberty of action of police force hereafter should, I suggest, be made with Sarhaddis. Unless Government of India are prepared to subsidise Sarhaddis annually to extent of value of booty which they gain by raids, it seems undesirable to recognise immutability and correctness of axiom mentioned in the beginning of Dyer’s telegram. If our levies and troops along the frontier can prevent Sarhaddis invading British territory, it is apparently best to temporise with them until next autumn only when Sykes may he able to co-operate as proposed in his telegram to Government of India, dated the 24th April, No. 58 C. Birjand and Sistan Governors have respectfully addressed me about re- covering flocks looted three years ago and recently; I am sure that Persian Government will be stirred up to action if our settlement takes no notice of their claims. If Government of India has undertaken to police Southern Persia with consent of Persian Government our final arrangements with the tribes should not be secret from that Government as it seems to me. 80 Telegram R., No. 83, dated the 17th (received 18th) June 1916.

(2) Exchange of captives on both sides and return of Sheikh Hussein’s money and his own tea. Letter purports to be signed by (?) Sheikh Hussein also, hut signature is not in his writing. Change ordered in terms is due I think to fact that people of Tangistani are feeling the pinch, no trade and smuggling to great extent stopped.

I said such a proposal had been made hut had not been sanctioned so far as I knew and that I had protested against it. To any weakening of our cordon at present he was very strongly opposed and I fully agree with him. Desperate though the attempt seems to he, I do not think that it is safe to conclude that Turco- German Mission will not try to escape through Persia.

Enclosure No. 4. Translation of a letter from Major A. P. Trevor, C.I E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Zair Khidar, Ahram, dated the 4th May 1916. I have received vour letter of the 28th Jamadi ath Thani regarding Colonel O’Connor and the other members of the Shiraz British Colony whom you describe as your guests. I have to inform you that I have been authorized by His Biitanric Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to inform you that if you will send Colonel O’Connor and the eight other prisoners now with you to Sar-i-Bast and hand them over to the military authorities, the British authorities guarantee to release Khalu Hussain and the eight other Tangistani prisoners as soon as the latter can be got back from India where they now are. I strongly advise you to do this : if you do not, it will be the worse for you and for your tribesmen. The General Officer Commanding agrees to suspend any further military action for five days (from to-day) to give you time to send Colonel O’Connor and the other prisoners across. If you do not do it within that time, he does not bind himself to refrain any longer from severe measures. , 239 Telegram R., No. 2281, dated the 16th (received 17th) May 1916.

Please compare views expressed in Minister’s 260 F. of April 22nd on same subject. Having regard to them it is difficult to understand Minister’s making such a recommendation as that contained in concluding paragraph of bis 331 F. and strongly deprecate acceptance of Khan’s conditions which could only be regarded as complete wiping of slate and would quite preclude any further action against them.) s l n 240 Telegram : R., No. 1118, dated the 17th (received 18th) May 1916.

Venture to suggest that grant of charge of Bushire-Shiraz road to Soulet should be made conditional on his taking active •steps to release prisoners and assist us. If he cannot do anything in my humble opinion there seems to be no advantage in placing road in his charge when sooner or later (I gather from your telegram No. 338 F. it will probably be sooner), it is proposed to install military police. I find on going into the question that on previous occasions when Soulet had charge of road he diverted it to Firuzabad and other routes; he never actually gnamed the Shahi” (Borasjun, Kazerun, et cetera) route. If Sonlet does nothing, I venture to think that it would be better to punish Khans up to Daliki and then open road and let it take care of itself until we can put in military police.

Following from Noel at Oil Fields “ As result of conversations with Ilkhani and Illbegi, I make following observations on Bakhtiari affairs as they appear to me: . * “Tribal situation in Chahar Mahal is uncertain and from our point of view unsatisfactory. Khans are genuinely afraid that subserviency to our interests involves rendering of such services as arrest of Said Esa as associating them selves with us in breaking up of Salar Maksuds party, &amp;c., will lie aore to involve them in unpleasant and probably serious difficulties with other Khans. They are, therefore, most anxious to obtain from us some guarantee of support. Questioned as to nature of support they hope for from us both Khans ask that British Officer with usual Consular escort should accompany them to Ailaqu and afford them same measure of assistance as that accorded to Jang bv Grev They point out that Germans and Persian agitators have taken refuge‘in Bakhtiari country and that it is not within their powers to object them without some overt sign of assistance from us. That this is p n ume opinion of Khans is confirmed by conversation planned by telephone between Mujahid and Muntazim-ed-Dowleh which we made arrangements to overhear. My proposals will follow. .

He thinks me inconsistent apparently, hut he has not sufficiently noted change of conditions, I think. Operations by our troops inland has been consistently opposed by Government of India so that I was forced to conclusion that only instrument in our hands against Khans was Soulet-ed-Dowleh, in the absence of any intimation to the contrary and with season advanced beyond time indicated in Bushire telegram 179—1032 (1 ?). There seemed fair prospect of securing his assistance up to April 22nd and even after. To re-establish his loyalty in eyes of Persian Government and ourselves was clearly in his interests and he expressed his readiness to act. Then came a change in his attitude. Kawam’s death gave him greater import ance : he saw his own importance and before taking steps began to bargain asking for £20,000 down. Persian Government and all our friends here were convinced that he would take money and do nothing, and begged me not to agree. In this attitude he was also confirmed by the Chagedak raid and scuttle, as it led him to think that we had no serious intention of taking action our selves. It came, however, to his knowledge that we knew all his connections with rebel Khans and he has now doubt of our attitude towards him. Nor does the raid appear to have impressed the hostile Khans themselves : all Persian opinion here condemns it as a dangerous (expedient ?) and the question has been put to us whether military authorities had no consideration for life of Consul. Proper policy was strong line with Khans so long as we had a fair prospect of backing it up by force but no longer. Not that 1 have yet abandoned it, as with appointment of Parman Parma I can discern slight alteration for the better in Soulet-ed-Dowleh, to obtain whose co-operation I am making further attempt with Farman Parma’s advice and with Kawam’s support locally. But if it fails and if His Majesty’s Government is not prepared to take adequate action at Bushire, we must either (as it appears to me) negotiate with Khans and make considerable concession or else resign ourselves to leaving captives in hands of Khans in circumstances of great hardship for large part of summer with no corresponding advantage to ourselves. Indication that some kind of action from Bushire is under consideration has just reached me. I trust that this is so and that it will be adequate. I shall continue my negotiations with Soulet-ed-Dolweh (from whom I expect to get a reply in a day or two) in the meantime.

Following from O’Connor '.—Begins. “ Situation here at present is as follows : The two Khans responsible for our detention are now only too anxious to come to terms with British' IS authorities and only question is how matter should he settled. They express themselves as wdiing and indeed anxious to enter into most friendly relations with British, but at the same time they are very suspicious and refuse to release I I x unless certain conditions are agreed to first. I have already submitted certain proposals, for consideration, but some of these do not appear to be acceptable, and after further discussion with the Khans I venture now ao-ain to submit matter to you. b “ Khans are willing to release us— u (1) exchange for Tangistani prisoners; , “ ( 2 ) on receipt of an assurance to repay 10,000 tomans confiscated from Sheikh Hussain and release of consignment of tea valued at some 15,000 tomans for which Zair Khidar is standing security; and “ (3) they also ask for an assurance that main Bushire-Borasjun road may be opened for traffic as before. “ I venture to invite your favourable consideration to these proposals. Their acceptance will secure our immediate release and will terminate highly undesirable state of friction which has agitated all this part of Southern Persia for nearly a year past and at the same time it leaves the way open for any future settlement between ourselves and the Khans which may appear desirable later op. You are of course best judge as to whether settlement on these lines and release of myself and other British subjects here is desirable or whether it is considered preferable that we should be detained here pending employment of other means for our liberation. No doubt your decision will be arrived at on general grounds, but I venture very respectfully to urge claim of our small party here to have our personal interests taken into sympathetic consideration should these not clash with public policy. “ With reference to details of proposed conditions— “ (1) I am enclosing to Resident details of 16 prisoners whom Khans claim in exchange for us. I suggest that these should be brought to Bushire as soon as possible and date fixed by Resident for exchange to take place. “ (2) I presume it will be considered preferable to release money and goods in question rather than to keep British subjects indefinitely in confine ment under conditions utterly unsuited to health and well-being of Europeans especially, as no direct loss is thereby involved to British Government. “ (3) On cessation of hostilities there can, I presume, be no objection to resumption of traffic by main road. “ I am fully aware of certain objections which exist to this or any similar arrangement, but, in view of the whole circumstances of the case and of certain views which I knew you to entertain six months ago, I venture to hope that you will now approve of settlement being arrived at on some such lines as these with the least possible delay. Should you regard proposals favourably, I venture to beg that you will issue necessary instructions to Bushire author ities as soon as possible. w Abram, 8th May.
