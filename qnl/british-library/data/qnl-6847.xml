MESOPOTAMIA ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE. Ureonn]. V hen General Maude first took over the Command of this (. lorce) the political machinery id the Basra vilayet was firmly established and working smoothly, while on the Tigris front no political issues of any importance were arising so that up to the time of our arrivaj here, and indeed up to the time of Secretary of State’s telegram of 20th March regarding future administration of this country, I have had little opportunity to gauge his attitude in regard to political questions. Since then, however, political problems have been continually arising, and I feel it my duty to acquaint His Majesty s (lovernment with the position which has become unsatisfactory from a political point of view. (General Maude’s military successes have established his reputation as a soldier beyond all criticism, but he is purely a soldier and without any previous experience of the East or of Orientals, and I find him, as is only natural, unsympathetic and somewhat intolerant in regard to political problems and unable to appreciate important bearing of apparently simple problems of daily occurrence on larger political and even military interests. With the limited power which I at present possess as his Chief Political Officer, which gives me no right to report to Government, and having regard to his pronounced divergence of outlook, I find myself unable to make good the undertaking which I have given to Government to allow nothing to be done calculated to prejudice their declared policy, and I realise that if that policy is to be safeguarded, I must be placed in a stronger position vis-d-vis the Army Commander, and at any rate to be given right to send a regular report weekly or fortnightly to higher authority to keep them au fait with current questions and at large. As His Majesty’s Government are aware, I have no ulterior ambitions here, and am quite ready to resign if that course is convenient to them, but if it is desired that 1 should remain, my hands must be strengthened. If this could best be done by making me High Commissioner nominally, I woidd no longer oppose it provided it is under stood that it does not connote any more extensive introduction of Arab administration than was recently agreed upon, but simply placing His Majesty’s Government in a better position to keep themselves closely informed of political developments in the new territory. If the [? portent (sic)] of my being made High Commissioner could be limited as above, I do not think Army Commander would raise any-objection. There had better be no increase in pay as it would bring mine to more than his. I should, of course, give him copies of my reports, but mere fact of my having right to [? differential treatment] would serve both as a safeguard and as a safety valve. It could be done in connection with arrival of General Clayton without giving rise to controversy. Failing some such action on above lines, I think it would be better if I were relieved. SIR P. COX’S POSITION. 1. From Si r P - Cox to Secretary of State, 25th May HH7. (Repeated to Government of India.)2 From Viceroy, 20th May 191/. Private. Reference Cox’s personal telegram of 25th May regarding his relations with Maude. 1 think it would be best lor Cox to come heie and explain his grounds of complaint which appear somewhat vague. 1 his would also give him much needed change and rest and modus operandi ndght thus more easily bo arrived at. If you agree I propose to ask Maude to allow Cox to come here at once to discuss matters connected nith politics and administration of Mesopotamia. Meantime orders on Cox s telegram cVinnlfl hp nost/ooned. o fj. From Secretary of State to 1 iceroy, .&gt;lst May 191. Private. Your private telegram dated 29th May. Cox. 1 agree to your consulting Maude. How long would Cox be absent? If Maude agrees, what arrangements are proposed for Cox’s work while away ? 1 lease let me know result of reference to Maude and await my final decision. 4. I'rom Secretary of State to Sir F. Cox, 1st June 1917. Personal. Your telegram dated 25th May. Disposal of question will take time. But you may be sure that it will be considered with every desire to make your position as satisfactory, as possible. 5. From Mr. Stores (Basra) to Sir li. Graham, Foreign Office, 3rd June 1917. Personal and Private. I have had opportunity of studying in detail the actual political situation in Bagdad. Consider you ought to know that owing to unsympathetic attitude of the Military to the Chief Political Officer’s advice and recommendations we are in danger of losing ground with the population, on the whole very friendly disposed, with grave prejudice to present and subsequent policy as enunciated by His Majesty’ Government. Prestige of Chief Political Officer is very high throughout the country and anything done to strengthen his hand would tend to strengthen our hold on the sympathies of the best and most powerful elements, without being in any way incompatible with the necessary supremacy of the Military. 6 . From Viceroy, Oth June 1917. Private and Secret. Your telegram of 31st May. Cox. Before consulting Maude I thought it advisable to sound Cox privately on suggestion. He telegraphs as follows, 5th June:—“Private and personal. Absence from here now for purpose of visit to Simla would be most inconvenient to me personally, and in my judgment inexpedient official!v, and I beg that the suggestion be not pursued.3 “ |' rom Personal point of view. I am in best of health and hope to remain so if I stay where I am. hven if I were only to stay at Simla the inside of 3 week, I could not be back in less than six weeks, and that after a punishing journey through the Gulf in worst part of the hot weather, and with the prospect of great accumulation of work to cope with oh return. Officially. Important Sheikhs are here or are expected with whom negotiations are in progress, and difficult political issues frequently arise, which it is not fair to leave a junior officer (to) deal with. Position is simply this : In case of present Army Commander it is doubtful whether the status ami functions of the Chief Civil Official are sufficient to ensure that the civil and political interests of the State in these territories, present and future, are sufficiently safeguarded. You therefore propose to take Chief Civil Official away for a couple of months, leaving the strings in the hands of some young officer with no weight at all. A good deal of harm might be done, and in any case I should find my position all the more unsatisfactory on my return . “ If you desire fuller information, I suggest my sending you a liaison officer for a visit. We have recently iiad a visit from Storrs, liaison officer from Egypt, with beneficial results. “ I do not wish to complain or enter into controversy over past issues, but to safeguard the future. General Clayton, who will soon be arriving as my deputy, will bring with him a detached point of view which will be a source of strength to me, and it would seem a natural course for His Majesty’s Government to inform us in connection with his arrival or independently that they need to be kept up to date in regard to political and administrative developments, and would like a fortnightly progress report. Army Commander could hardly object to that. The question of my personal status is quite a secondary one, and I beg that it may not prejudice main issue. “ If your suggestion regarding my coming to Simla is made with knowledge of India Office, I beg that this may be repeated to them.” No particular advantage would be gained from liaison officer. Suggestion that you should call for fortnightly progress report would seem to meet the case for the time being.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000299_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B261</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000299</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B261</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mesopotamia Administration Committee.
