My dear MOTOR LAUNCH n GHAZAL' Yesterday a representative of the Naval Officer- In-Charge, Bahrain, telephoned for particulars of the Company launches in Bahrain and was informed that we have one launch only. He stated that the information was urgently required by the Senior Naval Officer, Basrah, to whom the information on all Bahrain launches was to be telegraphed. 2. It would seem highly probable that this information is required in connection with plans to collect all available launches for some branch of the Services. There seems a possibility, therefore, that our launch may be 'requisitioned” or 'seized'. 3. As you know we are entirely dependent on the 'Ghazal' for our contacts with C-atar. These contacts consist of regular visits to our camps and to the Ruler, and these visits are essential. Pay must be taken to our employees and there are also quarterly and annual payments to be made to the Shaikh involving the transport of large sums of money. The launch is used by the Company representative as living quarters during such visits. As you know Qatar has no regular service of steamers and hired craft are unsuitable, even if procurable, in these days. Also there is con siderable risk involved in the use of local boats. 4. In addition to our Qatar visits we have to deliver money to many of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs in connection with our various concessions and options. Air and steamer services have proved unsatisfactory and we anticipate having to use the 'Ghazal' for these contacts P.T.O.also. 7e need hardly say that local hired craft are entirely unsuitable for these protracted journeys eai'iieuiasiy either in winter or summer. 5. In these circumstances we wish to bring it to notice, before any action is taken, that this launch which is specially constructed for our purposes is essential to the Company to enable it to fulfil its concession obligations, and the Company, therefore, would deem it necessary to protest most strongly against any seizure. 6 . 7/e do not know on what authority seizures or requisitions can be made in Bahrain but if you are involved or consulted we should be most grateful if the Company T s position can be fully explained to those concerned. Yours sincerely, Major T. Hickinbotham C.B.E., TT .B. ' T s Political Agent, Bahrain.Bahrain would like to come into the scheme ii it is put into operation: but there appear to be certain inherent dangers and difficulties/in the scheme:- (i) Presumably orders regarding Kuwaiti dnows issued by the Shaikh of Kuwait could not be enforced against dhows already under charter for voyages other than between India ana the Persian null. ^iij If this presumption is correct, the Natcnodas oi Kuwaiti dhows, resenting interference with txheir liberty of movement, would very likely go to Basra ana charter their craft to tne I.W.T. By this means they would be / certain of making good profits whereas, if they are limited to, say, the Karachi - Kuwait run, they would be at a disadvantage in settling terms with the Karachi exporter, (m) Nakhodas of dhows already in Indian ports might deliberately, when nearing of the Shaikh of Kuwait f s orders, confine themselves to the Indian coastal trade or the African trade lest tneir return to the tiulf should bring them under restrictive control. (ivj Certain quota goods - e.g. Hour ana sugar - are best shipped by steamer and not by dhow. On txhe other hand, timber and cement (which are urgent necessities but not quota goods) are best shipped by dhow rather than by steamer It would be a pity, therefore, ii a dhow cargo of timber were T shut out’ by a cargo oi sugar. # Nothing but benefit would oe de)Til/ed from a scheme which ensured that all Kuwaiti dhows calling at Karachi get into touch with the Kuwait agent there, so that essential rather than non-essential goods were shipped to the uulf from that Port. But I am doubtful of tne advantages to be derived from any greater measure of restriction or control, which might well have an effect the opposite of that desired. As I stated at the beginning or this note, Bahrain will gladly take part in the scheme if it is decided to£°ey- Telegram 3.

I have the honour to forv/ard, for your information, a copy of a preliminary He port on the possibility of securing suitable Ihows for the purpose of _ establis hing a line of T Jaterborne ^ireless Observation T nits across the xEASIAN GULF, roughly along Long. 50° 40 * E, from RAS-al-MUTAF on the 3. IRANIAN coast to HAS RAKAN, Eorthermost point of the QATAR pensinsula. 2 . The desirability, from an operational viewpoint, of providing as early a warning as is possible to the air axid ground A.A. defences of ABALAN/BASRAH/ BAN JAR SHAiilUR areas in event of air attack from an Easterly or South Easterly direction is obvious. 3. The Air Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force in ’Iraq., is most anxious to establish such a line at the earliest possible date. I therefore carried out a pr el mi nary investigation as to its practicability. 4. The lolitical Agent K0UE1T , who was most helpful aid encouraging, did not apprehend any Political difficulties: but I should w&amp;lcome an assurance, - if possible - that there is no gi^eral objection to the scheme. I have the honour to be, Sir , Your obedient servant, Sd. H.B. Russell, At R COJTODORE, C01.NANNING No.215 GROUt , ROYAL AIR FORCE. The Honourable the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Residency, B US HI BE „REPORT ON PRELIMINARY ENQUIRIES INTO THE PROVISION OF WOU/DHOWS - PERSIAN GULF, After visiting S.N.O.P.G. and N # 0.i/c Khorramshahr, I was advised that Kuwait, one of the chief dhow building centres in the district, was likely to offer the best chance of securing the type of sea-going dhow most suitable for R.A.F./WOU purposes. 2. N.O.i/c Khorramshahr suggested that if 10 dhows are required for effective observation along a general line running N. and S. (approximately Long. 51° 40 f E.) from Ras-al- Mutaf - S. Persian coast, to the Northernmost point of Qatar - Ras Rakan, a total of 15 dhows would be required to enable reliefs to be effected, and a reserve held in the event of accident. After examination of the Naval chart Persian Gulf, Western sheet, it appears likely that it might be practicable to anchor at least two dhows in comparatively shallow water (about 10-12 fathoms) at a distance of some 10 and 20 miles to the North of Ras T^akan. Similarly, that it would be possible to anchor a further two dhows on rather deeper shoals some 10 and 20 miles South of Ras-al-Mutaf. * Thus a stretch of open sea, only some 40 to 50 miles wide would require to be patrolled by three, or possibly four, ‘'free' dhows. Should this prove to be practicable, I consider that seven or eight dhows would be enough for observation purposes, while an additional four would be required as reserve. 3. I proceeded to Kuwait, p.m. 18th May, where I met the Political Ageht, Captain Hickinbotham and Lt. Comdr. Maltby R.N.R. The latter is supervising the conversion of intermidiate size dhows on behalf of the Royal Navy. The following morning, 19th May, accompanied by Lt. Comdr. Maltby and the chief Arab shipwright at Kuwait, I inspected three dhows:- The first some 100 feet in length, and 213 tons approximately. The second and thrid of 68 and 73 feet in length, and of 110 and 115 tons respectively. All three are deep sea craft, though the largest vessel (much larger than the other two), is an ocean-going dhow. The two smaller dhows 7/ere considered of suitable size for WOU purposes. 4. As a result of conversations between the Political Agent, Kuwait, the Arab shipwright, and myself, the following points are tabulated:- (a) Size of dhow considered most suitable - 110 -125 tons. Note. The Arab shipwright confirmed previous opinion that this size dhow is capable of keeping the sea during* any but the worst weather likely to be encountered in the Persian Gulf. (b) Number of dhows required. - Eight on duty, four off duty at Bahrain to rest and refit. (c) Hire or Purchase - Political Agent, Kuwait, strongly recommended hire rather than purchase, hiring on a six monthly contract. Under hire contract the owner is responsible for finding and rationing the native crew, and maintaining the dhow, sails, running and other gear, in good repair. (d) Approximate charges per dhow of the size indicated, per mensem, are as follows:- Hire of dhow - Rs. 1000 * Captain’s wages - Rs. 250 Crew’s wages - Rs. 1250 (15/18 men)V K Sundries and Conversion - Rs. 500 Total Rs. 3000 Thus total hire 12 dhows equals - £ 2,800 per month approximately, (at Rs, 13 to £ 1 sterling), or, over a hiring period of six months, total hire 12 dhows rather less than the initial cost of one Blenheim aircraft. * Note . Incidentially it is understood that native captains of a good type, have knowledge of the elements of navigation , and are capable of maintainging position within reasonable limits. 5. Large deep water dhows of the approximate size required are now coming into Kuwait for laying up and refitting; but it if pointed out that these ships will again be brought into use by their native owners in approximately 100 days - three months - in time to carry date cargoes from Basra and district. It would appear, therefore, most desirable to obtain authority to hire and to arrange contracts as soon as possible. Political Agent, Kuwait, estimates that from the date sanction is given, until each ship can be ready for sea, including conversion, will be approximately one month. 6. Subject to S.N.O.P.G.*s approval, I understand that Lt. Comdr. Maltby is very willing to supervise the conversion of any dhows required for RaA.B. pruposes. Political Agent, Kuwait, very kindly undertook to assist in every way possible in securing the number and size of dhows require^, and, to arrange any contracts or financial transactions that may be necessary. v 7. Finally I think it is inevitavle that some additional accommodation will have to be erected near Muharraq, for the confortable housing of W0U crews when resting. Sd. H.B.
