Persian Gulf part of Colonel de Gaury*s tour has now been cancelled and the Governor of Aden thinks it doubtful whether the King of the Yemen would allow him to visit Sanaa. Colonial Office consider that it would be undesirable to press the King of the Yemen to give permission if he does not wish to do so® In the circumstances, Colonel de Gaury 1 s mission may well resolve itself into a special visit to Ibn Saud only® 2._ .Mr. Stonehewer Bird recommended that if Colonel de Gaury visits Ibn Saud, it should only be as part of a longer tour. I also feel that a special visit to Ibn Saud should be ruled out, especially as at the present moment there is no particular communication we wish to make to him. 3o I should be grateful therefore if you would reconsider proposal in the light of the foregoing and let me have your views. So far as we are concerned, it was never very clear to us what precise advantages it was hoped that the proposed tour might bring us, and now that a large part of the original programme has fallen through we are inclined to think that the whole project might be cancelled.

We note that his tour is to include a n _, U+c_ S&lt;MTC . visit to the n Trucial ports'jM -trictly speaking? it $(**&gt;**&amp;(. ,, , of course, tfri-o meanp only the ports on that part of the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf which is known as the Crucial coast: but it may ipil be the intention that Col.de Gaury should also visit the Arab States of Koweit, Bahrain and Muscat. We should be grateful for any further light you can throw on his itinerary K /' along the Arab shore^C b shore/ But whatever his jL~U&lt;L Political Resident in the Persian Gulf iw*be**: given an opportunity of expressing his views. This procedure, which should apply in the case of any official visit to the Arab coast, applies with especial force to Col*de Gaury, who is not altogether persona grata there. If therefore you will tell me urgently, if possible by telephone, whether you have any more precise information about his itinerary, I will ask the Political Resident by telegram whether he sees any objection to the visit. Perhaps you would at the same time send a further telegram to MCE informing them that the Political Resident is being consulted. I am sending a copy of this letter to Eyres at the Foreign Office • Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. PEEL.— ■■■■■■■ ?• FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 17th May, 1941 (E 2229/114/25) Immediate. Secret. Dear Peel, I enclose a copy of a telegram from Jedda giving Bird’s comments on the suggestion contained in Government of India telegram No. 2141 that Prior should visit Ihn Saud. We feel that the objections which Bird sees to the proposal are sound. We are perfectly satisfied with the attitude which I'bn Saud has adopted towards P ra&lt; l&gt; - his message to the Iraqi people could hardly have been improved upon - and we have no fear that he is likely to be influenced by Naji Suwaidi - who, incidentally, went to Riyadh against Ibn Saud’s wishes. We feel therefore that a visit by Prior to Riyadh would only embarrass Ibn Saud and would appear to show lack of faith on our part in his loyalty to us, especially as he has instructed the Amir Faisal to keep in close touch with Bird at Jedda. I see that Prior himself has now telegraphed saying that he is not in favour of the Government of India’s proposal. In the circumstances we very much hope that you will see your way to discouragiigthe Government of India from pursuing the matter. I INDIA hinl V C. 1 ^. R. T.

Ibn Saud has adopted the attitude which neither Naji Suwaidi nor Prior are likely to influence in the least. 5. If I had thought it advisable to have a personal talk.with Ibn Saud I should have asked for your sanction to visit him, but to do .so at a time when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Amir Faisal, is remaining on at Jedda on his father's instructions in order to keep in close touch with His Majesty's Government through me, would be a sorry blunder. 4. His Majesty's Government should, I feel, continue to speak v/ith one voice in this country, that of accredited representative. If Government of India have arguments or considerations other than those already adduced they could I feel prqDerly communicate them to you for use in any further representations you may desire to make.RLE COPY 1 AliattM .to ■P&amp;UtA.oal .MbI.

Since then he has received, and is still receiving, the pay of his post. He is not on leave - he has taken all and more than he has earned - although it happens that the Government of India had no duty for him. It is understood from the d.o. letter to Mr. Caroe of 22nd April 1940 PZ 1746/40 that he had before that date been taken into the service of the Foreign Office and he appears, therefore, to be drawing duty pay from two sources. There is no reference in the Secretary of State’s telegram dated 21st March 1940 PZ 1472/40 nor in the Government of India’s reply dated 1st April 1940 to this aspect of the matter and it is not clear that the Government of India in saying that they had ,f no objection to him taking up other employment before the expiry of the period of notice” contemplated that he would in that event continue to draw his Indian pay. It appears that the Foreign Office should have informed the India Office that they wanted Capt. de Gaury’s services in which case the normal course would have been to lend or transfer him to the Foreign Office. Information is requested whether this course was considered. The view stated in Finance Department’s minute*dated 21st May 1940 PZ 2588/40 that the fact that he obtained employment under the Foreign Office does not affect India’s liability is not understood. It is recognised that there may be special features of Oapt. de Gaury’s case but in principle the Finance Department’s view does not appear sustainable and it is considered that Under Secretary of State’s sanction to the course adopted was necessary. +Surely it is quite correct? The G.ofl’sfc liability is not affected - though ti F. 6 .might arrange tc pay him less while his 6 months ran. But it is quite different from the loan / i of a i serving Officer’s' -services R.T.P. r&gt; 425G 940 J Auditor, .7.40 The Under Secretary of State has now sanctioned the Department’s view that no action should be taken towards the transfer of Mr. de Gaury 1 s services to the Foreign Office during his 6 months’ notice - see submission of 5th August, below.

E 574/G My dear Peel, I send you herewith an interesting memorandum by de Gaury upon his work at Riyadh* 2. Since this memorandum was written, Ibn Saud has made it clear that he does not want to have a permanent CcO^rJi' British representative at his and the idea of having de Gaury or anyone else in permanent residence at Riyadh must therefore be regarded as dead for the time being. 3. This means that de Gaury is after all free to resume employment under the Government of India, and I hope you will be able to let them know/that this is the u case and find out where they wish him to be employed. He is, as you know, at present in the U.K., and will remain here until his instructions reach him. Once his next post has been selected, we should probably like him to pay a final, farewell visit to Riyadh, if that could be arranged Woo M.C. , T FtEGo, POL.

I think all who have read de Gaury’s reports from Riyadh will agree that his stay there, though short, was most successful, and that he has shown himself to be the possessor of considerable insight and ability. We are moat grateful to the India Office and the Government of India for having made his services available to us, and only sorry that the unexpected termination of this appointment makes it impossible lor us to use them for a longer period. Yours everSnclosure to Mr. Stonehewer Bird’s letter of January 25rd, 1940 to Mr. Baggallay. Memorandum. Ibn Baud kindly expressed pleasure at my visit to Riyadh, and said two or three times that the Italian Minister’s remarks about the impropriety of my being there for an indefinite period did not disturb him in the least. He said that his own people had asked him why I was there. He had replied that he, Ibn Baud, had asked for me to come because there were many questions arising out of the relations of Saudi Arabia with neighbouring countries which concerned the British, and in war time close and quick contact with them was most necessary. 2. 'But' he went on to say to me recently, and having first mentioned the officials, Captain Shakespear and Mr. Philby, who went to him in the last war, 'I still don't quite understand why you have come”. f, In so far as news is concerned I have it from every quarter, out of the radio, from my representatives and Agents abroad”. He does have a remarkably efficient news service. There is the collection of radio news. This is taken down by special listeners to every station broadcasting in Arabic and to some broadcasting in English. (Their radios are expensive and powerful sets). The result is read out to him twice a day - a lengthy business/53 2. business but one which he never neglects. He has a large number of wireless telephones and a stream of telegrams come in to him from over fifty wireless stations. His foreign representatives and numerous correspondents abroad report to him. His Secretaries’ tables are always littered with press cuttings. There is a constant coming and going of visitors to Riyadh and all of them deliver their news. 'WISHU ALOUMKUM' (What is your news) is the first question of such persons. Once the King chided me for not knowing the latest rumours in Bagdad, which were about the tension between Iraq and Iran. 5. A difficulty for me at Riyadh was that of course I could not see the telegrams received by the Legation from nearby posts. There is no 'safe-hand' for us between Jedda and Riyadh, and also there was no means for making an improvement in this direction. For this reason I was not in a position to make those comments, brief and non-committal as they might be, which would show him that I was well-informed about current affairs. 4. I felt that I was being challenged to produce some intriguing surprise, either in the form of 'secret' news, or better still in gold.’ The implications if gently made, were that without something of the kind I was not really so welcome as I should be with it. In fact that I was falling short of the standard of my two predecessors in the last war. They had had news of/5 . of the outside world, telegraphed via Bombay and only a week or so old, while the routes available to him were then long and uncertain. They had pleasing surprises and simple direct requests. 5. On the other hand His Majesty obviously very much liked having someone at hand to v/hom he could pour out his views on the probable course of the war, on the Palestine question, the Khilafate, the Syrian throne, Nuri as Said, the Lutfalias, Islam, the Soviet 'menace', etcetera, etcetera. He told me soon after my arrival that he would talk to me much and that I must separate what was of interest to me, and what was his considered opionion from what were passing comments made without reflexion. 6. He will I think miss these talks - particu larly as he was recently arranged that the Emir Saud shall take more administrative work from him, and he had more leisure than ever before. 7. My conception of what will be best in the matter is that we should not give Ibn Saud the idea that we are pressing a representative upon him. de should wait until he gives an indication oi his wishes, or until there is a reason for me to go to him, one which would satisfy him, or which required an intermediary at Riyadh. For me to remain here now would give the impression that we were inclined to force a representative upon him without sufficient reason - and incidentally would invite further/v 4. n further Italian representations. 8. I therefore suggest that I withdraw to Egypt while His Majesty is in the Feiaz. If before he returns to Hejd, or soon after, he enquires for me, or we have some reason for my return which he would understand I could go to him again. In that case, unless we find that I must visit Jedda for our own reasons, I think that a tactfully less conspicuous route of entry to Hejd is that via Koweit. 9. If I am not required to go to him the Foreign Office or the India Office will doubtless inform me to where I am to proceed. 10. Mr. R. Heber Percy will accompany me to Egypt. This is a convenient place to record that he was of assistance to me in Riyadh inmaijy ways, and in particular in working out the quite extraordinarily puzzling cypher work which the Hejdi telegraphists made for us by their queer and variably written numerals. I am grateful to him for his intelligent and successful service^ which are of course unpaid by the Government, and which brief as they have been so far, should be recorded. 11. During my visit Ibn Saud presented me with the customary cloak and gown and a gold sv/ord. I should be grateful for permission to retain these objects received in such unusual circumstances.

CONFIDENTIAL. i l 194-0 Section 1. [E 8025/6278/25] Copy No. 125 Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received December 19.) (No. 164.) My Lord, Jedda, November 21, 1939. IN my telegram No. 153 of the 13th November I reported the approaching departure of Captain de Gaury and Mr. Heber Percy for Riyadh. They left Jedda on the 14th November, and arrived at Riyadh on the 18th. Mr. Wall, whom I left at Riyadh as liaison officer, left for Jedda on the 20th. 2. Enclosed is a copy of the instructions which I gave to Captain de Gaury to take with him. 3. As I reported in the ninth paragraph of my despatch No. 150, dated the 24th October, the King waved aside my suggestion that the presence of a British representative at Riyadh might lead other Powers to ask for the same privilege, but the Italians have, in fact, already raised the question. According to a message from Ibn Saud which I have received through Mr. Wall, the translator of the Italian Legation referred to the journey of Captain de Gaury to Riyadh in a conversation with Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, Minister of Finance, and asked whether the King would allow other Governments to have representatives there; whereupon the King instructed Sheikh Abdullah to let the Italian Minister know, in some suitable manner, that the King himself had asked that a British repre sentative should stay temporarily at Riyadh &lt;c because of the frequent necessity for business discussions in connexion with neighbouring British territories,” and had wanted Sir R. Bullard to stay, but that being impossible, Sir R. Bullard had offered to send someone else as representative and the King had accepted the offer. 4. My French colleague, far from objecting to the presence of a British representative at Riyadh, where France is not represented, declares himself delighted, and has asked whether, in case he should have some message of special importance to send to the King, he may send it through the legation and Captain de Gaury. M. Ballereau is a very good colleague and is anxious to show a united Allied front in this country, and as I share his desire, I am not only exchanging information with him, but have promised to convey to the King any messages with which he m ay entrust this legation. 5. It is impossible to forecast how long it will be possible to keep Captain de Gaury at Riyadh. If this were a normal year, Ibn Saud would come to Mecca towards the end of December and stay for two months or so, and that would be a signal for Captain de Gaury to leave the King, since he could not go to Mecca, and, in any case, so long as the King is in the Hejaz. it is always possible to arrange an interview for a minister in case of urgency. But it is possible that the King may not come to the Hejaz this year : this would be an obvious economy, in cost of transport and of hospitality to distinguished pilgrims, for the King to make while his finances are straitened. If he does not come to the Hejaz, it will be for Captain de Gaury to discover whether his presence is becoming irksome to the King in any way. The object of sending a British representative to reside near the King being to induce the King to maintain a favourable attitude towards us, the arrangement loses its point if it ceases to be agreeable to the King. 6. I am forwarding copies of this despatch, without enclosure, to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. [780 t—1](PNot printed. Enclosure. Instructions to Captain de Gaury. Captain de Gaury, IN accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in Foreign Office telegram unnumbered of the 11th September, you are proceeding to Riyadh to reside there as the personal representative of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, in order to be in a position to supply His Majesty King Abdul Aziz day by day with first-hand information, and also to act as liaison officer with the legation. Mr. Heber Percy-will accompany you as your assistant. 2. The Foreign Office have arranged that you should have the local rank of first secretary, and Mr. Heber Percy that of honorary attache, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are being informed accordingly in a letter of which a copy is attached.^ 1 ) 3. As you are aware, the object of the plan by which you are to reside at Riyadh is to help to consolidate the good relations between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the King, and to ensure his remaining friendly to us during the war. This being so, there would be no point in your staying at Riyadh if it appeared that your presence was becoming irksome to His Majesty in any way. Please keep this in mind and let me know for the information of His Majesty’s Govern ment how the plan works in practice. If the King comes to the Hejaz for the pilgrim season, as he usually does, it will be natural for you to return to Jedda, at any rate for a time, since, when the King is at Mecca, it is always possible to arrange an interview with him. 4. Any dangerous dogs that are sleeping should be allowed to sleep on, e.g., Khor-el-Odeid, and I trust that you will also be able to damp down any fresh questions that arise that do not seem to call for action. On the other hand, where, as in the case of the islands between Bahrein and the mainland, there is a possibility that friction may arise, please inform the legation at once so that His Majesty’s Government may be warned in time. 5. The principal objections raised by the Sheikh of Koweit to the King’s counter-proposals for the Trade Agreement have been received by telegram and communicated to you so that you will be able to discuss them with the King at once. There is, however, a despatch on the way which may contain other points. 6. During my visit to Riyadh last month I kept a full diary giving the essentia] parts of all talks with the King and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and any items of news that I managed to pick up. I should be glad if you would keep a similar record and send me a copy of the current portion whenever there is an opportunity.In any further communication on this subject, please emote » / a n„. yfd^r . and address —not to any person by name, but to— l P.2:. “ The Under-Secretary of State,” ForeigjCbtile, ffiSidony^W^»ff &gt;s 4'&amp; * LORY 7931 .THE Under-Secretary of State foi Foreign Am compliments to ottAi.

No. 214^/2010/6. BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, SAUDI ARABIA. September l9tii, 1939. My dear Baxter, I may at any moment receive a reply to my telegram No. 123 to the Foreign Office dated September 13th.,suggesting that in the first place I should go to Riyadh instead of de Gaury. It was my own suggestion that in case of war we should try to induce Ibn Saud to accept a British Officer to reside at Riyadh, and that de Gaury would be the ideal officer for the purpose. But I did not contemplate asking Ibn Saud point blank on the oubreak of hostilities to receive de Gaury, as a resident representative of His Majesty’s Government (or of this Legation). The proposal was bound to require some manoeuvring. After I despatched my telegram No. 123 Fuad showed me a second reply he had received from ibn Saud on the subject. It showed that he was in a state of great worry and excitement about the proposal that de Gaury should visit him. The telegram was more wordy and confused than usual, but one or two statements were definite enough: one said that if I could not leave jedda Ibn Saud would himself come to the Hejaz. I did not telegraph to you a second time, as I hoped my telegram No. 123 would be sufficient and I did not wish to add to the work of the telegraphists, and of the cypher clerks at the Foreign office. 2. The situation of course most unsatisfactory from de Gaury’s point of view,and the telegram from Cairo to you, No. 608 of September 17th., is no more tha^n I expected. Here is/ C.¥. Baxter, Esq., C.M.G., M.C. Foreign office.f 6Lctu.«ut4^ K* 4 .AAH is a senior officer, diverted from his own imppfc,tarfti.ifiSi£)c foj a job which I suggested for him, and when he is sent to Egypt I suggest his waiting in Egypt until I have seen ihn saud. And I have not forgotten the warning you gave me just before I left England, that unless we could secure de Gaury f sservices at once he would be snatched away by some other department. At the same time it must be remembered that the object of the proposal to send de Gaury to reside at Riyadh was to keep Ibn Saud favourably disposed towards us. The Palestine question is no longer the problem it was, Italy is still neutral, and my task here is therefore so far greaty simplified. If ibn Saud is favourably disposed in any case ( as he now seems to be), and if, moreover, even the proposal that de Gaury should go to him on a visit throws him into a fit of apprehension, there seems to be no point in pressing the proposal. If I go to Riyadh I hope to make Ibn Saud feel the want of unbroken contact y/ith the Legation and to be able to suggest de Gaury as the link. His visit might be represented quite honestly as a stage on the way to Masqat: he could perhaps go on there later if Ibn Saud thought the visit had been prolonged sufficiently. I did not suggest, in my telegram No. 123, that de Qfaury should even oome as far as jedda, since his visit to Riyadh might not come off, while to have two extra men at the Legation v/hen we were at full strength and the work had fallen off, and v/hen v/e v/ere not sure that in a few days we could get v/ater to drink, would not be reasonable. The coal for the condensers, which was within a few days of exhaustion has finally been replenished after great exertions, but one or both may always collapse in the absence of the boilers and spares which are on order in England, and to enlarge the Legation staff until it is absolutely necessary seems unwise. AH/All this would have 'been telegraphed in ordinary circumstances, hut I hope that what I have telegraphed will turn out to have been sufficient. If you decide, on the telegram from Egypt, to order de Gaury to jedda, we will make the best of that. I did not feel justified in opposing the idea any further, and anyhow I thought the Foreign office decision about my visit to Riyadh must have been taken by then. 3.

Sj&amp;'s/vj of the 13th September, of which a copy has been sent to you under separate cover, about the proposal to appoint de Gaury as Political Officer at Riyadh. Bullard evidently feels that a final decision on the question must be postponed until he himself has seen Ibn Saud, and so de Gaury will have to wait in Alexandria for the time being. I enclose, for your concurrence, a copy of the reply which we propose to send to Bullard. 2. We see from the Government of India telegram of the 9th September, of which you sent us a copy under cover of your letter P.Z. 5605/39 of the 11th September, that the Government of India would prefer Hay to be appointed to the post instead of de Gaury. Our idea was that the Political Officer at Riyadh should be a member of Bullard’s staff and should have the rank of First Secretary, and we think there — would..• RECd. POL. i - 1 J.P. Gibson, Esq. 2QSEP1939 INDIA OFFICEwould be great difficulty in appointing anybody as senior as Hay to the post. It was never intended that the Political Officer at Riyadh should be a Special Envoy, independent of the Legation at Jedda. Moreover, we cannot agree that fluency in Arabic is of minor importance. In our view, it is essential that whoever goes to Riyadh shouH be able to discuss matters freely v/ith Ibn Saud himself. That is the whole point of having him there. 3. In the circumstances, we very much hope that if Ibn Saud does finally consent to have a British representative at Riyadh, the Government of India will agree to let de Gaury proceed there. /■4 A NO DISTRIBUTION.

I do not think there is now any danger that Ibn Saud will be unfriendly to us and Italian attitude also makes the situation at present more favourable than was expected. All things con sidered I feel that I ought to offer to go to Riyadh.

Mr. Heber Percy would be his assistant. 3. If these officers were to continue their journey to Jedda could they be usefully employed there pending any necessary approach to Ibn Saud or should they remain at Alexandria for the present? 4.

SUBJECT:- Special measures in the Persian Gulf on . outbreak of war. 3. (b) Political Officer for Riyadh, (paragraph 14 of Jedda letter of 7th July 1938 , So.141 to the Foreign Office, and paragraph 6 of Foreign Office reply No.75 of 17th March, 1939). It would be important from the Resident’s point of view as well as that of Minister, Jedda, to be kept in touch with what is going on in Saudi Arabia, and this suggestion for a British ofiicer to be sent to Riyadh seems to me an excellent one. With regard to who this officer should be, I suggest that if war should come during the next 8 months or so, it might be well de G-aury. He is leaving Kuwait on long leave in the middle of May and will be replaced by Galloway. So he would be free for this purpose. He knows Arabic extremely well, was attached to the Legation at Jedda in 1935, accompanied Sir Andrew Ryan on his mission to Ibn Saud at Riyadh in November 1935, and is I believe persona grata with the King. While at Riyadh de Gaury would of course work under the orders of the Minister at Jedda.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3897</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3897</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/160(2) 'Measures to influence minor Powers &amp; Arab States in time of War.

The appointment of a Political Officer, under the orders of HM Minister, Jedda, was proposed in 1939 as a special measure in the event of war breaking out. De Gaury was suggested for the post because he was thought to be acceptable to Ibn Saud [Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd]. The purpose of the role was to monitor political developments in Saudi Arabia, and to keep Ibn Saud favourably disposed towards the British (comment by Reader William Bullard, HM Minister, Jedda, folio 91).The papers include: correspondence concerning de Gaury's leave, pay and allowances; questions about de Gaury's suitability for the role (e.g. comment by the Government of India External Affairs Department on folio 132); India Office minutes relating to the appointment; report by de Gaury on the state of roads between Riyadh and Dhahran (folio 68); report by de Gaury on a meeting with Ibn Saud (folios 53-56); Ibn Saud's wish not to have a permanent British representative at Riyadh; correspondence concerning a proposed visit (which did not take place) by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Ibn Saud, May 1941; and correspondence concerning a proposed liaison visit by de Gaury to the Persian Gulf, Riyadh, Jedda, Yemen, and Aden, September-October 1941.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Political intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
