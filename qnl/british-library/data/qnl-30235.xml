My dear Metcalfe, In going into the question of our title to Basidu about which we have recently sent you copies of demi-official corres pondence with the Foreign Office, we notice that the Treaty of 18 06 between Persia and Muscat, confirming the Edict of 1855 leasing Baddar Abbas, etc. to the Sultan of Muscat, does not appear in Aitchison, and we have indeed had some difficulty in ascertaining its exact purport. But a text, of which I enclose a copy, which seems orima facie reasonably reliable is given on pp. XCIV-XCV of Badger’s 'Imams and Seyyids of Oman' (1871j, though we notice that the date given by him for the treaty (April 1856) conflicts with that given on page 460 of Lorimer. (In this connection I also enclose a copy of a letter from the Sultan of Muscat to the Political Resident in the Persian Sulf dated 25th April, 1857 which gives the purport of the Agreement in general termslonly). The question of the exact wording of paragraph 1 is of some importance in connection with the Basidu title and we suggest that, if the Government of India see no objection, the Political Resident might secure an authrritative translation of the Treaty, which, if it is not too late, could be included in^itchison. It would in any case be of interest to us as well as to the Government of India for purposes of record. 2. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle. lour sineerely, (8d.) J.C.ys/alton.

Should the Governor of Bhiraz complain against the Arab Governor of Bunder-el-’Abbas, the Imam shall immediately temove him, and appoint another in his stead, who shall like wise be subject to the Governor of Shiraz. Bunder-el-’Abbas and the adjacent islands, and thh other places named, are assigned/- 2 - 4 % assigned, in farm, to the Multan of Maskat and his heirs only* In default of heirs, these territories must revert to the Persian Prime Minister, tfThile the territories above named shall remain in the hand of the Sultan of Maskat 1 s officers, he shall not allow the agents of any foreign Governments to pass through those places, and shall protect them by ships of war, and otherwise, against secret treachery and open foreign invasion, ihe oultan of Maskat has not the right of transferring Bunder-el-’Abbas, or any of the aforenamed territories, to any foreign power, even under the conditions stipulated. s *****Translated purport of a letter From His Highness Syed Thueynee, Imam of Muscat To Captain Felix Jones, Agent and Resident Persian Gulf. 29 - Shaaban 73. 25 - April 1857. Reed. 11th May, 1857. A.C. Your letter to the address of my deceased Father has reached me- You stated therein that Sir James Outram, who is vested with full powers, either for peace or for war, was desirous of learning the true nature of the relations that existed between my late Father and the King of Persia; his Excellency’s object being, the consideration of an arrange ment (of H.H.’s affairs) as regarded Bunder Abbas and its dependencies. His Excellency, you wrote, was more especially anxious to acquaint himself with the terms of the contract &amp;ca, entered into between the Imam and the Shah. The enclosure will inform you on these points. Purport of enclosure runs thus: In the reign of Fash Alee Shah. 6000 Tomans were annually disbursed for Bunder Abbas and its dependencies. Of the above sum, 2000 Tomans were remitted by Mahomed Shah, and the balance only, 4000, were paid. But since Kasir Ood Been Shah came to the throne, year b^ year the tribute was raised until what did occur. I speak of war did occur. Peace was in the end concluded by an agreement for the yearly payment of 16000 Tomans(Tribute) for the bunder and its districts. v Confines of the Territory as follows Commending from the East at Bayaban Desert, Bunder Abbas and Khumeer. The Islands of Kishm, Larak and Ooriauz are dependencies of/!(=&gt; of Bunder Abbas. The Contract to last a period of 20 years, for H.H. Syud Saeed, or his son succeeding him.

In Britain's case, Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat are named as territories under its protection. The file contains correspondence between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd], concerning the granting of the Sultan's permission for Britain to sign the non-aggression clause on Muscat's behalf.The remaining half of the file documents the efforts of British officials to trace evidence of a reported treaty between Persia and Muscat from 1856.Notable correspondents besides those already mentioned include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; John Charles Walton of the India Office.
