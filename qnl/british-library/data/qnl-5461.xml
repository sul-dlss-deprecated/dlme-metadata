In view of the present political situation in Iran and the urgent necessity for an increased number of ofiicials possessing a knowledge of the country, Mr. Eden strongly supports the proposals now made by the Secretary of State for India. 3. I am, therefore, to express the hope that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction, at~a very early date, the creation of the four posts enumerated in India ^-fiice letter under reference and to approve that the financial details may be left to the discretion of the Govermaent of India on the understanding that the expenditure involved will be shared between Imperial and Indian Funds in the usual manner. The position would be subject to review in the light of the political situation in the spring of 1942. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Secretary to the Treasury.The Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No.262 of the 8th June outlined suggestions for 'infiltration” in Iran more or less on the German model in order to report on and to obstruct German activities. The first point in this scheme was the attachment of extra staff to the Tehran Legation and British Consulates in Iran, together Y/ith the opening of new Consulates. On this the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf commented that the Legation already had an enormous staff and that new Consulates would certainly be suspect. 7U OH'S No - 3 6xr ef fauM (hxuy&amp;ut frycrfart-oM £~\. tl*. 3a tte gyaggnttb ^attachment of extra staff to the existing Consulates, It is hoped that friction with the Iranian Government may be avoided by filling posts already recognised or by creating posts ' Yrhich d o not require offici al recognition, iw ttoc I* &lt;f\dkA. £ froMskA k/HTe Government olTridia are anxious to place many officers in training as cadre limitations, financial implications and Iranian suspicions will permit, To this end, with the full support of the General Staff, they make the following definite proposals for placing Indian Political Service officers 'in Iran:~ C^puuu ‘fxn. fcvOzLc - (a) One officer as Assistant to the Consul at Kerman - his agr^ment as Vice-Consul to be sought later, ihis appointment would also cover Bandar Abbas. t Udi CofcUdpJZd &lt;xjh Ke/\rr\a*y % The Political Resident suggested that the owusAixGUi, of a Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abbas was fully justified by the extra York entailed by the Navicert system, but H.M.

It will be seen that the Government of India propose the creation o f the following appointments (a) One officer as Assistant to H.M. Consul at Kerman, it being s understood that agreraent to his appointment as Vice-Consul should be sought later. This appointment would cover Bandar Abbas. (b) One officer as Vice-Consul at Meshed.

(d) One officer ds Assistant to the Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr, who would he]|p in Cypher and Navicert work. 2. Mr. Amery considers that, whatever may be the outcome of the discussions now taking place with regard to the policy to be adopted towards Irar, these additional posts will be of great political valpe.

(We assume that it takes into account the corrections in our letter of 24th May). We are all in favour of publishing the new 'districts in the Foreign Office List as it makes it so much easier if anyone wants to verify a point* Indeed, on second thoughts we feel that this would not be a bad moment to try and get the Persian Government to agree to these new Consular Districts, with a view to their being included in the King f s Commissions and Exequaturs issued to Consuls. There is, of course, a possibility of the Persian Government having sufficient remnants of the Shah Reza mentality to stave off our proposals indefinitely or to refuse them outright, but we doubt it, and even if they did, it should do little harm in practice. If the Foreign Office and the Government of India agree, may we approach the Persian Government accordingly?

The question of the delineation of Consular districts in Persia was in abeyance at the beginning of the war owing to the fact that it was impossible to persuade the Persian Government to acquiesce in Royal Commissions which said more than that the person in question was His Majesty’s Consular officer ”in w or 'at” any given place. It is not thought appropriate to approach the Persian Government now, but to relieve the present indeterminate situation which causes administrative inconvenience to ourselves with regard to (a) Consular Marriage warrants and (b) Consular tours, we have drawn up a list of Consular superintending and subordinate posts, with the Shahristans we. suggest should be placed under the Jurisdiction of each* The appended scheme has been drawn up after consultation with His Majesty’s Consular officers in Persia, and we submit it for the approval of the Foreign Office and of the Government of India. If approved it should no doubt appear in the next Foreign Office List. This scheme has been made out from an up-to-date schedule of Provinces supplied by the Ministry of the Interior.

His proposals were approved 'by H. M. Embassy, Tehran, subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office; they have been somewhat modified for the Government of India, who now request the sanction of H. M. *s Government to their revised recommendations. (A table setting out Mr. Shrine's proposals on Government of India' s emendations is below). The re-classification of the post^ of Consul, Zahidan, as a superior post in the Indian Political Service has already been sanctioned (Ext.4312/44* original in Political Department). ^ In November H. M. Consul General recommended further that in view of the great increase in cipher work at Meshed and Zahidan, a confidential assistant should be appointed at each of these posts. His proposal lias been sanctioned provisionally by the Government of India on a temporary basis and on terms slightly lower than those originally suggested by Mr. Skrine, and they now ask for H.M.G.'s approval. (The pay and allowances sanctioned by them amount to less than £1,000, the expenditure which, according to the present arrangement, can be sanctioned b the Government of India without reference to H.M.G.) A draft letter to the Foreign Office requesting their approval of the Government of India's proposals is submitted below.

(iii) The present post of Vice-Consul, Zabul and Kain, to be converted to that of Vice-Consul, Zabul and Zahidan, with headquarters at Zahidan, the Vice-Consul to spend four months each year at Zabul. (iv) The post of Medical Officer in East Persia is held by an I.M.S. officer. As. however, it does not entail sufficient professional duties to justify the continued employment of a highly quali/iea officer, this post should be filled by an I.M.D. officer instead of an I.M.S. officer. These proposals have the concurrence of His Majesty’s Ambassador, Tehran. 3. In view of the increase of work connected with cypher telegrams, botn at Meshed and Zahidan, the Consul-General for Khorasan has recommended tne creation of the posts of one confidential assistant each at Meshed and ZahiHan. The Government of India agree to this and in anticipation of the approval of His Majesty’s Government, are according provisional sanction to the .creation of these two posts on a temporary/-temporary basis on the following tenns :~ Pay:- Rs. 250^10-350 plus dearness allowance at current rates. Special pay:- Rs. 25/- per mensem. Customs Compensatory allowance:- Rs.25/- per mensem. Rent-free accommodation. 4. T am to request that the sanction of His Majesty’s Government to the above proposals may kindly be obtained and conveyed to the Government of India at a very early date. 5.

Consular Representation in East Persiafi Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to your Circular Express Latter No.4041“E/ 43 dated the loth January 1944 and its enclosures on the subject of the strengthening of the Civil Services. question of Consular representation in East Persia has b'en under review and I have discussed it in detail with h.M’s Consul^ Zahidan. the Additional Counsellor, Tehran (the late Lieut. Colonel A.H.Macanr and H.M’s Vice-Consul, Zabul &amp; Lain. 2. Attention is invited to the Proposition Statement appended to this letter, columns II and III of which show the Class I and Class II posts in East Persia. The present arrangements date from 1932 when, on the recommendation of Lieui -Colonel C.K-Daly, the former Sistan Lain Consulate with its subordinate Vice-Consulate at Zahidan was abolished and the district placed under the Meshed Consulate-General with a Vice-Consul for Zabul and another for Zahidan. There have been various changes since/.•. J■■■ sine© particularly in 1942 when the proposals contained in my telograin N o. 122 dated loth March 1942 were sanctioned in a mddilied f r om't)y ' the' ^ JoTernment of India. Further modif ications took place later when (1) a Glass I officer. Captain D.H.Harrison I.M.d. was sent ot 2ahidan in place of Asst. Hurgeon D.J.Upshon I.M-D. as Medical Office-r and Vice-Consul, and (2) Mr. R.M.Hadow vas transferred from the post of Vice-Consul Meshed and not replaced by a Political probationer. Since tnan Mr. 0.W.Hart, 5xtra Assistant, has officiated as Vice-Consul Meshed in addition to his own duties vide Foreign tele^am 9709 dated 9th November 1943. 3. The arrangements as they stand at present are not altogether satisfactory for the following reasons:- (1) /under present conditions in Persia the Llonsui-Seneral and the Vice-Consul, Meshed each have a very full day’s work with the result that neither can get out on tour as much as is desirable and there is no reserve in case of illness or unavoidable absences. ( 2 ) Successive Vice-Consuls, Zaoul and Kaig, have complained that there is not enough work at Sir land to keep them usefully occupied. It is a fapt that owing to the distance between the two headquarters (327 miles) and the poorness of communications it is difficult for the Vice-Consul when at Sirjand to keep in touch with political work at Zabul and he tends to leave it to the Indian Assistant and Proconsul, the old and experienced Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiv; and even in these days there is barely*' a half-day’s work at Birjand itself.Moreover life at both places though comfortable enough is lonely and none of the incumbents since 1932, even the married ones, have been happy there. (3; “ Moo/J rftd (3) \*hen I advocat&lt; ? d moving the Headquarters of the Medical Officer in Hast Persia to \ Zahidan I did/mean to deprive the Gousulate G-eneral altogether of the services of a British medical officer* I expected that a doctor from India would be attracted by -the opportunities for professional work and study in a big town like Mesued as well as by the amenities and social contacts such as they are, of the Consulate-G-en^ral and that lie would be glad to spend a mo tn or two here each year. In practice how-: ver it has not b^en so, Dr- Upshon did cot cone up to Meshed at all, and captain Harrison in spite of repeated^ invitations has only spent two days here during the year he has held the post. The fact is that from the $ point of view of British exiles from India Zahidan is a suburb of Quetta, to which centre of civilisation they take ev ry opportunity of escaping by train; exotic Meshed, separated from them by 625 miles of ' desert roaa, holds no attractions. (4) The recommendation in my telenxam Nq. 122 of loth x-arch 1942 t that Zahidar: snouiobe classed as a superior post was not adopted when the Vice-Gonsula ,e was laised to the status of a Consulate. A senior incumbent like Colonel Smith feels this to be deroga - to ry, and he also hankers af r lahul wnich was unitl 1932 a superior ^ost with Zahidan under it. I myself, in 1929, aft«r two years as Consul in Sistan and Kain, recommended t that the headquarter of the Cor sulate should be moved to Zahidan (then called Duzdap);, but Colonel Daly who succeeded me had other ideas. 4 . For the above reasons, and on the assumption tnat Zahidan as ..ell as Meshed will continue to be of some importance evltafter the war, I have the following recommendations to make: (1) The/__ .(1) The poet of Vice-Consul ileahed to be permanently filled and Mr. C....Hart appointed to it substantively, (2) The post of fxtra Assistant Meshed to be abolished and replaced by a Confidential Assistant and Cypher Clerk; / . (3) The post of Vice-Consul Zabul &amp; Kair be abolished and Tabu! included in the Consular district of Zahidan; (4) The Zahidan Consulate to be made a superior post, (o) A nev; post of Vice-Consul Birjand and Additional Vice-Consul Meshed to be created’a and filled by^a Political Offleer or probationer with headouarters at Meshed* the incumbent to spend at least 4 months in each year at Birjand; ( 6 ) A new post of Vice Consul Zabul and Zahidan to be created with headquart rs at Zahidan, the incumbent to spend at least 4 mouths in each year at Zabul; (7) If it is decided to retain the post of Medical Officer in Cast Persia on the cadre of Medical Officers in the Political and hxterral Affairs Department, the incumbet-t will # have his headquarters as at present at Zahidan but should for political reasons spend at least 3 months each summer at Meshed; ( 8 ) After the war, or earlier if conditions permit, the post of Indian Assistant and Proconsul Zabul can be abolished and &amp; Consular clerk stationed there; (9) At Birjand Miss Palmer dmittof Tehran is starting a Cottage Hospital this autumn with hie help oi une Shaukat-ul-Mul k and the Vice-Consul/....X. ( • ±\ co py/.»• • • Vice-Consul. If the proiect succeeds it will os better from both tne medical and the political point of view to close the Consular dispensary ' d support the Cottage Hospital. The Assistant Surgons and Indian Assistant was then be re/laced, by a Consular Clerk. j. These proposals are setg our in Columris V and VI of the proposition Statement appended to tiiis letxer. If approved xn principjple their financial effect will be calculated as Tar as possible and tne results submitted in due course. At present we are concerned with questions of personnel. The establishment is to be strengthened by (1) promoting Mr. Hart to be substantive Vice-Consul xa ne she d (2) Appointing a Political officer o£ probationer to the new post of Vice-Consul ^abul and 2 an i car;. From the point of view of adnunxsiirative eiiicienc} at both Lie shed and Zahidan during the war and in the difficult post-war period these two proposals ere strongly rsco imeridea, while Irongthat^ of training young officers the locating oi tne fi?e- Cc isul Birjand at Meshed where he can study hussien C d plain diplomatic experience mill be.an improvement on, tne present arrangement. 6. A point remaining for consideration is whether the 2 am dan Consulate should continue to be in the sue a riot ending charge of the Consul-General in Ifhorasan. or wiiether it should be independent as the Sistan and Main Consulate was up to ^1932. i nave no v ry strong views on this subject ana am prepared to leave it to H-M’s Ambassador and the Govt rnrnert of India to decide.- ——/ 1 * Head quarters ii. % Present establ iahment Post Inounbont. iii. iv. proposed satabl iahment. r.

The suggested re-alignment of Consular^Districts in East Persia appears to me more in keeping with present- day administrative requirements, while th^ proposed raisins: of the status of His Majesty’s Consulate at Zahidan to that of an independent Consulate is clearly justified both on grourris of administrative convenience and by the increased importance which tnis post has acquired during tne preaent war - an importance which is likely to be maintained in the post-war period on account of Zahidan's position as tn« .chief entrepot* for Indo-Persian trade by the overland route. 2.

A^croC i jT, I have the honour to invite a reference to paragraph l(ii) of your despatch ^p*P*23(3)-E/44 of the 17th October 1944 to Hia Britannic Majewty's Ambassador Tehran p in which it is stated that the Government of India would be prepared to consider a recommendation for elevating the post of Extra Assistant, Meahed, to that of temporary additional Vice-Consul, Meshed* 2. I have already, in paragraph 3(1) of my des patch No.188-20/8 dated the Sid July i944, pointed out that under present conditions the pressure of work upon the Consul General and Vice Consul pre vents them from touring as much as is desirable and leaves no reserve m case of illness or absence. These considerations will apply a fortiori if the Vice Consul is to have charge of BiFJahd in addition to his own duties. As it is, owing to the great ino^rease in the number of callers at the Consulate General, and in the office work connected with such subjects as Anglo-persian post war trade development, Soviet affairs, intel ligence and security, transport, propaganda and public relations, and cyphers. Mr .Hart the acting Vice Consul has been so busy that he has been unable to tour at all during the past year. 3# This great increase compared with pre occupation days amply justifies, in my opinion, the elevation of the post of Extra Assistant, which Mr .Mart holds substantively, to that of Additional Vice Consul. His local knowledge and practical experience/..••••••••This ^ «^onc •* /f »«.T 9/^ Mor entertainig to doi but prices arid wages have, as . well known to the Government of India, enormously increased since the Yice-Gonsul !zabul , sumptuary allowance was fixed and I can f&amp;ufo fflgjfcfife fafet that recent incumbents have usually spent a great deal more than their sumptuary allowance in putting up travellers and entertaining Persian guests. 6. Lastly I recommend that the special pay of fe.100/- attached to the post of Consul, Zahidan, which was fixed when it was a Vice-Consulate be raised to Rs.200/-» Ijiis will bring it into line with the special pay attached to all other superior posts in Persia and the Gulf, ihejremoteness of Zahidan, its lack of ad amenities, abd the wild and sometimes dangerous country through which the incumbent h^s totour justify a special pay of fis*200/-. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Britannic Majesty t s toiDastador Tehran, under Endorsement $o•51-20/8 dated the 23rd November f 44# MMa» «» Uafrit3«3»45 ,28th November 1944 ftom British Cotfshlfe General, to the Secretary to the Governmentladifi. External Affairs Department, New consl^arnrepresentatioii in E # _ _ \~rr^rv-Jl (C* dkJ V' tSkV^ the following further recommendations to make relating to Class II personnel. the United Kingdom CommeridalCorporation working in tfce Consulate at Zahidan and one at leshed, vide your telegram N0;1402/E dated the 11th September 1944. As the colume o| purely UJC.C.C. work varies these men are of considerable assis tance in other cypher and confidential office work also. But these posts will be reduced soon after the UJC.C.C. close down, and the represen tative of the Corporation at Calcutta has already asked us to withdraw one of the Zahidan clerks. Deprived of the services of these clerks the Vice-Consuls at both places will be so bur dened with cipher and other purely routine duties that their usefulness in political and consular work will be greatly reduced. To giwe an idea of the increase in ciphering in the Meshed office since the Occupation I may mention that in 1940-1 our bill for telegrams, not including U.K.C.C. ones, was Rs.1,300/- as against Rs.16,482/- in 1941-2, Rs.50,o62/- in 1942-3, and Rs.51,574 last year. Ite Zahidan figures will of course be less striking, but on the other hand the Consul there with Zaoul added to his charge is to have only one Vice-Consul to help him. I consider a Confi dential Assistant to be no less necessary at Zahidan a than at Meshed when the UJC.C.C. clerks go. ' 3. I therefore recommend the appointment of Confidential Assistants at Meshed and Zahidan as a temporary measure while present conditions persist. Ine pay and allowances I would request dat ed the 23rd No vember 1944 With reference to my de ZaMflaa* ter clerks paid byExt. 3608/44 Mr.HarrjLso^ isir.P^el. —— ,t Luu ^ u. &lt;?).0 . 5 &lt;w«. 1^*- u**+^A Yt+t**.iA^} t East Persia Consulate^ eA 1. Meshed Consulate-G-eneral. _ &gt;tt6&gt;asoYc In 1933 Major Daly, who j as a temporary to ajar &gt; had been holding ^ joint charge of the posts of Consul-General Meshed and Consul Sis tan, proposed that,as a measure of economy two posts should be amalgamated, that ©I* Consulate for Sistan and Kain abolished ; and.that the Consul-General should spend his summer at Meshed and the winter at Zabul, an I.P.S.probationer being left in charge at Meshed during his absence. These proposals were sanctioned by and the Government of India, (PZ.2099/33, PZ. 2562/33, PZ. 3134/33, PZ. 4658 / 33 , PZ. 6292/33 and PZ.4829/34). It is not clear from our files at what date this arrangement was modified but the position at the beginning of the war was that the Consul- General remained in Meshed while the posts of Vice-Consul at Zabul and Zahidan were held by more junior officers of the I.P.S. Prom 1938 to 1941 Mr.C.W.Hart, Extra Assistant to the Consul-General, officiated as Vice-Consul, Meshed, in addition to his own duties (PZ. 1331/38, Clin. 29/73)* In 1941, in view of the need for increasing the number of British subjects employed in political work in Persia, the Government of India put forward various proposals for the placing of I.P.S. officers in consular posts there, among them the appointment of a Vice-Consul, Meshed (Ext. 4144/41, flagged in Clin.29/45 (2)). These proposals were approved,(Ext. 4877/41,); and Mr.H.A.M.Barlcw was appointed, Mr.Kart reverting to his substantive appointment of Extra Assistant to the Consul-General, (Ext. 562 ^ Clin. 29/45 (2)J. In November of last year, however, the shortage of I.P.S.Officers being acute, Mr.Hart was once more appointed to officiate as Vice-Consul (Ext. 6186/43 , Clin. 29/75)* Mr.Skrine now proposes that Mr .Hart should be confirmed in the appointment of Vice-Consul, the post of Extra Assistant being abolished and that of Confidential Assistant and Cypher Clerk substituted. 2. Zahidan Vice-Consulate. The Vice-Consulate at Zahidan was established on an annual basis in 1923 and was made permanent in 1936 (PZ.4799/36 Clin.29/56). In 1943 'the Government of India proposed that the status of the Vice-Consulate should be raised to that of Consulate, and that the headquarters of the Medical Officer for the Khorasan Agency should be moved from Meshed to Zahidan, where the Medical Officer should act also as ex officio Vice-Consul ( Ext. 3H0/43 , Clin . 29/18). The Consul-General now recamnends that the Zahidan Consulate should /bebe made a Superior Post in the Indian political Service (the Government of India have acted upon this recommendation - papers transferred to e political Department), and further that the appointment of Vice-Consul at Zahidan should be amalgamated with that of Vice-Consul, f abul &gt; held by an I.P.S. officer or probationer with his headquarters at ^.ahidan, who should spend not less than four months of the year at Zabul: the Medical Officer also retaining Zahidan as his headquarters but spen ng at least three months of the year at Meshed. r 1 3.

Consular Representation in East Persia . Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to your Circular Express Letter No. 4041-E/43 dated the 18th January 1944 and its enclosures on the subject of the strengthening of the Civil Services. The delay in submitting my proposals, which is regretted, has been due to the fact that the whole question of Consular representation in East Persia has been under review and I have discussed it in detail with H.M* s Consul, Zahidan, the Additional Counsellor, Tehran (the late Lieut-Colonel A.H. Macann) and H.M’s Vice-Consul, Zabul &amp; Kain. 2. Attention is invited to the Proposition Statement appended to this letter, columns II and III of which show the Class I and Class II posts in East Persia. The present arrangements date from 1932 when, on the recommendation of Lieut-Colonel C.K. Daly, the former Sistan-Kain Consulate with its subordinate Vice Consulate at Zahidan was abolished and the district placed under the Meshed Consulate-General with a Vice Consul for Zabul and another for Zahidan. There have been various changes since, particularly in 1942 when the proposals contained in my telegram No.122 dated 16th March 1942 were.sanctioned in a modified form by the Government of India. Further modifications took place later when (1) a Class r . officer, Captain D.H. Harrison I.M.S. was sent to Zahidan in place of Asst. Surgeon D.J. Upshon I.M.D. as Medical Officer and Vice- Consul, and (2) Mr. B.M. Hadow was transferred from the post of Vice-Consul Meshed and not replaced by a Political probationer. Since then Mr. C.W. Hart, Extra Assistant, has officiated as Vice- Consul Meshed in addition to his own duties vide Foreign telegram 9709 dated 9th November 1943. O.etvnv ^2 3. The arrangements as they stand at present are not altogether satisfactory for the following reasons:- (1) Under present conditions in Persia the Consul-General and the Vice-Consul, Meshed, each have a very full day's work with the result that neither can get out on tour as much as is desirable and there is no reserve in case of illness or unavoidable absences. (2) Successive \Tice-Consuls, Zabul and Kain, have complained that there is not enough work at Birjand to keep them usefully occupied. It is a fact that owing to the distance between the two headquarters (327 miles) and the poorness of communications it is difficult for the Vice- Consul when at Birjand to keep in touch with political work at Zabul and he tends to leave it to the Indian Assistant and Proconsul, the old and experienced Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy; and even in these days there is barely a half-day's work at Birjand itself. Moreover, K! G nrev\eV»s _ V &lt; 2 XpoSi bol. life/life at ‘both places though comfortable enough is lonely and^/ none of the incumhents since 1932, even the married ones, have been happy there. (3) When I advocated moving the Headquarters of the Medical Officer in East Persia to Zahidan I did not mean to deprive the Consulate General altogether of the services of a British medical officer. I expected that a doctor from India would t&gt;e attracted by the opportunities for professional work and study in a big town like Meshed as well as by the amenities and social contacts such as they are, of the Consulate-General and that he would be glad to spend a month or two here each year. In practice however it has not been so; Dr- Upshon did not come up to Meshed at all, and Captain Harrison in spite of repeated invitations has only spent two days here during the year he has held the post. The fact is that from the point of view of British exiles from India Zahidan is a suburb of Quetta, to which centre of civilisation they take every opportunity of escaping by train; exotic Meshed, separated from them by 625 miles of desert road, holds no attractions. (4) The recommendation in my telegram No.122 of 16th March 1942 that Zahidan should be classed as a superior post was not adopted when the Vice-Consulate was raised to the status of a Consulate. A senior incumbent like Colonel Smith feels this to be derogatory, and he also hankers after Zabul which was until 1932 a superior post with Zahidan under it. I myself, in 1929, after two years as Consul in Sistan and Kain, recommended that the headquarters of the Consulate should be moved to Zahidan (then called Duzdap), but Colonel Daly who succeeded me had other ideas. 4&gt; For the above reasons, and on the assumption that Zahidan as well as Meshed will continue to be of some importance even after the war, I have the following recommendations to make:- (1) The post of Vice-Consul Meshed to be permanently filled and Mr. C.W. Hart appointed to it substantively; (2) The post of Extra Assistant Meshed to be abolished and replaced by a Confidential Assistant and Cypher Clerk; (3) The post of Vice-Consul Zabul &amp; Kain be abolished and Zabul included in the Consular district of Zahidan; (4) The Zahidan Consulate to be made a superior post; (5) A new post of Vice-Consul Birjand and Additional Vice- Consul Meshed to be created and filled by a Political Officer or probationer with headquarters at Meshed, the incumbent to spend at least 4 months in each year at Birjand; (6) A new post of Vice Consul Zabul and Zahidan to be created with headquarters at Zahidan, the incumbent to spend at least 4 months in each year at Zabul; (7) If it is decided to retain the post of Medical Officer in East Persia on the cadre of Medical Officers in the Political and External Affairs Departments, the incumbent will have his headquarters as at present at Zahidan but should/i Q44 j should for political reksons spend at least 3 months each summer at Meshed; (8) After the war, or earlier if conditions permit, the post of Indian Assistant and Proconsul Zabul can he abolished and a Consular clerk stationed there; (9) At Biro and Miss Palmer Smith of Tehran is starting a Cottage Hospital this autumn with the help of the Shaukat ul Mulk and the Vice Consul. If the project succeeds it will be better from both the medical and the political point of view to close the Consular dispensary and support the Cottage Hospital. The Assistant Surgeon and Indian Assistant can then be replaced by a Consular Clerk. 5. These proposals are set out in Columns V and VI of the Proposition Statement appended to this letter. If approved in principle their financial effect will be calculated as far as possible and the results submitted in due course. At present we are concerned with questions of personnel. The establishment is to be strengthened by (1) promoting Mr. Hart to be substantive Vice-Consul Meshed (2) Appointing a Political officer or probationer to the new post of Vice-Consul Zabul and Zahidan. Prom the point of view of administrative efficiency at both Meshed and Zahidan during the war and in the difficult post-war period these two proposals are strongly recommended, while from that of training young officers the locating of the Vice-Consul Birjand at Meshed where he can study Russian and gain diplomatic experience will be an improvement on the present arrangement. 6. A point remaining for consideration is whether the Zahidan Consulate should continue to be in the superintending charge of the Consul General in Khorasan, or whether it should be independent as the Sistan and Kain Consulate was up to 1932. I have no very strong views on this subject and am prepared to leave it to H.M’s Ambassador and the Government of India to decide. 7.

These Indian Consulates are enormous affairs, as you probably know, with acres of grounds and menials galore. There were about 120 persons in all living in the compound at Meshed and living conditions are amazingly cheap and easy so much so in fact that many of the people in these distant parts have hardly ydt begun to realise that there is a war on and what people are going through at home. . If for no other reason I think my visits are doing good in bringing some of the facts.to do with the war more forcefully home to them than would otherwise be the case. I hope so anyhow! I felt bound to inspect Birjand on my way South to Zabul since this post was just being re-opened. We were put up by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk one of the local Persian notabilities who showered such lavish hospitality upon us that what with the heat and the bad road Carr and I became slightly bilious!! Clinton Thomas, the-Vice-Consul at Birjand, is an I.C.S. youngster and a good type of lad. He has had no previous experience in Persia and does not speak the language, but should, I think, do well. Prom Birjand we went on to a Rest-house at Shusp where we spent most of the night, not too uncomfortably, and left at 4-30 a.m. A very disagreeable drive across virtual desert for 136 miles with a following wind. Although it was mostly flat or downhill the car overheated and boiled and we had to stop to let her cool so you can imagine what the temperature was like. After leaving the main road and striking East for Zabul we came to the Sheila river crossing. This had only been reported a few days before as ‘'open 1 ’ for the first time this year and when we got to it I could see that we were in for trouble. We therefore waited for a lorry with a tow rope attached in case of trouble. We got it alright, the tow rope parted and nothing would induce the car to go backwards or forwards. After heaving about in the mud for a couple of hours we got the car out backwards and undamaged and sent it off to await us at Zahidan. Carr and I meanwhile transferred ourselves and our luggage to the lorry and eventually arrived in this fashion at Zabul at 3.30 p.m. on September 8th rather the worse for wear but having been fortunate all things considered. There is no Consular Officer at this post at the moment and it is in charge of a British Indian Pro-Consul Khan Bahadur Haiy Elhashmy M.B.E., a worthy old servant who had retired after 31 years service in the Government of India but who came out again, following representations by Skrine at meshed, as a contribution towards the war effort. i/ W.M. Codrington Esq., M.C., Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.I an'glad I came here since the menial staff are, in my opinion, 'being grossly underpaid and not properly cared for. I discussed the matter with Colonel Watts, the Consul from Sahidan, who happened to 'be here on a visit and he expressed himself privately as entirely concuffih^ ih my view; I have dealt witti the position fully in my official report. There is another 'biggish question in the air affecting Zabul, Zahidan, Birjand and Meshed about which, while it is not a Security problem, you may like to hear. Watts, who has had years of foreign service and is very knowledgeable about Persia (He also speaks Russian which is a considerable asset in this country in these days) is very anxious that Zabul should be brought under his superintendence at Zahidan and possibly Birjand also. The principal arguments in favour of this course are (l) the geographical propinquity of Zabul to Zahidan and the easier means of access to it from Zahidan which is only 120 miles away and (2) the fact that Zabul has recently been incorporated, for administrative purposes, in the Governorship of Mukran, in v/hich Zahidan is also situated. Having seen the conditions on. the spgt and in view of the distance from Meshed to ZaBul viz nearly 650 miles, over a most execrable road, whereas Zahidan is only 120 miles away, I am of the opinion that, in so far as Zabul only is concerned, this change should certainly be made. Birjand lies just about midway between Meshed and Zahidan and the arguments in favour of bringing it under the superintendence of the latter post seem to be about equal. Birjand has, however, greatly increased in importance since the war, for the reasons set out in my official report, and the time may not be far distant when it may be considered advisable to raise its status and set it up as an independent post on its own. I am not however in a position to state v/hether the moment for doing so is yet ripe. We leave tomorrow for Zahidan. • L. - v ^ Yours ever, (Signed) John Dashwood.Copy (Y 6412/6412/900) PERSONAL &amp; SECRET British Consulate, Kerman, September 15 th 1942. My dear Will, I arrived here last last night after a pretty grilling trip of over 600 miles from Meshed via Birjand and Zabul to Zahidan and then another 350 miles from Zahidan via Nasratabad across the Kerman desert to Bam in one hop. The roads at their best are in most places little better than glorified cart-tracks and across large stretches of the desert, and beyond, one just winds one’s way as best one can to avoid breaking the springs over bumps and holes or getting the crank-case stove in by large boulders or in sx:)Ots v/here the ruts have become so deep that there is danger of the car becoming ’’bellied”. Luckily we came through without mishap, with the occasional use of a spade, except on the way to Zabul where the car became bogged at the crossing of the Sheila river. After floundering about in evil-smelling mire for about an hour and a half we succeeded in getting her out as I have already told you in my earlier letter. Zahidan was quite the lousiest spot which I have struck in Persia - an arid wilderness with no verdure of any description and no amenities. The inhabitants have the reputation of being all diseased and the appearance of being in a perpetual state of semi-coma from opium smoking to which the Persians are much addicted. Watts, the Consul, is a big beefy fellow who served in Prance with ’’the Hampshires” in the last war, then transferred to the Indian Army and then into the Indian Political Service. He \ was in charge of the Consulate at Kashgar for some time and was l due to go back there when he was sent to Zahidan instead. He is very resentful over this and is a man with a grievance against the world in general. Temperamental, close-fisted, hermit-like and full of odd idiosyncrasies. I don’t think that he and Skrine, his superintending Consul at Meshed, hit it off too well together but their relations are quite correct. As I have already told you, in my opinion Zahidan should be constituted as a post on its own, separate from Meshed, and Zabul should be transferred to the superintendence of Zahidan. Apart from the arguments contained in my letter of September 10th the change would avoid, a great deal of overlapping and unnecessary correspondence. On the Security side, I did not like the extent to which the Indian Trade Assistant is helping with much of the Secret work in Watts’s office. There is nothing against him but it is, I thjrki dangerous since although he is not supposed to have access to any + KUok $ Cyphers except the ”Q” Indian Cypher 1 ' I this, I gather, is in eijtnJh' con sonance with what is done regularly in India and the ,Vvc ^7 Government of India have approved the arrangement in principle), he might be able to get at the Foreign Office Cyphers or some of Ctrfa. (x^-4 ^ucf more Secret files if Watts happened to leave the room for some reason or another and in a moment of mental aberration forget &lt;xbaX«-. either to close the safe or to leave one of the Foreign Office Cyphers or Secret files on his table. Both therefore on Security grounds and because the work also seems to justify it I feel that Watts should have a reliable full-time junior to help him. It does not matter too much whether the junior has previous experience of Consular work provided that he is a 'Vhite man” in every sense and has his head reasonably well screwed on. Kerman has just got such a man in the shape of a young lad from the Indian Army v/ho had his leg blown to ribbons in a recent frontier affray. W.M. Codrington, Esq., M.C., /Watts Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.HHHHIHHHiHBI e Watts is a man of rather untidy habits which is reflected in the way his papers are kept, but he is reasonably security-minded and apart from the question of his using the Indian Trade Assistant too much and the general lack of physical security, for which Watts is not responsible, I did not find anything else particularly serious to cavil at as a result of my inspection of his post. Yours ever, (Signed} John Dashwood.'“■opy. I.Y 6804/64X3/900). PER80HAI: &amp; 3^0 RET My dear Will, British Consulate, Kerman. September 17th 1942. This is quite the most attractively built and the best found Consulate that I have come across sb'ferin Iran the next nearest in comparison being Meshed. The garden and grounds have been laid out with great taste and, I should say, at considerable expense. The owner, from whom the property was originally rented, eventually got into financial difficulties with the result that the Government of India were able to acquire it for Tomans 26,000, or Just over £2,000 at the present rate of exchange. The figure was much higher in terms of sterling at the time of purchase owing to the different rate of exchange then ruling but the bargain was, in any case, a good one. A change of incumbency was taking place at the very moment that I arrived. Barlow, a man of 39 and a member of the Indian Civil and Political Services, taking over from Colonel Falconer who had been here for five years. The Vice-Consul, Nicholson, who has just been invalided out of the Indian Army, on account of war wounds, has also only been here a few days, with the result that neither he nor the Consul have yet got fully into the saddle. They both seem to be shaping up well, however, and should make a good team. The Physical Security of the Confidential offices is perhaps a little better than most of the others in East Persia but could still be improved upon. The working arrangements also seemed good and the Cyphers and files were neatly kept and made a favourable comparison with Watts*s show at Zahidan. The whole Consulate here has in fact a much more businesslike appearance but the dreary environment of Zahidan may have been party responsible for the unfavourable impression created there. 1 / W.^. Codrington, Esq., M.C., Foreign Office, Whitehall, • S.W.l.I have taken exception in ray report to the fact that Captain Hassan and Captain Harrison have undoubtedly had opportunities of, if they have not actually had, access to Foreign Office Cyphers without authority having been obtained for this. Captain Hassan is a Sikh and seems to be a decent type of man. Captain Harrison is 100^ Bri Jh. Though I have nothing against Hassan I was not happy about the principle of his having access to Foreign Office Cyphers but I believe the India Office allow officers of his calibre to have access to their Cyphers. I have therefore ruled that neither he nor Harrison must have access to Foreign Office Cyphers until authority for this has been obtained and that the question of similar authority for India Office Cyphers must be taken up with the Government of India. ♦ - — Apart from this and the question of the security of Cypher telegrams for Colonel Stuart I found little of importance to question. I hope to get to Isfahan on September 19th. The remaining posts on my list will then b^ Shiraz, Bushire, Muscat, Jedda, Khartoum and Port Sudan, and there is also a visit to Ankara and Istanbul to be fitted in. V/e have had no mail for over two months owing to being so much on the move but hope to hit some off at Isfahan. Yours ever, (Signed) John Dashwood.Copy. (Y 7422/7158/000). PERSONAL &amp; SECRET. British Consulate General, Bushire. October 20th 1°42. My dear Will, It has been '-an interesting experience to come down here. £In the first place the road passes through some -•‘ic magnificent mountain’ scenery rising- at times to.a height of about 8,500 feet with most .alarming hair pin bends. Then, the Qashgais’who inhabit the territory to the North and South of Shiraz, have been cutting up rough and have been holding up a number of cars and depriving tne occupants of all their valuables and stripping them to the bone. Stories ar^ told of some passengers arriving with nothing more than a newspaper to hide their nudity from the vulgar gaze. In these circumstances Brenan, the Consul at Shiraz, deemed it prudent to ask for an armoured car to precede us to Kazerum. We suffered considerable discomfort from having to travel in the wake of its oust but were spared the anxiety of being molested by bandits. It was probably just as well that these precautions were taken since the following day Brenan telegraphed to say that there had been a recrudescence of hold-ups and that the road must be considered unsafe. ^ 10 - It was a pleasant surprise for me to find that the Political Resident Colonel Prior, was an old friend whose acquaintance I had made in Switzerland. He strikes me as being absolutely first-class and I had nothing but a few comparatively minor points to cavil at in the running of the [office. As usual, however, the weak point was outside. Lieutenant Odellt who is a conscientious fellow but not very bright, was carrying a file of Cypher telegrams around owing to having no facilities for their safe custody. This is being put right at once and the whole business of the future distri bution of any copies of telegrams, to outside persons or offices, is being tightened up. The Resident is also examining the possibility of building on an extra room to enable the cyphering to be done in one room only and for all the Cyphers to be kept there. If the above changes are made I think that this place should be pretty secure. You will see from the report th^t the Confidential clerks, who also have access to the Cypher Books, are all British Eurasians. I was originally inclined to be prejudiced against having persons of this nature to handle Cyphers but after seeing their work at different posts and discussing the matter with the Resident, I have reached the conclusion that, on the whole, they are more trustworthy than many European British subjects. In | fact the only European who was employed on Cyphers here has had I to be sent away through taking to drink.’.’ I propose to leave for Basra en route to Ankara via Bagdad as soon as I can get transport. In the course of my travels through Persia I have covered over 4,000 miles of really bad going and must count it lucky not to have been held up for anything more serious than a puncture except when the car got bogged at the crossing of the Sheila river. Towards the termination of each day’s run we always seemed to meet unending processions of weary and over burdened donkeys literally staggering into the towns. W.M. codrington Esq., M.C., Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Frequently/n.o. «3o/ Hi These despatches deal v/ith security arrangements at Meshed, Bir^ajid, Zabul, Sahidan, Merman and Bushire.

Sir John Dashwood’s recommendations may be summarised as follows:- (i) That bars should be placed on the windows of the Consul’s new office. (ii) That the door marked ”X” on the plan attached to his report should be abolished. (iii) That grilles should be fitted over the doors marked 'Y” and 'Z” in the plan, or in the alternative that Burglar Alarms should be installed. (iv) That a cypher register should be maintained. (v) That messages received in cypher for the ORE should be paraphrased before being passed on to his office. (vi) That 'INDIV' pads should be repaired where necessary. (vii) That Captain Hassan, C.L.O., should not have access to Poreign Office cyphers without the sanction of the Foreign Office. (viii)That the same applies to Captain Harrison, Adjutant of the Royal Engineers. (ix) That Captain Hassan should not have access to the secret archives, and should v/ork in the old office. (x) That the key of the safe in the old office should be placed in the combination safe. (xi) That the keys of the confidential archives cupboards should also be kept there out of office hours. (xii) That a rush burning programme should be prepared. (xiii)That secret outgoing mail xhaix awaiting despatch should be placed in the confidential cupboard. (xiv) That no secret mail should be sent by post. (xv) That 'precedents' cards should be kept. (x^i) That an aeroplane courier service should be instituted. 5. On these recommendations I have the following comments to make:- fi) Bars for the windows have been ordered. (ii) and (iii) The door marked 'X', though not a necessity,ia a convenience as it is the only means of access to the office in bad weather without going out into the open (the verandah does not, as appears from the plan, extend beyond the drawing room). T propose to have fitted to it a spare Chubb lock similar to those fitted to the other outside doors. On the general question of the security provided by the doors it is suggested that in view of the position of the office, and the watchman who patrols at night, they are adequate for ordinary circumstances. If the Staff including the Consul were 'hors de combat' no grilles would keep the building secure as the walls themselves are in places only one brick thick and could easily be demolished with a crowbar. ! iv) A cypher register has been started, v) The C.R.E.’s messages are being paraphrased, vi) The 'INDIV” pads have been repaired. vii) Captain Hassan does not have access to any cyphers at present. I propose to take up' this question as soon as it is decided what his status should be, i. e. whether he should become Additional Vice Consul or not (vide my telegram No.209 dated 23rd September). (viii)Captain Harrison’s position has now been clarified (vide your telegram No.155 dated 7th October). /ix)- 2 - The proposal that Captain Hassan should not work; in Vice Consul's office or have access to the secret archives is possibly due to a misunderstanding. Captain Hassan does not know the combination of the safe and has no occasion to go to it tor take out the secret books and files in it; but he does have frequent occasion to refer to the files in the confidential cupboard, and he could not carry cut his work as Consular Liaison Officer effectively without doing sc. The key of the old safe is now kept in the combination safe. The keys of the confidential cupboards are not taken out of office either by the Vice Consul or myself but are kept in drawers of our office desks, the keys of which are on cur key rings. This makes it unnecessary to undo the combination safe for the purpose of getting at the confidential files. If this is not considered sufficient protection the keys can be kept in the safe as suggested. xii) A rush burning programme ia being prepared. xiii) Secret mail awaiting despatch is now kept in the confidential cupboard. No secret mail is sent by post. The system of 'precedents' cards will be introduced as occasion arises. I entirely agree with Sir John that a more efficient courier service is urgently required, and that an aeroplane service would provide an excellent solution.w 2nd December* 194S* Dear Chancery, your despatch No. 373 (G. 1128/5/42) of November 4th about security at Kerman Consulate* We are not quite clear what Captain Harrison’s 'osition is in regard to access to cyphers.

Khorramabad will shortly become General Headquarters of the 10th Army and we may find that we need a Vice-Consul and a clerk there also. 7. I realise that we are asking for a lot but owing to the peculiarities of Persian administration we have to rely on Consuls to see that the measures we arrange with the Persian Government are carried out locally and Consuls have an enormously increased burden also in connexion with supplies and propaganda. It is essential to strengthen our hold on the areas of special interest to us. We cannot find staff in the Middle East and efforts in India have so far been unavailing.

INDIA OFFICE '■■■■■■■■I -Jn any further communication subject, please quote 'The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. Sir, 0N O' fart' V &gt;1 3005 W i &gt; oreign Office. S.W.l. 5th June, 1942. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, from which it will be seen that Captain M.P.O.C. Tandy assumed charge as British Vice-Consul at Meshed on the 16th February last. * 2. As Mr. H.A.N. Barlow, whose appointment to Meshed was the subject of correspondence with the India Office last year {see India Office letter EXT 5629/4f? of the 12th Septemberand'earlier correspondence), also assumed duty at Meshed on the 25th February last, it would appear that Mr. Tandy’s appointment as Vice-Consul is in excess of the authorised establishment of the post. 3. I am therefore to enquire whether it is intended that Imperial Funds should meet the usual moiety of the cost involved in the appointment of a second Vice- Consul to Meshed. 4. It will be seen from India Office letter EX 4144/41 of tha 31st Ju ly last enclosing a copy of a te legram Ho. 5625 of t he 18th July, 1941, from the ^Government of India, that the proposals made therein, to place certain Indian political officers in consular posts in Persia, were to be reviewed in the spring of 19CL, and I am accordingly to request that the Government of^India may now be asked to report on the necessity for the continuance of these posts. ✓ 5. Finally, with reference to Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1941, No. K 10474 /7113/254, I am to enquire Whether the transfer of Lieutenant k.-h;. Hodson, to/ RECd. 942 »ary of State, ice. IND^ 6 JUN OFFICEu ■ r I / to take up the post of Vice-Consul at Kerman,was proceeded with and if so, the date on which he assumed duty there, in order that steps may he taken to appoint him in the usual manner.
