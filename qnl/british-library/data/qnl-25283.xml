Of this total Pour hundred thousand francs represent a debt owed by Prince Akbar to the Russian Eank ( and no liability is entailed under this head on His Majesty’s Government.

After an exchange of compliments, air A. hicolson handed to him a letter signed by me, which extended to his 'property” the guarantee given jointly by His Majesty’s Government and that of Russia regarding his life and honour, oir A. hicolson added that a similar letter would be given him at ietrograd by the Russians. His Imperial Highness then stated that he desired a settlement of his claim (which amounts to one million francs) for pillage of his goods by the Germans at Isfahan, and repeated the solution proposed by him on a recent occasion, viz. by the remission of taxes &amp;c., and by the acceptance by the Russian Government of the debt of Four hundred- thousand francs incurred by his son, Akbar lirza, aaram-ed-Dovleh, towards the Russian Bank at Isfahan. bir A. hicolson replied that as regards the latter point, the 111 would doubtless discuss mattersmatters with iionsieur bazonow: l is l.lajesty 's ■ 7 d!Q' V'm ; Government hah decidea to reconmeah J^o the Persian Government the remission of taxes as the best solution of the above-mentioned claim, air A. hicolson took the opportunity to emphasize clear ly and without room for any doubt, the great desirability that l is Imperial Highness should not confiscate the estatesof Bakhtiari Khans whom he might consider himself Justified in regarding with suspicion, nor deal harshly with people whom he might dislike as pro enemy. The main object of the Zil's return was to secure the restoration of law and order: and this purpose would not be served by vindictive measures. It was essential that neighbouring chiefs should live peacefully with each other. The Zil stated that he harboured no evil feel ings against the Bakhtiari, with whom he had only on one occasion (and then on instructions from above) dealt severely: he added that he had no intention whatever to repeat this severity and would live peaceably with them: but it would be necessary for His f.;ajesty*s Government to give a word of warning to the Khans also, as recently their behaviour at Isfahan had been overbearing. His Imperial Highness also stated most solemnly in reply to a remark by Bir A. Mcolson - that he entertained no designs whatever against his grand nephew, the present bhah: and that he was- prepared to take any oath that he would always remain a loyal subjectin Is. iir subject of the present Shah and hie successors. The Zil then remarked that while full of gratitude for what His Majesty's aovemraent had done, he must point out that, be his intentions ever so praiseworthy, be required certain material support. To arrive back at Isfahan with only- moral backing would render his task impossible. 10,000-20,000 Ee desired to receive Ten to Twenty thousand tomans, £2,000-64,000 i.e. Two to Four thousand pounds to pay men with, and also five hundred to one thousand rifles with which to arm them. Be added that five hundred rifles would in Tarsia soon be mentioned as fifty thousand &amp;c. Ouch was rumour in her si a. Be added that While the Tiussian troops were in Isfahan all would be quiet but he would be useless if not able to stand by himself. sir A. Kicolson said in reply, that he recognized the reasonableness of the Til's conten tion and the matter would be discussed with the icussian Government. Be added that you would ae kept fully informed and that Bis Imperial highness would of course be guided by your advice, When the Zil arrived at Teheran. I am, with great truth and regard.

He expressed on his father’s hehalf the greatest appreciation of his reception hy Sir Edward Grey yesterday hut added that it was an occasion which had furnished no opportunity for a '’business conversa- tion' and the Zil therefore desired him to discuss the situation with me for submission to Sir E. Grey. Prince Ismael stated that the Zil was most grateful for the Prs.200,000 advanced by His Majesty’s Government for his journey expenses and desired that the question of the one million francs loss which he had incurred at Ispahan might be settled. On my remarking that as yet Sir E. Grey had been furnished with no detailed statement on the subject, Prince Ismael replied that the situation was as follows His eldest brother, Prince Akbar (the present Minister for Foreign Affairs), when compelled to leave Ispahan at the beginning of the German rising there, had raised a loan of Frs.400,000 from the Hussian Bank at Ispahan to enable him to transact various family matters and to escape. The remaining Frs.600,000 were on account of jewellery and gold and silver plundered from the strong boxes etc. left in thethe Imperial Bank of Persia, I informed the Prince that Sir E. Grey had already begun to discuss the question of the Zil’s loss with the Russian Government and while I could not hold out any hope that the question would he settled before his departure from England, I sincerely trusted that some solution might have been arrived at before it was time for the Zil to leave Petrograd. Prince Ismael thereupon proposed that the matter might be settled in the following manner. The Russian Government should take over the Prince’s liability to the Russian Bank, viz: Prs. 400,000. Regarding the remainder (Prs.600,000), His Majesty’s Government should give ”a formal promise” of its recovery and it should be recovered as follows Prs.200,000 had already been advanced by His Majesty’s Government to the Zil. There remained Hrs.400,000. This sum might be recovered in the following manner If His Majesty’s Government exercised influence on the Persian Government the latter could remit the taxes payable by the Zil on account of his properties in Persia which amounted to a large figure. The remainder, if remainder were necessary, could be reimbursed to the Zil from the payments due to the Central Government from the province of Ispahan. By this means, His Majesty’s Government wouldwould not de called upon to furnish any further cash payment to the Zil. The Persian Government, who had no money to spare, would not he called upon to make any out-of-pocket expenditure and the Zil’s losses would he made good to him. I promised to record this proposal and submit it to Sir E. Grey without offering any comment on its feasibility. It tf\jL - I pointed out to Prince Ismael that objects of value left at the Imperial Bank might well have been deposited there at the Zil’s risk, in which case it might not be fair to hold the Persian Government responsible for robberies by the Germans and their supporters. Prince Ismael replied that as the Persian Government were responsible for law and order in Persia, they were surely primarily liable. As regards the Germans and their supporters, he would not hesitate, if the claim did not lie against 1 the Persian Government, to confiscate the properties 1 of the pro-Germans in Ispahan, some of whom were i wealthy, and thereby recover the sums. I added that, as regards the Frs.400,000 to be taken over by the Russian Government, he would have a suitable occasion to discuss the matter with M. Sazonoff when in Petrograd. tfhen a friend of the Zil’s enquired when H.I.H. was leaving England, Prince Ismael replied in.:my presence, tnat in a, measure it depended on the Foreign Cifice as one Zil was most desirous of receiving a satisfactory reply onon the subject of his finances. (This does not look very encouraging.) Prince Ismael also urged strongly the need of receiving an assurance for the Zil's 'Mens” in addition to that regarding his life and honour.

His Excellency alleges as reason question of principle and possibility of the Germans requesting similar facilities.
