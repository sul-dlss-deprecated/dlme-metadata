The front surface has been carefully finished and used as a trail piece. At the bottom are four registers of \u201cT\u201d signs above which are five feather signs. The two outside feather signs are in sunk relief, the middle three were painted in red ink apparently to serve as guiding lines. The feather sign second from the right is partially sculptured. There are traced of red outlines on almost all of the \u201cT\u201d signs. The workmanship is poor but the piece has considerable technical interest as evidence of production method. The back is rough. \r\nCondition:  A few slight scratches on the surface.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "4 9/16 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 in.
