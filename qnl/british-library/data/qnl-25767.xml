Cowasjee Dinshaw &amp; Brothers. Sir Hormusjee, who is now 82 years old, has for several years resided in Bombay, leaving the local management of his business in Aden to his sons, but at my invitation, he has now paid a special visit to Aden on the occasion of the Centenary. Since his arrival he has spoken to me about his continued apprehension regarding the future of the Aden Salt Industry, in which he and many of his friends are deeply interested. He has given me a Note that was drawn up by him and them in Bombay on this subject in the hope that I might find it possible to make some public reference to this question during the Centenary Celebrations. I have not thought it appropriate to do so, and I have told Sir Hormusjee that I consider it better and more likely to be effective if I were to infoim you of the representations that he has made to me. 2. The present position of the Aden salt exporters is that, the Indian Additional Salt Duty having been abolished from the 30th of April, 1938, they are placed on an The Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, M.P., H.M’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, London .&lt;s - 2 - an equality with salt producers in India, hut at the same time they are exposed to the competition of* foreign salt works, such as those in the Italian East African Colonies. There is also no certainty that the Indian Additional Salt Duty will not he re—imposed at the end of the present financial year or at some time in the future. If the G-overnment of India were to take such a step, the injury to Aden Salt interests and to the revenue of the Colony of Aden would he very considerable. 3. I have made frequent representations on this subject in the past, and I have assured Sir Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw that the Aden Salt interests may he certain that His Majesty* s Government are fully alive to the importance of their case. I hope that it will he possible for His Majesty’s Government to make to the Government of India any representations that may he necessary from time to time to safeguard this industry, and that you will he able to authorise me to give a reply to Sir Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw that will allay his fears. I have, etc., etc., (Signed) B.R.REILLY. Governor.I &lt; * AB£2j MO. s 3 ,5 / J Colonial Office, Downing Street, ^ May, 1939. Sir, I have the honour to aclaiowledge the receipt of your despatch No.56 of the 15th of February regarding your conversations with Sir Honmisjee Cowasjee Dinshaw on the subject of the Aden salt industry. 2. X see no objection to your giving an assurance to Sir Hormusjee that His Majesty’s Government are fully alive to the importance of Aden’s salt interests, and to your also informing him, should you consider it desirable, that, if occasion arose, I should be prepared to consider whether representations could suitably be made on behalf of this industry.
