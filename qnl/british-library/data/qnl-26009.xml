I attach a copy or Chancery Tehran's letter ho* 211/4/48 of the 18th March about the disposal of the Persian Pamine Relief Fund referred to in the Political Resident's Express Letter No. 3^-4/^ of the 6th January. We consider that any transfer of responsibility for the administration of the Fund would seem to require the agreement of the present successor of 'the Bombay Government which adopted the resolution of 1875 and the Political Resident is only authorised to deal with the interest for a particular purpose namely for “relieving poor applicants at the British Government's Dispensary at Bushire' and it is specially provided in the resolution that the principal of the Fund is not to be touched. We feel that subject to the agreement of the successor government the total sum at credit amounting to 15,115-10-0 Rupees should more properly be handed over to the Indian Embassy. If you agree with our view we would be grateful if you would obtain the Government of India's concurrence to this proposal. (R.A. Olinton-Thomas) F.A.K.

Department, v«e enclose copies of an express letter from the Political Resident, Bahrein, and its enclosure, about the disposal of the Persian Famine Relief Fund. As you will observe, the Political Resident does not consider that he should continue to dispose of the assets of this fund anu would iiite to hand them over to us. We would, of course, be very glad to take over the assets and hand them over to the Persian Red Lion and Sun, or other charitable institution, for the benefit of the poor of Bushire. The question is whether in law or equity we are entitled to do so without the concurrence of the Government of India. From the enclosure to the Political Resident’s letter, it is clear that in 1875 the balance of the old ’’Persian Famine Relief Fund” was taken over by the Bombay Government as a ’’Local Fund” a^d that control of both' principal and interest was assumed by that Government. 3o far as we know, control of all funds and other assets in India which prior to August 15th 1947 vested in the Government of India or a provincial Government have since that date vested in the successor Dominion or Provincial Government concerned, and not in His Majesty’s Government. If this view is correct, control of the Persian Famine Relief Fund should rightly pass to the Government of India or the provincial Government of Bombay. If you agree, therefore, we shall discuss the matter with the Indian Smbasay here and arrange with them for the transfer of the funds. l£ou will notice from the Political Resident’s Express letter that a copy of it has been sent to the Commonwealth Relations Office, whom you will no doubt wish to consult. Incidentally, the sum of Rupees 40 per month, mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Express letter, has not been drawn since the interest payments stopped on the 16th September, 1946. i/e are sending a copy of this letter to the Political Resident.

Mr. Harrison. I would assume from the letter dated 28th May 1875 and the memorandum No 5752 dated 10th September, 1875 that the Persian P a mine Relief Fund was a fund created or maintained by public sub scriptions for the relief of famine in Persia, and that it was held by the Committee as trustees for that purpose. If that is so the P.P.R.P. was, I think, a public charitable trust. I do not read the resolution of the 24th September 1875 as pur porting to put an end to the charity and vest the fund in the Government. In 1875, there was no statutory provision for settling a scheme such as it now contained in s.92 of the Code of Civil Pro cedure and the right to do so was probably vested in the Crown.
