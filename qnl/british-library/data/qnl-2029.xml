IvIUTUTE . On June the 5th the War Office telegraphed to the G.in C.,India, their agreement that India should now assume responsibility for the control of all land defence measures in the Persian Gulf less oweit, the responsibility for air operations remaining under the A.C.C.Iraq. (Previously the whole of this responsibility had rested with the latter.) The telegram below from the C.in C.India to the i.ar Office shows that the Chiefs of Staff in India have lost no time in examining the question of the defence of the Persian Gulf area. Moreover, they have already appointed a military commander for the iersian Gulf and have sent him on reconnaissance with re mesentatives of the C.in C. 44M6iA&amp; EasifraJid the ,-,.&lt;7.0. Iraq. This fldission will consult the lolitical Kesident in the Persian Gulf. as regards the Arab Coast, the telegram mentions articularly Bahrein and Sharjah. The A.A.defence of Bahrein is discussed in the notes at Ext.2868/41, flagged in the attached collection No.30/192, which also contains information about other defence measures at Bahrein. We do not seem to have heard anything about the defence of Sharjah since we received the appreciation dated January, 1939, incollection No.2C/l94, attached. As for the Persian Coast, the telegram suggests that a small force may have to be sent to Bushire (? to evacuate British^nationals from Iran or, if circumstances v/ere favourable/to support tribal activity in conjunction with action from the A.I.C.C. area. Although this does not necessarily mean that Eushire would be held against enemy attack, it will involve a review, in consultation with the Political Resident, of the decision reached last (see telegram to the Government of India ilo.55C5 of September the 10th, flagged). This decision was that, notwithstanding the recommendations of the Government of India and the Political-Resident, unless circumstances altered materially, Bistre should be evacuated and not defended, only a small/force bein sent there to cover the evacuation. ensure the security of the Straits of Hormuz. It is fortunate that the Government of India have recently secured, in competition Yvith the Japanese, a contract for the purchase of a large quantity of salt from the island of that name. This removes a potential menace and will give them an opportunity to extend their influence there. War Staff for any observations. August by the C.in C.

It is only recently, after many months of effort on the part of this Residency that the land defences of Bahrain have been placed on a proper footing and 1 feel that this would have been achieved much earlier had the responsibility lain on India and not Ira^. 3* There are no defences worth the name in Kuwait, and the scheme provided depends on the despatch of forces which the Iraq Command would almost certainly not be able to spare in an emergency. So long as Iraq remains quiet, Kuwait is not threatened, but if Iraq is in a disturbed state then Kuwait is almost defenceless. 4. as regards Bahrain, of the defence measures provided, the Defence officer, the arms and ammunition, the anti air craft battery and its personnel are either Indian or have been sent from India, and the armed police and motor transport been found locally, ^part from a searchlight on a defective lorry and the temporary loan of an officer from the Iraq Levies nothing whatever has been received from the Iraq Command. 5. As regards Muscat, the ilitary adviser and assistance of every sort has been sent from India, and beyond the prepara tion of defence schemes and a Royal Air Force wireless station nothing whatever has been supplied by Iraq. 6. Since it will be seen that the requirements of Defence on the Arab Coast are those of Land Forces, with the assistance of the Navy, it appears obvious that tils littoral should be under India and not Iraq, since India and India alone can supply / ourt 2514 I 9 A 1 J our requirements* Moreoyer f this littoraX as a whoi&amp; looks to India and not Iraq* The political and naval control is already based on lndia f the trade is mainly with lndia f and the principal steamer service is based on India* The incurs of Iraq into this area is neither natural or necessary and cannot 9 to my mind f be justified from any point of view* I recommend therefore that control of defence on the Arab Joag should be removed from the Iraq Command and placed under India at the earliest possible moment* Such air assistance as may be required would 9 it is presumed t continue to be given by Iraq* I am sending a cop£ of this despatch to His Majesty** Secretary of State for India* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sdo C*G.

I8th September 1939. Dear Strafford, As you are aware, we and the political authorities in the Persian Gulf are very anxious that steps should he taken as urgently as possible to implement the defence appreciations for the Arab States of the Gulf which were worked out earlier this year by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq. These appreciations were considered in June by the Oversea Defence Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence which recommended that they should, generally speaking, be approved and that ’’The Air Ministry should take the necessary action to give effect to the proposals made in them so that the local authorities can proceed with the preparation of defence schemes’ 1 (Oversea Defence Committee Minute No.344, dated 14th June). The Political Resident has asked us for immediate authority for the creation of the suggested Bahrein ■/ volunteer force (see my letter of the 13th September, No.P.Z. 5552/39), An urgent decision is also desired in the matter , . of/ Wing commander S.C.Strafford, D.F.C., Air Ministry. ' - .2 of the froe grant of c.rrr,o to che FJultan of Muscat on the lines contemplated in the Muscat defence appreciation (see Peel's letter to Foster of the 5th September, ITo.P.2.5462/39, and also my letter to you of the 15th •September, No*P.2.5601/39) c 2. Apart from the practical difficulties in the way of supplying arms I understand from you that the Air Ministry have not yet succeeded in obtaining covering sanction from the Treasury for the various measures proposed* In case it may be of help I enclose a list of / the main items of expenditure contemplated in the several / defence appreciations. I am unable to estimate the expenditure involvec, but obviously it is comparatively small and we hope that you will have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary sanction very urgently. From the local point of view it is important that the proposed defence measures should be given effect as soon as possible. All the more important Rulers have offered His Majesty's Government their co-operation in the war and it is very desirable that they should be encouraged by tangible evidence of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to assist them in improving their local defences. It is also important for us to ensure the protection of the oil wells and/3 and refinery at Bahrein, and I need not emphasise the significance of the Arab coast of the Gnlf generally as a link in air communications with India. 3. There is of course a serious practical difficulty in regard to the early supply of arms, and particularly of automatic guns. The defence appreciations suggested a total supply of 35 Bren guns, viz. 4 for the store at Koweit, 12 for the Bahrein police (to he paid for hy the Bahrein Government), 9 for the Bahrein volunteer defence force, 6 for Qatar (to he paid for hy the Sheikh), and 4 for Muscat. Prom recent correspondence it appears that towards the end of August the Political Agent, Bahrein, secured from the Government of India a promise of 12 Vickers-Berthier guns for the Bahrein Government. The Government of India have said, however, that they have no more Vickers-Berthier guns available for purchase or on loan, and have suggested that the War Office he asked to give priority for the supply of Bren guns to the Gulf States, and that the Air Ministry offer to provide Lewis guns until Bren guns become available should he pursued. This “offer 11 refers to an assurance given to us orally hy Poster in June, (a copy of our telegram on the subject was sent to the Air Ministry with India Office letter of the 17th June, No.P.2•3668/39) hut I understand that it would now he extremely/4. extremely difficult to male ever Lewis guns available. We hope however ■•hat you will do wnat you can to secure the early satisfaction of the needs of the Gulf States in this matter. If you wish us to do so we will ash the Government of India to what extent they can help in the supply of rifles and S.AAo 4. I am sending a ccpv of this letter to Gilbert at I he Treasury, who I understand is concerned with the Air Vote 7 and also to Simpson at The War Office. Yours sincerely? (Sgd.) J. P.

Attached herewith, for your information, is a copy of extracts from the Sub-Committee*s Report, and a copy of an Appendix which was attached thereto giving their recommendations, in detail, regarding the provision of equipment* 3. The Appreciations are now being examined by this Headquarters in the light of these recommendations, and suitable amendments will be issued in due course, where necessary. 4. It will be noted in paragraph 6 of the attached extracts that the Sub-Committee recommends the provision of the Regular Adjutant and N.C.O. Instructor for Bahrein, and the Air Ministry has now been informed by the India Office that Army Headquarters, India, is prepared to find the personnel.

These recommendations covered the following matters:- 2 The above Papers were referred to the Committee byThe Coiroittee accordingly reviewed the Appreciations only in so far as the above matters were concerned, and their views are recorded in the following paragraphs. Certain comments on matters of detail are contained in an Appendix to this iiinute. PROBAIiLE REINFORCE!IS NTS . 3. In each of the Appreciations three sources are suggested for possible reinforcements in case of an emergency of the type contemplated. These are:- (a) Landing parties from escort vessels. (b) Reinforcements of aircraft or armoured cars from Iraq. (c) Army reinforcements from India. The object in each case is the defence of the territory concerned against tribal attacks and sabotage. It is evident that an emergency of this type might arise when the British Empire as a whole was at peace or at war, though the latter contingency is probably the most likely. The availability of reinforcements must therefore be considered in both sets of circumstances. Peace. 4. In peace-time it is probable that landing parties could be made available from the escort vessels, and it would be reasonable to count on this when considering measures for the protection of British property. Similarly, there is little doubt that assistance would be forthcoming from Royal Air Force sources in Iraq. It is, hov/ever, most unlikely that any Army reinforcements could be sent from India. The number of units, forming part of the Army in India, which is available for use overseas is limited. Furthermore, these units are earmarked for certain definite roles in war-time. As they/ must at all times be ready to proceed in case of sudden emergency, it is unlikely that the Government of India would consent to any of them being despatched on a mission which would affect their immediate availability for their war role. No reliance should therefore be placed on reinforcements for the Persian Gulf from India in peace-time. Y/ar c 5. In war-time it is very unlikely that any reinforcements would be available to meet the danger of tribal attacks and sabotage. In the event of serious trouble in the Persian Gulf, arrangements might have to be made by His Majesty’s Government for the despatch of forces to deal with it. These arrangements would have to be made in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, and no mention of any such reinforcements should appear in the local defence schemes.

The General Staff have the toma following comments to offer 2 - (a) That the potential military commitment might be lessened if the Kulers concerned could be induced to tighten up all possible legal and executive measures to deal with individual agitators within their borders, and to improve the standard of their local forces, increasing their strength, when practicable, on the outbreak of war. (b) That any reinforcement to the Gulf area from India must be found from within the troops that have, in consultation with the War Office^ been allocated to External Defence. In view of the commitments which I are at present envisaged for these troops, it appears likely that the acceptance of this additional Iliability would necessitate an increase in the strength of these forces. In accordance with the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee this would require the consent of both His ly&amp;ajesty T s Government and the Government of India. (c) That while we are at present prepared to accept (subject to certain reservations which will be mentioned here after) the strength suggested for reinforcements to be sent from India, we must insure against the possibility of having to rescue, in emergency, small inadequate detachments. It will, therefore, be necessary, as soon as His Majesty f s Government have decided tne recommendations they propose to accept, for a further reconnaissance to be carried out both to guard against this risk and to prepare the necessary administrative plans. (d) That the size of the force recommended for despatch to the SEARJAH FORT - DIBAI area requires further consideration. A platoon for the statie defence of the Fort itself may be adequate, but it is thought that such a small force might be insufficient to afford the necessary protection, in the event of serious trouble, to the landing ground. Similarly V-. the is olated and so mewhat exposed position of DIBAI may need for its protection) recommended* I (e) That the task in KUWAIT does not seem suitable for infantry who could do little more than assist in the defence of the Town and/or its water supply. The essential requirements here seem to be early intelligence and the power to take the initiative against raiders. This is a task for aircraft and mobile forces, and it is suggested that an armoured cavalry regiment could be used with advantage provided it is possible fcag to get its vehicles ashore.v€^(L Would you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No* P.Z^3^67/ / 39, dated the 23rd June 1939? 2.

Office of the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf, P.O.Po.C/122 Camp, KUWAIT.. Dated the 1st March, 1939 Reference your letter No. 3.10347/3/Air 0 of the 13th February enclosing a copy of the Appreciation for the Defence of MUSCAT prepared by the 0.3.0.2 of your Headquarters, my comments are as follows. 2. When X was at &amp;T’ SCAT recently X discussed the question of defence generally with the 3altdn and with Watts, though I had not at that time received your loiter quoted above. In regard to the defence of MUSCAT a certain political consideration has to be borne in mind which does not arise in connection with the Trucial Coast, Qatar, Bahrain Or Kuwait. This is that the Sultan, unlike the other Rulers of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, la juridically an independent sovereign, and therefore his State would not automatically be at war on the side of the British Empire when the latter was engaged, as would the other Arab States. 3 , The Sultan when I had the above discussion with him, though 1 he did not specifically mention his juridical position, indicated 1 that before engaging himself on our Side he would require a definite guarantee from His Majesty’s Government of defence*, (I gave of course no definite answer to this request). This is not unreasonable from his point of view, but I do not know how the Service Departments would regard this proposal. If the Sultan, for instance, were to remain neutral in a war in which we were engaged, (there would be no question of his joining our enemies),, he e mild juridically forbid the use of Muscat waters and Muscat territory, including the use of aerodromes, to our forces. (This would apply equally to the enemy s forces). I suppose the Sultan could also ask for the removal of the Royal Air Force depot at 'iuscat. 4 # This I imagine is what the strict juridical position might be in case of war. In practice, however, I am of the opinion that the 3ultan could not and would not offer armed resistance to any use of his territory which we might have to make, and that he woiild give way vrar© or less amicably to force majeure on our part. As far as his own feelings and sympathies are concerned, I have known him well for many' years, these are definitely on our side as are also his general interests. He has, for example, a very wholesome dislike ; ii and suspicion of both the German and Italian Governments and their is that the Sultan should be assisted in the free rearming and training of his Levies (Paragraphs 19-21 of the Scheme). As this step is intended to secure Msttra and Muscat against tribal attacks from the interior, which apart from anything else is advantageous to the Sultan, I do not imagine that the Sultan would make any objection to this proposal. It is possible that some confidential bargain might be struck with the Sultan by which, in return for his receiving free re-arming and training, he would agree to let us use his waters and territory in time of war without objecting, though without designs 5 The main suggestion in Price’s 3cheme( with which I concur) /necessarily^ Air Vice Marshal J.H.3.

The political aspect of the Defence of Muscat will, however, need some consideration and in the mean time I suggest that the Scheme he forwarded to the Air Ministry with my views. 7. With regard to the possibility of attacks by the Omani tribes on Muscat see paragraph 26(1), (2) and (3) of enclosure to my letter Ho.C/14 of the 18th January, 1938 to the India Office, copy sent to Courtney under ny Printed Letter No. C/15 of e&amp;ie date. 8. There is a .motor track of course that goes up the Batinen Coast from Muscat to Sohar and beyond. This would be of use in case a detachment of the Muscat Levies or of our troops had to be moved in that direction. The track is indifferent and would not stand regular use by heavy traffic unless repairs were carried out in certain sections. Watts who has been over the route could supply details. There is another motor track via a place called HAJJAR some way towards 3UR. '^tts could also supply information as to this track. 9. On a small point.

I have however amended certain portions of tne Apprecia tion to bring it more into line with the points brought forward by you® In particular I nave recommended that the rifles snould be withdrawn from the local guards and stored in tne Port with a reserve of ammunition® Jhile i fully concur with tne remarks made by you on major questions such as the route imperial Airways would use in emergency, 1 consider they snouid be taicen up separately and that what is required at tne moment is some plan which we can worlc on immediately such as tne one outlined in the present Appreciation* I cannot give any decision as to whether SHARJAH or RAS Al» HADD is lively to be used by aircraft for operations over the Persian ^ulf since tnis must depend on the situation and naval plan at the time and tne type of aircraft available, por extended operations by long range aircraft HAS XL HADD might be more suitable, while if only “nart' type aircraft were available SHARJAH would be preferable* I will arrange for the A«L*0. at BAHRAIN to visit SHARJAH to go into tne question of accommodation and supplies for any reinforcements from INDIA* 6 .

I cannot help feeling that ± might well have been sent copies of these enclosures before now, especially that of the O.I.D. paper, when I should have understood that the issues mentioned by me had already, broadly speaking, been dealt with in that paper, instead of being, as I was, in complete ignorance of the subject, vide ray letter ho^698-S^ of 10th December 1938 and my letter ho.66-8^of 14th January. 5. under India Office p.L,Do.P*2,6532/38 of 19th October 1938 X received a copy of letter of 14th July to the (7.I.D. but this merely said that* “It is understood, however, that the question of a defence scheme for Bahrain, which is one aspect of the larger problem discussed in the enclosed correspondence, is at present under investigation separately by the Gommittee of imperial Defence.

Thank you for your letter PZ.786/39 of the 14th February in which you suggest that the Defence Schemes for the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms should be forwarded to the Government of India before they have been reviewed by the Air Ministry. 2. On consideration I feel that such action, apart from being irregular, is not desirable. As you know the defence of the V/estern coast of the Persian Gulf is a Royal Air Force responsibility, and it is only natural that the Air Ministry would wish to examine the Schemes before they are circulated to other Government Departments. 3. In this connection you are probably aware that there is now a new arrangement in the matter of dealing with Defence Schemes (vide 0.D.C.1666 of the 24th January, 1939). The Chiefs of Staff have now ruled that the Oversea Defence Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence is to co-ordinate and review all oversea Defence Schemes including those outside British territory. 4. When the Air Ministry has examined the Air Officer Commanding, Iraqis proposals for the defence of important centres on the Western shores of the Persian Gulf these Schemes will, under the new arrangement,be put before the Oversea Defence Committee for their consideration. The India Office representative on that body will then have the opportunity of commenting and suggesting amendments. On reflection I am sure that you will agree that this is the best arrangement.. . 2 .

Dear sir Trenchard, Thank you for your letter D.0.H0.662-3 of 1st December 1938. Thilat I appreciate thoroughly the value of these exercises, I am afraid the present time is full of difficulties. As you know, all rqy vessels are being re-armed, and until this programme is completed I shall be left extremely short of ships. Although only one ship is re-armed at a time, the passage to Malta takes almost a month which results in two ships being away at a time for considerable periods. Then in addition to this I have been ordered to send ''Fowey* to Aden for important exercises, and after that she proceeds to Bombay for docking. The result is that until the end of January there will only oe one ship in tne Gulf, and the Admiralty have instructed me that this ship is to be at Basrah for the greater part of the time that I am here. /hen the ships come back from re-arming ac Malta it will be essential for them to carry out intensive ship training in order to aocustom the crews to their new armament. You will appreciate from this that my hands are very tied at the moment, and I very much regret that I shall be forced to aay that a ship is not available fairly frequently during the next few months. 1 will bear in mind your wishes in this connection and endeavour to arrange some exercises of this type as early as pose ible. I am sending a copy of this letter to Tyssen. Yours sincerely, sd. Allan Poland.

Could you please refer to my letter No.559-3, dated the 5th November, informing you that an officer had been detailed by the Ai r Officer Commanding, Iraq, to visit the Arab side of the Oulf and draw up, in collaboration with the Political Agents, schemes of local defence. 2.

I trust this will not mean any further postponement of consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence of the general Gulf defence scheme.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter D.O.No. lu'G't 8th October, 1938, a copy of which has been forwarded to me by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and in particular to the question propounded by you in paragraph 8(a). 2. The vulnerability of the Arab States to attack by sea will depend primarily on the number and efficiency of H.M.Ships allocated for the protection of the Gulf. 3. With regard to numbers, 1 have made representations on this matter hnd have eveiy reason to hope that the strength of the force allocated for defence will prove adequat e. 4. There remains the question of efficiency. The requisite standard can only be obtai ned and maintained if sufficient opportunities are presented for the escort vessels to carry out exercises with other ships in company. 5. Ah examination of the services on which the escort vessels have been engaged during the last 12 months shows that the opportunities for exercises have been insufficient. I have conseqiently given instructions to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, that in future it must be the rule rather than the exception for the escort vessels of the Persian Gulf to carry out their duties in company, and requested him to arrange programmes accordingly. 6. This may impose some reduction in the facilities available hitherto for the transport and visits of Political Officers in the Gulf, but I consider that, in the interests of security, this must be accepted. Providing sufficient notice of facilities required is given and it is accepted that, whilst on passage, the shaip concerned will be engaged in exercises, I do not anticipate that any substantial inconvenience should result. 7. I must point out however that owing to the rearmament programme now in progress, each escort vessel in turn will be absent from her station for a period of approximately three months and this will involve a reduction of the facilities avai lable, and I shall be grateful if requests for such facilities may be reduced to a minimum for the time being.

On examination it may be found unnecessary to refer the matter to the C.I.D. as it may transpire'that it will be possible to meet the A.O.C.'s security proposals by departmental action. We already have a sound guide in the Chiefs of Staff Reports on the defence of Bahrein (C.I.D. paper 1461-B; and in that paper one of the conclusions reached is that the possibility of'attack both from sea and air on any appreciable scale is remote and is insufficient to warrant the installation of coast defences or anijj-aircraft guns. This opinion, I think, must overrule the suggestions of the India General Staff concerning the possibility of air attack from Iran and Erit£fa. The conclusions reached by the Chiefs of Staff on .nhrem must reflect on the other places in the Gulf^ the defences oi which are being reviewed, since Bahrein is strategically and commercially of far greater importance than any other point on the western side of the Gulf. I agree that it would be useful for the R.P.G. to have a copy of C.I.D. 1461-B; but apart from sending that document to Powle, I see no need for the question of the Defence of the Persian Gulf to be referred to the C.I.D. unless the investigation of the Defence Requirements for that area now being undertaken by the A.O.C. f Iraq, reveals that the provision of extensive and coastal defences should be undertaken.

As regards your draft 3e tter asking the Committee of Imperial Defence to consider Sir Trenchard Powle’s letter. The three questions which the latter poses in his paragraph 8 would appear to have already heen answered in the Chief of Staff Report 1461-B (para.4). This Report has heen taken note of and approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence itself, vide the Minutes of their 331st meeting. I suggest that it will be sufficient to send the above C.O.S. Report’and the extract from the Minutes to the Resident, and that there is no need to worry the Committee of Imperial Defence again. 2. As regards the suggestion that the Committee of Imperial Defence will not wish to consider the general scheme for the Defence of the Persian Gulf when this has been prepared. I feel that not to have this Defence scheme reviewed by the Committee of Imperial Defence would be contrary to the principles followed in connection with all Empire schemes at the moment. Quite apart from the fact that the Committee of Imperial Defence are the only co-ordinating authority who have the necessary machinery to effect such a reviev/, it is obviously advisable to obtain the advice and assistance of the Defence Departments in the United Kingdom in framing a complicated scheme which involves the co-operation of all three services. I should suggest, therefore, that the Resident be asked to arrange for the draft scheme to be sent home as soon as possible so that it may be reviewed by the Overseas Defence Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 3. It is most important that the General Staff (India) 10,000 4.38 should/should he kept fully informed regarding the progress of this Defence scheme, and that they should he in possession of copies of the scheme when they are ready. The External Affairs Department in India are not likely to possess the draft scheme at the present moment^~Thougtf^ they may have all the correspondence, hut it is the scheme itself that the General Staff want and which we must obtain for them as early as possible. If the Resident sends home the scheme for review by the C.I.D. , I suggest that he should he asked to send copies simultaneously to the Government of India.A r n.,.. i SECR35T. 7490 ] t 1958 FD Mm.

As we were on the brink of a major war in the last week of September I cannot help thinking that it was extremely fortunate that a scheme for the defence of the Gulf was initiated in my letter No.c/14, dated the 18th January 1938, and ’was further examined at the Informal Interdepartmental Meeting of 14th April which was held at ny suggestion, and which I attended. 3. As a result of this Meeting certain broad provisional conclusions were come to - the Meeting being an informal one. These were as summarised in paragraphs3 (a) and (b), 5 and 6 of ray Note to you of 19th April. Some of these conclusions may be obvious enough, but as I pointed out in one of ny communi cat ions it is preferable that consideration should be given them in good time rather than they should be postponed until war actually breaks out. 4. In my letter No.376-3, dated the 15th July 1938, to the Air Officer Goramanding, Iraq, I referred to this Meeting as well as to a letter from the Air Ministry, and suggested tl^t an officer should be detailed to examine with the local political authorities / .T.Peel Esquire, M. C., The India Office, London.2 - autiioritiea problems of local defence of the Arab States# I added some comments on the defence of Kuwait# I went on short leave to England on the 2nd August, but instructed tfeightman who was to act for me as Political Resident to to the Air Officer Commanding follow my letter up with cenmunicat ions from him^giving his views on the local defence of Bahrain, Qatar, the Trucial Coast, and Muscat. This yeightman did very thoroughly in his S&amp;l letters IT os. c /50 2, dated the 4th August 1938, c/ 512 , dated the 8th August 1938, c/ 513 , dated the 8th August 1938 , and C/528, dated the 9th August 1938. 5. On the 15th September 'tfeightman, who in the meantime had taken up the question of local defence at Bahrain in its most important aspect - protection of the Oil Pield and Refinery, telegraphed to the Air Officer Commanding referring to his (ye ightraan’s) letter of 4th August, informing him that 1 the Bahrain Petroleum Company had prepared their plans and were anxious about obtaining equipment required at once, leightraan further asked if there was any prospect of the Air Officer commanding being able to send ah expert to examine and advise on their plans within the week. Maj or Young, the officer detailed by the Air Officer Commanding, arrived at Bahrain on September 23rd. 6. I returned from leave on the 27th September and found that Weightman had done excellent work in preparing, in co operation with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Bahrain Government and Coates, the Air liaison Officer, a scheme of local defence. The Bahrain Petroleum Company had for instance ordered barbed wire for the fencing of their essential property /-3 property (see paragraph 6 (a) of Weightman*s letter of 4 th August): it arrived on the 28 th September, and local guards were being enlisted. Young, with this scheme as a basis, with Coates^ assistance, in collaboration with Weightman, produced a most useful scheme, a matter of no little difficulty having regard to the size of the Oil Field, and the complicated conditions of modern Bahrain. This scheme which is of a preliminary nature Young has taken back with him to Air Headquarters where it will be examined and a final scheme approved in due course. 7 . At my suggestion Young, with the concurrence of the Air Officer Commanding, accompanied me here, and spent a couple of days examining a local defence scheme which had been drawn up by de Saury in collaboration with the Oil Company. The Shaikh was informed of the reason of Young’s visit and expressed his appreciation of the interest taken in the defence of his State. Young was taken round by a member of the Council who he reported was both friendly and helpful. The Kuwait scheme, like the Bahrain one, will be submitted by Young to Air Head quarters for approval. As you will see a good deal has been done, but much still remains to be carried out. In the direction of local defence schemes, those for Kuwait and Bahrain have to be approved by Air Headquarters, while those for ^atar, the Trucial Coast and Muscat still remain to be drawn up. Further, though it is now some six months since the Departmental Meeting referred to above was held the conclusions arrived at are - so far as I know - still 'provisional' and the views of the General Staff, India /-4- India, as contained in Metcalf s* s letter llo.F.ooo-iy'oS, ^ dated the 15th September i93S^_i.o you, are somewhat at variance ( cf • paragraph 5 (5),(8) and (10)} with the conclusions come to at the Interdepartmental Meeting. I would urge strongly that a final decision be come to as soon as possible on these points, and I presume txiat tne appropriate authority to deal with them is the Committee of Imperial Defence. A decision should not tahe up much of their time as, so far as I understand it, they will only have to decide the following main questions: p (a) Are the Arab States vulnerable to attack by sea. (b) Are the Arab States vulnerable to attack from the air? (c) Whether it is worth while sending troops to any States on the Arab side ? 9. If the answers to (a), (b) and (c) above are in the negative then the present conclusions stand. If, on the other hand, these answers are in the affirmative then it will have to be considered whether it is worth while establishing any forms of defence against sea and air attack, and in the case of (c) where the troops required should come from ? 10* With regard to the local defence schemes, I do not suppose that the Committee of Imperial Defence will want to consider these though they will be sent to the Departments concerned in due course.

Will you kindly refer to your Secret letter ho* i^*^* 3128/38 of May the 19th, and connected correspondence on the subject of the Defence of the Persian Gulf in the event of a major war? 2* The Government of India have now obtained the views of the General Staff on the various points raised by Fowle in the note accompanying his Secret demi-official letter h0*8/14, dated the 18th of January 1938* 3* They note that these matters have since been dis cussed informally with interested Departments at the India Office on ^pril the 14th, and it would seem convenient to communicate the views of the Government of India on tne points discussed at that meeting in the order in which they are dealt with in the record accompanying your letter under reference. 4. iit the outset, the General Staff, wish it to be em phasised that as the issues involved relate to an area for the defence of which the Government of India are in no way responsible, the views which are expressed should not be regarded in the nature of expert opinion voiced by the authority responsiole for tendering the best Military £&amp;&amp;!. P8L BO*T. 2 f SEP 1938 INDIA OFFICE aavice♦•♦o**©****advice; that in regard to many of the issues raised, they are handicapped by lack of complete and detailed knowledge of all the factors concerned; and that where their views appear to conflict with the conclusions reached at the inter-departmental conference, they have no desire to challenge the correctness of the latter. 5. Subject to these remarks the U-eneral Staff offer the following comments, in which the (iovernment of India concur generally:- Cl) bushire - They agree that in the event of a major war, Sushire should be evacuated and not defended. 12) fianp:vy eh - Mi shin.,,-,, b a ch ^ . a gn ul l.,- This area is not included in the scheme for the defence of the inglo-Iranian Oil Company r s oilfields and installations, if, as we have been given to understand, it is probable that this area may become important from the point of view of oil production, and that a refinery, in addition to the one at ibadan, may be constructed in the r vicinity of Bandah Shapur, together with appropriate commu nications with the G-anoweh -Mishan- Grach Qaragnuli area, the defence commitments as regards the iinglo-Iranian Oil Company will be considerably increased. (3) Lingah - Jask - Char bar - It is agreed that no importance need be attached to these places and that they could be abandoned in the event of an emergency. (4;3 (4) Baiiciar-Abbas - The U-eneral btaff note that at tJrie meeting at the India Office it was agreed that no important interest is involved in -bandar Abbas, and that the place coula be abandoned in the event of emergency. They observe that by virtue of their position in the btrait of iiormuz the occu pation of bandar Abbas, hen jam, ^,ishm and possibly other islands in the vicinity, may be necessary in order to pre vent the laying of mine fields, and to deny temporax'y bases to hostile naval vessels * They recognize ho*«ever that this aspect of the problem is a naval one and has no doubt been considered. 15; The Arab aiae of the Persian dulf^ in the opinion of the General Staff, the possibili ty of air attack on this side of the Gulf cannot be ruled out. bor instance, an effective attack on the oil and air interests in Bahrain would be well within the capabilities of the Iranian Air Force, which has a strength of about 150 aircraft. Nor should the possibility of attack by hos tile seaborne aircraft, or by long distance bombers from Britrea, which is under 1,000 miles distant from Bahrain, be eliminated. 16 ) Koweit - It appears to the uaneral Staff that the defence of Koweit must in the first instance inevitably depend upon the Shaikhs own forces supplemented by such assis tance as the Koyal Air Force in ira&lt;p may be able to render.5 But if the oil supplied at Koweit are furtner developed with the object of proviair^ an alternative source of supply to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s fields in Iran, then some additional measures for security would seem necessary and the possibility of having to send troops to support the Shaikh's forces should not be lost sight of. (7) Bahrain - The General Staff agree that for the protection of the aerodrome, oil and other vulnerable interests at Bahrain against sabotage and attack by tribesmen it is desirable to raise a local volunteer defence force. In this connection they suggest that the European staff of the Oil Company at Bahrain, properly equipped with light automatics, rifles, ammunition etc., would form a useful unit. The provision of barbed wire defences for certain vulnerable points will no doubt be considered. ( 8 ) Q atar and Trucial Cuast - In idle opinion of the General Staff the protection of the Trucial SnaiKhuoms from attack by sea can oest be secured oy our ensuring naval and air supremacy in trie Gulf as a whole, ms regards attacks from the interior, or in the event of these shaiKhdoms themselves turning hostile, it may even be necessary to occupy with troops certain places essen tial to the security of the air route e.g. Behai and Sharjah. ( 9 ) museal and Gwaaur - The General Staff consider that in certain circumstancescircumstances it may be necessary to utilise troops and/or Koyal Air Force units to defend kuscat. As regards (iwadur, owing to its abandonment as a station on the air route to India in favour of Jiwani, there will no longer be any neces sity for defending it tin this respect see paragraph 11 below) ♦ CIO) In regard to the possibility of the muscat Arabian coast being used as a base for a hostile cruiser or submarine, the Defence Department (Navy .branch) consider that this threat cannot be ignored but that the responsibility for dealing with it is primarily that of the Senior baval Officer, Persian tiulf* The Admiralty will doubtless be consulted in this connection. (11) As regards G-wadur, the Air Officer Commanding remarks that its importance from an air standpoint has decreased with the recent transfer of imperial Airmys interests to Jiwani. it may be necessary to utilize troops and/or ttoyal -air Force units to defend Jiwani in certain circumstances. [12) Finally, the (Government of India note that Fowle in his secret letter No.D.0.376-8 of the 15th July has invited the co-operation of the Air Officer Commanding, iracp in the matter of drawing up schemes for local defence at koweit, Bahrain, the Trucial Coast (Debai and bharjah) and muscat.

PE EUthe C.I#D. waa that the proposal waa reported to hare originated with Ibn Saud himself. The Committee had been influenced to a considerable extent toy the immediate situation in Palestine. Ibn Saud might prove a very important factor in that situation so that the present proposals were perhaps more important from a short than from a long point of view. The idea of the C.l.B. has been that someone should go to Jedda to talk with Ibn Saud with authority, if he found it advisable, to make this offer of £30,000. The Cabinet were informed that Sir Header Bullard, H.M.Minister at Jedda, on whose judgment the F.O.relied, had been immensely pleased to hear of this proposal and had said that it would be most helpful. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, however, that if the matter could be placed on the Agenda again on the following day, he would like the opportunity to make sure that Sir Header Bullard had realised that the promise of £30,000 was conditional on Ibn Saud being able to raise the larger sum. Referring to conclusion (f) of the C.l.B. on the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia (That, with a view to the settlement of the S.S.frontiers of Saudi Arabia on line* acceptable to Ibn Saud, the Foreign Office and India Office should be authorised to take up the question of tie cession by the Sheikh of Abu Bhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid: and that, should compensation in the form of a cash payment prove necessary, the expenditure of a sum tentatively estimated at £25,000 for this purpose should be provisionally authorised, subject to the usual arrangements for obtaining Treasury sanction), the Secretary of State for India warnedthe Cabinet that the Government of India saw strong objections to the proposal to take up the question of the cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el*Odeid, as they thought that this would hrve a serious effect on the Truoial Chiefs. He was prepared* however, to discuss the matter further with the Government of India. The Minister for Co-ordinr.tion of Defence, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that apart from conclusion (c) wbioh had been reserved, the Cabinet need only take note of the remaining conclusions of the C.I.D. The Cabinet agreed: (a) To take note of the conclusions of the C.I.D. at the 329th meeting, subject to - (b) The reservation of conclusion (c) on the subject of a proposed contribution of £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabia Section of the Hedja* Railway until a meeting to be held on the following day: (c) That in the interval the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should ascertain whether H.M.Minister at Jedda, who is now in London, realised the conditions attached to the proposed contribution of £30,000.^otuaXljr tiie question of a aolTonce san«iuc for Mkhrexn is under consideration by the aoa«aittec of imperial /efenoe* «rus raised by the uil :*oard in connection «rith the importance of oil supplies v and the Chiefs of otaff ^ub^Oonyuttee hare been instructed to report on the question* it«P* dibson, ^sq* 9 *.ndua iff Ice*7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 raft Pap&gt;er. -W SEA MAIL. ^ wn v/i political Department.

The Oil Board endorse this view and consider that Bahrein should be included in any scheme of defence for our protected territories in that area. 3. In view of the many demands for protection beirg made, the Board consider that their opinion as tothe relative importance of Trinidad, Rangoon and Bahrein as sources of oil supply, might be of assistance to other Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence.

IIiPORTr.KC K OF OIL SUPPLIES FROM BAHREIN . (Paper No.O.B.245). THE OIL BOARD had under consideration a T'emorandum by the Petroleum Department on the Importance of Oil Supplies from Bahrein (Paper No.0.B.24-B). MR. STARLING said that the importance of Bahrein was increasing. Production was going up, a large refinery had been erected and the Air Ministry were looking at it as a possible source of supply $f iso-octane. It was suggested that Bahrein should be included in any scheme of defence for our protected territories in that area. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said that from the Admiralty point of view Bahrein was an ideal source of supply. The defence of Bahrein will shortly be considered by the Oversea Defence Committee. Being on a small island it could very easily be looked after. £ 1 rom its geographical position, however, any attack by a surface ship was remote in the extreme, and the operation of an aircraft carrier of any of our potential enemies in those waters was also extremely unlikely. In the view of the Admiralty, sabotage was the danger to be guarded against. He suggested that the Board should affirm the importance of this source of supply. GROUP CAPTAIN LINNELL said that the Air Ministry were / examining the possibility of establishing; an iso-octane plant at Bahrein, but he suggested that in view of the large number of demands for protection which were being made it would be helpful if the Oil Board could place such sources of production as Trinidad, Rangoon and Bahrein in an order of priority. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS informed the Committee that the Admiralty felt so strongly about the importance of Trinidad that an offer to provide guns had been made, and if the proposals were approved, defences could be in position in a very short time. The question of priority had to be dealt with on two2 . grounds: firstly, the value of the place as a source of supply, and secondly, its liability to attack. GROUP CAPTAIN LINNELL suggested, and the Board agreed, that, in forwarding the Memorandum to the Oversea Deience Committee, the Oil Board should state that from the point of view of importance as sources of oil supply the order of priority was Trinidad, Rangoon, Bahrein. C 01 .PLUS I OK . THE OIL BOARD agreed - To refer the Memorandum on the Importance of oil supplies from Bahrein (Paper No. 0^3.24^) to the Oversea Defence Committee under cover of a memorandum affirming the importance of this supply and statinS the Oil Board’s view as resrards the order of priority of Trinidad, Rangoon and Bahrein as agreed during the discussion.P^^P JL!-R.-.

I do not intend to send a complete copy of the minutes to the A.O.C. Iraq, and I think it will be sufficient to send him a resume of the Conclusions to which we agreed* I intend to inform him that the possibility of any commitments (apart from the defence scheme for the Anglo-Iranian oil fields; on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf is most remote. On the western side the threat of any attack from the sea or from the air is slight and we would not at present be justified in making any provision for fixed defences against sea or air attack. Our immediate aim should be to develop whatever local resources there are in order to offset the possibility of tribal attack from fh© landward side, and of sabotage both in the Bahrein oil fields and at those places which are staging points on the Iraq-India and Iraq-Aden air routes. I also propose to tell the A.O.C. that we are asking him to send an officer to assist in drav/ing up defence plans for KOw«it, Bahrein, Sharjah and ? Muscat. It is obviously desirable that this officer s visit to the Gulf should take place after Sir Trenchard Powle’s return. We will therefore tell the A.O.C. that he may expect in the course of time to hear from the R.P.G. suggesting arrangements by which collaboration on drawing up defence plans for the places mentioned can best be achieved. Perhaps you will be good enough to inform Sir Trenchard Fowle of the action we propose to take. . y Yours % R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C., India Office, King Charles Street, S.W.l.

Mr* &gt; Mr. f e,el, L. &lt; r^ ' ’ *, ! -j .:..., . .&gt; ry ~XASV- Ol+frt' CbASVCUlr J- IAA tk*, -7' tL+ Re the informal interdepartmental meeting held on the 14th April on the subject of the defence of the Persian Gulf in the event of a major war. 2. I think the meeting was a very useful one and elicited a number of important decisions,subject of ffpt+tun** course to these dsbisi-efis being confirmed by the various higher authorities concerned. CciKclu^cm^o 7&gt;. The most important deci si ons were the following general ones:- (a) (see para.20 (2) of my Note enclosed with my letter No.C.14 of 18th January last to the India Office) That in the opinion of the Admiralty the contingency of a hostile cruiser^ entering the- Gul-f- in time of war was so remote that it need not be considered.(This covered the possibility of a cruiser bombarding Muscat and also,subject to further investigation, the possibility of a cruiser or submarine using the Muscati coast between Has Musandum and Salala as a temporary base (see para.28 of my Rote). The Admiralty considered, however, that a raider (disguised merchant vessel) or large submarine might attempt to enter the Gulf, but that such craft could be dealt with by the sloops of the Persian Gulf division. (b) (see para.2 (3) of my Rote) That in the opinion of the Air Ministry the Gulf was so remote from the bases of our potential enemies that the possibility of air attack could be ruled out. The only1 exception to this was if hostile bases were established in Persia. 4. It followed from the above that in the opinion of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry no defences need be organised in the Gulf against naval or air attacks. This, combined with the decision not to send troops to either the Persian or Arab side of the Gulf (see paras.5 (d) and (ft) and para.6 below), clears the ground enormously and only les.ves us with schemes of defence and internal security to be organised locally (see paras. % Y // below). I had thought (vide para.3 of my letter of 18th January) that some at least of the queries contained in my Note answered themselves in the negative, but it is a distinct advantage to have had those dealing with the possibilities of naval and air %0W attack answered^by the competent authorities. As we all know problems assume a different aspect when considered quietly in peacetime from that which they take on in the stress of war. If, for instance, the problem of the defence of Bushire had been considered before the Great War at some such meeting as we have now had, it is difficult to believe that the mistake (in my opinion) would have been made of tying up a whole division there to deal with tee WassJJrtuss and his Persian tribesmen. 5. Ctrutlutieus? The other dojaxai 1 te were as follows:- (c) (see para. 7 of my Note) . The Ganowen-I/ishun-Gach Q.aragnuli area was not included in the Abadan defence scheme, and it was doubtful whether it would be possible to draw up any scheme for its defence. (d) (see para.8 of my Note). Bushire♦ It was agreed that no troops (£ n nrv&lt;&lt;. tr could be sent to Bushire e^ctr on threat3. of attack, and if this threat proved serious enough the only step was evacuation. (e) (see paras. 9 to 10 of my l\ote). The other small Gulf ports. The same conclusion was come to as for Bushire. 6. To turn to the Arab side. The general conclusion come to was that in view of the heavy commitments which would fall on our troops in other areas in a major war there would be none to spare to send to the Arab states. These included Muscat. 7. To consider the Arab States one by one. Kowei t. (see parsalSto 17 of my Note) The suggestion made in para.17 (3) of my Note to the effect that the Sheikh might be encouraged to assist in his own defence was genera.lly approved of. I pointed out that owing to the recent finding of oil at Koweit, though in what quantities was not yet certain, the problem of Koweit defence was now both more important and more difficult as the oilfields, if these materialised, would be at some distance from the town and thus be open to sabotage by Bedouin, especially if in the meantime Ibn Saud’s strong control had been removed by his death. I said. T would be glpd to have the assistance and expert advice of an officer for drawing up a scheme of local defence. The Air Ministry suggested that,since the Air Officer Commanding Iraq was responsible for the defence by land of the Arab side, such an officer might well be detailed by him subject of course to his views. This would suit me admirably. Bahrein. (see paras. 18 to 21 of my Note) Here of course, unlike at Kov/eit, there is no question of a land attack on Bahrein. On the other hand we have an oilfield and refinery which lend themselves to internal sabotage from enemy agents (see para.21 (l) of my Note). The/12/ 4. The Admiralty representative emphasized that it was this kind of hostile activity of which the Admiralty were especially apprehensive. Here a~ain I would be glad of the services of an officer from the Air Officer Commanding to assist in considering a scheme of internal security. I have no doubt whatever that the Bahrein Petroleum Company would co-operate wholeheartedly in any such scheme. Q.atar. (see para. 22 of my Note) If the Air Officer Commanding Iraq desires any scheme of co-operation with the Sheikh to be considered I shall of course be very pleased to assist. At present the Petroleum Concessions Limited are merely carrying out exploratory drilling. If, however, they strike oil then the same problems of local defence for an oilfield will arise as at Koweit. 10* The Trucial Coast (see paras.23 to 24 of my Note). A scheme for the local defence of Sharjah was worked out some years ago by the Air Officer Commanding Iraq and myself. Perhaps this scheme might now be overhauled to see if it needs amendments. At the meeting the question of the local defence of Debai was also raised. This could likewise be gone into by the Air Cfficer Commanding and myself. 11. Muscat . (see paras.25 to 27 of my Note). The Air Ministry representative gave the opinion that Muscat was of importance from the R.A.F. point of view since it was an important station on the Aden-Muscat- Karachi route. With regard to considering a scheme of local defence against a possible incursion of the Omanis, it was suggested that the A.O.C. Iraq might detail an officer for this purpose. Naturally the co-operation of the Sultan would have to be secured but as such a scheme would be in his interest I do not anticipate difficulties in this direction.r 5. \i 12 * Oil • (l) On this subject I cannot help feeling that the undoubted importance of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company* s oil supply at Abadan has perhaps somewhat overshadowed the importance both actual and potential of oil on the Arab coast. Looking into the future it is by no means fantastic to envisage a series of oilfields, each perhaps as large as the one at Bahrein, stretching from Koweit to Muscat. In this case the Arab coast would become one of the largest oil producing areas in the world, an area moreover - and this is the essential factor from the strategical point of view - under our control. The great disadvantage^ of course of the Abadan supply is that it lies in a foreign country by no means under our control. Even the present situation with a. large oilfield at Bahrein and at least fair prospects of two others at Koweit and Hasa (where oil has been found recently) is of considerable significance (A Hasa oilfield would be in Saudi territory, but since by reason of the geographical position of Hasa transport to the outer world could not be effected during a major war without our sanction, doubtless some arrangement as to pre-emption rights of purchase could be come to). (2) I emphasized at the meeting and in my Note (see para. 14 (2)) a point which appears to me personally of great importance. In case of danger to the Abadan CL oil works scheme would be put into effect for sending a force there to guard them. Before, however, this force can arrive and function a period must elapse. During this period it may be that no oil will be forthcoming and in any case, as I understand it, the scheme does not Pi. -Jar cover the protection of the 15C miles^ of pipe line from the oilfields to Abadan. It is possible, therefore, that in the event of a major war, for a time our only supply of oil fro- the Gulf will he from the Arab side. This/This contingency obviously greatly increases the importance of oil on that side and especially as things stand at present at Bahrein. Among other considerations it would seem essential that arrangements should be made with the Bahrein Petroleum Company for a supply of fuel up to naval and R.A.F.standards. At present sloops of the Persian Gulf division still have to go from their base at Bahrein to Abadan to obtain their fuel supply. I understand, however, that conversations are proceeding between the Admiralty and the Bahrein Petroleum Company on the subject of a local fuel supply. In this connection the following extract from a letter from Mr.Weightman, the Political Resident, Bahrein, who is acting as Political Resident, received by me to-day, is of interest:- 'There is a very strong pro-British feeling among the higher command at Bapco which has been even more noticeable lately since the arrival of Mr.Thornberg, their Vice President. He has, on various occasions, remarked that the Company realise that they depend entirely on British protection against any possible aggression and it seems that they are genuinely anxious to do what they can to help. An obvious direction is in the supply of fuel for His Majesty’s ships and R.A.F. and Imperial Airways aircraft at Bahrain, and I have the most definite assurances that they would produce the required fuel in a very short time if it were wanted. The hint has also been dropped to me that existing contracts need not be regarded as an insuperable bar. He tells me that it is by no means uncommon for one oil company to take over part of another’s contract, and that Bapco would 'fix it' with A.I.O.C., with whom they are on excellent terms. There may, of course be a certain amount of American bluff about this, but I must confess I don’t think there7. is very much. After all the amount of the fuel used by the sloops or by R.A.F. and Imperial Airways machines at Bahrain is not so very great, and as a purely business proposition I doubt if it would be attractive. On the other hand the advantages from our point of view seem fairly considerable. Vie should have a reserve source of oil supply for H.M.’s Forces in existence ready for war. In peace it means increased mobility for the sloops; it means a saving on R.A.F. supplies (which pay Bahrain customs); and it means the end of friction over Imperial Airways refund of customs.' I will be grateful if you would circulate this Note to the Departments concerned. I am keeping a copy for my own reference.

(1) bushire . Sir Trenchard said that it seemed desirable to decide, in advance, what action we should take in the event of a major emergency, i.e. whether we should send reinforcements or evacuate. The far Office representative thought that with heavy calls elsewhere it would be extremely difficult in the early stages to spare troops for Bushire. Colonel .3unbury agreed with this view. The Admiralty/2. Hi J Admiralty and Air Force representatives said that they were not in favour of having any commitments at Bushire. Provisional conclusion . It was unnecessary to prepare plans for sending armed forces to Bushire. (2) Ganov/eh - M i shun - G-ach Qaragnuli . This area is not included in the ’h-s.hadan” scheme and the forces scheduled for the defence of the Abadan area would not be large enough to include the Ganoweh area. P r ov i s 1 one. 1 G one In s i on . -is things stand at present it is unnecessary to prepare a scheme for the Ganov/eh area. (3) Lingah - JasI: - Charbar . It was agreed that no importance need be attached to these places and that they could be abandoned in the event of an emergency. (4) Bandar Abba s. Here again it was agreed that we had no important interest to protect and that the place could be abandoned. (5) Arab side of the Pe rsian Gulf . dir Trenchard Fowle emphasised the importance of protecting (a) present and future oil interests and (b) the air route. The -^ir ministry representative said that responsibility for the defence of the whole of the Arab side of the Gulf rested on the A.O.C.? Iraq. It was generally agreed that the chief danger of attack would come from v/andering tribes and that it was unnecessary to provide against major intervention. Ga tain Edelston stated that the admiralty attached considerable importance to adequate measures being taken to prevent acts of sabotage./3. sabotage. ( 6 ) Koweit. The meeting was of opinion that consideration should be given t .&gt; the question of keeping a reasonable store of arms, perhaps in Iraq in reserve and to the drawing up of a scheme for the rapid expansion of the existing forces at the Sheikh’s disposal. Sir Trenchard Fov/le did not think that the Sheikh would be prepared to give any financial assistance though no doubt he would be quite willing to cooperate in other ways. (7) Bahrei n. As Bahrein is an island the chief danger would come from the sea.

The Air Ministry representative said that except for attack from Persia, Bahrein could be regarded as immune from air attack. The danger from such attack from Saudi Arabia was remote. This also applied to Massawa. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that from his point of view one question on which he would like an answer was whether any further land defences were// 4. v/ere necessary. Captain Edelston said that shore 'batteries were not recommended hy the Naval authorities and he did not think that they v/ere necessary. '?he Air Ministry and .7ar Office representatives agreed. Major Mallaby said that in any case it was extremely unlikely that guns could he supplied for a very long time. Sir Trenchard Powle said he thought that it would he possible to raise locally a sufficient force to guard the aerodromes ? oil fields, etc., hut expert advice would he needed. A reserve stock of arms etc. might also he desirable and at Sir Trenchard Powle’s suggestion it was agreed to he desirable that an officer (perhaps deputed hy the A.O.C . 3 Iraq) should he sent to Bahrein to investigate the position and to formulate a scheme. Sir Trenchard Powle said that he thought that the Sheikh might he willing to help in the purchase of arms and provide storage facilities; he might also he willing to contribute towards the cost of the guards. ( 8 ) Qatar , It was agreed that in present circumstances no special defence measures were required though guards would he necessary to protect the oil field, if oil is discovered. It was agreed that the question of forming a local defence force would fall within the sphere of the A.O.C., Iraq. Sir Trenchard Powle said he did not think that the Ruler would he prepared to contribute anything. (9) Trucial Coast . The chief problem here was the defence of landing/5. landing grounds etc. on the air route. Internal security measures would he required at Shargah and Debai and it was agreed that a scheme should be worked out between the Political Resident and the A. 0. C. , Iraq. (10) Musca t. Sir Trenchard Powle pointed out that during the Great \7ar we had sent a large force to help the Sultan to repel an attack from the Omanis of the interior; and he thought that a decision as to whether assistance should be given in the event of a similar attack during a future emergency should be arrived at. The Air Ministry representative said that under present circumstances they would like to see Muscat kept free from disorder. The V/ar Office representative pointed out that this might only be possible if troops were available and that what seemed required was to have a store of arms and ammunition available for use in an emergency. It was agreed that the question of forming a scheme, in cooperation with the Sultan, for the expansion of the local force in the event of an emergency should be considered and Sir Trenchard Powle suggested that a Service expert should be sent to Muscat for this purpose. In reply to Sir Trenchard Powle the Admiralty and Air Ministry representatives stated that there was no real danger of attack by sea or air and that it was unlikely that the Muscat coasts would be used for shelter by enemy craft.

Dear Gawthorn, L. TTzTj 2846 1 i938 Some three months ago the French Military Attache told me that the Iranian General Staff had begun to interest itself in the question of fortifications in the Persian Gulf and that he would not he surprised if a German firm received the contract for their construction. I asked the Minister to speak to the local manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and ask him if the company had noticed any activity in this direction in the South. Mr. Rice replied that they had not seen any new works of this kind hut that the Ministry of War seemed to exercise stricter control in the area than formerly and that quite recently the question of a new jetty had had to he referred by the local authorities to the Ministry of War before sanction to construct it could he given to the company. I also mentioned this to the Air Officer Commanding when I was in Baghdad in November. He said he would pass on the information to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. About a v/eek ago the French Military Attache told me that the Ministry of War had asked for the loan of the services of a member of the French Military Mission to advise upon fortifications but that the request had been withdrawn almost as soon as made. He then shewed me the six documents of which I append a translation. I asked if they were an exercise set by the mission for the students of the Ecole de Guerre - a very probable/ Major W.J.

He said they were not. I do not think they were the work of the mission or they would have been better done. The French Military Attache himself described them as ’’unworthy of serious consideration being quite elementary in scope and in too general terms to be of use”. I think, hov/ever, that an officer of the mission must have collaborated, otherwise it is difficult to see how my colleague could have had access to them far less retained them in his possession for, at least, ten days. I do not claim that these documents are of any vital importance but they are of interest as showing that the Iranian General Staff has begun to think of such matters as war plans and also as indicating the general trend of their % thought. I asked my French colleague if any similar preliminary studies had been made of the defence of any other of Iran’s frontiers. He was sure that none had been made. This is interesting: as revealing that the Iranian General Staff consider (and rightly so I think) that the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf is likely to increase. Though the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf will be interested in the remarks about Fao in File 5 I have not sent him a copy of this letter as I thought you might prefer to do so through the Admiralty. I have given His Majesty’s Charge d*Affairs two copies of this letter and copies have also been sent to Amy Headquarters, India and Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq, Dhibban.

(j) There is a possible landing place at Kung (4 miles North West of lingeh.) (k) A note on the defence of the Persian Gulf. An enemy invading' Iran from the Persian Gulf must, in order to secure lines of advance into the interior, base himself either on Khorramshahr, Bushire, Lingeh or Bandar Abbas. Khorramshahr can be eliminated from the discussion on account of the marshy nature of the surrounding country. Though a possible landing place exists at Kung nearby, Lingeh is unlikely to be selected by the enemy on account of the great distances thence before any important centre in the interior is reached. Bushire (Richard Bund) is the nearest point to Tehran at which an invading force can disembark. It offers many facilities. In that event Kharag » Island will almost certainly be occupied as it was by the British in 1914- - 1918. The defence of Richard fund is, therefore, most necessary and can be effected by installing a battery of coastal artillery (Note by Military Attache. The Iranians have not got any) and also some torpedo tubes. Richard Bund seems the best place/. ^ place to select and fortify as a naval base but some form of protection from aerial attack is necessary. Bandar Abbas plays a double role namely, that of a position from which to impede enemy advance on Kerman and also from which to dominate the Itraits of Hormuz. It is absolutely necessary to fortify this place. For the first task casemated batteries must be constructed at the following points North East point of Qishm Island. South West ' ' Hormuz. North East ” Larak, The fire of these batteries must be co-ordinated. For the second task a casemated battery must be constructed at the North East corner of Henjam Island. (l) A note on the Shatt-el-Arab region. This is of importance to Iran because of the oil deposits, and must be protected from air attack by anti-aircraft batteries. Balloons should be used to protect Masjid-i-Suleiman. The disembarkation of an enemy in this region is not to be feared on account of the marshy nature of the soil and the great number of waterways running parallel to the river and hence across the line of advance of an enemy coming from the river. An enemy advancing from Iraq by land would presumably/presumably attempt to cut the lines of communication of a defending Iranian force at a point well inland and hence no defence scheme for the North East (i.e. left) bank of the 3hatt-el—Arab would appear to be necessary. From official sources of information it is almost certain that the British are engaged in the construction of a camouflaged battery position in the palm groves near Fao. This must be verified. Periodical aerial photography by the Iranian Air Force v/ill show how this work is progressing. If the construction of this attery position is conlirmed a counter battery position on the Iranian bank of the river must be constructed. File No. 6 .

C/145 of the 21st March 1938 in which I gave the details of a rather serious agitation at r*«bai which had arisen recently against the deportation of two gun-runners* and against our policy of manumitting slaves who apply to us for manumission. The agitation against the latter proce dure, which has been in force for many years, came about owing to the large increase of such applications which have been made to us in the last few months. There is of course no question of our giving up our policy of manumission, but the last reports from Debai indicated that the situation was quieter. 2* This agitation, however, raises in a somewhat acute form the defence of the Trueial Coast section of the Air houte to India. (See paragraphs 153-24 of Note enclosed with my letter No* C/14 of 18th January). If in the pre sent instance drastic action to quell the agitation had been necessary, or may still be necessary, such as preventing by a sloop the Behai pearling fleet going to sea, before we put such action into force we would have to consider the safety of the Imperial Airways flying boats, which, as you are aware, land some eight times or so e week at jebai for refuelling* as a reply to such action on our part the local malcontents might retaliate by shooting up a flying boat aft two/- iiir Aubrey Metcalfe, K*C*I*^*, C* 3 *l*, M*V*o*, Secretary to the Government of India, external Affairs Department, New Delhi*% two| (nothing ia more holpleas than a civil flying boat on the water), or render their landing difficult or impossible by anchoring dhowa or small boats in the •fairway*♦ 3m What appliea to an agitation in time of peace applies still more to a situation which might rise in time of war. I have already referred (see paragraphs 8 ( 8 ) and 26(1) of my Note quoted above) to the very effective use made by our enemies in the last War of capable agents at ^ftushire and Muscat. I see no reason to suppose that in the next war* (if it comes ) 9 our enemies will not try and employ the same means 9 only at Debai and c&gt;harjah t say 9 instead of at ushire. f&amp;ere is always an opposition party to every shaikh on the Trucial Coast, and generally an opposition p rty in every Sheikhdom which is more or less hostile to U 99 and it would not be difficult for agents well supplied with fundS 9 and operating from the Trucial Coast hinterland, to stir up the local malcontents to interfere with the Air outa. 4. In so far as Debai is concerned, it seems to me per sonally that from the defence point of view this Airways* station is particularly vulnerable. The alighting area is in a lagoon betwe n which and the sea lies the town. The area is out of sight of the sea, and therefore even if a sloop were available for defence purposes, which apparently is not the case (see paragraph 2(2) of my Note), any effect ive action could be extremely difficult. The creeks at ei ther Vmm al -aiwain or Has al Khaisiah would seem to be pre ferable from the defence aspect, and if these have not be m definitely ruled out for Imperial Airways * Flyng *oats I suggest that they be reconsidered. Imperial Airways have not yet committed themselves to Debai, and the present temporary/-^ 1 r temporary agreement with the shaikh expiree in tTUXy* -3- 5# 1 have iliecusaed the above with ^ eightaian who hae visited Oebai and who entirely concurs with my views* e X am sending copies ot this letter to ^eyaour* ialton, Courtney and Poland* Yours sincerely, Sd/- T, C. Fowle* C* Sant under (Tinted letter Ho. C/161 dated the 28nd March 1938)useful for starting consideration of this question. He does not deal with the Saudi -Arabia • factor, no doubt considering it to be outside his province. It would, of course, increase our anxieties, and perhaps impose the necessity of more extensive defence measures, if Saudi-Arabia were hostile, or neutral with leanings towards unfriendly activities. This possibility may be remote, but may nevertheless require consideration.INDIA OFFICE, ^SkCHflT. WHITEHALL, S.l. 1. P.i. 939/38 12 th l arch, 19.%. ill you kindly refer to Fowled letter, d.o. Mo.

(D.(a). (b). (c) . (d) . The Persian Gulf is now tne 'Suez Canal of tne Air', and the Britisnair route runs along the Arab side. If this line were cut it would mean tnat no civil aircraft, and military aircraft only with difficulty, could get to India and beyond, unless the Iranian side were used, which would involve obvious difficulties. There is a subsidiary route - Egypt or tne Gudan-Ked sea- Aden-muscat, but tnis would I imagine be impossible for civil aircraft, and difficult for military aircraft in large numbers, tnougn tnis is naturally a tecnnical point on which I cannot dogmatise. On the main air route Kuwait is an optional halting place, and Bahrain and Snarjah are regular halting places, for Imperial Airways. At Bahrain and Sharjah there are important meteorological stations for the use of aircraft. Bahrain, in the not too distant future, will be tne headquarters of a Royal Air Force Squadron.

PROPOSAL TO HEDUCE THE NUMBEH OF VESSELS OF THE HOYAL HaVY IN THE PEHSI^H GULF . 1. Reference yoior secret memorandum No. G.0.758 dated 3rd December,1931. 2 . In considering the proposal to reduce the number of sloops in the Persian Gulf, it is difficult to divorce the protection of British interests in ’Iraq from the protection of British interests as a whole, as they are all indirectly bound together by the history of our position in the Gulf. Perhaps it would not be out of place to refer shortly to the reasons which brought British ships to the Gulf and which have progressively led us to consolidate our influence in the Gulf. 3. Great Britain was originally compelled to interest herself in the Persian Gulf owing to its position relative to the line of sea communications with India. Situated on the flank of those sea communications and at one time the refuge of hordes of pirates it must necessarily have attracted the attention of any maritime power interested in their sea communications with India. For these reasons it has been the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government to allow no other nations to establish a naval base in the Persian Gulf or in the Gulf of Oman. Later, trade interests developed and led to the general pacification of the Gulf. Later again in 1880 the arms traffictraffic in the Gulf attracted the attention of the Indian Government at the time of the Third Afghan War. Finally the Gulf became a vital factor in our system of Imperial Defence when the Persian Oil fields were developed and supplied the main source of fuel oil supply under British control. 4 . To these interests are now added two other important ones. In the first place the Persian Gulf is at present the only practicable military line of communication between Great Britain and f Irai and between T Iraq and India, and it is upon this line of communication that we depend for the maintenance of our military forces in this country. Secondly the Persian Gulf now lies directly on our air line of communications with India and Australia, the maintenance of which is one of the principal causes of our preoccupation with ’Iraq and its future. 5. It is now therefore more than ever important to maintain naval predominance in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in order that British communications with Basrah and Abadan may be safeguarded. Otherwise, apart from the vital question of oil supplies it would be not only impossible to give effect to plans for the reinforcement of our forces in this country by troops from India, but it would even become impossible to maintain the British force already in this country. That there is some danger of the development of hostile influence in the Gulf is signified by the renewed claims which the Persians are making to territory which is at present unaer British influence and by the purchase by the Persian Government of war vessels for use in the Gulf. 6 . Furthermmre, it happens 4ust now that we are trying to establish a civil air route from Basrah via the ArabianArabian littoral of the Gulf to India. The practicability of the safe establishment of this route depends upon the predominance of our influence with the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast over that of the Persians or of Ibn Sa l ud. Our prestige with the Trucial Shaikhs has already been shaken by our obvious weakness in handling our own and their interests in Persia. Any reduction of force in the Gulf would tend to confirm them in the impression that we no longer intend to dispute with Persia our interests in the Gulf. 7. Upon the above general grounds, therefore, it is obvious that any reduction of our number of ships in the Gulf would be most inopportune at the present time. 8 . Now as regards the specific role of these ships in connection with the local security of the Persian oil fields . and of the town of Basrah. As was exemplified last Summer, serious internal disturbances may develop very quickly in Southern T Iraq and the presence of a sloop at Basrah may be urgently required at very short notice. The present number of four vessels enables the Senior haval Officer always &lt; to have two ships within the Gulf itself. A reduction of the number of sloops by one would mean that only one ship would be normally available within the whole of the Gulf. This would considerably reduce the probability of a ship being at hand in the event of sudden disturbances.in Basrah, and the reduction would therefore tend to endanger the safety of the European population of that town. 9. The scheme for the defence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company 1 s oilfields in South Persia, referred to in your memorandum, is based on the supposition that there will be available to assist in the defence two sloops as well as H.M.S.'Triad”, making three naval vessels in all. The tasks allotted to these vessels are as follows:- (a)(a) The landing of naval parties to protect Abadan. (to) The landing of naval parties to protect Mohammerah. (c) The provision of gunners for four armed cars of the A.P.O.C. until the Company can train its own men. (d) Demonstrations. (e) The covering of the move of European and Indian employees from Abadan to Basrah. 10. This number of vessels would not be available if the present force were reduced by one, since one of the_ four sloops is generally refitting at Bombay. The scheme also pre-supposes that at least one sloop will normally be within twenty-four hours 1 distance of Abadan, and that the remaining two vessels will be available at short notice. If the proposed reductions are carried out this defence scheme will have to be drastically modified and I consider that two ships would not be sufficient for the purposes for which these / ships are required.

I enclose herewith a note on the subject, which embodies my views. It has aseunied I'm afraid considerable length, and I have extended it to cover not merely the cjueotion of the policy which we should adopt, but also have raised the question of the machinery by which that policy is to be carried out, a matter of which X think discussion cannot be indefinitely deferred, having regard to the changing conditions in India. In view of the controversial nature of the Issues, however, Z have not sent a copy of ay bote to any one except your self. I showed Mr. Howell*n Mote to walton however, as you authorised me to do, and if there is no objection I should be glad if a copy of it could be forwarded to them too, as it seems probable that the future foreign relations of India will come under review in oonneotion with the new constitution. Yours sincerely, 8 d/~ H. v. BiSCOfc. P . V. wylie,1'i8q. «C• X.!&gt;» , Deputy Secretary (}?0rei6n) to the Government of India, SM PM&amp;l .In his note Mr.Howell commences by poi ting out tiiat in tiie past v#e sought political supreiaacy in the lull f while not excluding the legitiiaav© trade of o her powers. He then goes on to raise the question whether the changes brought about by the ^ar have uiade any difference to this policy, and points out that the strategic and political importance of the Gulf region has been enhanced ty the ♦ development of air travel, and by local extension in Arabia of British influence, and that we now do not seek domination but only predominance. The Foreign Secretary then refers briefly to the danger which the development of the oil industry may cause to political supremacy in any Lackward region, ana refers to the present somewhat hesitating attitude of His Majesty’s Government to an American syndicate. In conclusion Mr.Howell is of opinion that the predominant consideration in our dealings with the peoples of the Gulf must be their own interests, though he qualifies this by stating that nothing should be none to undermine or endanger the structure which our ancestors have erected. 2. As I have been a»«ced for my comments on these views, and as 1 have just completed two years as Political nesident in the Persian Gulf during which time I think I can fairly claim to have travelled very extensively along its shores, ana to have developed as far as possible the personal relations subsisting between them and the residency, I venture to submit certain considerations as to what, I think, our future policy should be, for what they may be worth.3 . Sow, firstly* X am of opinion t&amp;at it is as necessary for us to maintain our political predominance in tiie Gulf today as it was before the «ar* The considered opinion has been expressed by the heads of the fi&amp;hoing services that the strategic importance of the Gulf is greater today than in any previous period. It is not necessary to discuss in detail the reasons for this opinion,neither am I competent to do so, but Lord french&amp;rd has spoken of the Gulf as the Sues Canal of the air, ana during the last ^ar His Majesty's Havy was very largely dependent upon the products of the Persian oil-fields. These two factors alone show the strategic importance of the Gulf, and there are doubtless others* 4 . Great importance is attached nowadays to imperial communications and no alternative has yet been found to the Persian Gulf as a link on the route to India and Australia. The chain is being built up with much labour and at consider able expense, and it would seem important that when once completed it should be adequately safeguarded. 5 . To the ordinary commerce of the Gulf I do not attach much importance, less X think than Ur.Bowell does, excluding oil, about which I will write separately. There is only one industry really in the Gulf and that is pearl fishing. This trade has never been in British hands, the \ better quality of the pearls being bought by French Jews and sent to Paris, though the poorer qualities are generally disposed of by the Arab dealers themselves in Bombay. imports into the Gulf consist of a few simple necessities of life, such as rice, sugar and piece-goods, which are generally • • •generally purcliased by petty shopkeepers from middlemen in Bombay* The volume of these imports, however, is not great and though in theae hard times it is desirable that British or Indian goods should be purchased in preference to foreign the fact, for instance that Japanese piece-goods have lately to some extent supplanted Indian and 3ri ish and that the sugar sold on the Arab coast largely comes from foreign sources, is not a matter of much moment from the political point of view, nor indeed, having regard to the smallness of the market, from the commercial point of view. 6 . Oil of course is in a different category and the establishment of a large oil company with its vast rescmrces approximating,,as pointed out by Mr.Howell, to those of a State, in the Gulf, might, I think, lead to serious developments, and any possibility of the extension of the activities of foreign oil companies in the Gulf should, 1 consider, be moat carefully watched and guarded against. It is to be hoped that if oil is found at Bahrain it will only be in limited quantities, but if further concessions are obtained by this American concern in Kuwait and Sejd and an oil-field developed on the Arabian littoral in any way comparable with that belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company then I think there is no doubt that foreign governments would interest themselves very actively in the Persian dulf and would seek not merely commercial concessions but a political position which would seriously threaten our own. 1 should therefore regard the grant of any further concessions to a foreign concern on the Arab littoral with dismay. 7. As regards the final conclusions xsy outlook is perhaps . •./-V -4- perhaps not quite eo altruistic ae that of ^r#Howell, and while 1 wOotld not for one moment suggest that we should in any way oppress the people oi the arab coast, X do think tnat our first duty is to consider tiie interests of our own country• However the difference is perhaps more in form than in autstance for Mr.Howell qualifies his consideration for the rights of others ty the proviso thut nothin^ must be done to endanger the existin L fabric, while when he writes 'each case must be considered on its merits and the interests of Muscat lor whatever place may be) must be the predominant considers^ ation* it is not quite clear who is to decide what are the best interests of Muscat - the inhabitants of Muscat or the British Government? However i will not pursue this point further and it is largely an academic issue for I believe that our interests coincide with those of the peoplu of the Arab littoral. 1 consider that our policy and our desiderata in the Persian Gulf should be as follows! to maintain the independence of the Arab Hhoikhdoms so long as they preserve law ani order and maintain a system of administration that will aawisfy or at any rate be tolerated by their subjects, to avoid any greater degree of interference in their internal affairs than is forced upon usj but at the same time to prevent any other foreign power from dominating them or obtaining any special privileges in the Gulf. 8 . It may be argued that we do not appear to have carried out this policy to any great extent, but in two places - Bahrain and Muscat - we h; Te p ae I shall show,had our hands forced, and in two places - Kuwait and the Trucial coast - we have acted up to it. The iihaikh of Kuwait enjoys entire autonomy in his internal affairs, and no control is exercised over • • e-5- over hia finances or hia judiciary, and I have done all in iqy power during tne last two years to increase hia authority and to maintain his prestige, and as a result of representations made by me His Majesty’s Government have laid down as their considered policy that the State of Kuwait should be maintained as an independent Principality. 9. As regards the Trucial coast, there again we do not interfere in the internal affairs of these shaikhdoms, and we tolerate many acts of which we certainly cannot approve,e.g. fratricide. Ho Kuropean other than political, naval and Air Force officers, is ever allowed to land on the Trucial coast and I personally have always strongly deprecated the establish ment of a civil air route over the Trucial coast, because X have always felt that, while a military and purely strategic air route over this portion of the Arab coast involved no interference with the internal affairs of the Ghaikhdoas, I have * always realised thu^t the establishment of a civil air route was a very different mat er and would involve a reversal of our previous policy, would be justifiably opposed by the Shaikhs themselves, and would be contrary to the policy which X think we should pursue in the future, be may be forced to remove t civil air route to the Arab side, but when in London I pointe out most clearly the drawbacks inherent in this ana urged that every effort should be made to obtain an extension of the that our hands have ben forced. &gt;e tolerated Ghaikh Isa's gross misrule for many years until it led to repeated complaints existing concession on the Persian aide. 10. As regards Bahrain and Muscat we can fairly contend on the part of a foreign power, and to the emigration of a number of his subjects. Finally we were compelled to deposehim and X think that at the tine there was no alternative but to put his eldest son in his place, thou^ primogeniture is not a reco&amp;nised rule of succession among these Arabs* ihe eldest son unfortunately is quite unsuited to fulfil his responsibilities and there is no doubt that he would not have succeeded in the ordinary course* However, having put him there and since he was unfitted to govern himself, there was nothing to be done, but virtually to assume charge of the administration, and this was particularly necessary in a place where there are very large foreign elements arid where, if we were to avoid complaints from foreign governments, it was necessary to impose a fairly decent system of administration: but if it were possible to hand over the reins of government to a Shaikh who was as capaole of ruling his State as is for instance the Shaikh of Kuwait, X would at once reconmend the withdrawal of all British control. 11* As regards Muscat, here agcin our hands have been forced. The State was attacked by hostile tribesmen from the interior and without our assistance there is no doubt the present dynasty would have been swept away, Muscat or Muttrah, where there are many British subjects } would have been pillaged and chaos wo Id have ensued all along the coast* Here again we have a ruler utterly unfitted to govern, who only with the greatest difficulty has been persuaded to spend a few months in the year in his State and who takes not the smallest interest in its affairs, and his son, till recently, was a minor* Should His Highness finally decide to abdicate, then I see no reason why his son, who is no longer a minor and who is shaping well, should not be allowed, after a little preliminary guidance, to assume full control of the government, and this is the policy ihat X would advocate, and the object at which I • • •-7- X would aim. 12. T.i sum up, X consider that our policy should 'oe directed to maintaining the independence of the Arab Uh&amp;i^h- doma; and that as far as possible they should be allowed to control their own internal affaire without interference on our part, but also without interference on the part ol anyone else, the only condition being that they must maintain such a standard of administration a® will satisfy their own subjects and fulfil their treaty obligati -ns. ^his policy of course does not preclude the maintenance of the clooest and most friendly relations with these Shaikhs, for they often need our advice, support and assistance, and these I think should be given whenever possible. it ties them t&gt; us by bonds of friendship and jaakes them less likely to listen to advances from elsewhere; it ena les us to ensure that a tolerable system of administration is beii% carried on and thereby prevents disturbances against law ana order. Finally, they have handed over to us control of their foreign relations and it is incumbent upon us to protect their subjects and we must therefore keep in touch with them, but 1 would repeat that in the adminstration of their own in.ernal affairs u think they should be given as free a hroid as possible. 13. In this connection I may perhaps be permitted to raise a consideration to which 1 have given a good deal of thought of late, and which recent events in India have brought prominently before my Mind, and that is the question of the future control of the Persian G If• Till heretofore the Persian Oulf has been controlled by and has been regarded as a special sphere of interest of the Government ol Inaia. Our position in the Gulf was originally built up largely through ...through the effort# of tr* Indian Kary and officer# of the Indian uovernment • 'ihe Persian uulf was forraerly regarded as being of great strategic importance to India, and moreover a considerable number of Indians were established at various places along its she res, and the uovermaent of Inula dia- played the keenest■interest in regard to Persian uulf problem# nowadays those problems have somewhat changed in character, and it seems highly probable that the Governmesit of India will also shortly cliange in character, and that the future Government of Im-ia may cease to regard our position in the Persian Gulf as of special importance to India or be willing to spend money on maintaining the commitments and responsibilities which we have assumed in this area. 14. on the other hand I think I am correct in saving that Mis Majesty's Government display a much greater concern in Gulf affairs than they did formerly# Ihis is but natural since the importance of the Gulf has largely changed from Indian to Imperial. the protection of the oil-fields and the Bhatt-al-Arab is very definitely an Imperial interest and not an Indian, and the strategic air route as also the civil air route can also be so regarded. lb. whereas formerly all Gulf questions were referred by the Kesident to the Government of India,now all questions involving Arabian policy, relations with bin baud, etc.,etc. are referred by him to the Colonial ufflce, ana therefore he thus definitely serves two masters, apart from the Minister at lehran whom he serves ir^iis capacity of Consul-wenerai on the Persian coast. I need not stress the difficulties of the local representative of the Government of India under such concii tic ns. • • • •conditions, confronted aajhe is by divergent views and interests and soraetiraes b contradictory instructions. Practically all matters of importance are referred to ~«ondon, where the iinal decision is taken. His Majesty’s rihips can no longer take action at the request of the nesiaent as formerly but the matter has to be referred to His Majesty*» liovemment. All matters concerning the air route have to be referred, to -uondon. Many Muscat matters must similarly be decided in x»onaon owing to the Muscat treaties with foreign powers. And virtually all questions arising at Kuwait, apart from those of a purely administrative nature, are dealt with oy the Colonial uffice # dealing as they do with relations with uin aaud, ^raq, etc. finally with further Indian! sat ion of the departments in Inaia, difficult and somewhat embarrassing personal questions may, I think, arise in connection with the Persian Gulf. it seems to .me inevitable that cite uestion of the political control of the Persian Gulf must come under review shortly. through a very serious financial crisis, and every possible means of retrenchment is being explored, and naturally the Persian Gulf has not escaped. r *he two pillars on which our position in the Gulf have been built up are, if 1 may be allowed to say so, the presence of the Hesident and the presence of the British wavy. ihe hesiaent has hitherto always been supplied with a permanent means of transport (with the exception of a diert period when its loss was at once felt) and has thereby been enabled personally to conduct affairs by personal contact all over the Gulf, and in this primitive part of the world it is the only possible means of transacting business; while the ships of the Persian uulf Hi vis ion have maintained the closest ana moreover the most friendly relations on the 16 Ihe Government of India are at present passing whole «. •dismay ? » • • • « 10 whole with all the Arab Shaikhs, a constant reminder to them of their treaty obligations and of the watchful eye of the Briti ah Government upon them, but at the name time good friends whom they are glad to see, unless suffering from a guilty conscience, 17. In their efforts to obtain reduction of expenditure the Government of India have already practically immobilised the Besident for 11 months in the year, thereby frankly precluding him from performing the greater portion of his duties, and this to avoid an additional expenditure of some two or three thousand pounds per annum - surely a small sum to expend in order to maintain our position in the Gulf. ‘ihey have further suggested the almost entire elimination of the White Ihsign from these waters, since it was proposed to reduce the Persian uulf Division to one ship viuring about 9 months of the year, and this at the moment that the Persian flag is about to appear for the first time, and when we are confronted with the growing nationalism and aggressiveness of the present -‘ersian Government. I submit that the cumulative effect of these measures is to 'endanger the fabric which our ances tors have built up* 4 . now, if the Persian Gulf is still of Imperial importance, and if, as seems highly probable, it will sooner or later be transferred from the control of the Government of India to that of his Majesty’s Government in Great Britain, subject to such financial adjustments as may be considered equitable, would it not be better to make these changes while our position is still intact and our predominance unchallenged, than after it had been whittled do*m by a series of measures, some of which at any rate I can only contemplate v/ith the utmostkm ii1111 him - 11 - diBnmy ? Juat as the centre of gravity of the riesident’s activities has been described ae having smmg froia the Persian side to the Arabian side so it Berras to rae tnat it would be fair to describe the political centre of gravity ae having swung nowadays fron the uovemiaent of India to nis Majesty’s Goverrment, and while; tiie former change is not necessarily permanent the latter would certainly seem to oe so, and it would ueem wise to follow the sequence of events and to change the administration of control accordingly. 'jo sum up. (i) ihe Gulf is nowadays of greater importance from the point of view of Imperial interests than of purely Indian interests. (ii) r ihe control of uulf affairs is no longer vested exclusively in the Government of India. Many matters are now dealt with by the Colonial office and virtually all matters of importance are referred to his Majesty* s Govt rument. Dual control in any area is always unsatisfactory. (iii) Ihe Government of India in the past have entered into certain commitments in the Gulf which it would seem that for financial reasons they are no longer able to maintain. ;he future Government of India will probably be even less willing to incur expenditure on commitments outside India. (iv) Owing to this and with the changed conditions in India it seems inevitable that the question of the control by t}ie Government of India of Persian Gulf affairs must come under review and sooner or later be transferred to His Mig e 8 &lt; ty ’ 8 Government. Certain measures of retrenchment already adopted or under consideration by the Government of Inh ia ...- 12 - India are calculated eerlously to affect our position in the Gulf* It is submitted that if control of the Gulf is to be handed over sooner or later to His Majesty^ Government it would be better that it should be handed over while our predominance is still intact rather than after it had been largely whittled away* 19* Since writing the above 1 have read the verbatim Report of the Rebate in the House of Lords on Wednesday the 20th May 1931, which was sent to Bushire by the Colonial Office during my absence on leave* At the risk of tiring the patience of readers of this note, I wo ild solicit a reference to that Rebate since the views therein expressed support so strongly the contentions which X have advanced above• i 20* Lord l v renchard opened the Rebate by pointing out the M vital*• importance - from the strategic point of view - of the Gulf. He said: « I do not think •vital* is too strong a word* It is not only vital to one particular part of the British Empire; it is vital to the whole. It is on the direct road, the short road, from Ungland through the Mediterranean to }5gypt, India, Australia, Mew Zealand, singa- pore, Hongkong and our interests in China 11 • Vhe noble ixjrd went on to point out the number of departments who now have a finger in the itersian Gulf pie, and the great difficulties occasioned by this multiplicity of control* He wound up by asking His Majesty^ Government to institute an enquiry to report upon how, with the least disturbance politically, the control of policy in Arabia and the Persian Gulf and Aden, under downing street, could be brought about. 21 seer&lt; -15- 21. Lord Plumer 8poke In tlie uarne Benue, ana I woulc quote the folloeing extraote from his epeech: “Aden and the Btationo in the Persian ttulf are not mere localitiea. ihey are vital strategic points of comzaunication. not only with India hut with the ifar ifiast. and even still further afield. 'jhey are a matter of concern to the whole ionpire. It has been found that present arrangements in connection with those places are cumbersome and unsatisfactory. In the future they are likely to be dangerous, for whatever may be the upshot of the present developments with regard to the government of India, it is quite possible that we may be at some future time confronted with a Government which, to Bay the least of it, is apathetic with regard to Imperial Interests. I hope the Government will realise that ;he time is opportune for making a change but the main point is that there should be real unification of control, that the unifi cation should be centralised and that, with that central authority, the threads should be held where they ought to be held, in the heart of the inspire*. 22. Lord Lloyd speaking in the same sense said; 'All the more important la it during the present phase of Indian constitutional development, when the question of the degree of intimacy of India's relationships with England will be unsettled, that any area so vital to us stratsgically as the Persian Gulf should be under the direct control of Whitehall*• 25. Lord Pas afield in replying on the hebate. contended that machinery had been established to enable rapid decisions to be arrived at on ordinary matters of daily occurrence in thethe Hear East, and went on as follows: M X want to state ▼ery definitely that, as a matter of iact, all questions of policy, big and small, are not left to be dealt with by this department or that, or by the government of India, but that really the responsibility is undertaken by his Majesty Government as a whole Vhe Persian uulf from the point of view of policy is not administered by the Govern ment of India, It is not administered by the Colonial Office, That is quite definitely undertaken by the Cabinet M . 24, 1 think it is perhaps, if I may say so, unfortunate that His Majesty's Becretaxy of Htate for the Colonies used the word M administered tt , though his meaning is made perfectly clear by the phrase “from the point of view of policy*: the position today is that policy is controlled from Whitehall but administration is controlled by the Government of India. how, I would submit that policy and administration cannot be divorced from one another. To adopt a military analogy, no army can possibly function if the General Bt&amp;ff and the Administrative Services do not maintain the closest touch. Tou could not have the General staff planning an advance while 'q' were reducing ammunition, and yet, if I may be allowed to eay so, that is exactly what is happening in the Persian Gulf today. His Majesty's Government are Contemplating a policy on the irucial coast, which may have wide repercussions and involve us in additional commitments and responsibilities, un the other hand, the Government of India, impelled by financial necessities, are adopting a backward policy which will seriously lessen the ability of- 1 b- the K«»ld«nt to keep in touch with the situation and to deai with any difficulties that aay arise. There was never greater need to keep in close touch with the Trucial Coast than there is today, but 1 have no means of doing so, and if the number of ships is reduced then all contact will definitely be lost. To quote another example, his Majesty^ Government have for some time past been endeavouring to arrange a meeting between His Majesty hin Baud and myself, in order that they may implement their undertakings to the Shaikh of Kuwait regarding the blockade, but 1 have no means of proceeding to the meeting. The Persian Gulf is not standing still but y as in every other part of the world, new /CAJfc problems are arising and require to be dealt^ and at no time was it more necessary for the Resident to maintain close personal contact with its peoples than today; thus oniy can future difficulties, and misunderstandings be avoided. 1 submit that policy and administration should be in the same hands so that one may be adapted to the other, &amp;n&amp; if a forward policy is to be adopted then the local officers must be supplied with the requisite means for carrying it out, 2b. It is perhaps hardly for me to make any further suggestions, but I have worked the present system for two years and have been myself a small cog in its somewhat cumbersome machinery, ana I therefore perhaps may be forgiven if I suggest that the method that would involve the least dislocation to the existing system would be to place the control of the Persian Gulf in the hands of His Majesty's Secretary of Btate for India. 2 b. firstly, this ould vest the control of both policy and administration in His Majesty's Government. Hecondly, IndiaIndia will always have very definite interests in the ttulf* and it is but fair that Indian revenues should contribute towards the expenditure. His Majesty's secretary of Btate for India would adequately represent Indian interests and could hold the balance equally between the financial responsibilities of the two parties. Thirdly, he «&gt;uld ensure that full wei^it was given to the views of the (iovern- ment of India. Fourthly, the British rtpresentativss in the Persian Gulf have always hitherto been officers of the Government of India, aid it would seem desirable to maintain this system, at any rate for some time to come. It is obviously desirable to have officers serving in the Persian Gulf with previous experience of its peoples and countries, and this many officers of the Indian Political service possess, and I believe that nowadays there is no difficulty in getting officers to serve in the Gulf. The arrangement would be somewhat similar to that existing at diabul, ana TOula ensurt that the Government of India were kept in close touch with Persian Gulf affairs. so long as the Persian Gulf ie 'Officered* from India, it *ould seem preferable that the ih Department dealing with tsOmat should be the India office, to whom many of the officers of the Political Department are personally known, and who are acquainted with Indian rules and regulations and accounts, etc. November 1931. sd/- H.

Lord Curzon appears to have been satisfied that *the maintenance of British political supremacy in the Persian Gulf was a matter of vital importance to the British Bmpire ,l 9 but be it noted it was political supremacy about which he was jealous* A few years later (5th of May 1903) an authoritative statement was made by Lord Lansdowne speaking as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords* He said t 'The noble lord asked me for a statement of our policy with regard to the Persian Gulf* I think I can give him one in a few simple words* It seems to me that our policy should be directed in the first place to protect and promote British trade in these waters* In the next place I do not think that he suggests* or that we should suggest* that these efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legitimate trade of other Powers. (Hear, Hear). In the third place - I say it without hesitation - we should regard the establishment of a naval base or a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a veryvery grave menace to British interests and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal (Cheers)* tt * Another quotation from a note hy Sir Henry McMahan written as Foreign Secretary on the 28th of June 1911 and accepted by the then Vicerpy* Lord Hardinge f is in the ssme key* It runs as follows »- '‘The history of our dealings with this small circumscribed sea is one of Isvish expenditure of British blood and money* of alternating periods of energy and indecision* but characterised throughout by a consistent endeavour to establish peace and order* We have in the past century abolished piracy, exterminated the slave trade* and policed the Gulf in so effective a manner as to open it to the trade of all nations* There has been no thought of restricting to ourselves the benefits obtained* and to such an extent have sentimental ideals been followed in this direction that although sole masters for over a century in the Persian Gulf, we have so much overlooked our own material interests that our rights in the sea and its littoral are for the most part of a lamentably undefined nature*' 2* This then was our policy* to maintain British political supremacy, to protect and promote British trade* and not to exclude the legitimate trade of other Powers* The maintenance of peace and order was of course the condition precedent to the maintenance of political supremacy and the fostering of trade and was in fact the plinth onon Tshich the whole rested* Until the Great War there was no change of conditions such as to justify a new orientation of policy* Have the changes introduced by the War or the changes which the world has seen since the War made any difference? These changes are so vast and the number and variety of factors which they have brought into play so great that one can do no more than indicate a few of the most salient* .Amongst these 1 would refer to s (1) the development throughout Asia of a spirit of independence (itself largely the outcome of British thought and influence) and a desire to put an end to the period of Buropean dominationj ( 2 ) a profound change in the attitude of world opinion towards the domination of one race by another; ( 3 ) an apparent loosening of the bonds which hold the component members of the British Empire together; ( 4 ) a greatly advanced sense of trusteeship on the part of such Buropean Powers as have Asiatic and African possessions* evidenced by the mandatory system of the Versailles Treaty; (5) simultaneously* though with some apparent contradiction* an immense local extension of the sphere in which Great Britain seeks to be predominant* which now embraces the whole of Arabia* Iraq and Palestine; ( 6 ) a marked decline in British trade and apparently in British commercial vigour; ( 7 ) a general growth* very apparent even in free- trade Britain* of a nationalistic attitude in commercial mattersi (3) air* and ( 9 ) oil* withwith all that these two words stand for* 3* The first and second factors have as yet had little direct effect upon the Gulf, but have produced and are producing developments in adjacent countries:- Egypt, Iraq* Persia and India - of which the consequences are still incalculable, but are bound to have a great effect on the Gulf. The relative importance of the Gulf trsde has declined, but the strategic and political importance of the Gulf region has been enhanced by the development of air travel, (factors 8 and 9) and the main air route between Europe, India, the Par-East and Australia seems likely to be along the shores of the Gulf. The local extension in Arabia of British influence may be accounted for as a direct legacy of the War* It does not seek domination, but only predominance, and is in consonance with current ideas as embodied in the Treaty of Versailles and given effect to in adjacent countries. But it is clear that unless it rests upon a solid foundation of commercial activity and success it cannot be other than transitory and must in any cose conform to the position in adJecent countries »s it may develop under the influence of the first and second factors. Meanwhile it seems largely to depend on the life of a single man - Ibn Saud - who is already old. 4. The development of the oil industry and the immense combines to which it has given rise have produced a danger to political supremacy in any backward region under a new guise. The resources of a large Oil Company are comparable with those of a State, ani whereas before the War, according to Lord Lansdowne, we should have gone to war to prevent Russia fromfrom establishing an ice free port in Gulf waters# the present attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards an .American Oil Syndicate is that of one who perhaps 'willing to wound is yet afraid to strike'. They would gladly see such excluded from the Gulf region, but cannot go further than saying that each situation which may arise from attempts to develop the oil resources of the Gulf region by foreign Powers will be considered by tnem on its merits. And that indeed is no ungenerous attitude, all things considered. 5. Taking all tnese factors into account we will I think reach the conclusion that, while not/iing should be done to undermine or endanger the structure which our ancestors have erected, the predominant consideration must be the interest of the people who inhabit the Gulf region. For the present that interest is undoubtedly best served by the maintenance of things as they are, and justifies a policy of excluding foreign adventurers whose movements and activities are open to many objections and not as a rule likely to benefit materially the States wnom tney may honour by their attentions. 6 . But when it comes to larger questions, such as thax whether we should oppose the extension to American nationals of the most-favoured-nation treatment which we have secured for ourselves in Muscat, a contrary conclusion might well emerge. Bach case must be considered on its merits and the interests of iJUscat (or whatever the place may be) must be the predominant consideration.The Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, at their 9th meeting on Monday, 18th March, took note of the appreciation of the strategical situation|bythe Indian General Staff circulated as paper No. P.G. 20. £f-• fA „ fix*-% 'V Secret.

A’- (With 2 spare copies and 5 spare copies oi enclosure).SECRET. General Staff Appreciation of the Situation in the Persian Gulf. Part I. Geographical Considerations. 1 geographical considerations in the area under review will be outlined at the outset as references to them are made throughout this memorandum. 2 The factors which influence the movement of Armed Forces from North to South towards the Persian Gulf Littoral are of primary importance. The most important geographical feature is the Dasht-i-Kavir desert with its South Eastern extension the Dasht-i-Lut, which, stretching across the centre of Persia is practically impassable to troops and divides lines of advance from North to South into two groups : those leading from Meshed towards the South (all of which unite about Seistan), and those from Tehran towards Ahwaz, Bushire and Kerman respectively. An advance from the North towards the 1 ersian Gulf must therefore run athwart our existing communications which run from Quetta to Duzdap in the East, or be flanked in the West from Baku to the Gulf by Military and Air Bases in Irak. Secondlv, for an average distance of 200 miles inland, all \\ estern and Southern Persia is densely packed with mountains. From the shores of the Persian Gulf the hinterland rises in a series of ranges to heights of 8 000 to 10,000 feet through which there is no natural corridor. All ranges run parallel with the coast line, and so present a formidable natural barrier to forces attempting either the effective occupation of the seaboard from the North, or the penetration of the hinterland from a base established on the sea coast. 3. The frontier of Persia marches with that of Irak from Basra to Rowanduz for a distance of some 500 miles. The barrier of Persian territory separating Irak from Russia gradually narrow’s from some 400 miles at its Southern extremity to 150 miles at its Northern end. Our principal interests are centred in the Imperial Oil reserve in the South West of Persia. In the North any encroachment on the part of Russia which tended to advance her frontier nearer to Mosul through Per sian territory would be resented by Turkey and would probably incur her hostility. Eastern Turkey with its complicated mass of mountain ranges and its lack ot suitable communications forms an effective barrier to an advance on Irak from the North. It would seem thus, that the strategic importance of the Irak 7 Persian frontier gra- dully diminishes as it runs Northwards, and it is obvious that where the danger is greatest, the barrier separating Irak from Russia is greatest also, for 400 nules ^ ot difficult country intervenes between the Caspian and the South lersian Oilfields ; and any Russian advance on them would have to be made slowly and methodically. This gives us for the present ample time in which to concentrate forces for the protection of the oilfields area and our interests in Southern Irak against a Russian threat, but none if that threat is Persian. In general, our hold on Irak provides a flanking threat to enemy activities in Western Persia, and the railway from Basra to Baghdad and Khanikin permits land and air pressure in the general direction of Hamadan, and renders vulnerable centres further North, e.g., Baku, liable to air attack. 4. Alterations in these conditions, recent or impending, wdll now 7 be considered The Duzdap Railway.—A development which affects the Persian problem in an important aspect—the defence of India—is the Nushki-Duzdap railway, wlncu gi\ es quick and ready access from India to the Seistan area, materially adding to our pov T er of meeting an advance from North to South by the Eastern I ersian route. Its possible danger lies in the temptation it provides for the construction of rail ways in Persia leading towards the Russian system, and thus removing the barrier of undeveloped countiy between Russia and Great Britain. In this connection, the Eastern boundary of Persia which separates it from Afghanistan is a purely arbitrary one, without geographical or ethnographical significance. For this reason the problem of India's defence as affected b\ a Russian advance into North East Persia cannot be divorced from the problems MC55S FDconnected with a Russian advance into Northern Afghanistan in the direction of Herat. Provided Afghanistan was actively in the field against Russia as our ally, an advance by Russia via the Meshed-Herat corridor could be most effectively met by employing our main forces on the Quetta-Kandahar-Farah line. In the event of Afghan neutrality or hostility, however, the Nushki-Duzdap line and the Seistan area would assume an increased strategic importance. The Hamadan Khor Musa Railway .—The development of this will materially alter the strategic situation in Western Persia. It will run from Bandar-i-Gas on the Caspian sea to Tehran ; and thence in the direction of Hamadan. It will then turn Southwards parallel to the Irak frontier via Dizful, through the South Persian Oilfileds to meet the sea about Khor Musa. Although any connection between the GulTand the Caspian is to be regretted, its alignment so far Westwards and parallel to the Irak frontier may be a serious disadvantage to an invader from the North. On the other hand it must reduce the time for action which we can reckon on. 5. From the foregoing it is evident that the main Military interest lies in the Seistan area and the Oilfields area. The occupation of Seistan would provide an effective counter to an advance towards the Straits of Hormuz and the Indian Ocean by the Eastern route and also protect India. The occupation of the Oilfields would protect our important and immediate interests in that area, and combined with the threat of attack from Baghdad would counter an advance from the North by the Western Persian routes on the Gulf ports. As regards the Seistan area. Meshed lies within 80 miles of the Trans-Caspian railway. Russian forces could occupy it at any time they liked. From Meshed to Duzdap is some 500 miles as the crow flies. A fair road exists ma Birjand which takes light motor transport. Our experience during the Great War of maintain ing forces over this route points to the unlikelihood of Russia threatening Seistan with a force of more than 10,000 men, without rail communication in Persia, pro vided the supplies of Seistan itself are denied to the enemy by our forces. The Oilfields area would require early land protection in the event of Russian penetration in the North, small forces sufficing while our Air Forces in Irak are available for its protection. A landing ground exists at Maidan-i-Naftun. Com munication with Basra (150 miles as the crow flies) is at present via the Karun River, the rapids at Ahwaz offering the chief difficulty. The direct advance on the oilfields from the North lies through Qum and Isfahan. From the direction of Isfahan the oilfields are protected by a difficult mountain barrier. The Bakhtiari tribesmen, truculent and warlike, have their welfare at present bound up in the prosperity of the oilfields. The oilfields are more vulnerable to attack from the direction of Hamadan and Khurramabad, though such an advance through the mountainous region of Luristan w*ould probably be a most difficult operation. The railway will also eventually lead into the oilfields from this direction. With the advent of the railway, Hamadan will tend to become the strategic centre of Western Persia, but until the natural mountain barrier has been penetrated by good communication, our military policy should be directed towards leaving it to the enemy to combat the natural obstacles, without unduly extending our own lines of communications. 6. The air factor will now be considered. From the Straits of Hormuz to Basra is approximately 500 miles, and an aver age stretch of 100 miles of sea separates Persia from Arabia. The development of air bases along the Trucial Coast should in the first instance guarantee a sufficient measure of air domination, both to ensure the free passage of shipping and to pre vent hostile air bases from being established on, or near, the Persian Coastal Plain. For adequate protection of the Gulf waterway it would be necessary to es tablish air bases on the Persian shore itself at the earliest opportunity, to add to the inland range of our aircraft. The Dasht-i-Kavir desert and the coastal moun tain belt provide a natural protection to the Gulf from attack by both land and air forces, since they increase the difficulties of maintenance to an enormous extent. Air bases, if they are to be a permanent and serious menace to the Gulf waterway, must be connected with workshop and factory by good ground com munications; and hostile air bases established on the line Kerman-Ispahan, or atv 3 Shiraz, without good roads or railways to serve them would he very difficult to maintain as effective operational bases. The effect of the geographical barriers, therefore, will be to hold the air bases away from the Gulf, and tell to our advant- age. With the increasing range of modern aircraft, however, it will be possible to reach the Gulf waterway from bases established in Northern Persia. Although the further removed from the Gulf hostile air bases are established, the less effec tive will be the threat which those bases exert, nevertheless, the possibility of air attack from bases situated at 500 miles radius may soon have to be considered. We can put this effective radius now at 300 miles, but during the next 10 years we must envisage an extension to 500 miles or more. On the attached map a line has been drawn showing the area of Persia which lies within 500 miles of the Trucial Coast A circle has also been struck on a radius of 500 miles with the Ahwaz oil fields as centre. The curve of the latter will show at a glance the necessity of ex cluding a potential enemy from establishing air bases anywhere on Persian soil. P/.rt II .—Former Policy in Persia. 7 The clash of Russian with British interests, imminent at the beginning of the century but postponed by the regrouping of powers enforced by the German threat, gave rise to a close examination, culminating in 1904, of the political and military problems arising from the situation in Pcisic*. 8. At first the tendency was to aim at military annexation, in necessity, of as much of Persia as would halt the Russian advance at a distance from the Persian Gulf involving in effect an advance of our frontiers into touch with Russia s Responsible consideration ruled this solution out; its full application as pointed out by Lieutenant-Colonel (now Field Marshal) Sir William Robertson when criticising a less ambitious solution offered by the Government of India, would have entailed bringing the British Empire into immediate contact with Russia s strength, allowing her to use men whom she would have been unable to use other wise. 9. As hinted above, the Government of India differed from the Home authori ties, but in degree only, not in principle. They held that the Asiatic history of Russia during the past half century lent no support to the theory that she desired to acquire or annex Persia, or to subvert the Persian monarchy. It was on the con- trarv that her policy everywhere was to maintain existing authority and to support the reigning sovereign, but to reduce him to a state of vassalage to herself. As the Government .of India and the Home Government read her ambitions, she had no intention to annex more territory, or to subjugate more peoples by force of arms, but preferred to control the government of the countries which she desired to in fluence, and to utilize them as instruments through whom she might obtain supreme political influence and commercial control. It was thought certain that the ulterior objects of Russian policy in Persia apart from gaining control of the Government of Persia, would be (i) To reach the' Persian Gulf. (w) By-means of {i) to be in a position to apply pressure to yet one more vulnerable spot on the flank of Great Britain. It was clear that the occupation, by British Forces, of the mouth of the Gulf as a counter would be a serious, if not an insuperable barrier, to the realization ot these hopes. 10 But here the divergence in degree appeared. The Government of India were strongly of the opinion that Russia could not be permitted to gain control ot Persia at all, and maintained that, if Russia were to make any material forward movement into Persia, Great Britain should at once make a corresponding move ment “ along the frontiers accessible to her forces by land and sea . this move ment was not intended to be a hostile advance, or invasion or permanent occupa tion • “ we should enter into Persia because we claim an absolute equality ot in terests with Russia, and with a view to establish the equilibrium which by her initial action she would have violently disturbed •4 With this in view it was urged that, if Persian authority in the Noith i\as s .ib- veited bv Russian forces, we should retaliate by the occupation of Seisfcan, of the port Bunder Abbas, and the adjoining islands of Bushire, and of Muhamnierah. 11. In the War Office examination of the question these solutions were con sidered unnecessarily far-reaching. Their view was that the British B i up ire was being gradually brought into immediate contact with Russian strength, and that the only guarantee of peace between the two countries lay to a large extent in the equal chances of attack and defence on land. They pointed out, vide paragraph 2, that these minor commitments would play into Russia’s hands, and would divide instead of concentrate our numerically inferior forces. 1 heir con clusion was to remain content with such territory as had to be denied to Russia and to neutralize any footing she might obtain in the Persian Gulf. For the latter purpose it was considered sufficient to seize Bunder Abbas and all the islands on the coast of Oman : for the former to occupy Seistan. It was acknowledged that these proposals were not consistent with former policy, but it was pointed out that they were as far reaching as our resources allow ed, and that though by adopting them we should certainly suffer a commercial loss, if we were to take over half of Persia, the financial loss would be far greater, while strategically we should lose and not gain. 12. It will be seen that it was held then that enemy occupation of the Persian Gulf meant only an advance on India and a threat to her communications in the Arabian Sea. As a base for military operations inland the Gulf had little or no importance, since, owing to the distance of the objectives and defective communica tions. any operations based on it, other than those of a purely local nature, were not likely to be undertaken. 13. In any case, taking things as they were at the time, it seemed difficult to justify the use of armed forces based within the Gulf itself, and the policy which the Cabinet eventually adopted was sufficient for the needs of the time. Its main point, as stated by Mr. Balfour, were that— (a) From the point of view of Imperial defence the only reason why we should make sacrifices to prevent Persia from falling under the com plete control of Russia v T as that Russia would then be able in time, at her leisure, to advance on India through Kandahar or Baluchis tan. {b) That she would be in a convenient position to stir up local dissension in Baluchistan. (c) That she might arrange the Persian railway system so as to acquire a third line in addition to the two already constructed, or in progress of construction, connecting her European possessions with the probable war area. (c?) She would further be able to create a naval base on the Persian coast which would threaten our sea communications with Bombay and Karachi. And to prevent this, two courses were decided on :— {i) Maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia, and (n) In view of her weakness, a policy of earmarking in advance those places and localities, the retention and occupation of which was believed to be essential to British interests. If disorder occurred and Russia crossed the Persian frontier, to move simultaneously into those locali ties. But the warning was added that, if we were to do this, we must not be over-adventurous and grasping, but must concentrate our attention only on those places which in time of war we could hold. The result was the Convention of 1907, with its demarcation of the Br't'sh sphere of influence, apparently abandoning British rights in the greater part of Persia, but defining the areas in which it was considered we should be ready to exergise rights of defence in the event of affairs moving to our disadvantage in the rest of Persia.Part III .—Changes in the strategical outlook since 19G7. 14. In reviewing our strategical policy vis-a-vis Persia, it would be unsafe to proceed on the assumption that Persia would be the sole theatre of war. The chances are that Afghanistan would also be involved, either as a hostile or an ally. . In either of these eventualities, Afghanistan would become the main theatre of operations and Persia a subsidiary theatre. Even in^the event of Afghan neutral- lity a condition of watchfulness along the whole length of the North West Fron tier of India would be imposed upon us, and this would contain the miin strength of the Army in India. 15. Twenty years ago the whole object of our Persian policy was to ensure the exclusion of Russia from a neutral zone and to earmark a smaller zone for occupa tion when the situation demanded ; an expedient which guarded a third main land approach to India, and, in the Gulf prevented any European power from obtaining bases within it from which they could attack our vital sea communications. These then lay outside the Gulf; so long as we could control its entrance, Imperial needs were met, for bases within the Gulf would have been useless to any European power establishing itself there. In other words, we contented ourselves with a lien on such areas only as the interests of the direct defence of India demanded, and with neutralizing any footing Russia might obtain in the Persian Gulf. 16. Since 1907, however, our military commitments have been extended into the Gulf itself. This was becoming evident before the Great War in the im portance given to the sea communications by the produce of the Ahwaz oil area, and in the commitment presented by that area itself. 17. The peace treaty of 1919 has added materially to this, for now Gieat Britain has acquired real commitments at the Northern end of the extremity of the Gulf—the Irak Mandate, and again the Persian oilfields in their heightened import ance to our fuel supply. The need for control of the entrance of the Gulf remains, but there is the further necessity for controlling and maintaining sea communica tions, now become vital, throughout their length. Our policy of 1904 was based on the protection of India and the sea routes in the Indian Ocean—our present policy has to allow for the vital interests which have sprung up within the Gulf itself. Therein lies the fundamental difference—the need for the then policy in respect of Seistan still exists, but the need has arisen for a more extended strategical policy in the Gulf. In short, the Convention is now unsatisfactory because it gives no protection to British shipping within the Gulf itself. It was not designed to do so. But the need for such protection is now a real problem, and its provision has become a more difficult one. 18. For, since, 1919, with developments in the air has arisen an entirely new danger, infinitely more difficult to hold at a distance, and sea communications in the Gulf are open to attack from air bases in Persia. At present there are limits to the danger, but as aircraft improve in power, the difficulty of forestalling it increases, and it is the steps desirable in peace which are discussed in the following paragraphs. An important Imperial Airway follows the Gulf, as the shortest open way to India, but this is not as yet a vital Imperial communication, and probably never will be. Moreover the arrangements which safeguard the sea communications will serve equally the safety of the air route, and in any case the sea communications alone demand that we should make sacrifices for their defence and maintenance. 19. Another factor has emerged, complicating the problem still further. Persia in 1904 showed every sign of breaking up. Under the present rule there has been ample evidence of the awakening of a Nationalist spirit in Persia. With this movement has appeared a desire for the exclusion of Russian and British alike. In many ways resentment of our long established hold on the life of the Gulf is shown. This movement is in the way of any partition of influence, such as hoped to solve the problem of 1904, however desirable, or however feasible, vis-a-vis the Soviet pressure. But it is none the less in our interests. Persia can never be more than a third rate power, but as such she is more likely to resist Russian pressure than was the feeble state of the past; an nexation by Russia of her Northern areas becomes our chief concern. Russia can, of course, occupy Northern Persia with little military efiort, but she knows that,except as part of a much wider offensive, it is not, as it was not in interest to exert pressure on Persia by force of arms, knowing a sue almost certain to entail war with the British Bmpire before she could reach the r-'PVQiQTi cpq non tH For L policy in the past has been that an advance on the part of Bus,a ^ should be met by a corresponding advance on the part of Great Britain , and if this was right in the past, when we had only the defence of India o consic er, i fully warranted now that we have the additional commitments of Irak, the oiitields, and the sea communication. • i -d The danger now lies in Persia, perforce or willingly, allying herself with Russia and placing at her disposal facilities which could well be prepared before the alliance was made. In that case, our counter measures become more difficult, politically, to carry through, but more necessary to carry through quickly. 20. As regards Seistan what change there has^ been in the means of imple menting our policy has been in our favour in the existence of the Nushki-Duzdap railway—easily continued to Seistan. The danger, as pointed out m Part , lies in the temptation it provides for construction in Persia towards the Russian railway system—a danger, which however, can be avoided in peace. In the Gulf, protection of the sea communications seems at first sight an easy matter, for there seems to be no direction from which an attack on them can develop. Nor can it by sea ; but the air menace is there—by its nature easier to apply and more quickly put into action. It is clear from Part I that the mountainous country interposed between the Persian littoral and the uplands of Persia present a serious obstacle to land opera tions designed to keep hostile air forces at a distance, operations which can be countered by Russian measures carried out under easier circumstances and providing additional areas in which to use her preponderance of man power. On the other hand, the nature of the threat provides its own solution. A convoy system protected directly or indirectly by the action of air forces, should render the sea commu nications reasonably safe so long as enemy bases were kept away from the littoral, and so long as we secure suitable points therein for establishing our own. The solution appears to be in establishing at the outset air bases on the Arabian littoral of the Gulf, in allotting aircraft carriers to the naval forces charged with organizing the convoy system in the Gulf, and in at once suizing suitable points on the Persian coast as advanced air bases. The development of air action from the oilfields and Irak would provide a power ful aid. As hostile action may hamper our seizure of bases on the Persian Coast, it is vital that we should prevent a foreign power from securing a hold on the Arabian side, even if we cannot debar it from the Persian side at the outside. The oilfields area presents the far more difficult problem of a stationary, compact, and highly vulnerable target. The land force required to keep hostile bases at a safe distance would be practi cally as great as the force needed for an efiective occupation of at least the whole of SoutffiWest Persia, and with the development of air services, possibly the whole of Persia. The strain on our shipping alone, let alone on our man power, would be such as to prejudice fatally action in the vital theatre Afghanistan. Readiness to protect the oilfields, directly or indirectly, by air action based in the oilfields area, or its close vicinity, must form a cardinal part of the protection arrangements here; arrangements which will automatically protect the upper end of the Persian Gulf. The only land forces which can be usefully expended here are (i) Such as will afford protection to the oilfields and the air establishment against sabotage, (ii) And such as may be needed to encourage the Bakhtiari, with or with out assistance, to repel the advance of land forces from the North, and (Hi) Troops manning anti-aircraft defences, which should find a very suitable employment in the oilfields. Irak is well placed for air bases threatening hostile air bases and com munications from a flank—a flank, moreover, which, as shown in Part I, is coveredby the Turkish barrier to Russian movements from the North. But our lien on Irak must gradually weaken by the conditions of the Mandate, and unless events make it possible to reverse it, we must sooner or later lose the advantage of our hold on Irak. When this comes, as soon as any hostile or even alien power seems to be in a position to threaten the oilfields, it would appear essential to take action to protect them, even to the extent of declaring a protectorate over them and the Dizful area. The development of the railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf must materially alter the strategic situation vis-a-vis Russia on the Persian and Irak frontier by tending to reduce the time for action which we have at our disposal. On the other hand, it will also serve our purpose by facilitating our occupation of the South Persian oilfield area should the trouble arise, while its course parallel to the Irak frontier would be to the disadvantage of an enemy attempting to cross from the North to the Gulf Ports. Hamadan would then become the most important strategic point in Western Persia. 21 . It will be seen that the old conception of 1907 has weakened and that it will not meet the situation again till oil is displaced in its war uses. In 1904, our strategical front, recognised in the Convention of 1907, faced Westward on a North and South line drawn from the Straits of Hormaz. With the development of the oilfields, it began to be recognised that this no longer met Imperial needs, and military thought in India was directed to the need for a Northward swing—conforming in fact, though for a different reason, with the desire of the Government of India in 1904— to include the Gulf ports and Muhammerah in the objectives of our policy. It is significant that the new frontier then recommended faced due North on a line from Seistan to the Karun river, and although circumstances have altered the desire in detail, in principle it remains the same. There is no longer any doubt that an advance by Russia into North Persia, or an alliance between Persia and Russia, will still necessitate, at the least, preparations for an advance into South Persia on the part of Great Britain, and paragraph 20 attempts to outline what should be “ the nature of Great Britain’s advance, and the depth to which it should be prepared to go.” Part IV. Summary. 22. Now, as in the past, if Russia makes a material forward movement, whether in alliance with Persia or despite her, the British Empire should at once make a corresponding movement “ along the frontiers accessible to her forces by land or sea.” Now, instead of the limited movement to Seistan and the Straits of Hormuz, Imperial commitments in Irak and the value in war, of the oilfields and of the sea communications thence, compel us to add such air bases on the Persian littoral as we need to supplement air bases on the Arabian coast, and may force us to an occupa tion of the oilfields area. But now, as then, expeditions inland from the Gulf are out of the question, and we must confine our efforts on the Persian littoral to that littoral itself. Similarly, extended action of land forces is out of the question, even in the East, in Seistan, and in the West, in the South-West corner of Persia. And it is essential that we should be prepared to take military action to support our policy as soon as the danger threatens and not wait till it materializes, in view of the ease and swiftness of hostile air action. And while it is still essential to avoid committing ourselves to a policy we cannot enforce, it is held that the above policy is within Imperial means and reasonably adequate to the need.It is to our advantage to assist Persia’s rise to independence. Put we should none the less, when the necessity arises, let Persia know clearly what we intend to do, should they so submit themselves or ally themselves to any alien government as to render possible a threat to the defence of the Indian frontier or to our com munications in the Gulf.

L.D.Wakely, .'j sG[•, G• B• , Secretary, Political Department, India Office, LONDON. (With 1 spare copy)A did OlaAsC*. X SECRET. General Staff Appreciation of the Situation in the Persian Gulf. Part I. Geographical Considerations. 1. The geographical considerations in the area under review will be outlined at the outset as reference to them are made throughout this memorandum. 2. The factors which influence the movement of Armed Forces from North to South towards the Persian Gulf Littoral are of primary importance. The most important geographical feature is the Dasht-i-Ka^ ir desert with its South Eastern extension the Dasht-i-Lut, which, stretching across the centre of Persia, are practically impassable to troops and divide lines of advance^ from A orth to South into two groups : those leading from Meshed towards the South (all ot which unite about Seistan) and those from Tehran towards Ahwaz, Bushire, and Kerman respectively. An advance from the North towards the Persian Gulf must therefore run athwart our existing communications which run from Quetta to Duzdap in the East, or be flanked in the West from Baku to the Gulf by Military and Air Bases in Irak. Secondly for an average distance of 200 miles inland, all W estern and Southern Persia is densely packed with mountains. From the shores of the Persian Gulf the hinterland rises in a series of ranges to heights of 8,000 to 10,000 feet through which there is no natural corridor. All ranges run parallel with the coast line, and so present a formidable natural barrier to forces attempting either the effective occupation of the seaboard from the North, or the penetration of the hinterland from a base established on the sea coast. 3. The frontier of Persia marches with that of Irak from Basra to Bowanduz for a distance of some 500 miles. The barrier of Persian territory separating Irak from Russia gradually narrows from some 400 miles at its Southern extremity to 150 miles at its Northern end. Our principal interests are centred in the Imperial Oil reserve in the South West of Persia. In the North any encorachment on the part of Russia which tended to advance her frontier nearer to Mosul through Per sian territory would be resented by Turkey and would probably incur her hostility. Eastern Turkey with its complicated mass of mountain ranges and its lack of suitable communications forms an effective barrier to an advance on Irak from the North. It would seem thus that the strategic importance of the Irak-Persian frontier gra- dully diminishes as it runs Northwards, and it is obvious that where the danger is greatest, the hairier separating Irak from Russia is greatest a 1 so, for 400 miles of difficult country intervenes between the Caspian and the South Persian Oilfields; and any Russian advance on them would have to be made slowly and methodically. This gives us for the present ample time in which to concentrate forces for the protection of the oilfields area and our interests in Southern Irak against a Russian threat, but none if that threat is Persian. In general, our hold on Irak provides a flanking threat to enemy activities in Western Persia, and the railway from Basra to Baghdad and kaniken permits land and air pressure in the general direction of Hamadan, and renders vulnerable centres further North e.g., Baku, liable to air attack. 4. Alterations in these conditions recent or impending will now be considered. The Dvzdap Railway.—A development which affects the Persian problemm an important aspect—the defence of India—is the Nushki-Duzdap railway, which gives / quick and ready access from India to the Seistan area, materially adding to our power of meeting an advance from North to South by the Eastern Persian route. Its possible danger lies in the temptation it provides for the construction of rail ways in Persia leading towards the Russian system, and thus removing the bai i iei of undeveloped country between Russia and Great Britain. In this connection the Eastern boundary of Persia which separates it bom Afghanistan is a purely arbitrary one, without geographical or ethnographical significance. For this reason the problem of India’s defence as 'affected by a Russian advance into North East Persia cannot be divorced from the problems M. 0. 457 F. D.f 2 connected with a Russian advance into Northern Afghanistan in the direction of Herat. Provided Afghanistan was actively in the field against Russia as our ally, an advance by Russia via the Meshed-Herat corridor could be most effectively met by employing our main forces on the Quetta-Kandahar-Farah line. In the event of Afghan neutrality or hostility, however, the Nushki-Duzdap line and the Seistan area would assume an increased strategic importance. The Hamadan Khor Musa Railway .—The development of this will materially alter the strategic situation in Western Persia. It will run from Bandar-i-Gas on the Caspian sea to Tehran ; and thence in the direction of Hamadan. It will then turn Southwards parallel to the Irak frontier via Dizful, through the South Persian Oilfileds to meet the sea about Khor Musa. Although any connection between the Gulf and the Caspian is to be regretted, its alignment so far Westwards and paral lel to the Irak frontier may be a serious disadvantage to an invader from the North. On the other hand it must reduce the time for action which we can reckon on. 5. From the foregoing it is evident that the main Military interest lies in the Seistan area and the Oilfields area. The occupation of Seistan would provide an effective counter to an advance towards the Straits of Hormuz and the Indian Ocean by the Eastern route and also protect India. The occupation of the Oilfields would protect our important and immediate interests in that area, and combined with the threat of attack from Baghdad would counter an advance from the North by the Western Persian routes on the Gulf ports. As regards the Seistan area. Meshed lies within 80 miles of the Trans-Caspian railway. Russian forces could occupy it at any time they liked. From Meshed to Duzdap is some 500 miles as the crow flies. A fair road exists via Birjand which takes light motor transport. Our experience during the Great War of maintain ing forces over this route points to the unlikelihood of Russia threatening Seistan with a force of more than 10,000 men, without rail communication in Persia, pro vided the supplies of Seistan itself are denied to the enemy by our forces. The Oilfields area would require early land protection in the event of Russian penetration in the North small forces sufficing while our Air Forces in Irak are available for its protection. A landing ground exists at Maidan-i-Naftun. Com munication with Basra (150 miles as the crow flies) is at present via the Karun River, the rapids at Ahwaz offering the chief difficulty. The direct advance on the oilfields, from the North lies through Qum and Isfahan. From the diiection of Isfahan the oilfields are protected by a difficult mountain barrier. The Bakhtiari tribesmen truculent and warlike, have their welfare at present bound up in the prosperity of the oilfields. The oilfields are more vulnerable to attack, from the direction of Hamadan and Khurramabad though such an advance through the mountainous region of Luristan would probably be a most difficult operation. 'The railway will also eventually lead into the oilfield from this direction. With the advent of the railway, Hamadan will tend to become the strategic centre of Western Persia, but until the natural mountain barrier has been penetrated by good communication, our military policy should be directed towards leaving it to the enemy to combat the natural obstacles, without unduly extending our own lines of communications. 6. The air factor will now be considered. From the Straits of Hormuz to Basra is approximately 500 miles, and an aver' age stretch of 100 miles of sea separates Persia from Arabia. The development o^ air bases along the Trucial coast should in the first instance guarantee a sufficient measure of air domination, both to ensure the free passage of shipping and to pre vent hostile air bases from being established on or near the Persian Coastal Plain. For adequate protection of the Gulf waterway it would be necessary to es tablish air bases on the Persian shore itself at the earliest opportunity, to add to the inland range of our aircraft. The Dasht-i-Kavir desert and the coastal moun tain belt provide a natural protection to the Gulf from attack by both land and air forces since they increase the difficulties of maintenance to an enormous extent. Air bases, if they are to be a permament and serious menace to the Gulf waterway, must be connected with workshop and factory by good ground com munications ; and hostile air bases established on the line Kirman-Ispahan. or at3 Shiraz without good roads or railways to serve them would be very difficult to maintain as effective operational bases. The effect of the geographical barriers therefore, will be to hold the air bases away from the Gulf, and tell to our advant- age. With the increasing range of modern aircraft, however, it will be possible to reach the Gulf waterway from Bases established in Northern Persia. Although the further removed from the Gulf hostile air bases are established, the less effec tive will be the threat which those bases exert, nevertheless, the possibility of air attack from bases situated at 500 miles radius may soon have to be considered. We can put this effective radius now at 300 miles, but during the next 10 years we must envisage an extension to 500 miles or more. On the attached map a Ime has been drawn showing the area of Persia which lies within 500 miles of the Trucial Coast A circle has also been struck on a radius of 500 miles with the Ahwaz oil fields as centre The curve of the latter will show at a glance the necessity of ex cluding a potential enemy from establishing air bases anywhere on Persian soil. Part TI. —Former Policy in Persia. 7 The clash of Russian with British interests, imminent at the beginning of the century but postponed by the regrouping of powers enforced by the German threat, gave rise to a close examination, culminating in 1904, of the political and military problems arising from the situation in Persia. 8. At first the tendency was to aim at military annexation, in necessity, of as much of Persia as would halt the Russian advance at a distance from the Persian Gulf involving in effect an advance of our frontiers into touch with Russia s. Responsible consideration ruled this solution out; its fuff apphcaGon as pointed out by Lieutenant-Colonel (now Field Marshall) Sir William Robertson when criticising a less ambitious solution offered by the Government of India, woffid have entailed bringing the British Empire into immediate contact with Russia s strength, allowing her to use men whom she would have been unable to use other wise. 9. As hinted above, the Government of India differed from the Home author- ties, but in degree only, not in principle. They held that the Asiatic history of Russia during the past half century lent no support to the theory that she desired to acquire or annex Persia, or to subvert the Persian monarchy. It was on t he con- trarv that her policy everywhere was to maintain existing authority and to support the reigning sovereign, but to reduce him to a state of vassalage to herself. As the Government of India and the Home Government read her ambitions, she had m intention to annex more territory,* or to subjugate more peoples by force of arms, but preferred to control the government of the countries which she desired to in fluence, and to utilize them as instruments through whom she might obtain sup reme political influence and commercial control. It was thought certain that the ulterior objects of Russian policy in Persia, apart from gaining control of the Government of Persia, would be— ' (t) To reach the Persian Gulf. (ii) By means of (i) to be in a position to apply pressure to yet one more vulnerable spot on the flank of Great Britain. It was clear that the occupation, by British Forces, of the mouth of the Gulf af a counter would be a serious, if not an insuperable barrier, to the realization os these hopes. 10 But here the divergence in degree appeared. The Government of India were strongly of the opinion that Russia could not be permitted to gam control of Persia at all, and maintained that, if Russia were to make any material forward movement into Persia, Great Britain should at once make a corresponding move ment “ along the frontiers accessible to her forces by land and sea . 1 his move ment was not intended to be a hostile advance, or invasion, or peunme it oc upi- tion ; “ we should enter into Persia because we claim an absolute equality of in terests with Russia, and with a view to establish the equilibrium which by hei imtia action she would have violently disturbed ”.4 With this in view it was urged that, if Persian authority m the North was sub verted by Russian forces, we should retaliate by the occupation of Seistan, ot the port Bunder Abbafr, and the adjoining islands of Bushire, and ot Muhammerah. 11 In the War Office examination of the question these solutions were con sidered unnecessarily far-reaching. Their view was that the British Empire was being gradually brought into immediate contact with Russian strength, and that the only guarantee of peace between the two countries lay to a large extent in the tqual chances of attack and defence on land. They pomted out vide paragraph 2, that these minor commitments would play into Russia s hands, mid would divide instead of concentrate our numerically inferior forces. 1 heir con clusion was to remain content with such territory as had to be denied to Russia and to neutralize any footing she might obtain m the Persian Gidf For the latter purpose it was considered sufficient to seize Bunder Abbas and all the islands on the coast of Oman: for the former to occupy Seistan. It was acknowledged that these proposals were not consistent with former policy but it was pointed out that they were as far reaching as our resources allow ed and that though by adopting them we should certainly suffer a commercial loss, if we were to take over half of Persia, the financial loss would be far greater, while strategically we should lose and not gain. 12 It will be seen that it was held then that enemy occupation of the Persian liulf meant only an advance on India and a threat to her communications mthe Arabian Sea. As a base for military operations inland the Gulf had little or no importance, since, owing to the distance of the objectives and defective communica tions, any operations based on it, other than those of a purely local nature, were not likely to be undertaken. 13. In any case, taking things as they were at the time, it seemed difficult to iustify the use of armed forces based within the Gulf itself, and the policy which the Cabinet eventually a dopted was sufficient for the needs of the time. Its mam point, as stated by Mr. Balfour, were that— («) From the point of view of Imperial defence the only reason why we should make sacrifices to prevent Persia from falling under the com- , plete control of Russia was that Russia would then be able m time at her leisure to advance on India through Kandahar or Baluchis tan. (b) That she would be in a convenient position to stir up local dissension in Baluchistan. (c) That she might arrange the Persian railway system so as to acquire a # third line in addition to the two already constructed, or m progress of construction, connecting her European possessions with the probable war area. Id) She would further be able to create a naval base on the Persian coast which would threaten our sea communications with Bombay and Karachi. And to prevent this two courses were decided on (i) Maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia. and (ii) In view of her weakness, a policy of earmarking in advance those places and localities, the retention and occupation of which was believed to be essential to British interests. If disorder occurred and Russia crossed the Persian frontier, to move simultaneously into those locali ties. But the warning was added that, if we were to do this, we must not be over-adventurous and grasping, but must concentrate our at tention only on those places which in time of war we could hold. The result was the Convention of 1907, with its demarcation of the British sphere of influence, apparently abandoning British rights in the greater part o Persia, but defining the areas in which it was considered we should be rea,dy to exercise rights of defence m the event of affairs moving to our disadvantage m the rest of Persia.5 III. “ In reviewing our strategical policy vis-a-vis Persia, it would be unsafe to proceed on the assumption that Persia would be the sole theatre of war. The chances are that Afghanistan would also be involved, either as a hostile or an ally. In either of these eventualities, Afghanistan would become the main theatre of operations and Persia a subsidiary theatre. Even in the event of Afghan neutra lity a condition of watchfulness along the whole length of the North-West Fron tier of India would be imposed upon us, and this would contain the main strength of the Army in India. Changes in the strategical outlook since 1907. 14. Twenty years ago the whole object of our Persian policy was to ensure the exclusion of Russia frc m a neutral zone and to earmark a smaller zone for occupa tion when the situation demanded ; an expedient which guarded a third main land approach to India, and, in the Gulf prevented any European power from obtaining bases within it from which they could attack our vital sea communications. These then lay outside the Gulf; so long as we could control its entrance, Imperial needs were met, for bases within the Gulf would have been useless to any European power establishing itself there. In other words, we contented ourselves with a lien on such areas only as the interests of the direct defence of India demanded, and with neutralizing any footing Russia might obtain in the Persian Gulf. 15. Since 1907, however, our military commitments have been extended into the Gulf itself. This was becoming evident before the Great War in the im portance given to the sea communications by the produce of the Ahwaz oil area, and in the commitment presented by that area itself. 16. The peace treaty of 1919 has added materially to this, for now Great Britain has acquired real commitments at the Northern end of the extremity of the Gulf—the Irak Mandate, and again the Persian oilfields in their heightened impor tance to our fuel supply. The need for control of the entrance of the Gulf remains, but there is the further necessity for controlling and maintaining sea communica tions now become vital, throughout their length. Our policy of 1904 was based on the protection of India and the sea routes in the Indian Ocean—our present policy has to allow for the vital interests which have sprung up within the Gulf itself. Therein lies the fundamental difference—the need for the then policy in respect of Seistan still exists, but the need has arisen for a more extended strategical policy in the Gulf. In short, the Convention is now unsatisfactory because it gives no protection to British shipping within the Gulf itself. It was not designed to do so. But the need for such protection is now a real problem, and its provision has become a more difficult one. 17. For, since, 1919, with developments in the air has arisen an entirely new danger, infinitely more difficult to hold at a distance, and sea communications in the Gulf are open to attack from air bases in Persia. At present there are limits to the danger, but as aircraft improve in power, the difficulty of forestalling it increases, and it is the steps desirable in peace which are discussed in the following paragraphs. An important Imperial Airway follows the Gulf, as the shortest open way to India, but this is not as yet a vital Imperial communication, and probably never will be. Moreover the arrangements which safeguard the sea communications will serve equally the safety of the air route, and in any case the sea communications alone demand that we should make sacrifices for their defence and maintenance. 18. Another factor has emerged, complicating the problem still further. Persia in 1904 showed every sign of breaking up. Under the present rule there has been ample evidence of the awakening of a Nationalist spirit in Persia. With this movement has appeared a desire for the exclusion of Russian and British alike. In many ways resentment of our long established hold on the life of the Gulf is shown. This movement is in the way of any partition of influence, such as hoped to solve the problem of 1904, however desirable, or however feasible, vis-a-vis the Soviet pressure. But it is none the less in our interests. Persia can never be more than a third rate power, but as such she is more likely to resist Russian pressure than was the feeble state of the past; an nexation by Russia of her Northern areas becomes our chief concern. Russia can, of course, occupy Northern Persia with little military effort, but she knows that.6 except as part of a much wider offensive, it is not, as it was not in 1904, in her interest to exert pressure on Persia by force of arms, knowing that such action is almost certain to entail war with the British Empire before she could reach the Persian seaboard. For our policy in the past has been t]iat an advance on the part of Russia should be met by a corresponding advance on the part of Great Britain , and if this was right in the past, when we had only the defence of India to consider, it is more fully warranted now that we have the additional commitments of Irak, the oilfields, and the sea communication. The danger now lies in Persia, perforce or willingly, allying herself with Russia and placing at her disposal facilities which could well be prepared before the alliance was made. In that case, our counter measures become more difficult, politically, to carry through, but more necessary to carry through quickly. 19. [a) What change there has been in the means of implementing our policy has been in our favour as regards Seistan in the existence of the Nushki-Duzdap railway—easily continued to Seistan. The danger, as pointed out in Part I, lies in the temptation it provides for construction in Persia towards the Russian railway system—a danger, which however, can be avoided in peace. (6) In the Gulf, protection of the sea communications seems at first sight an easy matter, for there seems to be no direction from which an attack on them can develop. Nor can it by sea ; but the air menace is there—by its nature easier to apply and more quickly put into action. It is clear from Part I that the mountainous country interposed between the Persian littoral and the uplands of Persia present a serious obstacle to land opera tions designed to keep hostile air forces at a distance, operations which can be countered by Russian measures under easier circumstances and providing additional areas in which to use her preponderance of man power. On the other hand, the nature of the threat provides its own solution. A convoy system protected directly or indirectly by the action of air forces, should render the sea communications reasonably safe so long as enemy bases were kept away from the littoral, and so long as we secure suitable points therein for establishing our own. The solution lies in establishing at the outset air bases on the Arabian littoral of the Gulf, in allotting aircraft carriers to the naval forces charged with organizing the convoy system in the Gulf, and in at once seizing air bases on the Persian coast as advanced air bases. The development of air action from the oilfields and Irak would provide a power* ful aid. As hostile action may hamper our seizure of bases on the Persian Coast, it is vital that we should prevent a foreign power from securing a hold on the Arabian side, even if we cannot debar it from the Persian side at the outside. (c) The oilfields area present the far more difficult problem of a stationary, compact, and highly vulnerable target. The land forces required to keep hostile bases at a safe distance would be in effect the same as would be needed for an effective occupation of at least the whole of South-West Persia, and with the development of air services, possibly the whole of Persia. The strain on our shipping alone, let alone on our man power, would be such as to prejudice fatally action in the vital theatre—Afghanistan Readiness to protect the oilfields, directly or indirectly, by air action based in the oilfields area, or its close vicinity, must form a cardinal part of the protection arrangements here ; arrangements which will automatically protect the upper end of the Persian Gulf. The only land forces w^hich can be usefully expended here are : (t) Such as will afford protection to the oilfields and the air establishment against sabotage. (ii) And such as may be needed to encourage the Bakhtiari with or with out assistance to repel the advance of land forces from the North, and (m) Troops manning anti-aircraft defences, which should find a very suitable employment in the oilfields. (d) Irak is well placed for air bases, threatening hostile air bases and com munications from a flank—a flank, moreover, which, as shown in Part I, is covered7 by the Turkish barrier to Russian movements from the North. But our lien on Irak must gradually weaken by the conditions of the Mandate, and unless events make it possible to reverse it, we must sooner or later lose the advantage of our hold on Irak. When this comes, as soon as any hostile or even alien power appears to be in a position to threaten the oilfields, it would appear essential to take action to protect them, even to the extent of declaring a protectorate over them and the Dizful area. (e) The development of the railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf must materially alter the strategic situation vis-a-vis Russia on the Persian and Irak frontier by tending to reduce the time for action which we have at our disposal. On the other hand, it will also serve our purpose by facilitating our occupation of the South Persian oilfield area should the trouble arise, while its course parallel to the Irak frontier would be to the disadvantage of an enemy attempting to cross from the North to the Gulf Ports. Hamadan would then become the most important strategic point in Western Persia. 20. It will be seen that the old conception of 1907 has weakened and that it will not meet the situation again till oil is displaced in its war uses. In 1904, our strategical front, recognised in the Convention of 1907, faced Westward on a North and South line drawn from the Straits of Hormaz. With the development of the oilfields, it began to be recognised that this no longer met our needs, and military thought in India was directed to the need for a Northward swing—conforming in fact, though for a different reason, with the desire of the Government of India in 1904—to include the Gulf ports and Muham- merah in the objectives of our policy. It is significant that the new frontier then recommended faced due North on a line from Seistan to the Karun river, and although circumstances have altered the desire in detail, in principle it remains the same. There is no longer any doubt that an advance by Russia into North Persia, or an alliance between Persia and Russia, will still necessitate at the least preparations for an advance into South Persia on the part of Great Britain, and paragraph 19 attempts to outline what should be “ the nature of Great Britain’s advance, and the depth to which it should be prepared to go.” IV. Summary. Now, as in the past, if Russia makes a material forward movement, whether in alliance with Persia or despite her, Great Britain should at once make a corres ponding movement “ along the frontiers accessible to her forces by land or sea.’* Now, instead of the limited movement to Seistan and the Straits of Hormuz ; our commitments in Irak and the value of the oilfields in war, and of the sea com munications thence, compel us to add such bases on the Persian littoral as we need to supplement those on the Arabian coast, and will force us to an occupation of the oilfields area. But now, as then, expeditions inland from the Gulf are out of the question, and we must confirm our efforts in the Persian littoral to that-littoral itself. Similarly, extended action of land forces is out of the question even in the East in Seistan, and in the West, in the South-West corner of Persia. And it is essential that we should be prepared to take military action to support this policy as soon as the threat appears and not wait till it materializes, in view of the ease and sw iftness o f host ile air action. .. , — — And while it is still essential to avoid committing ourselves to a policy we cannot enforce, it is held that the above policy is within our means and reasonably adequate to the need. It is to our advantage to assist Persia’s rise to independence. But we should none the less, when the necessity arises, let Persia know clearly what we intend to do, should they so submit themselves or ally themselves to any alien government as to render possible a threat to the defence of the Indian frontier or to our com munications in the Gulf. i£C558FD—25—8-9-28—GIPSmmm KMHPi* 1 fju/mc (90 groups ULE X OF TKLEGR A U 4644 312- (COPIES OSCULATED) From Hceroyo Foreign and Political Depsrtment 0 to Secretary of State for Indiao Dated Simla,, 6th 0ctober ff 1928 0 Received 6th October* 1928* 10 o 15 poXn 0 XX mxz&amp;o Our telegram of the 3rd instc© 1987~S C Persian Gulfo General Staff appreciation is being forwarded by mail leaving India on 15th October* General Staff emphasise the increased coEmitmentfi due partly to Mandate and principally to Oil»fields 0 and point out that the Empire now has a vital sea ccmcunication running along the whole length of Gulf itself from Straits of Horous to Basrah* If Russia makes a material forward movement 0 whether in alliance with Persia or in spite of her 0 our new commitments would compel ue in war to add to our previously contemplated forward movement to Seistan and the Straits of Hormuz* occupation of such air bases on the Persiailittoral as we need to supplement other and main bases on the Arabian coasto It may also force us to the occupation of the Oil*fieldg area* They are of opinion that extended military operations inland fro© the Gulf ports are out of the question* and that the ffi ftin danger lies in the development of an air threat which would have to be met by counter air action© They urge that it is essential that we should be prepared to take action to enforce this policy as soon as danger threatens* and not wait until it materialises^, in view of the ease and swiftness of hostile air action,:C Q g Y 0 F 2 E L &amp; From Viceroy., Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, Dated Simla, 3rd October, 1928, Received 3rd October, 1928, 9,20 p„m„ XX MPCRTAHT . 3,987-S , Lixat-at J.aur aarta.

As regards our possible cards in the forthcoming negotiations, we conceive that British friendship and goodwill must always be of lumensa value to Persia vta-a-via of Russia, if not for its own sake, however much she may pretend to be-little it. More concrete is the loss she would sustain if we stopped running the Duzdap railway. Possibly, too. His Majesty’s Government may now be inclined again to consider the previous suggestion that it might be worth while to extinguish all debts, save pre-war debts, in consideration of a general settlement (vide my telegram of February 16th, 344-3), and there are further individual counters, like the possible rendition of Rasldu and face-saving concessions over the slavery convention lifting and buoying. Should Persia treat our spirit of accoraiodation as weakness, we feel that, while avoiding anything which could be interpreted as provocative, we should at once stiffen our attitude over the status quo (except of course on patent un-essentials) and answer any attempt at extrusion by gesture of referring our differences, especially as regards slavery, lighting and buoying, to the League of Nations, it is after all Persia and not ourselves that has reason to shrink from publicity before the League or otherwise over matters of international concern in the Persian Gulf,1.9 /t- &gt; THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. WE have been asked by the Committee of Imperial Defence* to report on the question of a defence scheme for Bahrein, in the light of its importance as a source of oil supply (Paper No. O.B. 253)t. We would draw attention to the fact that the whole question of the defence of British interests in the Persian Gulf has been raised quite recently by the Resident, Sir Trenchard Fowle, and that an informal interdepartmental discussion took place in the India Office on the 14th April on this subject. The defence of Bahrein was specifically considered, and our own views are in close agreement with the opinions which were expressed on that occasion. We set out below the main considerations affecting this problem, and our opinion upon the defence policy which should be adopted. General Considerations. 2. Bahrein is an island group on the west coast of the Persian Gulf, some 300 miles from the entrance to the gulf. His Majesty’s Government have guaranteed the protection of Bahrein against aggression by the chiefs and tribes of the Persian Gulf, in a Treaty with the Sheikh of Bahrein, dating from 1861. The Iranian Government has put forward a claim to the possession of Bahrein, but we understand that there are no legal grounds for this claim. Strategical Importance of Bahrein. 3. We note that the Oil Board have now assessed Bahrein as being less- important as a source of oil supply than Rangoon or Trinidad, and we understand that the oil from this source is mainly suitable for commercial purposes. There are other considerations, however, in addition to the protection of the oil supply which render the defence of Bahrein important in time of war. Two aerodromes and a flying boat base are located there, and it is proposed to establish one flight of the general reconnaissance squadron in the Persian Gulf permanently at Bahrein in peace. It is likely to become an increasingly important link in our air communications with India and the Far East, since our air facilities at Bahrein are located on an island, where they could be more easily defended than any of our other aerodromes in Iraq and the Persian Gulf in the event of the Arab States proving hostile to us. In peace His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf use Bahrein as their base, but this is mainly because certain recreational facilities have been provided there. No docking or repair facilities exist, nor are any naval stores or ammunition reserves kept there. Moreover, the oil from the Bahrein oilfields has too high a sulphur content to be used in His Majesty’s ships except in an emergency, and all supplies are normally provided from Abadan.2 Scale of A ttack. 4. The possibility of an enemy cruiser or aircraft carrier entering the Persian Gulf in time of war cannot be entirely ruled out, but in view of the risks involved and the comparatively low strategic value of the British interests which are located there, it would appear to be remote. The object of enemy action would presumably be to interfere with the movement of oil out of the Gulf, and in so far as surface raiders are concerned, tankers could be attacked with much less risk and an equally good chance of success in the Gulf of Oman. A possible form of attack on Bahrein would appear to be by direct bombardment from a submarine, but the waters of the Persian Gulf are generally unsuitable for the operation of submarines. As regards air attack, we have already discounted the probability of attack by ship-borne aircraft, and Saudi Arabia does not at present possess sufficient aircraft to warrant air attack by that country being considered as a serious danger. Iran is the nearest country from which any considerable attack could be developed, and though at the present time their air force is not well equipped or organised, air attack from Iran might become a threat in the future. For the present, however, it seems unlikely that any great threat to our interests in Bahrein will arise from any act of external aggression, and it is mainly against sabotage that our precautions should be directed. Defence Resources available. 5. At present the only force maintained in peace is one of 150 armed police administered by the Sheikh. The localities where local guards would be wanted to guard against sabotage are dispersed; the oilfields are three miles from the refinery and fourteen miles from the naval base and wireless station. The police would only be sufficient for their normal peace-time duties, and, as special local guards would be necessary in war, it seems advisable that the numbers required and the provision of their arms should be arranged in peace. The strength could be reduced if certain areas were enclosed in barbed wire fences, and “ forbidden areas ” proclaimed in any period of emergency. In view of the considerable income accruing to the Sheikh from the oilfields, we see no reason why he should not provide further personnel for armed police duties. Defence Plans. 6. The India Office and the Air Ministry have already agreed that a general \ defence plan to cover the aerodromes and other British interests ashore in the Persian Gulf should be prepared as soon as possible, and instructions have been issued to the Resident and the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to concert in the preparation of such a plan in conjunction with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. This general plan will include a section on Bahrein as the result of a study of the problem locally. We do not, therefore, consider that any further action is called for at the present time. Conclusions. (a) Strategically, the air facilities at Bahrein, as well as the oil supplies, are of importance. (b) Attack both from sea and air on any appreciable scale is a remote possibility and is insufficient to warrant the installation at present of coast defence or anti-aircraft guns. (c) Sabotage is the most probable source of danger, and the possibility of improving the security measures against this threat is about to be investigated. (d) Since the preparation of a defence plan is already in hand, no further action is called for at present. (Signed) CHATFIELD. GORT. R. E. C.
