Dated 7th received Sth April 192^, To PRIORITY. written report now received from Captain Driver, Special Service Officer, who has visited all scattered camps of refugees from the Alth^an raid and carefully collated and tested evidence from various sections, contains the conclusion that 1^6 Mmen and 1?7 women and children were killed by the A ^hwan, and a6,g00 sheep, 3&gt;7^0 donkeys, 5 horses and 2 camels carried off. The Akhwan killed all the male wounded and prisoners both men and boys but spared the women, casualties among the latter being due to rifle fire at the time of the attack. The attacking force numbered between 12,000 and 16,000, and was commanded in person by Feisal ai Bawish, the principle lieutenant of Bin Baud. The attack took place on the morning of March 14th, led by horsemen who were subsequently reinforced by a large body of camelmen. The fighting continued until sunset, and the Akhwan force camped on the battlefield for three days after the attack. The area raided was a network of nullahs in the neighbourhood of Umm-el-Hashim just within the Iraq border. I will now reapectful- -ly examine the argument that Bin Sadd was not more responaibla for this raid than the Iraq Gevernirent for the Sahmirar raids of last summer, and that the two sets of rai^s can be treated as paraliel. In the case of the Al^hwan raid, firstly there was a conference sitting to discuss relations between the two Spates, which entails a very special measure of abstinence from provoc- -ation on both sides; secondly, Bin Saud had, on grouhds which were shown in my telegram No.113 the ^-th March to be completely inadequate, officially threatened in a letter dated 22nd February ^92^ that be would not restrain his tribes from attacks on Iraq and as mentioned in para of the sase telegram there were reports for days before the raid of preparations being openly made for itfor it by Feisal. Thsse facta confir® the ocnolusions reached imajaimcusly by Trevor. Knox and myself that Bin Siaid must have been fully cognizant of preparaticne for the raid. It eeene doubtful in fact whether he would deny this. Thirdly, the raid took place in Iraq territory. Fourthly the loas in lives and property was very great. In contrast, the circurestancee of the Nejd-Skteoar raids last summer were as follows;- firstly, there was no conference sitting and thus no special aggravation or question of honour; secondly, the raiders were small bodies, not more than about loo men, who could cover long desert distances *4' without much preparation and without being observed by the authorities; thirdly, attacks by the raiders in n© instance took place within Kajd borders. There wua thus no question of invasion, although it is true that the victims were mostly caravans from Nejd trading into Iraq. Fcurtiily, the damage inflicted wae ooivparativeiy insignificant, the total maximuffi.of casualties which can be gathered frciK rather vaguea accounts to be claimed by Hejd, being not more than 50, all cf them men. These facts will, I think,show that there can be no comparison between them. A review of the attitude of Iraq shows that it has shewn great forebear since and its procedure under great prove c- -ation has been strictly in accordance with international principles accepted by the League of Nations. Firstly, although Feisal himself was convinced by the first reports which he had received following on the Sultan^ threats that a very serious raid had occurred and was in a state M of extreme indignation, he was persuaded by me to hold his hand, restrain his people from counter raids and keep his delegates awaiting full explanat- -ions at Busrah. inquiries by a British Officer have now been extended! over three weeks, and have fully proved the deliberate and destructive invasion cf Iraq territory while the conference ■ was sitting. Sedondly, the Iraq Government nowa asVs that instead of reprisals the measures laid down by the League of Nations shall be adopted against the offender, namely the cutting oif of supplies• I have strained my influence with Feisal to the i \Hi. If tc the utmoBt in imposing this patient attitude upon him, and ** gravely fear it will not stand the further strain which would be involved by requesting him to order his representatives to continue the conference after the Kejd agression has been proved and before any apology or restitution has been received from Nejd. j Feisla has to think of his reputation with his people and dare not take action which would be represented by the restive assembly now sitting as a complate sacrifice of national honour. Critics of the treaty and agreements in thea aesembly would Inevitably seize on our refusal to bring pressure on the sultan according to the precepts of the League as proof that we shall not carry out our promises of defending Iraq, if in any way inconvenient to us. Thea arguments would be reinforced by the fact that it is notorious that the first move towards cutting off of Nejd supplies would bring Bin Saud to his knees, so that Iraq frontiers could be adequately secured against further trouble without any cost or trouble tc H.M.Government. The mere rumour that orders for the cutting oif of sup lies had. already issued, due t© the expected stealer failing to call at Bahrain some weeks ago, caused alarm throughout Nejd, I beg that the foregoing arguments may be given full weight as in view of them I am constrained tc warn H.M. Government that insistence ©n Iraq 1 s immediately continuing the conference without attempting to obtain restitution may jeopardise the whole position here.

Dated 7th received gth April 1524.. Arrangements are already in train by arrangement with Trevor for a flight to Bahrain after Ramazan. The Ait Officer Commanding has also (-?-) been considering the possibiMty cf a friendly flight to Riyadh and sent a memorandum, on this subject to the Air Ministry by the last air post. The Journey however presents considerable difficulties and certain dangers and should in his opinion on no account be undertaken unless certain that Bin Saud actively welcomes the project and will efficiently carry out all instructions in regaato to warning tribes-, arranging dump and guard near ^Hassa, and if neaessary marking certain places en route as a guide for tne aeroplanes (?). If the project is forced on the Sultan, the Air Officer Comiiianding would be most unwilling to proceed with it, as Bin Saud would probably neglect to iollow such instructions. It appears most unlikely that Bin Saud will .actively welcome such a visit as that proposed by Knox, and even if he did the possibility must be borne in mijid of his making the return journey of the aeroplanes diffiouit, if the\ negotiations fell through. It appears essential therefore that not only a friendly reception but a friendly conclusion of the negotiations must be assured beforehand. If this is assured, the shortest time within which the j^ir Officer (*©amanding can guarantee the completion of tne preparations would be theee weeks after tne establishment of the flight at Bahrain, or say six weeks after the receipt of intimation of Bin Saud's consent.

It was somewhere about this stage of the proceedings that AH Khulqi Pasha made the remarkable statement that he could assure me that Ibn Sa f ud would be head in two months.' On Major More asking him whether he had heard the reports of the American Doctor B mes who has recently reached Bahrain, JLi Khulqi Pasha replied that he did not refer to the phyileal death of Ibn Ba*ud. He was speaking metaphorically and meant th- t,in 2 months, Ibn St^ud «ould be politic lly dead, When the rejoinder was made that .assuming that he was right in this bold prophecy, it was a matter of comparative indifference wh t the envoys might agree to in the matter oi the Wadi Sirh^n,for,in the event of Ibn Sa'ud's political death, the Shammar under Bin Hashidzs i -2- would infallibly re-occupy Hail and Wadi Sirh.n would come of itself hack to Trans Jordania. he said that the possession of Jauf would probably bring Ibn Sa'ud to life again. 2. As soon as Ali Khulc i ViaH f j , .

If the Trans-Jordanian envoys left with matters at a deadlock, the Hajd envoys would probably leave also and there would be a complete breakdown and it occurred to me that they could prolong matters sufficiently by telegraphing the exact state of affairs, as disclosed by these two Qonference meetings, to the Amir Abdulla and asking for his orders, pointing out that it was obvious that something of the Wadi Sirhan would have to be given up. They agreed to do this. 3. I called In the Majd delegates and asked the Trans Jordanian delegates in their turn to withdraw which they did. ihe Hajd delegates then came forward with the most sensible proposal,emanating from either side,that I have heard since the uonierence 'began. Ihey said that they would 'be prepared to submit the question of the possession of the whole of the Wadi Sirhan to a plebiscite provided that the King of Hedjaz consented to a similar plebiscite for Khurma and Turaba. The question of Khaibar and Taimah was raised and, as already telegraphically reported, the Hajd delegates gave me to understand that,if the plebiscite gave them Kaf, they would be prepared also to put Khaibar and Taimah to the decision of a plebiscite but it was agreed that it would not be advisable to raise this question at the present juncture. 4* The Trans Jordanian envoys were then called in and the Conference resumed.

The President of the Hajd Delegation asked the ~ resident if he had his permission to reply.

The t ^ranB-Jordanian delegates said that they could not ag-re^ ^ aid the following written statement before the Conference;- ' e hare already proved in fh« in the prenouB meetings of the Conference that Jauf Sakaka and Wadi . o . ^aai Sirhan are part of Syria separated fron. Hajd by the sandy lafud than which no other suitable boundary exists between Trans-Jordania.which is a part of £yria,and Najd. The Hajd Delegation.however.maintained that they could not giye up this district because it is on their line of communication with Bamscus. We,in order to come to peace, then suggested that the discussion should be coniined to this line of communications or in other words to Jauf and SaJcalca alone, which should be formed into an independant state recognised as such by both parties. The Wajd delegation however would not agree. J'r.President .then suggested three ways of settling the case, (l (1) that V*adi Sirhan 'be divided between the two partieso (2) that a plebiscite be held^or (0) that Jauf and Wadi Sirhan be formed into a stale under Ibn Sha*lan. ^ou asited us to communicate those suggestions to our Government . You further have told us at the Session of 26th at the ^arch 1924/full Conference that the llajd Delegation would agree to a plebiscite in Jauf # Sakak® and Wadi Sirhan provided a pclbiscite be also held in Kharmah and Turabah also.

D. e the lint of conmunication between gypt, Palestine,Trans Jordania and f Iraq passes through the territory of Trans Jordania Wadi Sirhan,and as the Government of Iran© Jordania is primarily responsible for those communications they should have the supervision of this line. E. We will agree to those terms on the condition that the principalities of the Hashid family and of the • Aidh family in 1 /sir be reestablished and that Hajd evacuate a 1 Hijaz territory in the interests of peace in rabia. The Hajd Delegation refused this suggestion.

President:- What do you Hajd delegates say to this suggestion? Hajd Delegates: We will not agree to it. President: 1 suggest that we make a temporary 'boundary and form a neatral zone between the two states. This is of my own suggestion and not that of my Government# Ihe 'boundaries of this neutral zone to be from Jabal 'Anaizah to J.af and from Jabal '^naizah to Jauf. #rom Kaf to the hill twenty five miles east of Wadi ar-Ratein which is a Railway station^ on the Hijaz line,and from this point the line runs parallel to the railway line at a distance of twenty five miles from Madain Salih i.e. up to Jabal Sirhan Sar'an and Bir al Julaimat from where it runs north east up to the Hafud 18 miles of Taimah,then to Batrah and then follows the Uafud up to Ta 1 us an- Ha'jah and then to Jauf. This to be a neutral zone for a period of six months during which period neither of the two Governments of Hajd and Trans Jordania will be responsible for what takes place in it between the tribes living there,and the Rulers of both Hajd and Tr.ans- Jordania undertake not to send troops or raiders to this neutral zone nor to help those who wish to raid from amongst their tribes,and a warning to be issued that it is dangerous to enter it.

The trans-Jordanian enyoys then put up a long statement in ^dfiich after a review of the situation they put forward the following proposal Jauf,Sakaka and Wadi Sirhan should be a neutral territory,which both parties will recognise on condition that the natural boundaries of Syria shall also be respected and our limits shall be from the south as we formally notified them to be i.e,our boundary shall run from Madain Salih and shall pass to the east of Taimah and shall leave to us Walad Sulaiman and shall end at Jabal Raf and shall leave Jauf and Sakaka freej;then it shall begin again at Jabal Dhyial which is to the north of Sakaka and shall end up in Jabal Anaizaha Because the lines of communications between ®gypt and Palestine and Trans - Jordania and Iraq pass through the territory of Trans Jordania and the Wadi Sirhan and as the Government of TransJordania is primarily responsible for the safety of such communications,it is necessary that it shoul( have b , right to control this road# We agree to the conditions laid■ fp ; f m f 7 i.!) ~2- •iown above on condition that the family of lil Ras &gt;iid return to their old dominione and authority and that the family of Ayidh holds rule in \sir and that the Government of Najd vacates all lands 'belonging to the Government of Hedjaz, Bejecteu hy ' jd. -he Haj^d delegates unanimously refused this proposal. h e 52 iid nm itr f In - y! ^ i ,11, f tt - r w pi r rj, rnp *1 The President then put forward his proposal j . lor a peaceful solution contained in his telegram No. 101 dated dated the oOth (5f March.

He therefore asked for their views and found they were quite unable to assent to this. finally the President put before both parties the following temporary solution that a boundary line should be drawn from Jaba] Anaizah to Kaf and from Kaf to a point 25 miles to the east of Wadi Retheim a station on the Hedjaz Railway from there the line to follow the railway at 25 miles distant to the east to a point 25 miles east of Madain Salih.

Prior to this the Government of 'Iraq had asked the Sultanate of Najd through the High Commissioner to expel Hamud as-Suwait,Shaikh of the Dhaflr^and Shirbab,Shaikh of the Badur, and the Sultanate of Najd had complied with their request, merely to maintain friendly relations and avoid misunderstandings, but the Government of 'Iraq had forgotten this.'

The object ©f the conference with regard to the Kejd- -Trans-Jordania frontier is to arrive at a direct agreem«nt between the rulers concerned on outstanding questions. You should therefore make further effort to secure definition by agreement of the frontier following thei lines of that in my predecessor's telegram of November gth 1923. Failing this you should attempt to seaure from the parties concernea a reciprocal guarantee that they will not extend their own influence or interfere in territory at a specified distance on each side of this frontier or of some ether agreed line. H.M.Crevernment can however in no circumstances accept responsibility for neutral territory thus defined, which will correspond to that on the Nejd-Iraq frontier. Whether the Nuri Shaalan should or should not exercise power in the liadi Sirhan is a matter® of no concern to H .M, Government, whose interests will be bounaed in these parts by the frontier of Trana-Jordania wherever this may ultimately be fixed. If this alternative materialises, the question ®f latitude 32 will not arise, since neutral territory will presumabljfjc touch or extend t® the intersection of latitude 32 with longitude 39, already fixed as the point on the Nejd-Iraq frontier, and will thus complete the northern frontier of fieja. If you cannot succedO. in ootaining either alternative solutions suggested above, you may in the last resort proceed with Bin Baud's suggestion of direct agreemaat between (-?-) as manaatory and the Sultan of Nejd, fixing Ne^a-Trans-Joraan frontier from tfte intersection ef 32 and 39 on the general lines laid dovra in ny predecessor's telegram of November 8th.

The Trans-Jordania envoy has orougnt me (-?-) reply of Amir Abdullah electing buffer state for Wadi girhan under Nuri Shalan, subject to agreement between Kejd and Hedjaz. (? In hope of) securing agreement I recomrrend that the nard of the ruler be suppressed for the time being and that the Trans-Jordan proposal comes before the conference in the following form: establishment of independent buffer state of the whole of the Kadi Sirhan from and including Kaf and Jauf, whose independence Nejd and Trans-J6rdania agree to respect. Both sides agree not to send within its limits troops or officials and reserve grazing rights for their tribes according to past custom free fcem Zikat; ( - ?~) freedom from transit dues for passing trading caravans of both parties. When this proposal comes before the conference, the Nejdis will probably raise the question of ruler. I suggest that Trans-Jordania reply that they are content to leave it to a plebiscite provided that both Amir Abdullah and the Sultan of Nejd are by mutual agreement excluded from the choice of the plebiscite, as also notorious influential follower of either party. In conclusion the conference will sit again on Wednesday , next and wo shall be glad to reoeivei reply before the meeting as to Abdullah^ views. Knox.v // 61/14 and 61/15. Telegram P.

The Akhwan carped on the spot the next day, and the following morning saw thrae aeroplanes, hid in fear and eventually retreated to safety, sent a vessenger to the Sultan reporting the engagement and asking orders whether they should proceed to Jauf. I asked the Sheikh what he thought Bin paud or the Akhwan imagined they gained by these wild adventures. He said 'fame, and to convince the Bedouin that Bin gaud was not played out'. Secondly, the Trans-Jordania delegates have now applied for permission to leave Kuwait on the grounds lhax the Nejd raid on Iraq and further Mejd concentrations threatening danger to It is now no longer pcasible to doubt the Sultan's complicity in the raid or that the raid occurred.

The whole queetion of the defence of Iraq against Bedouin raids has been carefully considered, and although we are prepared to take all action possible within Iraq borders, raids will continue unless every effort is made to secure reciprocal anti-raiding agreement. The argument that an important raid cannot take place without the cognizance of the suzerain chief is a two-edged one and might equally be applied to the Shamir.ar and other raids for which Feisal disclaims responsibility. I am not prepared to send protests to Bin saud at the moment when hie representatives are at Kuwait for the purpose of arriving at an agreement to (Tend) these raids, unless Iraq also sends representatives and undertakes to refrain during the conferenc© from retaliatory measure b . H.B.Government do not agree that the recent raid is adequate reason for suspending negotiations, {?

I have since heard from two independent sources that Bin Saud has written to the Sheikh of Kuwait asking for a loan of R£ % 75*POO. I have not yet heard this from the Sheikh, but shall no doubt learn it if I challenge him. It seems to be extremely significant Ikat and shows that the Sultan is in great straits, and I consider it important, if this suits the policy of H.M.Government, to save rather than destroy him. I propose one possible course that I think may ♦ A &gt; I save the situation, and that is to arrange for a visit to Riyadh by air and allow me to offer the c-ultan his choice between peace and war. I think I could do this within 12 days from receipt of approval. T could propose to him purely desert frontier, abandoning Jauf, Khurmah, Turaba, Khaibar and Taimah and retaining Hail and Wadi Dawasir and the present Iraq-Nejd frontier. Subject to the above, the frontier to be fixed by the British Government and accepted by Bin gaud on general 4 understanding of half distance betwwen oases.

Complete internal independence within his reorganised^ boundalies and complete dependence on H.M.Government for all foreign affairs.

If raiding losses come up for discussion, I propose a clean slate and all losses written off on all sides, i| . and an undertaking on our part to do what is possible by4 vtry vaguest but some notion of their nature can be gleaned from the paragraph 2 already cited above.

It was also stated in the same cl.use that eleven men, inhabitants of Jauf.were ***** shot in the market place of ' Wn without having committed any offence. To this 1 r.ply that the men in question were highway robbers who at thai time attacked the workmen of the Railway line between qasr as-Larqa and al -felraq killing six men and stripped them of their clothes and. in accordance with the orders of the Government, the troops at the salt villages followed them up and arrested them and sent them to ' ,mman where their crime was proved in court and they were punished in accordance with the law. It was stated that the son of ' Abtan bin Jazi of the Huwaitat attacked a carvan etc but the name of the son of 'Abtan 16 not given and 1 do not agree that the flani Sakhr attacked Ibn Kharidah' s .aravan. It is a peculiar thing that the delegates ol Hajd at one time claim that part of the Huwaitat are under them and at another complain of Huwaitat attacks on Hajd subjects. -he village, attacked by the Ikhwan near Ummal-'/iaad and the incident took place on the 1st Septemblr 1 S22 and the people who attached were of Sajir headed by Ibn Muhaiya of the 'Utaibah and about two months later Ibn Rubai'an and his followers of the Sahimah refugees attacked the Bani .tiyah at the Pilgrim station and plundered their donxeys fwo months ago Ud i'awaich and his followers attacked the Jugara tribe. At on. time the Hajd delegates say that the iugara are their subjects another they say that they attacked them.-2- forced', and,when attcmpte were made to define the term, fab lit Beg, the Iraq envoy, ineieted on the insertion of a clauee to the si fect that tribesmen obeying a call of mobilisation must take away their ia.mllic.ti, On this resulted hopelete disagreement.Snbih Ssg, could not agree that '' half a loaf was better th n no bread' and seemed to prefer that no agreement should be arrived at on the point. ihe iejd delegates had agreed to a form drawn up by Iraq envoys to the effect: that neither party shall raise tribes within the other's terri.ories and that, if tribesmen agreed to obey a call to arms on the other side of the territory,they should leave that territory quietly and in a private fashion (and should take away their wives and families)and should do nothing on the way that would indicate that they were on a warlike expedition'. I'hey agreed to this subject to the omission of the clause ' they thould leave with their wives and their families',but.when they insisted on the taaission of this clauee, the Iraq envoy refused to aign. ^Ith regard to point 6 a formula was easily arrived at which both parties agreed to sign. 'ith regard to point 7, the Iraq envoy said that this point was raised by them originally but they were no longer anxious for it and would withdraw their demand. On this, the ^resident ol the Mejd delegation said they regarded this as a vital point and that no agreement was possible at all unless an extradition agreement formed part of the proceedings. He said that the whole trouble between the two parties was the queetion 01 tlie retarnof mutinous tribesmen and that he was bsolut ly bound by his instructions and could agree to nothing nor sign any documents,unless thie point was conceded. Iraq wae at liberty to withdraw their demand but. if they did bo, he should raise it on his own account. Ihe Mejd d legate reiterated that It was quit Impossible for them to agree to the return of refugee tribesmen but suggested that this point should be deferredumil the consideration ol the Hej ' demands# , for ula was easily found for point B which both agreed that they will be willing to sign. Over point 9 the same difficulty recurr d. In itself point 9 was unobjectionable but,when it case to the question of what fihould be done with regard to the; return of tribtemen who surreptitiously crossed the frontier without obtaining paeees from their inspector ol boundariesd insisted on the return of them to ihtir own territory and iraq said that it could not in no way agree o do so* It here appeared to the president th t there was a suitable opportunity for complying with the request made by th.

They were informed that the return of tht Chammar of Hijd t or even heir expulsion,was impossible unless they proceeded to commit further offences,in regard to which the Iraq envoy explained the precautions that have been taken in Iraq to prev- nt the recurrence of offences by them. As regards point 2,it was explained that iraq had agreed to be bound by the evidence of Sir Vercy Cox as to whether he had undert ken that all plunder before the Ujair agreement should be forgotten, if Sir Percy Cox declared the t he had given such an undertaking, the iraq Government would respect it and would agree to withdraw their claim.

Sir, • ii.h reference to what you eaid at to-day'e sveeion, viz that either Paiyid Ham*ah or 'Abdullah ffendi would hare to take a letter from you to His Highnoee the uitan.we have the .aonoui tc iniom you that the N .jd Delegation have set and diecuseed this proposal carefully.and have decided to requeet you not to iiapose this difficult matter upon them,as we know that it would open a wide field for misunderstanding,ae if it had been Hie Highness the &amp;ultan who had stood in the way of the settlement of the dispute bet*ean S Jd and 'Iraq. In point of fact however, it wae the writers, the Majd Dtlegation who, having been told to show a conciliatory spirit by His Highness the - ultan, have shown the utmost literal!ty in accept! g the majority of the proposals of the 'Iraq Delegation whereas our proposals have not met with any acceptance at all from the 'Iraq clega ion. We therefore think that it is impossible for any one of us to accept the responsibility of going to the Sultaa alone, especially when we consider thst we can see no sign that they are coming round to our view regarding what is the real essence of cur claims, and is of vital Importance t Hajd, viz.the question of the iribes and the return of fermenters of trouble and criminals from mongst them.In addition to this the Najd Delegates have one political principle iiut in demanding the return of rebels and criminals of their tribes aiUx as has alread 0 een put forward,and they cannot go against their political principles by carrying a proposal which would leave the door open for the enticing away of Sajd tribes as jhat is th reason hy ther is not peace and security, fee therefore request that you will cither send your letter by a messe ,gcr .ho is not a ember of the I»jd-2- Delegation, or allow the whole Delegation to go for a given period aL you were aeked to do in the joint letter submitted to you by the two Delegations on tht 19th January 1924.

Government of He.jaz and Hamzah Gauth i'he newspaper M Alahran' published that some weeks ago a certain man named Shaikh Hamzah Gauth arrived at Cairo and lived with his son in the Continental Hotal and said that he was a representative of Ibn Hashid, that he had come on duty on behalf of his lord, that his lord was fighting Ibn Saud and that he was returning to his town via Syria* He proceeded to Beyrout and its newspapers published similar statements as this about him, but the M A1 Qebleh' jyj newspapers whichjthe official paper of the He.jaz Government was received and there was an official communique on its heading as follows:- i'he Government notify to all their officials on the northern coasts and beyond it that Hamzah Gauth on© of the inhabitants of Medinah and one of the servants of the house.of i Saiyed Hashem who used to lead the pilgrims while making pilgrimage; escaped from the tl^n as he was to be punished for his being an accomplice in the theft of (deposits of the holy room). And accordingly the Government becameaware of his arrival in Egypt and on summoning him for trial in that offence which blacken the face of the sun he took refuge with the authorities of the French Government and then he was sent to Damascus. Accordingly and in view of the strict orders issued in connection with his arrest (but it is incumbent upon evary-Mohamiaedan to murder him for his offence in transgressing the honour of the holy room as was mentioned) this general notice was published.

If th.

Xhe President as^ed the ^resident ©1 K jd Delegation what ha suggested regarding the plunder which ht said had been uOcen from 1 Iraq tribe© viz in the w^.y of n arbitration Committee rrfeident of the * Ir-a X^elep: • tion . We must first of all agre^ whether this arbitration Committee is to consider cases which occurred ft t the ^Ucair Conference only or from the time when the Ar;.b Government of 'Iraq wae set up. -'resident: Yes. Dr • Abdul 1 h, H. .jd Delegate : - ihis case shows clearly hov? h rmful it is for the Najd *--ii -xsm -T w0 remain in 1 Iraq and the. r .-.ids - ; .re likely to continue nd the trouble increase. i s he reasons why the Arbitr tion Committee should only deal with plunder taken after the 'Uqair Conference are:- 11) -he Iraq Severn eat h ve not before el imed any { i.e. they have not done so since the ^Oqair Conference) (2) 11 ud the Iraq ioVtrnment intended to cl am restitution ox plunder t^ken from their territory before the 1 Uqair Conference, they would not h ve returned the plunder taken srom ®ajd aft-.r that d .te. (3) Before the signing of tht Protocol at the 'U% ir -onferenoo the frontier between the two State® was not fixed and it * s not known whose euojecte oert in iritet were.conaequtnlly the Ji,.jd Government c.-.nnot accept responsibility for plunder t - en before thei, d i te?&lt;= the question of extr dl iion,*wh t we are t Iking about now is raiding by 'Iraq tribes* into 1 Jd nd M ij d tribe© into 1 Iraq President of the * Iraq Delegation:- i undertake now that the Iraq Government will punish thoee who raid H. jd. Will the n jd tion give a similar undertaking ? Bajd Belegates Xee, the Uttjd dovernrntnt will punieh those who rid 'Iraq. President Xh^n we can draft a cl use to that effect. All; Sfes. 'ihe following cleuee wa» then dr fted Kach of the two Governments of «ajd and 'Iraq agrees that raiding by their tricee into the territory of tht oih^r Government is a crime which they will punish very severely nd that the haikh of the tribe will bt held responsiblt. 12) In addition to what h&amp;e been agreed upon in the previous clause both Governments will to the bast of their ability return the plunder and in the evejn of their being unable to do so. they will pay compensation to the value of the plunder. President :• us now turn to the third point. President of the Hajd Beleg- tion. I request that this be left till tomorrow, to enable ue to discuss the proposal for the appointment of the Agents. If we are not able to satisfy ourselv s on this point we must reler au.

The * Iraq delegates:- Xhat it- -.ill right, d Belegates :- We sh 11 thimc bout it. ^he eixlh point was accepted subject to a decision ; out the seventh. Regarding the seventh point as the President wae telegraphing to London bout the question of whether r ids ehould be considered a Political or non-political offence,it wag. decided to await a re; Xy. Regarding the ngnth: point, it wae greed ih t 'h-ikht ?4io hold n official poEition or have fl ge and b nnere to chow that they are comm nderr to an rmed force, ehiill not expose their b dgee of office or 11 gs after crossing the frontier into the othtr St ;es territory for ha purpose of gr zing. Xhc. Eeseion then adjourned till 2 on Friday 21st vcembv.r 1925.I therefore invite the attention of members of the Conference to ? causes of dispute the different (armed forces; which may arise at any time between the tribes and cause troubles and dangers in Arabia. I am ready, in the name of the 'Irans-Jordania Government, to fix the boundary between ^rans -sordania and ^ajd in accordance with the agreements and old boundaries and with the treaty made by the Hajd overnment with His Majesty's Government on 18th July 1916; if Hajd leaves Jauf and Sakaka and their dependancics and returns them to Ibn Shavian, I agree that there may be a separate Amira;t to act as a buffer between Hajd and Irans-Jordania for the future and provided the lines of future communication between -r ns-wordania and 'Iraq be left in our hands, 2. Should we come to an agreesv nt, the Xr-ms-Jordania Govern •mtnt art- ready to send an agent to Majd and to accept an ge t of fajd in Xr.ns-Jordania, to look into questions affecing the tribes of both parties. 5. About •.ighteen months ago, although ^-jd and irand-»Tordania were at peact, the Hajd Government sent an rmad forct into r .ns-Jord nia, who suddenly attacked a village near Amman and killed about thirty inhabitants without cause an« I demand blood money for these innocent lives in accordance with tribal custom. 4. That both Governments agree to prevent raiding, find, in the event of a r id taking place, the Government of the State of which the raiders are subject shall undertake \o r turn the plunder,or pay lull compensation for it, and to pay blood money for any killed. 5. The tribes of both parties to be prohibited from crossing the frontier in large parties or armed bands and, should there be any need for a person,or party of not more than ten persons, to cross with or without arms, they should carry a pass from their iovernm.nt,duly endorsed by the Agent of the Government whose territory they are entering. a larger p^rty than this not to be allowed except by agreement between the tvvo Governm nts. 6. Neither Jovernmen to correspond with the tribes of the other Governm nt direct and without ti at Governme t's knowl dge7 V -5- except In the cage of private and personal letters . ?. ihe political refugees who take shelter in either state cannot be extradited.

We gather from the above mentioned letter that you contemplate some change in our official position which you had approved and accepted f and consequently do not consider it seemly for us to remain in Kuwait when our official position is in doubt 0 We have therefore decided to leave by the next steamer, the more so as the other delegations have all left and there is no liklihood of their return for a con siderable period.

The information in my telegram No.57 does not U4-' modify the opinion expressed in my telegram No,55. Ibn Sa'ud has not said that he villi not send a representative to 'balance the Amir Zaid but my own opinion is that j Bin Sa f ud is so Jealous of his own entourage that considerable persuasion will be necessary to induce him to comply( Please see my D.O. written the day before yesterday). You will also get by this mail my telegram Ho.59 of the 30th and if I can I will draft and enclose to you with this another telegram which promises interesting developments. It look as if it was possible that Government had, in consequence of my various telegrams, decided to apply considerable pressure to Bin Sa'ud to produce in him a reasonable frame of mind and in that cas^ some one must go to Ujair. I am better again and think that,if I have the 4r6euiieh placed at my disposal and take with me Mylrea as guest and medical adviser I could pull off the Ujair interview alright and I should like to do so .

No.12/211. pated ^th February 192^. I have just received by post copies of Knox T s telegrams No.39 ana draft of No*61, which was presumably despatched* To take the last first, Knox is of course under the complete misapprehension that the stoppage of booking of passeagers and cargo to Bahrain is a measure taken by Government; it is simply a vagary of the B.I.Steamship Coy. who have taken unnecessary alarm at a slight outbreak of plague in Bahrain. I am endeavouring to get the Company to change their order, which iszi unprecedented and likely to cause great inconvenience to the public of Bahrain, not to mention raising prices. This being so, it disposes, I think, of most of telegram No.61, which is based on this incorrect assumption. I strongly deprecate the idea of my going to see Bin Saud about conference questions firstly because I am not fully au fait with them, and secondly because my idea of dealing with Bin Saud in this regard was to object to the delegates he nominated at the start. I did actually object to Mullah Hafiz and I should have objected to the President, Hamzah al Grhauth, as soon as I heard who he was. I do not consider it desirable to go and remonstrate with Bin Sand for sending unsuitable representatives at tbis stage, and I am convinced tbat nothing would persuade bin to come bimself, short of which I doubt if any representative would have amy real, powers delfgated. Further, I very much doubt whether Bin Saud has the power, if he has the will (which is also open to doubt), to restrain his tribesmen from encroaching on Hedjaz or other neighbouring states, so that if he were11. persuaded to give an undertaking to this effeot, it would, in myxi opinion be valueless. I venture therefore to express the hope that if H.M. Governiaent consider that it is advisable for someone to meet Bin Saud in reference to the conference, that person should be Colonel Xnox, if he is well enough, or if he is not, the conference should be adjourned sine die on account of the illness of the President, as suggested in Knox's telegram No.59 clause (b)* Long bffore next cold weather we shall get particulars of the real state of Bin Saudts health, and if he is well, a meeting between him and my successor would in any case be desirable. I may add that the time of the 'Lawrence' is very well booked: up until the end oA March. As she is a new ship and the channel to Ojair is not properly charted, it is unlikely that the Captain would take her there in any case. On Cox's two last visits to OJodLr he had to go from Bahrain to Ojair by launch. Doubtless however one of H.M.Ships could take Knox to Bahrain, but tofortuneately the steam launch there is out of action at present. In the circumstances, I trust that it will not be necessayy to have any meeting with Bin Saud in connection with the conference. A copy of the above is being sent to Knox by post. This refers to Knox's telegram No. 55. Trevor. Copy with compliments to Lieut. Colonel S.G.Knox C.S.I.,C.I.E. on special duty, Kuwait for information.61/15. Telegram P. From Knox, Kuwait.

Resident Persian (lulf informs me that stoppage of Bahrain shipments from Bombay is only mistake of steamer^ Agents. (2) If answer to (t) is in the affirmative, pressure will lead to little, unless someone sees him and convinces him that he must yield to necessity and desert boundary. (3) Reply seems required to Sultan's message conveyed in my telegram No: 57 dated 28th; January. I suggest that it should take form that we regard Khurma,Turaba and Khaibar as essential portions of Hedjaz territory and, if Sultan will not leave Hedjaz alone , we shall deprive him of Jauf and whole of Wadi Sirhan, whereas mandatory state^we shall make such arrangements as seem suitable to us. He should also be told that King Hussain has at least as much right to interest himself in Asir affairs as Sultan of Nejd,feoth being border states, and that in no circumstances can British Government admit interest of Sultan of Nejd in Kunfidhah on the opposite side of Asir from Nejd boundary ,more especially as Nejd is not a maritime state expept for A1 Ahsa coast.% ui I 'W|: (a) (4) Reply seems require, to my telegram No:64 dated 3rd : February . '5) Also to question whether Sultan should he pressed to send suitable envoy to Balance Zald. Although Nejd envoys were at once acquainted with contents of JeKuealem telegram No; 31 dated a3nd: January, Sultan has not yet been officially informed, much less asked to send suitable envoy. Lastly, I auggeet that, if and when Conference meets, I be authorised to say that 13th: March has been fixed as time limit for discussions and that agreement must be reached by thai subject to ratification . There can be no further references and previous experience suggests that it wou^d be well if all dele gates' instructions contain^ciauae directing th«m to record measure of agreement reached without continually saying that, unless certain vital points are conceded, they can sign nothing. This specially refers to Najd. I select 13th: March as suitable mail day, 27th : is also possible . If visit to A1 Ahsa is not considered advisable , I could write to Sultan on above lines , provided approval reached ae by 10th: February .No. 38-S. u* CONFIDENTIAL.

LJ. bu 1 (L H- k - —Ma^or, Political Agent, Kuwait,THE T£gTH SE3SI0H 0? THE . 9-5 u a.m. on Friday the 18th Janury 1924. 1 he President: Iraq has agreed to leave out the clause bout an agreement between fiajd and Hijaz being a sine qua non for any agreement between Iraq and N a jd, so let us run through the Iraq demands ag.,in point by point. (a) 'aoh of the two contracting Governments agree that it is a crime which should be severely punished for their tribes living within their territory to raid into the territory of the other Government,and that the chief of the tribe concerned shall be held responsible, (b) A special tribunal shall be constituted periodically to take evidence regarding plunder and to ..ssess claims; the tribunal to consist of (l) an 'Iraq tribal representa •4 -tire nominated by 'Iraq and accepted by Kajd (2) A iiajd tribal representative nominated by Hajd and accepted oy ' J-raq and (3) a third person nominated ad hoc for each claiji by the claimant from tiu. tribes of the defendant party. The decision of the majority to be final. On proof of raiding and damage sustained being given before this tribunal and accepted by it, the Governments of Iraq and 'ajd, each in regard to their own tribes,undertake to enforce the restitution of property in accordance with tribal custom and to suitably punish the offenderte in accordance with clause (a) above. Clause 3 4 were drafted as follows: (A) Neither H.M.the King of Iraq nor H.a. the Sultan of He jd,nor their respective Governments shall correspond on officiil or political matters with the chiefs, Shaikhs and officials of the other Government. (■'JNeither H.M. the King of Iraq nor the S itan of i-ajd nor their respective Governments shall correspond-2- with those of their trihes who now or at a future date arc living in th territory of the other Government except through the Inspector of boundaries referred to in clause 9. A long discussion took place on the fifth Point and in spite of a preliminary agreement a dead lock was reached over the question of the families of those answering a call to arms remaining in the other Government's territory. Point 6 was agreed to and drafted as follows -- The lorces of neither 1 Iraq nor Najd shall pursue offenders across the frontier except by mutual agreement Point 7 - Non-political offenders. Ihe Iraq envoy proposed that, as no agreement had been arrived at,and as the point was one which his Government had put forward, the proposal for an agreement fcr the extradi -tion of non-political offenders should be dropped at present. Saiyid Hamzah: If 'Iraq withdraws this demand, we will put it forward as one of ours. Point 8.was agreed to as Shaikhs having official positions or having flags or other badges as commanders of armed forces will not expose or display such flags and badges when they wish to cross he frontier into the territory of the other Government. Point 9. S aiyi d Kamzah;- As the extradition proposal has been withdrawn I suggest that the 1 st sentence of para (b) of this clause be cut out too i.e.the words *w tu the exception of tribes or individuals ?/ho are political offenders'. Sabih Beg. 'Well, I propose that the whole of (b), hich was originally proposed by the Uajd Delegation, and retain (a) alone,or keep the whole thing without cutting out anything.1 -o- As no agreement waB arrived at the point was left pending, ■^reeident let us consider the Najd demands. (l) The return to &amp;ajd of the Najd Shammar on * Iraq Sahih Beg: The Government of 'Iraq are prepared to give an official written guarantee that if the application of the procedure mentioned above does not prevent the Shammar from raiding into Hajd territory , they will take steps to expel individual Shammar raiders from Iraq, hut they will not return ihem to l^ajd. 1 Abdullah iffendi It ie well known that the Wajd Shammar are a separate unit of the tribes subject to ^ajd^and so if any part of it are guilty of raiding,all of them should be held responsible. It will not meet the case to expel individual raiders. We do not consider that the raids perpetrated by Hajd .ribes on 'Iraq ( of which we have given a list showing the plunder taken) were the work of individual tribesmen but of the tribes. Sabih Beg :- (l) What I have- said is all that the Government of Ira can undertake to do: J2)It is not fair to punish the innocent with the guilty We will expel actual raiders but not whole tribe. (o; The list you submitted contain many names of different tribes other than Hajd, Sh^mmar, Besides the Shammar who have raided into Hajd since 'Abdullah Effendi came to Baghdad, were from Syrian territory, not from 'Iraq. Point 2. Hestitution for plunder taken from Hajd subjects after the t Uqair Conference. 1 Iraq Delegate:- ihe Hajd D legates state that Sir Percy Cox promised-4- h) that the claims prior to the 1 Uqair Conference would be cancelled. If it proved that he did makt Buch a promibe the f Iraci Oovernmen 1 - will abide by it and will arrange for the return of all plunder taken after the Conference( the majority of which has already bt en returned).If on the other hand it be proved that Sir Percy Cox made no tmch promise the 1 Iraq Government insists that the date of exchanging articles plundered to be counted from the coronation of His Majesty the ^ing of Iraq. Reg rdinr Joints ^ &lt;1 4 of the K^jd Demands which deal with the expulsion of tribes, the Iraq Governmcint cannot accept the principle f expulsion ol tribesmen taking r^fu e in f Iraq ae it would lead to complications on the other frontiers cf f Iraq where similar conditions prevail,viz.with Dyria,iurkey # and Persia. President * How I shall read you a telegram from the Secretary ol tale lor Colonies o . . the Hi^;h Commission r for ^raq:- ( reads Colonial office telegram No.25 of 14th January 1924). 'Iraq delegate:- although I have received no instructions regarding this, yet I agree to it. Saiyid Hamzah:- I should likv. to think it over till to orrow. 'Iraq delegate:- As regards the last point,about Ibn Mijlad, he is an 1 Iraq subject but should he and his tribe wish to become Bajd subjects they must go to ^ajd and not return to 'Iraq. Baiyid Hamzah;- I request that the meeting be adjourned till tomorrow, and it was so adjourned xxl± for A.M. on Saturday the 19th January 1924.■ THi. BLEVl- T SESSION OP TH: COHPSllEHC®. ■laiji P)M The Conference met at 9 :30 a.m.on the 19th January 1924. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. Sahin Beg addressing the President I request you to aek the Hajd Delegation whether they agree to the proposal of the Secretary of State for the Uolonies with regard to the refugee tribes and will be satisfied with guarantees being taken; and if they do not agree to this as there are other points on which we have not agreed up to the present whether they are willing to sign the points on which we have so far agreed as a Fourth Protocol to the Mohammerah Convention^ President:- I wish first of all to point out to both Delegations that we should not prolong this Conference needlessly. We have already been at work for a long time without coming to any final settlement. I therefore suggest that you sign as a protocol the points which have been agreed upon and slso if you like that you record those points on which it has been impossible to come an agreement, each party commenting on these and clearly stating their importance in the eyes of no their (Government. His Majesty's Government have/intention of urging you to sign anything against your will - I have referred the question of arbitration and received the following telegram in reply. (Heads Colonial Office telegram Ho.14 of 8th January X 4^ #£# 4 / 9 Sabih Beg : - The Government of Iraq agrees that His Majesty's Cfovernment should arbitrate on those points upon which we have not been able to come to an agreement and that their decision be final. 1 Abdullah fiendi,(Majd delegate)X, -2- itie importa t point from our point of view Is the question of the trlbee, and we are not authorised to el n any agree-ent or protocol unleee we settle the question of the rtlugee tribes in a suitable manner. As to whether we will accept the proposal of His Majesty's GoTernment contained in the telegram which was read at the last meeting that they should arbitrate on those points on which we cannot agree.I can only say that «• cannot answer this ourselves, but must refer the matter to His highness the cultan by telegram and awn.it his reply, XX ±K. Saluh Beg:- It is clear now that the Delegates of His Highness the Sultan of Kajd are not empowered to settle Important points without constantly referring to His Hlghneaa the Bjiltan of Majd and as 1 cannot live at Kuwait for several months to allow the Bajd Delegates to correspond with their Sultan as they like, 1 think the only thing to do is to adjourn the Conference for a considerable period to enable the Hajd Delegates, or some of them, to go to H ajd and put fi . rward to oheir ultan all the points and correspond with the British Government. Both Delegations were in favour of a lengthy adjournm nt and it was decided to write a joint letter to the lori d Ion K 0 pe5od! 0nferLn0e aeking hlm t0 the Conference. he meeting was then adjour ed till £-3C a.m.on the 2 let.

In this connection I would point out to you that tht; situation is extremely delicate at present and to go at present would be to accept a very grave responsibility. It is our duty to wait and see what the Government of Hijaz does a out sending an envoy and also what new instructions are issued by Xr ms-Jordania. I want to write a letter to Hi&amp; Highness the Buitan of .N jd and inlorm him what the Government of Iraq's views really are about the question of the tribes, and I have hopes that His Highness will agree when he sees the proposal of the secret ry of State for the olonies.

Secondly, I have received yesterday Ibn Sfc/ud^a replies to my letters of which translations were forwarded with fiy despatch Ho 38 dated 26tia January. Replies are polits and concilliatory and show no signs of breaking off negotiations. In reply to the ''Iraq letter his attitude i» summed up in last two lines where he says that King Faisal is too exalted to grant a refuge to seditious persons and that 1 Iraq Government should not recognize tribal customs opposed to Justice and civilization. He offers help to restrain and punish tribes. Letter in regard to parallel is more interesting but requires careful translation to appreciate exact meaning. He offers to negotiate direct with Britain as mandatory power for protection of his commerce and abandons claima to North on the understanding that treaty will become inoperative when and if territory passes out of mandate. He has full confidence in Great Britain than whom he Qas no other trust but none in 'Iraq and Trans-Jordania, the latter of whoit he cannot permit to doninats his commerce and vital relations with Egypt and Syria.

Dear Friend, I hare received with gladness your letter dated the 24th of January 1924 which concerns the (iuestions agreed upon and disagreed upon between ourselves and the Governinent of Iraq. I originally agreed to participate in the Arab Conference with great pleasure for I prefer right dealing and peace should endure between me and my neighbours; that e ch party may rest in internal security and to prevent bloodshed which has occurred from time to time without essential cause and I put before my envoys before their journey suitable instructions to this end and I look forward eagerly to the approaching of the time when we shrll all have good neighbourly relations. The essential nutter in my view is the question of the refugee tribes which is vital for $ejd and 1 do not see anything in the proposals which have been placed before me which will serve as a solu.ion to stop this sedition. If this door is open to the tribes,many difficulties face me the least ol which is that I shall not be able in future to punish the wicked per sobs and those who transgress the limits ol the religion ol Islam and the local laws. For every criminal, who commitsthe worst crimes of murder and plunder.will find a safe refuge in Iracj nd I wonder how a civilised Government like the Government oi Iraq agrees that it should become a place of refuge ^ nd a sanctuary for wicked persons and highwaymen. Bow the diiiiculties whic the Government of Iraq h&amp;s put forward are unfounded, for the m tter does no. require permanent military arrangements of watch and ward and the Government of Iraq, by the/S'J mere f^ct of making clear and proclaiming that she will not allow her territories lo be a refuge for criminals,would shut the open door in the face oi the tribes and will put a boundary .nd stop to this sedition which it is to b feared will destroy the friendly relations between the two ountries liejd and Iraq and,if difficulties present themselves in the face of the Iraq Coverm^nt from such action, then I am ready to help the Iraq GoTernment and to share in the matter of punishment as the original treaty of ohammer-h prescribes. A b for the other considerations of honour these are wrong considerations for His Jajesty King Faisal is too high and exalted to provide a refuge for wicked criminals ad the Government of Iraq should be above honouring customs which do not agree with justice.

Dear Friend, I have received your letter Mo.52 of the 24th January concerning the northern 'boundaries. I thank you very much tor the opinions and solicitude especially your personal solicitude but with regard to what the envoys of Mejd have put forward as to the prolongation of the boundaries beyond line parallel 32 to the boundary oi Syria these proposals w; re founded on the supposition that the Government of Trans-Jordan was an independent Government. If your honour had shown these opinions co the envoys on the consideration that these boundar- -ies chiefly concerned the British Government herself,you would have seen that the envoys would have changed their opinions and proposals from those expressed by them, for we have full trust in the British Government and in no other and we are convinced that she will guard her ngagements with scrupulous care. I cannot agree to the junction of Trans Jordan with Iraq for I have no security against the tricks which the authorities of those Governments raise and you have seen their obstinacy in the matter of the return of criminals from which it can be seen that there is th ir deliberate trickery and I think there is no civilised Government that will approve that it should be a refuge for murderers and thieves. Our envoys h ve made pl^in to you the necessity which impels us to the junction of our boundary with Syria and we are unuble to watch the Government of Trans Jordan dominating our trade and our vital interests but,if the objection really comes from the British Government, then I leave to that Government'Mj -2- herself to find a solution to repel uh dangei 1 threatening my country and my tribes now and in the future from i.he junction of the Government of Xrans Jordania wi th ^raq, and to find a road for commerce free and safe which will guard our only trade to Syria and gypt and there shall be no power to the Government of Trans Jordan over it on conait-on that there shall be a signed agreement concerning the northern boundary between myself and the British Government direct and that this agreement shall be cancelled and inoperative if these lands pass out of the British mandate and all this because my heart is satisfied and full of reliance on the British Government and perhaps it would be possible to leave the details in this matter to the tonversa -tdions which will take place between yourself regarded as rex^resentative of the great Government and between the envoys at the time which you consider suit ble for that.

It concerns the Kuwait Conference &amp; is without doubt wruttem by Mulla Hafidh.The remarks therein ouch as 'I am not aware as to what stage the negotiations have reached T etc are doubtless put in with Ti w to averting suspicion from falling on him,but his style is well known here &amp; Shaik Hamad is equally certain that the effort is his. He has long been the news- Agent in the Gulf for this paper. The article in question is intended as a bit of oro Bin Baud propaganda no doubt. I have translated the paragraph which refers to Bahrain only -- It runs as follows - It has been rumoured here that Shaik Hamad bin Sasa and the Consul will bring up the matter of Shalk Hamad's position in Bahrain with a view to his Governorship over Bahrain being recognised by the Arab Grover nine nts and Uajd. but I regard this as a mistaken notion for wkadfe | from what I hear it would not be possible for the Sultan of ITajd to regard the present ^ule r of Bahrain other than a usurper of his ; father's rights,who has ceased to be obedient to him ^ is a destroyer of his/icountry . As regards he consul,although it may ppear that he e helps him ( ohaik Hamad) as soon as disturbances have died down ShaiiC Hamad will learn then wa%t a reckoning he has to pay. T ^f this is not the work of Mulla Hafidh, the only other likely person is one Abdul Aziz, a schoolmaster in the school he re, a friend of his, who,I learn from both Shaik Hamad &amp; the Qadhi has recently been writing to the papers. 1 0^-' W'twi.

This reply is civil thanks me for ray efforts says that he has conferred full powers and agrees that peace is the real desideratum but does not refer specifically to the article which Ki ng Ssisal has agreed to sign. When 1 asked the Hejd representatives whether they were prepared to sign it on behalf of the Sultan of Hejd they replied that it would depend upon the attitude taken up by the Iraq representatives at their next meeting, ihey could do no more at present than hold out i hope. As regards the question of the Sultan sending his son to represent himtelf, they inform me that Resident's letter had reached Ibn Sa'ud before they left but those letters gave the Sultan the impression that the Conference would meet at the end of February and, as the sons were in Riyadh, it would be quite impossible for the Sultan to arrange to send one of them in time. I am afraid therefore that all hope must be abandoned of the arrival of one of Ibn Sa'ud's sons unless the Conference were to be delayed unreasonably right into the hot weather. The only alternative appears to be to send a less exalted representative lorHedjaz.

Whereas ever since the 'Uqair agreement, 1 have prevented my tribes from raiding and, thank God, no hostile act hae been perpetrated against the Iraq Government or her tribes or even against those evil doers who have taken refuge there. This is not because I have not the power or am timid or weak but because I wish to remain friends and to act ®n the advice of my friend the British Government. Now the flood has reached its height and I cannot keep on in this way #.ny longer^as many raids and acts of aggression have taken place and much plunder and bloodshed . I have received many complaints from my tribes^who are worn out and ask for revenge,which clearly showythat such trouble it brewing that I cannot stand up against the. storm. I have just received a letter from my father the Imam^who assures me that the trouble is increasing day by day and asks me to return as soon as possible,as also a letter from Dawish^ Copies of both of these are enclosed herewith for your perusal^wfeiei will show you how critical the xksxx position is. I am leaving at once and will try to keep their minds at rest with good promises, but 1 must ask you to send me a reply immediately, ii .ither tell me definitely that a stop will be put to these acts of aggression and that the plunder and the,4® -2- refugees will be returned on the reeponsiMlity of my friend the British Government or I must ask to be excused for any turn affairs may take.

I was talking to the Hejd delegates this morning about the letter in queetion and they tell me that Saiyid Hashim himself took it ashore at Bushire and went with Abdul Razzak up to Subzabad but that Colonel Trevor had already left Bushire two days before its arrival. More and ^thinking that Colonel Trevor would be sure to send it on himself with oonsiderable oomment, waited some little time before I finally decided to telegraph it on to Colonies. I had begun to doubt myself whether that letter, rather an important one,had ever reached Bushire at all and thought that it might be due to some carelessness of the gost Office or Ibn Sa'ud's own clerks. I n view of Saiyid Hashim's very clear and emphatic statement, that solution is out of the question Probably long before this letter reaches, the matter will have been already disposed of. After Colonies'injunction to me to keep in close touch with Resident, it is very important for me to know exactly where and who the Resident may be. Would you please therefore let me know as soon as possible what are Resident's movements and when Colonel Prideaux will be taking over ? I have also heard,though I very probably have got this wrong, that the Dalys are going home. If there is any idea of Daly being relieved in the near future, could you 'let me know who his relief will be and when he will come to Bahrain^ I only ask because it is very important for me to know the exact movements of Ibn Sa'ud's son.Please forgive this bald short letter but just for the moment I am pretty busy.

The general impression seems to be that Bin Sa^d must lose ground and Hashimites grow stronger as time passes and therefore it behoves the Hashimites to be scrupulously tender towards the susceptibilities of their weakening enemy and to be careful to allow him no excuse for saying that he has been forced into hostilities and that it is better to die sword in hand rather than bleed to death slowly. We are in a vicious circle. Hussain promises to send an exalted representative whom Bin Sa^d never asked for and then says that,if Bin Sa'ud will not despatch a corresponding dignitary, he will not send his man nor even appoint a substitute of lesser importance. If I sent the Nejd delegates within the v/eek off to Riyadh with the Iraq proposals it would be atleast the middle of May before satisfactory Nejd representatives could return. In the meantime according to Bin Sa'ud all malcontents within his territories are flocking to the border creating disturbances in his territories and crossing into Iraq at the first sign of retaliation.Bin Sa'ud would probably not raid Iraq, more especially if Iraq is on the alert, but blaze out towards Mecca and Medina and he will say,with some justice that the unreasonable playing fast and loose with him by the Hashimites forced these steps1010 [I o 0 ; ^ Ovf ' Oi | fie. 11 sila '; : f [. ir 'Wfl]l f ^ ^9g$j | } ^% I IT f ^9^ fa [ ^ W&amp;3J I &lt;1OJ ill | »*:»;■ [. 10*3 5ii I 117 6 li mpi U,MJ lit ail 333351 ) isa# i ■ m 61 I Inifi to} upon him when he was ready to treat and showed that he was so ready. The time when telegrams are full of Turkey, the home of re-action, expelling the Khalifa and cutting off the allowances of the royal family is no time for such mushroom monarchs as the H as himite B insisting on their royal dignities and I think, if they maintain the attitude indicated in Baghdad telegram referred to, Muslim opinion will condemn them in their controversy with Bin Sa'ud. I therefore repeat that I consider it most advisable for them to send their delegates by 15th of March and leave no stone unturned to obtain peaceful solution,even waiving their roj^l dignity for the laudable end in view. Personally I regard hostilities as almost inevitable but it is important that Bin Sa'ud should be put inexcusably in the wrong. I think a clever move by the Hashimites would be to throw themselves boldly into arbitration and say that they are ready,coute que coute, to accept the arbitration of the British Government on all points involved as absolutely final. It would be interesting to see that Bin Sa'ud would do in such an event and it would pave way for a renewal of conference next cold weather and gain time which eeems of paramount importance,-Knox&lt;,'elogrKm (Code).

The letter from Bin Saud quoted in the latter telegram is the same as that referred to in my telegram No. 17 dated 4th March and enclosed in my despatch 16/165- B dated 2nd March. in my opinion the object of Jin Baud's letter 79 of 23rd February is the same as that of his letter 75 of 8th February, forwarded with my despatch No. 12 dated 23rd February, via. to extenuate in advance possible (and judging from enclosures to His Highness' letter of 23rd February extremely probable) Wahabi attacks on Iraq, 2. ITejd Envoys are wrong in attributing end of February as date of reassembling of Conference to me. Writing on 15th February I said Col. Khox was better and Conference might possibly reassemble in March in about three weeks and asked him to liold delegates in readiness. Col. Knox however sent message (Ho. 73) on 18th February through Bahrain asking for representatives to reach Kuwait by 29th February and his later message No. 77 of 22nd February was too late to stop them. 3. In my opinion Bin Saud's message re sending his son quoted in my telegram 16 dated 2nd March was merely a polite nay of saying he did not want to do so; perhaps how- -ever he will change his mind on receipt of message sent with your telegram of 8th March.

The raiders are reported to have seized immense numbers of bhsge . camped camels and sheep and bO tents, and to have BBijpfmpt: on tne spot. All the Mesopotamia tribes have closed in towards the railway and are greatly excited. ihe (iovernment of j.raq in agreement with me have sent orders to their delegates notto proceed 'beyond isasrah, until full apology and redress have been giverootc for this incursion, which makes discussions between the two (iovernments impossible, especially in view or the oultan of jwejd's threats, conveyed in his letter of k^rd February xvo.XV to the resident in the rersian tiulf jDUShire that he could no longer be responsible for restraining his tribes, xhese previous threats make it appear probable that tne raid now reported was under the orders of jsin oaud. j-he mesopotamian Government will, so far as is possible, restramx its tribes from retaliation, but will find this exceedingly difficult unless prompt- reparation is made, if the raid proves to nave been as serious as first reports imply, it appears it may be necessary to bring to bear on the oultan definite threat of cutting off supplies by sea. xhe xrans-uordan delegates will arrive Kuwait by air on iviarch ki^nd. nigh Commissioner. ir'VSUio 6l/l4 and 61/15, Telegram P, From High CQmmissioner, Baghdad.

The tribes attacked were shepherd sections of the Diwaniyah tribes and also sections of the Dhafir. Subsequent movements and present position of the .raisers is unknown.

The local sheiks believe that a big raid of the kind reported would not have been made unless the Sultan of Nejd had given all his tribes general permission to raid, and they are clamouring for protection. Your telegram No.93 read with Bushire telegram Uo.49 of the ..me date seems to show that the Sultan never intended to send his son to the conference. it is now established that a serious raid has taken place, and unless prompt action is taken still more serious may follow.

The correspondence is between the Political Residency at Bushire, the Political Agencies at Kuwait and Bahrain, the High Commissioners in Baghdad and Jerusalem, the Colonial Office in London, the British Agency at Jeddah, the Government of India, Sheikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, ruler of Kuwait, Ibn Sa'ud, Sultan of Najd, King Faisal of Iraq, and Amir Abdullah of Transjordan.The main aim of the conference was to settle issues of border delineation between Najd, Transjordan, the Hejaz, and Iraq. Other issues of negotiation were the return of Shammar refugees to Najd from Iraq and compensation for past raids. Much of the correspondence deals with this. The discussion focuses around the status of places that there is most disagreement on: Wadi Sirhan (Jauf [Jawf], Kaf [Kāf]), Akaba [al-‘Aqaba], Maan [Ma‘ān], and the Hejaz frontier (Khurma, Turbah, Khaybar). Other more practical issues are discussed, such as travel arrangements and the identity of attendees, including Ibn Sa‘ud's decision not to send one of his son's as delegate which led to King Hussein withdrawing his own representative.Other subjects covered by the volume are:a large raid by the Ikhwan on Iraqi shepherd tribes that effectively ended the conference;the presentation by the British of a silver plate to Sheikh Ahmed to thank him for his hospitality;the official Najd government publication of a 'green book' on the conference.Notable within the volume are Stuart Knox's notes and minutes on the numerous sittings of the conference: folios 1D-37, 57-90, 120-29, 252-63, 265-71, 274-80.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Iraq Fayṣal I</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Jordan ʿAbdullāh I</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Stuart George Knox</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shammar (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Transjordan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kāf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al Jawf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al 'Aqaba</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000238#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
