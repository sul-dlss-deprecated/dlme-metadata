D®ar Mr. Peel, You have,I think, on your records, copies of this Company’s Thrift and Life Insurance Benefit Plans concerning Class I British and Class I Amorican employees at Bahrain. From a cable I have recently received from San Francisco, it appears that further benevolent schemes are afoot for the benefit of these employees. These benefits are to be in the form of Annuity and croup Life Insurance, through the medium of U.3.American in surance companies. There will be contributions to the premiums payable by both employee and employer, those of the employee be ing deducted from salary. The scheme is a voluntary one so far as concerns the present employees of the Company but it will be a compulsory one so far as concerns employees hereafter engaged or I assume re-engaged, by the Company. It looks as though steps are being taken to make The Bahrein Petroleum and its Subsidiary and associated Companies, independent of the Croup schemes of the respective Parents, namely, the Standard Oil Company of California and Texas Corporation, who, as you know, are jointly interested in The Bahrein petroleum com pany. I am asked whether I see any objection to the scheme in principle. I am told that so far as the Am e nican employees are concerned, they will continue to be paid in dollars in the United States, where they will be paid and where all deductions will be made and premiums paid. This means there will be no remittances Americans are concerned from Bahrain to the States. *' r ith regard to the British employees, whilst therewill be no actual physical remittances, there must he, I think, remittances by way of account, namely, the moneys to be paid to the account of a British employee will be paid by the Bahrein Company in the States and debited in Bahrein to the account of the B r itish employee who will draw his salary less such deduction. In principle, I see no objection to the scheme, nor do I see any other question (other than one under the Defence (Finance) Regulations) likely to arise in connection with the scheme. I do not know when the scheme will commence; it must, at present be in draft only because I am told that drafts will be sent for me to look at. Subject to what I have said above and so far as you can from the rather scanty material, do you think that these plans are likely to cause any embarrassment to you or to the sheikh of Bahrain? I cannot see why they should but I would be grateful if you would tell me if you can see any objection to them without, of course, committing either H.11.Government or the Government of Bahrain to blessing these Plans, or, in other words, as the lawyers say, any views you express would be without prejudice to either— Government. If I could have your reply within the course of the next few days, it would be a convenience as I would like to cable to S a n Francisco definitely that so far as I understand the scheme I can see no objection to it.
