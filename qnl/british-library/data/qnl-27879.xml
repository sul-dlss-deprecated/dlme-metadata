Sir, K 3 ', 4 iD With reference to the India Office letter No. P.Z. 6616/37 of tee 8th of October, regarding the interference by the Persian authorities with a Bahraini dhow at Khoramshahr, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Sden to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copies of four telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the subject, and a copy of a telegram from the Acting British Consul at Khoramshahr. 2. It will be seen from these telegrams which, together, comprise a full report on the incident, that the Persian authorities confined their action to confiscating the Bahraini registration papers of tne dhow, and to obliging the Captain to register his ship at Khoramshahr. They did not, at the same time, oblige the members of the crew to take out Persian nationality papers. 3. In Mr. Eden’s opinion, the action of the Persian authorities is merely a logical outcome of the Persian claim to Bahrain. It is evident, moreover, that no representations | by His Majesty’s Government would induce the Persian Government to modify what are clearly standing instructions as regards the treatment of Bahraini dhows in Persian ports. Nevertheless, since silence on the part of His Majesty’s Government might be interpreted as acceptance of the Persian point of view, Mr. Eden thinks it desirable that a protest should be addressed to the Persian/ The Under Secretary of State India Office.dS) Persian Government. In his opinion, hov;ever, nothing would he gained hy hasing the protest on the so-called H status quo agreement 11 , which is open to varied interpretations and the mention of which would almost certainly lead to a retort from the Persian Government on the subject of the recent Bahraini nationality and property laws. He considers, therefore, that the protest should he a purely formal one, and preferably made j at the request of the Sheikh of Bahrain. 4* Mr. Eden would he grateful to he furnished with the observations of Lord Zetland on this matter at an early date.

If you agree, appropriate local action might be to obtain authority for Vice-Consul to make official protest against registration and impounding of papers (and if necessary (? against) flying of the flag) after which the dhow could leave. Departure of the dhow on the responsibility of Nakhuda before protest could n ° d0Ubt b9 P r9V9nted fa y referring him to Bahrain Government's views (see Bahrain telegram No^50).

The
                           nakhudaof the dhow was forced to hand over his vessel's registration documents to the Iranian naval authorities in exchange for Iranian Government registration papers. The incident is said in the file to be connected with the issuing by the state of Bahrain of nationality and property laws, and with the Iranian Government's claim to sovereignty over Bahrain.The incident is discussed in correspondence from the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the British Minister at Tehran (Sir Horace James Seymour), and the Foreign Office, as well as in India Office minutes, and resulted in the issuing of a protest by the British Government to the Government of Iran (folios 12-13), at the request of the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah [Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah]. The Iranian Government in response asserted that Bahrain was an inalienable part of Iran (folio 9), and the Foreign Office decided to take no further action.There are no papers in the file dated 1939-40; folios 2-3 record a similar incident from 1941.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, Āl Khalīfa dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ships--Registration and transfer</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001c5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
