I have the honour to remark that on the 17th April, there was a report current in Kuweit that the individual in question was shortly due to arrive among the Awazim, and had given out that he was coming to replace Mohamed-ibn- Sultan. 3. His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuweit to whom I mentioned Jeddah's tele gram on the 21st April informed me that he had recei\ed no information from His Majesty s King Bin Saud on the matter whatsoever. 4. The Shaikh gave it as his opinion that Ibrahim-bin-Arfaj, whom he knows as another petty commander of His Majesty King Bin Saud s, like Mohamed-ibn- Sultan has been deputed with the sole and express purpose of tightening up the blockade against Kuweit, and that the table that he is coming up to post himself in the vicinity of the ( Iraq-Kuweit-Nejd frontiers to settle certan matters between Nejd tribes, is so much camouflage, especially the story that he will be ready to receive complaints from the 'Iraq or Kuweit frontier authorities against Nejd tribes. 5. The Shaikh added that Ibrahim-bin-Arfaj, was the Commander of the Nejd ' Sarriyeh ' stationed with the ' Subei ' and Sahool tribes, when al-duwish at tacked and defeated them in July 1929 at Gaiyeh (Qaiya) near Artawiyeh (reported in my No. 468, dated 12th August 1929). 6. To day the 22nd April news reached Kuwait by camelman from the South that Ibn Arfaj had camped at Hafar-al-Batin five days ago. This appears to con firm the news given in paragraph 2 above.

My Lord, ' a / ^ In continuation of my despatch No.22 of 30th April 1930, regarding Ihrahim i'bn Arfaj, I have the honour to report that the Political Agent, Kuwait, has recently received a letter from King Ihn Saud dated 29th March informing him of Ihrahim hin Arfaj's appointment on the Kuwait and Iraq, frontier. Colonel Dickson has also received a note from Ihrahim hin Arfaj reporting his arrival at Hafar. i'he note adds that whilst he is ready to receive complaints from the Shaikh of Kuwait, some Nejd property still remained in Kuwiat which he hopes to recover through the assistance of the Political Agent. His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq, has expressed the view that the reason why Ihn Saud has hitherto failed to pay the £ 10,000/-compensation which he promised to pay at the meeting last January in connection with the surrender of the Ajman and Mutair is that he is watting to see what action the Iraq, authorities take regarding Ion Mashur. This assumption is proha^ly correct. At the same time it is possible that as he cannot advance this reas n openly he may try to contend that some oi the camels etc. 'belonging to Ajman and kutair have not yet 'been surrendered to him and it is possihly The Bight Eon'hie Lord Passfield, P.O., His Majesty^ Secxetary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, LOaDQfi .

In continuation of my despatch No. 233, dated 16th May, I have the honour to forward the following items of news which may be of interest :— 1. The rumour is still current that H. M. King Bin Sand intends to remain in the Hijaz for good, and that he intends appointing Sand his son his viceroy for Nejd and Hassa. Best informed opinion in Kuwait puts no credence in the rumour, and prefers to put it down to the fact that the King has given out that he will summer in Taif. At the same time it is considered possible that he will permanently appoint the Amir Sand to the governorship of Nejd, himself retaining the general control. 2. At the end of May, Ibrahim bin Arfaj proceeded to the 'Iraq neutral area to settle certain water disputes which had arisen between Shammar elements at ' Bir Ansab ', and at Julaida between some Shammar under ibn Hudaid and the Dhalir under ibn Suwait. Ibn Arfaj is reliably reported to have decided both cases satisfactorily and in the second of the two cases to have given his decision in favour of the Dhafir. 3. During ibn Arfaj's absence in the neutral area (2 above) three small caravans managed to get into Kuwait as below :— (a) On 5th June a caravan of 60 camels, consisting of Braih tribesmen from Hafar al-Batin. {h) On 7th June a caravan of 25 camels, tribes Ajman from Awainah in Mid-Hassa. (c) On 10th June a caravan of 15 Mutair camels from Artawiyeh. In addition quite a large number of Awazim tribesmen moving in small parties of 4 and 5 camels, have managed to reach Kuwait during the last three weeks. The process seems to be continuing. All caravans have purchased their requirements and left again. 4. A report has been brought in by the Mutair caravan that Ibn Arfaj has been ordered to build proper forts at Harfar, Safa, Haba and Garaa ail in Mutair country. The story is not considered unlikely. 5. One Khalid bin Sufan (Ataibah) arrived from Baghdad on 10th June. He is understood to have visited local tribal elements camped at Jahrah and round the town of Kuwait. He expressed a desire to visit Bandar ibn Faisal al-Duwish now camped at al Garaa, and is said to hiive enquired whether it would be possible without arousing ibn Arfa j's suspicions. 41 6. Mohamed el Sudairawi an important Kuwaiti, long resident in Bombay and recently pronounced bankrupt there, returned to Kuwait on 8th June via Basrah. He is reported to be regaling the inhabitants with very lurid stories of the situation in India.JO.. ■'ID3NTIAL.

V ' C la ■ continuation of my confidential despatch No. 243 dated the 26th May last, I have the honour to forward for your information translations of the following letters (a) From Ibrahim bin Arfaj to the Political Agent, Kuwait, No. nil dated nil 1349 /7 (received on 10th June 1930) with / / —* 7 elloloeure - f' (t) From the Political Agent, Kuwait to - Ibrahim bin Arfaj No. 354 dated ism 'June 1930. c ' (c) From the Political Agent, Kuwait to H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait No.255 (Confidential) dated 12th June 1930. (d) From H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent No. nil dated 14th June 1930. (e) Two camel lists sent by H.E. the Shaikh to the Political Agent on 15th June f 30 (f) A 'Mulhaq' or supplemsnt to a letter received on 15th June 1930 by H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait from H.M. the King of Hijaz and Najd under his letter No&lt;, 2070 dated 21st Dhil Hujjah 1348 (20th May 1930)From tlie above correspondence it will be seen that Ibn Arfaj (presumably acting under the orders of Bin Saud) has followed up the activities of Barjas ibn Othman and Mohomed ibn Sultan and has come to the charge with a fresh list, this time of 321 camels, which he says arc with certain Kuwait subjects (names given), and which he demands on behalf of his master# Ibn ArfaJ in his letter (a) makes two wrong statements. Firstly. If is incorrect that I told Yusuf bin Abdullah al-Nafisi to inform ibn Arfaj that he was n to submit a list of losses (of c amels) which were to be reco - vered' # What I did say was that ibn Arfaj should do no thing foolish and attempt to take the law into his own hands and that if he had any complaints to prefer against the Shaikh of Kuwait, he should inform me, sending a copy to the Shaikh. Secondly, In the third paragraph of his letter .ae uses the words fr and this al-Nafisi explained to you TT , -t-^e did nothing 01 the sort, and the statement is a pure invention. The above explanations are necessary,! think, to enable you to understand ibn Arfajls methods. Enclosures (b), (c), (d) are self explanatory, but (e) requires a little elucidation. On receipt of ibn ArfaJ T s letter, I asked H .E. the Shaikh to let me know whether any of the Barnes of persons who were in possession of the 53 camels mentioned in Ibn Sultans list, had again been mentioned by ibn Arfaj. The Shaikh replied that 24 men 1 s names mentioned by ibn Sultan^ had been entered in ibn Ariaj's list but that whereas the former had only found 36 camels with them the latter now claimed, and without examination or search, that there were 68. See list I &amp; II. 5# Enclosure (f) forms part of a corteous r letter on general subjects recently received(20th May 1930) by H.E. the Shaikh from H.M. King Bin Saud, and deals with the tk letter sent by the Shaikh regarding the 53 camelsfound by ibn Sultan and which the Shaikh had said would be handed over if payment were made for them 0 See paragraph 5 of my confidential despatch No. 221 dated 15th Hay. Th© matter has now reached a climax and unless something is done to settle this vexed question once and for all, we musuexpect a recrudescence of Bin Saud's 'thunder', as well as possibly more serious conse quences. Hitherto my policy has been at all costs to prevent any of Bin Saud^ armed parties crossing the border and taking the law into their own hands, as they so often did in 1928 and previous years. In this I have so far been successful. It has however necessitated my largely taking matters into my own hands and dealing with men like Barjas ibn Othman and Mohomed ibn Sultan direct, for if I had left things to the none too strong Shaikh of Kuwait who has been only too prone to allow himself to be bullied, and talked round, we should already have found ourselves overrun by armed parties of Najdis wandering over the country in search of so called lost camels and helping themselves as they chose, I consider it important therefore that I be furnished with very early orders, as to the line I should take up now with Ibrahim ibn Arfaj, and I request that full instructions be sent me as soon as is possibl e*'^ 7. The attitude of the Shaikh of Kuwait in this matter has been and is the reverse of strong and I have to watch him closely lest he do something foolish without my knowing it. At one time he talks of trying to bribe ibn Arfaj, at another of inviting him to Kuwait to make a 'grand and final search' as he calls it (of all Kuwait camels), and yet again he suggests settling the question out of hand by sending all the camels ibn Arfaj now asks for, irrespective of the feelings of his unfor tunate subjects, or of future consequences. 8 * If left entirely to himself, the Shaikh would without doubt come to grief, as he cannot hope to4. ' V® -4- &lt;V match himself against the astute Bin Saud, The latter of course knows this and tries to deal with the Shaikh only, leaving me out of the picture® » 9« There is little doubt, and the Shaikh agrees with me in this, that Bin Saud 1 s policy is to show the local Bedouin world, and especially the Kuwait tribes, that he possesses a very long arm and intends to impose his will on Kuwait as if it -was an app^iage of Najd. The successive attempts of Barjas bin Othman, ibn Sultan, and now ibn Arfaj, show also that do what they will, and settle up, how they may, the Kuwaities will go on being bullied. And even now should a settlement be come to with ibn Arfaj it is I fear certain, that in a few more months, another high official of Bin Saudswill turn up with more claims. 10 # It may be noted in passing that Bin Saud forever makes out t^t little Kuwait to be at fault, and the depredations of the people of Nejd against Kuwait during the last 8 years are not taken any account of, nor indeed in the present instance has ibn Arfaj done anything at all about the 37 plus 13 camels taken by the Awazim. On top of everything the 'Blockade n goes on merrily, and is becoming daily tighter under the direction of ibn Arfaj. 11. In my opinion the following courses are now open to us:- (a) H.M's G-overnment to tell Bin Saud that from the date when Barjas ibn Othman made his search of Kuwait territory and gave a clear statement to the Political Agent that he was satisfied that no more rebel camels remained in Kuwait, no further claims will be considered. (b) H.M's Government to tell Bin Saud that if he is willing to pay the cost of the 53 camels found by ibn Sultan to the Shaikh of Kuwait, they would advise the-5- the latter to return the camels, but that no further claims will be consi dered or tolerated. (c) H.M's Government to agree to the procedure being adopted as suggested by Bin Saud in his 'Mulhaq' (f), and the Shaikh of Kuwait to deal direct with ibn Arfaj on these lines f pro vided that Bin Saud will give an under taking that he neither had nor will prefer any further claims against Kuwait in connection with rebel camels. This last course, I think, would be a weak one and I do not advise it, for I can only see further trouble resulting, The recent rebellion in Najd followed by this long camel controversfery has brought home to me the need for some sort of modification of the policy which permits the Ruler of Kuwait to have direct dealings with Bin Saud whenever he choses# I venture to suggest that just as Kuwait now deals with 'Iraq or Persia through the medium of the Political Agent ( the time has come when Kuwait's foreign policy with Najd should be sijailarly controlled. There is little doubt that much of Bin Saud's irritation with Kuwait in the past has been due to Kuwait's policy of double dealing^ both with H.M's Govern ment and with Najd, a method which is only too dear to the heart of an Arab. If therefore we are going to safeguard Kuwait's interests from the desert-side properly, we must, I think, have a louder say in shaping her policy with Bin Saud, otherwise we shall find ourselves in a very false position one of these days.

I have pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 255, dated the 15th instant (Enclosure 6) the contents of which as well as that of the letter and enclosures received by Your Excellency from Ibrahim bin Arfaj through Yusuf an-Nafisi, I have understood. I have also received a letter from the abovementioned 'persons to the same effect including similar list to that sent to Your Excellency. Ibn Arfaj pretends that all the animals mentioned therein are still with the Kuwait tribesmen, and that should search be allowed he will find more than that mentioned. All this is over and above the question of the 53 camels noted down by Muhammad bin Sultan and the 30 camels taken already by the Awazim and the 13 camels which they lately took. Ibn Arfaj's letter is probably genuine although it has no date and^seal, since the handwriting is the same as that of his previous letters. As to the shortages mentioned in the abovemeutioned papers, I do not think it possible that such a large number of camels as stated could ever have'been in our territory, and certainly neither the officials of Ibn Sand, whom we sent with our son Abdullah al-Jabir^ and who twice carried out the necessary searches in their own way, heard of them. The first of these was Barjas bin Uthman and his companions. If there, had been so many camels, how did they fail to find them. Moreover to concentrate and confine the tribes again for another search would be real persecution, and would injure their property greatly. We also wrote to the abovementioned Ibn Arjaf with regard to the shortages, and said that should anything besides that noted down by Ibn Sultan be found, he should let us know so that we may do whatever may be necessaiy. Is it not conect to say that we agreed to return everything that was reported to us t Ibn Arjaf's letter with its enclosures is herewith enclosed. Enclosure 8 to Serial No. (44),.. Translation.

E. the Shaikh of Kmcait's suggestion that he would hand back the camels claimed by ibn Sultan if they were paid for. With reference to the shortages, there has been no shortcoming from your part, because you have clone whatever action that was necessary. But may God save you, the ways of the Bedouin are not unknown to you, and it appears to us that most of the animals now with the Arabdar have been left with them in trust even through the^ Araibdar claim to have bought them. Hence, may God pro long your life, and as the proverb has it, u Follow the humble up to his family's house '. This saying is just and it can apply to Nejd property as well as to that of Kuwait subjects. In the 'present case it means that all camels that can be recognised as the property of Nejd subjects and are now with subjects of Kuwait should be recovered and distributed through your hands. (And my plan is this.) Each present owner (Kuwait subject who has bought a Nejd camel) should be given a letter from you to us, or to any of our retainers (officials) stating that a certain camel or camels were found to be in the possession of so and so (Kuwait subject), who bought them from so and so (Ne^d subject) at such and such a price; that the camel or camels are being kept (by you Shaikh of Kuwait) until the price be recovered through us from the seller, and that when this price is paid to the buver, the original owner (Nejdi) can return to you and take over his property. This way is the best. You should also warn the peo'ple of Kuwait not to buy any camel without stipulating with its owner that it was not a robbed animal, or had strayed from the people of Nejd. By so doing both of us will find full rest. We shall, also do the same with the people of Nejd that is should any Kuwait subject recognise his camel with any Nejd subject, we shall restore it in case it was robbed, but should it be sold by any of the Kuwait subjects we shall ask you to undertake payment of its price, and the camel shall then be given back to its owner. This proposal will keep all matters straight and in good order, will leave no excuse for the robber and will reserve the rights of the people. Please let your brother know should you agree to this proposal, other wise should you have another proposal please write to your brother. We aic; prepared and await your reply.

Y- I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. ^60, dated 21st June 1930 (Enclosure 2), reporting the activities of Ibrahim bin Arfaj. 2. The Hon'blithe Political Resident entirely agrees with the view therein expressed that the^time has now come to put a stop to these activities of Ibn Sand's agents in Kuwait, and is of the opinion that the Shaikh should be urged strongly to resist any further attempts on the part of Nejd officials to institute searches in Kuwait lerritory. He has alroady made great concessions in this respect and it is clear that so far from meeting with any response on Tbn Sand s part this attitude on his part is merely construed as weakness and attributed to alarm and fear. If despite refusal on the Shaikh's part further attempts are made by Ibn Sand's officials or armed forces to enter or obtain access to Kuwait territory, Colonel Biscoe considers that the best thing for you to do would be to obtain a letter from the Shaikh requestine: the official concerned to leave am. to send it out to him by car by the hand of Khan Sahib Farhan or some similar responsible individual.' If the bearer of the letter definitely verifies the fact that Ibn Sand's officials or forces are within Kuwait territory, the letter should be delivered and the matter reported by telegram to the Hon'ble the Political Resident who will at once bring the facts to the notice of His Majesty's Govern ment and His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah, with a view to suitable represon- tations being made.

He said that as Bin Saud had asked him for his proposals in return, he had written and replied as follows 'That he (Shaikh Ahmad) had received his (Bin Saud T s) letter, and had read his proposals for settling the camel question with interest. That H.M.Government had taken up the question however and were considering the matter from their point of view, and that pending ins tructions from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the matter must remain in abeyance. That while agreeing in general with his (Bin Saud^) proposal, he (Shaikh Ahmad) suggested the following as a better plan; that instead of sending every one of his people who had bought camels to Ibn Arfaj, which would be inflicting hardship on many people needlessly, he.

The latter would then receive his camel and go'. I send you the above for information.

Host of our Kuwait pilgrims arrived back here, in safe and sound condition, and they all express their grateful thanks for kindness and attention received at Your Majesty's hands# They pray always for your progress and happiness# I also on hearing their praise and gra titude, am filled with gratitude for Your Majesty's generous favours, in which indeed we are all drowned. I ask God to give us joy of your long life, and may your kindnesses con tinue for many years, to enable us win your praise and satisfaction#Mulliaq II. It has been an honour to receive your second 'Muihaq' and whatever Your Majesty has said has been understood by your brother. You suggest with regard to the camels which are with the Araibdar, that in your opinion most of them are 'trusts^ though they are claimed to have been bought, and that the best thing for me to do, is to collect a££ these camels, recognized with the people of Kuwait, anend letters with the owners to Your Majesty or to any of ^our Majesty* s retainers stating the name of Che original buj q ± from among the Kuwait tribesman, the name of the seller, iron Your Majesty's subjects, and the value of the camel, lour Majesty then says you will afterwards give orders for the value to be recovered from the seller and paid to the buyer, and for the owner of the camel to ccme to us and take it over. Your Majesty thinks that this is the best way, and wishes that we should warn the people of Kuwait that none of them buy any camel without stipulating to its owner that it should neitha: have been robbed nor plundered from the people of Najd, and that Your Majesty will do the same with the people oi i^ajd as well, and that Your Majesty does this that both sides may have peace and rest. May God prolong your life and make your kindness last. By §od the Great, 0 dear friend, I your brother, will always dislike doing the least thing that might displease Your Majesty, on the contrary I am anxious to do a ll in my power to please Your Majesty and secure Your Majestys satisfaction in every respect. As regards the 'Araif' (recognized) camfcls which my Araibdar have got, and your statement that most of them are 'trusts' and not purchased. 0 sirel Your Majesty can never imagine such a thing seeing tbat we have been very strictly watching this matter from the very beginning, and have already warned all our people that anyone buying any property shall have to prove his purchase by means of satis factory witnesses. And that should anything be found with a person and he be unable to prove its purchase by means ofof witness, he shall be punished p^bperly and deservedly. Be assured, my friend, that nothing can be hidden. And notwithstanding everything we are fully observing this matter with the utmost care. Your Majesty ^ it is also impossible that anybody could hide such a matter while we are observing him, and if he could so in this matta: today for example, it would no doubt be known very soon. Your Majesty would then see how we would deal with the man and what an example we should make of him for others. Your brother's (Shaikh of Kuwaiti) opinion in the 'Araif' camels case is that all the buyers should pre sent themselves to us, and every one should prove his purchase by mwans of satisfactory witnesses# His name would then be noted down by us with a full description of the number of camels he has got, their value, and the name of the seller. We then would make out a general list ^ ^Qr in this manner showing every case, and would submit it to Your Majesty wilii one of our servants acting on behalf of all to receive the value. The camels would in the meantime be kept by us pending Your Majestys instructions# Should any other camel be discovered with anybody over and above what he has declared, that man shall no doubt be deserving of punishment and the camel shall be r&amp;stored to its owner without compensation under Your Majesty's orders. This arrangement I propose should be carried out if Your Majesty will agree to it. But your opinion is the highest. As ordered by Your Majesty we have warned the people of Kuwait that none of them should buy any camel without stipulating to its owner that it has neither been robbed nor pn plundered from the people of Najd, in the sar© way as Your Majesty had warned your subjects not to do so in matters concerning the people of Kuwait• Insha'allah by your safe existence, a settlement will be attained in every respect.

Despatch from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Colonial Office , No. 33, dated the 11 th J uly 19dU. 1 have the honour to forward for the information of His Majesty's Gov, /,' &gt; eminent a copy of a despatch No. 260, dated 21st June 1930, received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, regarding the activities of Ibrahim ibn Artaj, Ibn Sand's representative on the Kuwait border. 2 Although the activities of Ibn Sand's agents on this frontier ha\o been reported from time to time it may not be amiss to summarise briefly the events that have occurred since the Mutair and Ajman crossed the border m February last. These two tribes were conveyed into Nejd territory by the Koval Air Force and Ibn Sand himself expressed his appreciation of manner in which this had been done. There was however a possibility that a few camels might have been handed over to the Araibdar or that a few refugees might still remain and when King Ibn Saud desired to send an emis sary to investigate the matter it was decided, in order that he might have no possible ground for complaint, to allow him to carry out the search in conjunc tion with a representative of the Shaikh. 3. The first emissary sent by Ibn Saud was Barjas al Othman. Ho carried out a most comprehensive search and discovered a tew refugees sti in Kuwait territorv mostly women and children, whose men folk had been killed, and a certain number of Nejd camels. The latter were at once sent off to Neid territory while the refugees were left to follow slowly, as their means of transport permitted. Barjas al Othman expressed himself entirely satisfied with the result of the search, and left to report to His Majesty Ibn Saud who was then at the mouth of the Shett-al-Arab. In March last however King Ibn Saud sent another emissary, one Mohamed ibn Sultan, who camped actualh on the frontier with a force of some 290 men. He crossed the frontier as tar as Subahiyeh and his forces seized 36 camels while Awaziz patrols were posted on' the border to blockade Kuwait and prevent all ingress and egress. On the 5th March ibn Sultan himself arrived in Kuwait and demanded pei mis sion to effect yet another search of the Kuwait tribal camels and, untortuna e- lv, in mv opinion, the Shaikh allowed him to do so. After nine whole days search, all done by motor car and supported by some armed followers of the HShaikh, ibn Sultan had only been able to find the following: camels of Neid brands. (a) 12 cnrnels which had been sent as gifts by rebels to Kuwait tribal acquaintances previously. (/;) 53 camels which could be proved to have been bought legitimately. 4. With these two searches it might have been hoped that the activities of Ibn Sand's agents would have ceased. This has not however been the case and he has now sent Ibrahim ibn Arfa.i to maintain the pressure. The latter has not camped nearer the border than Hafar el Batin, but has employed armed patrols all along the border to prevent caravans proceeding to Kuwait and divert them to Zobeir. Further, he has visited Kuwait himself secretly, and Colonel Dickson has definite proof that he stayed two nights with Naiisi, Ibn Sand's agent there. Each fresh commander appointed to the Kuwait border produces fresh lists of so called Nejd camels and fresh demands upon the Shaikh of Kuwait. As Colonel Dickson points out, matters have now reached a climax, and had it not been for his constant efforts, there is little doubt but that Ibn Sand's armed forces would by now have been over-running Kuwait territory and helping themselves to Kuwait camels, while Ibn Sand on his part has made no attempt to compensate Kuwait for the heavy losses inflicted on them by Xo.ia tribes or to pay the compensation which he promised. T enclose for the information of His Majesty's Government a copy of a reply that T have sent to Colonel Dickson and trust they will approve of the instructions therein given. 5. 1 would also venture strongly to urge that representations should be made to Ibn Sand regarding the conduct of his officials on the Kuwait border. The Nejd Government desires to be treated nowadays as a civilized gov ernment in the comity of nations. If this is so they should adopt in their deal ings with their neighbours at least some of the practices current among civi lized nations. As will be seen from the above, Ibn Sand's officials have camped with armed forces actually on the Kuwait border, thereby creating consterna tion among Kuwait subjects ; they have crossed the border and looted Kuwait tribes ; they maintain a perpetual blockade of all Kuwait territory and no one from Nejd is allowed to visit Kuwait; and finally Ibn Sand's own authorised representative instead of visiting Kuwait openly and calling on the Shaikh and the Poiiiical Agent, visits it secretly by niulit, presumably in order to spy out the land. Further, his aeroplanes visit Kuwait territory without per mission while the visit paid by the aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force to DARIN In the interests of the Hedjaz Air Force immediately evokes the most vigorous protests. Ibn Sand's attitude therefore towards Kuwait can only be described as deliberately hostile, and he persistently treats Kuwait as though it were a rebellious province of Nejd. 'While prevented from invad ing it by His Majesty's Government he is attempting to reduce it to submis sion to his will by blockade. 6. Ibn Sand in his letter to the Shaikh of Kuwait has suggested that each Kuwait subject who has bought a Nejd camel should be sent with a letter from the Shaikh into Nejd territory with his witnesses to prove that he has bought the camel. This proposal is firstly opposed to current practice and tribal custom and secondly would involve great trouble to Kuwait subjects. They would have to proceed with their witnesses perhaps a hundred or two hundred miles into Nejd territory where the case would be heard by Nejd officials whose impartiality in this matter may well be doubted. When similar cases arise between Kuwait and 'Iraq if a Kuwait subject professes to have found his camels in the possession of an Iraqi tribesman he is sent by the Political Agent to 'Iraq where tho matter is investigated by he Officer-in-Charge of the Southern Desert and the claimant is compelled to abide by his decision. The Shaikh of Kuwait is naturally unwilling to agree to Ibn Sand's proposal but contends that Nejd claimants should be sent to Kuwait with their witnesses where the case would be investigated by the Shaikh and Kuwait claimants should be sent to Nejd, If King Ibn Sand contends that the impartiality of the Kuwait officials is also not above suspicion in a matter of this nature, Colonel Dickson informs me that he thinks the Shaikh would readily agree to the Political Agent supervising the proceedings. In any case this, I am informed, is the general practice and there seems to be no reason why it should be departed from in the present instance. The Shaikh of Kuwait has there fore written to Ibn Sand declining to agree to his proposal and putting forward the counter-suggestion outlined above. Lc423FD27 7.

(9) That the condition of al-Duwish, Ibn Hathlain and Ibn Lami was daily becoming harder and that they were being treated with much greater severity lhan before. To-day they conld no longer .move about and take exercise as before, for in addition to wearing chains their legs were confined in 41 stocks ' made of heavy wood. Though the story must be taken with suspicion, it bore the ring of truth, especially as Ibn Mikrad is a well known loyalist and friend of Bin Sand. The Mikrad further hinted that the time had come for H. M.'s Gov- ernment to move Bin Sand to treat his prisoners with greater consideration, seeing that it was generally known in Nejd that the King had promised H. M.'s Government in writing to treat them all in humane fashion and as Europeans would do.

This is an old letter and was sent to ibn ArfaJ by me in reply to one from him and the Kinc informing me of his appointment, I took the opportunity then to mention the two cases of theft of camels that the Iwazim had committed. Letter (b)followed me to India, and back again to Kuwait, so is a little on the old side. It is interesting as showing that ibn -rfaj passes on my letters to Mecca for the King to see. You will note that His I^ajesty King Bin Saud forwards copy of a letier whica he said he had previously sent me, but which has never yet heen received by me. The subject matter is the same as that sent to Shaikh Ahmad in 'Uulhaq' dated 21st Dhil Hujjah (20th '•'ay 1930) forwarded to you under my Confidential let No.260 dated 21st June 1930. ( (J A ^ ~2~ ) O s. -Si- Letter lo) is itm Arfaj's reply recently received to letter (a). You will note what a rough Bedouin ibn ^rfaj Is from the way he writes, and he has thoroughly mixed up my letter to him with that sent by the Shaikh on the subject of the Awazim robberies. While I said nothing about dates, ibn ArfaJ in his reply erroneously talks about my having mentioned that the robbery happened in the month of Dhil fta'dan 1549. As a matter of fact the Shaikh tells me that the letter sent to him is facsimile to that sent to me and that he has confusea things badly over dates# 2^ I propose taking no action on letcer^ tc), for as soon as the weather cools to somewhat I shall myself run down to ^afra and discuss matters with ibn -^ifajo A reply is however due to letter (b) as a natter of courtesy.

I have the honoui to acknowledge the receipt of two letters which were brought me by yout officer Abdur Rahman al-Liuhairib, the first from H.M. the King and the second from yourself. I regret that owing to Id festivities I was unable to acknowledge their receipt earlier The appontment of yourself by ^is August Majesty, and your being posted in the vicinity of the 'Iraq ^uwait frontiers in order to settle cases between the Nejd tribes, and watch their movements is without doubt an act of wisdom, and I especially welcome H.M.the Iv ing s r- statement that you will gladly receive and examine any simple complaint that may be sent you by H.S. the Shaikh of Kuwait against 'ejd subjects should any such mtsbehave themselves and coimnits acts of aggression against Kuwait subjects. In this connection I understand that H.E. the Shaikh has already submitted a complaint against some Awazim who only few days ago stole some camels from Kuwait woodcutters camped inside Kuwait territory. This complaint I trust you will examine with all despatch, punishing the aggressors and returning the camels. The incident is not the first that this unruly tribe has commit ted, for when ibn Sultan himself was in these parts certain evil men of the Awazim similarly stole 37 camels claiming them under the law of 'Araif. Regarding this matter however complaint was made direct by the Shaikh to H.M the King who.is doubtless considering the matter and will reply in due course.'

When ibn Sultan was in your side they were recognized by their owners, and restored by him to them in the presence of your man who came in a motor car# This is the real source of these camels.

Saud is calling up contingents from different tribes, for some unknown purpose. As late as 24th September 1930, a report of fair reliability reached Kuwait that letters had been received by the Awazim, Ajman, Bani IQialid, Sbei and Sahool tribes inviting their Shaikhs to proceed to the Hejaz with what strength they had available. They were not however to come with all their strength but leave something behind. Though one cannot definitely say whether there is any truth in the story at this stage, it is just possible that events in Yemen, are making it necessary for Bin Saud to place some strength on his South Western frontier. 2. Reliable messengers from Artawiyeh the last in on (25th September 1930) report that Bin Saud has for the present confirmed Bandar al-Eaisal al-Duwish as -amir of the Mutair. Bandar who recently proceeded to Hoffuf in response to an invitation by Ibn Jaloui, lias returned to the tribe. He was given a present of Rials 300 as well as articles of clothing etc. •5. Al-Humaidi, youngest son of al-Duwish has returned to the tribe from Taif.

From Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E*, Political Agent, Kuwait# To The Hon*1)10 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire# Sir, /, -3 I have the honour- to invite reference-to my confi dential Demi-Official No.267 dated the 25th June 1930, my confidential -.o»274 of 5th July 1930 to your address, and to paragraph 6 of your confidential Despatch No.33 dated 11th July ^ 1930 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, in in which you pointed out (as reported by me) that the Shaikh of Kuwait had declined to agree to His Majesty King Bin Saud f s proposals regarding the 53 Nejd camels claimed to have been bought by Kuwaitis, and^ put forward certain counter proposals. 1 have now to report that His Ivlajesty King Bin 3aud has replied to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in a letter dated 8th Jamad Awal 1349 (1st October 1930) agreeing that the matter be settled according to the Shaikh of Kuwait's proposals. This I think is most satisfactory, and shows that the King appreciates the justice of the Shaikh of Kuwait's point _ 4 U- oi view, and also I think that shows your representations have had some effect. Tli e King 1 s letter was sent through Abdullah bin Jaloui ibn Turki al-Saud the Governor of Hassa, and was for warded to the Shaikh of Kuwait under cover of the latter's letter dated. 20th Jamad Awal 1349 (13th October 1930), together with an open letter from the King to ibn Arfal, whiclj contained practically a verbatim copy of his (the King's) letter to the Shaikh, and instructed him to take further action in direct communication with His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait.This letter the Shaikli lias sent on to ibn ^rfaj after perusal. 4. Tlie satisfactory feature of the King's letter Is its very cordial tone, and from Muliiaq No.3, one gathers that the King is grateful, as I knew he would be, for the tratment meted out to his officials (Abdullah al-Mansur and party) when they arrived on Kuwaiti Southern frontier and asked if the^r could take w Zikat tf from the Harb Tribe camped at Subaihiyeh. 5. The Shaikh is naturally pleased and gratified at the turn of events and proposes in anticipation of your approval,to proceed on the lines proposed by himself and agreed to by the King, and will shortly write ibn ^rfaj to send all Nejdi claimants to Kuwait. Each will then be told to point out his camel. V /hen this has been done, the Kuwaiti at present owning the animal will be given an opportunity of proving that he had bought it. Failing his being able to do this, the camel will be at once handed back without compensation. If however he can prove purchase ; the camel will be retained by tha Shaikh, until the cost is recovered from the person who sold it, through ibn Arfaj, and is remitted to Kuv/ait for disbursement to the Kuwaiti. The Nejdi will then be allowed to go away with his camel. 6. In practice the Shaikh will go through all claims together and when it is known what money is to be paid \ to Kuwaitis, he will send a responsible official to ibn -hrfaj who will submit a full statement of the result of the enquiry, and will bring back all monies due in a lump sum. This will be handed over to the Kuwaitis by way of compensation. If The above method of settlement it will be noticed follows the tribal system of 'Arafa', except that ibn -^rfaj will make himself responsible for 'undoing' all intermediate sales, and finding out who was the original culprit who first sold each particular camel. 8. With this letter I enclose translations in triplicate of (a) Abdullah bin Jaloui's letter to Shaikh-3- Shaikh iihmad dated 20th Jamad Awal 1349 (13th October 1930) (b) His ^iajesty King Bin Saud's letter to Shaikh Ahmad dated 8th Jamad Awal 1349 (1st October '30] It is of interest to note that neither the K ing nor his Governor appears to be aware of the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait was recently the recipient of the K*C.I.E. at the hands of the King Emperor, for neither gives him his proper titles when addressing him. ^ have the honour to be.

The Shaikh of Kuwait's 'fidawis' and the Kuwait tribal eleioents (Araibdar) who have been camped at Jahjtra throughout the suiamer have now left that place and have moved to the eastern edge of the Shaqq.

All the Kuwait 'Awazim' and 'Araibdar' who were camped under the wall of Kuwait during the sjunmer months, have left for the hinterland in anticipation of the coming rains• Among these were Shaikh Ijnaifir of the al-Mafuth section of the A^man (a refugee) and his family^ also the lady Sarah with her infant Khalid al-Hathlain the wife and son of Fahad al-Hathlain respectively also refugees. 9© Han tush al Suwait visited the Political Agent on 18th November 1930, and reported that he had recently been sent for by Abdul Jabbar Effendi of the 'Iraq Desert Police, to Safwan, That official gave him to understand that the 'Iraq Government were dissatisfied with the way that Captain Glubb had run the Southern Desert tribes, and in particular how he had broken the power of the important Suwait leaders, and made many M nobodys n into Shaikhs. They were now going to change all Captain Glubb*s methods, and would shortly invite him Hantush and Ajemi to be the Shaikhs proper, and would hold them res ponsible under documents taken and given, for the whole of the Dhaf ir , their movements and future behaviour. Shaikh Hantush intimated that he was extremely suspicious of Abdul Jabbar's talk, especially when he was invited to cross into 'Iraq territory. This he said he would not do, neither would Ajemi unless they received most implicit assurances from 'Iraq, as to what 'allowances' they would get,and what power would be placed in their hands. Though he did not always see eye to eye with Captain Glubb, Hantush added, that he hoped he would not be taken away, as he and he only had been able to bring the Southern Desert under control. 10* It was rumoured in Kuwait on 14th November 1930 that Captain Glubb had been transferred to Trans-Jordan and that a member of the Shereefian family from Baghdad was going to take his place, with Headquarters at Nasriyeh al Muntafiq. This rumour coupled with what Hantush'^ toldV 0 told, the Political Agent rather gives colour to the story of the coming transfer of Captain Glubb, though the Political Agent has received no intiioation of anything as yet« 12» The presence of large numbers of Bin Saud's tribesmen in Kuwait, with the correct and very reasonable conduct of the King's officials on the Southern frontier lends one to hope that the coming winter will usher in a period of good will and mutual trust between Nejd and Kuwait. This welcome state of affairs is eminently satisfactory ♦ I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col. f Political Agent, Kuwait.U|ii+ G OITFI DBNTIAL .

In a casual conversation with him on the 20th November, he informed hb that Captain G-lubb had long ago left the ^raq Southern Desert fcr good and was now working in Trans - Jordania.

At the same time I would suggest that for the r present no actual representaions be made to His ^ajesty the j^ing as it is only fair to wait a little longer and see ibn ^rfaj on his return, or any other official, settles the ai matter to the satisfaction of ibn Khudaiyir and the Shaikh of Kuwai t. should nothing be done by 1iie end of the year then shall asx you to move in the matter. As a matter of It 5 -: -2--2- of principle I do not think we should let a raid past, however small, as nes^ot to do so is only looked upon as weakness, and only brings_further trouble in its wake. 4* On the E5th September sixty two camels, the property of Faleh ibn Zhudaiyir a well-todo merchant of -Kuwait .ere grazing in the vicinity of i^ana^ish (south—west of Kuwait State) and within Kuwait territory. The camels had with them 2 herdsmen© These were suddenly attacked by 5 armed men of Harb, two of v/hom commeneed firing on them, while three began to drive off the camels. The herdsmen replied to the fire, but one of them being hit in the arm ,e second, could noc prevent 16 camels being driven away# :j, « r ^e raiders made off in^the direction of Haf&amp;r al Batin, but before they got there, being in great straits j. »f /ui/er, oney killed two camels for their blood, and what water they could find in their stomach^s to drink, '^his left 14 camels, 0 • Arriving at Eafar they were detained for two days by ibn ~shwan of the Lutair, (Braih section) who recognized the animals as belonging to Kuwait, and the raiders as being Harb tribesmen and folloY/ers of ibn ^shaiyir (camped at Subaihiyeh). 7 * ^earing however to incur the wrath of the Harb genei-ally, who v/ere in the good books of ibn Saud, ibn ^shwan allowed the raiders to proceed to Dulaimiyeh in the Tawal al Dhafir (neutral area,, where they hirf themselves among some of their fellow tribes en, camped there.

Here they found their quarry and the oamels, but they also ran up against one Ilirjaan, a negro slave and offi cial of ^odullah ibn I.Iusaad, Governor of Hailo The latter at first refused to hand over the raiders or the oamels. but on i being tiireatened by Ibn j.rfaj's „aaa lie gave up the 5 raiders and promised to send in the 14 oamels to Kuwait by slow steps. 10• ./hen Faleh ibn Khudaiyir returned to Kuwait he handed over the prisoners to the Shaikh who had them confined and reported the case to ibn -^rfajo 11 • In the meantime messengers came in from the slave -arjaan to say that he lE.d changed his mind and would not hand over the camelso 12. On the 15th October ibn ^rfaj requested the Shaikh of Kuwait to have the prisoners transferred to him, adding tha* he had sent men to Dulaimiyeh to demand the camels a£rom 1-irjaan and would return them to Kuwait in due course. The Shaikh complied with the request on 17th October and sent the raiders to ibn '''rfaj^s camp at Safa in charge of ^bdul Rahman al I uhairib(ibn -i-rfaj's man). 13. On 13th November ibn Arfaj wrote in (translation marked 'A' submitted]and said he had recovered four of the missing camels, but that the rest had be n lost according to the slave I.irjaan's report, all except one which had been recognized as belonging to Obaid ibn ^dwani and had been returned to him under 'Arafa' Law. 14. On my advice ibn Khudaiyir was next sent off to ibn ^rfaj to take over the 4 camels, and see what he could do to recover the remaining 9 camels, which obviously were being kxjtc hidden away by Ivlirjaan. The Shaikh also instucted ibn 'hudaiyir to submit his bill to ibn ^fajwhich came to the following: t r::£40/- u ost of hired car used in persuit of raiders • xY ials 35/- Expenses for 'Bilasa', Rials400/- (Idia) or blood money for wounded herdsmen, nialsSOO/ ~ or two camels killed by raiders for the bloodo —^ ~ + -ial « 635/-/^v lo. In the meantime and before ibn Khudaiyir reached ibn Arfaj$Camp, the latter seized 50 camels from the Harh tribe (or 'Nikal^/as a fine, and sent them off for safe custody to al Shuwaish who is in charge of the King's own herds• 16. Then came news of ibn Arfaj's recall to I^ecca, and on ibn Khudaiytr's arrival at his camp (27th November 193CJ he was given his 4 camels only and told to return with a letter dated 27th November 1930 to the Shaikh of Kuwait( translation enclosed and marked 'B'), The gist of the missive as will be seen was that as he ibn ArfaJ was about to leave, he could do nothing more than give ibn Khudaiyir his 4 recovered camilso Ibn iirfaj did not even offer to compensate him with camels from amon^ those taken from Harb, which was the just thing to have done, nor did he offer to pay the bill of 1^40/- -f-Rials 635/- mentioned in paragraph 14 above. 1 7. Ibn Khudaiyir saw ibn ^rfaj leave for the south on 29th November 1930 and himself returned to Kuwait on 30th November 1930 from Safa, a disappointed man.

OGWMtt'TiiL mam Sir, In continuation of i^uwait Intelligence Report No. o49 dated 11th December 1930, I have the honour to report the following movements of tribes, tribal Shaikhs and other items of Desert Interest. (1) KUWAIT TRIBSS (ARAIBDAH &amp; FIDAWIS). As foreshadowed in paragraph 8 of my previous report, these have moved South into the Garaa region and are camped round about Abu Hiran. Their camels water at Tawil and Subaihiyeiu . (2) Diw'IR are said to have crossed Batin in a i&lt;ortii West direction and to be now EiBXExiB in 1 Iraq territory close to Athaiba following the grazing. (3) SHAMMAR .are still in the vicinity of Um Amarat Liahzul, and water at Jahara. (4) HARB under ibn Ashaiyir are still in the ~araa region South West of the Kuwait tribes. They are reported to be moving slowly towards the West probably with the intention of eventual ly going towards Ugubba near which place al-Firm is camped. Their camels water at Subailiiyeh. (5) AJIuAN (a). There appears a tendency for some sections of this great tribe to cross the Dahana and move into Nejd proper, where much lain nas fallen. Several sections are still ($ t&amp;ol ' 92— fff &amp; camped North of Jarriya^ and Safa in the vicinity of --iitiociri i/auiia# i T ii6ir camsls water at Safa Jarriyao (b). Shaikli Mohomed the son of Naif al- Hathlain, recently caiue up from Hiath to Jarriya, where he married a young Ajmi widow. After the ceremony he returned to Riath where practically all men and women members of the Hathlain family are camped® (c) Shaikh Junaifir of the Mafuth section of the Ajman a refugee in Kuwait territory recently proceeded by the desert route to the North, to interview Khalid al-l.Iohomed al Hathlain (Zab Sahman), al-Damir, ion Uthain, and Aodullah ibn Liukhian (slayer of Fahad ibn c-alouij the 4 Ajman Shaikhs who are still in the vicinity of Baghdad as refugees and guests of King Faisal. Apparently with the departure of ibn Mashur from ♦Iraq Khalid sent an urgent message to ibn Junaifir asking him to come up and see him and the others. Probably behind the move there is the intention of getting ibn Junairir to return to Nejd and intercede for them. Junaifir is known to have some influence with Ibn Saud he having been his hunting companion and teacher when the King was a boy. (d) Shaikh Nasir ibn Jumaa the Ajman Shaikh wno escaped from the R.A.F, and who was handed over to Ling's Agent ibn Sultan by the Kuwait authorities shortly after the R.A.F. surrendered the rebels in the spring of 1929, is credibly reported to have died in prison in Hoffuf. There is no reason to doubt the reiort 6. LTJTAIR. (a) ' Ilwa ' with the splendid rains which have fallen in I^ejd, there has been a general tendency for some sections of this tribe to cross the Dahana (like the Ajman) into xiejd proper from the summar area. The majority however have moved to the Southern end of the Garaa region and water at Safa and Jarriya. b) ^raili are in the G-araa region, more oror less at the V/estera end of the Musannat ridge. They water at Haffar al Batin, (c) -cil Shuwalsh with Bin Saud's camel heards is oamped South V/est of Khabari Watha. 7. xiWAZILI . are still in the Kuwait Neutral Area and water at Wafra, Shathaf and Grain. Some sections are further South in the Suda area, Q* (a)Further reports from the interior show that very good rains have fallen in ths Sudair, Washm and Aridh provinces. (h) Rain has fallen in Kuwait territory to the North of Jahcra and especially between al-Liyah and Safwan, For a distance of 30 miles round Kuwait towi however the rainfall has not exceeded i' all told and more is badly needed by the shephards. LIUSixBILiiH. Desert caravans (tribal) are still coming into Kuwait, but with the move of some of the tribes furthar into the interior, in distinctly fewer numbers than in the early part of December. 10. GEL j SRAL . (a) The Shaikh of Kuwait and the Political ^gent are still anxiously awaiting news of the appoint ment of a successor to Captain Glubb in the 'Iraq Southern Desert, as they have several minor cases of complaints against 'Iraq tribes which require settle- mait. It is hoped that information on the subject will soon be for^coming. ' (b), A report was current at Subaihiyeh on 28th December 1930 that Amir Saud had visited al- ''h- ° rU.., lr Shuwaish in the G-araa 3 days previously by motor car from Hiath. Confirmation is being sought of this. ^ 11. CONDI HON OF GOULTRY . (a) On the 19th December 3 / important * Nejdis who were said to be returning from Kuwait to the interior were found dead in the Shaqq South West of Thamilat Turqi (on the border of the Kuwait neutral area). The case appears to be one of murder and is^ /Vv -4- fZ surrounded in mystery. Nothing apparently was taken from the men. They were all three shot aead, their rifles and a dead camel being found near the bodies. (b). On 23rd December two Nejdis coming from Zubair to Kuwait on camels v/ere found with their throats cut to the East of the road near the Liyah ridge. A Salubbi has been caught who has confessed to the murder. He has admitted that he had as companions two othec iJulubbis, but so far has not divulged their names in spite of many beatings. (c). On the 23rd December anman with tatoo u marks such as Iraqis carry, was found dead near Legait in the Kuwait Southern Area. The body was lightly burried. Report has it that he was one of 3 Iraqis who passed through Jahara 3 weeks ago with some 50 camels which they were taking to Hassa for sale. Nothing has been heard of the 2 companions though enquiries are being made. The above three incidents, which have rather startled the countryside, are probably due to the hard times that t&amp;e Bedouin are going through. Poverty and distress are so evident everywhere due to lack of rain that it is a matter wonder that more persons have not takai to 'Banditry' as a means of livelihood. 12. TOURS . (a) The Political Agent on 28th December made an exhaustive tour of the Kuwait Southern boundary from a point close to Khabrat Duwish to Ras Kaliya. The tour included Thamilat Turqi Grain hill^Sahud or the name given to the ^rain wells, and Araifjan wells. Many mistakes were found on the map, such for instance \ as Tamilat Turki which should be quite another 5 miles South of its present position on the map. (b). The Wara and Burgan hills were climbed and ^ specimen pieces of bitumen were collected from' 5 ' Ci' both places. A1 Burgan 'Massif' would appear to be shaped like an old volcano with the crates containing I a lake of bitumai. This seams to have been covered with a thick layer of sandy deposit of considerable age, but in one or two places the bitumen is finding its way to the surface in the form of springs. The bitumen oosing out was quite soft and smelt strongly of crude oil. Apparently the Bedouin collect and take away most of what comes to the surface for use as medicine for camel mange etc. (c) The following information^ regarding the southern border 'wells' was collected. SUBAIHIYffl .Many and very fine wells covering an area of 30 acres;all revetted with brushwood; water only 10 feet from surface; sufficient for 2 brigades easily or as Bedouin put it for 4000 tents. THAlalLAT TURKI. Seven water holes only with rocky bottoms, a mere trickle at this season and enough only for -g- a company. After rains, more is available it is. said. GRAIN. Wells situate 3 miles South East of the prominent hill of the same name. There are six of them with water 8 feet deep. Water appeared plentiful and good and sufficient for a regiment of infantry. aRAIFJAN . Consisting of 13 excellent but rather deep wells. Sides of which were of masonry. Two large cement troughs available for watering animals. Supply available for a full regi ment of cavalry or possible more. I have the honour to be, Sir, ^ Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col.,After Note. It is confirmed today (30th December 1930) that the Amir Saud al-Abdul Aziz al-Saud reached Nta in Hassa on 24th December on a hawking expedition and that he sent messages to al-Shuwaish camped in the Liujdair north of Safa that he intended coraing up to hawk in the region .¥est of Khabari Watha and also inspect his fathers camels. It is probable therefore that the story told to the Politi cal Agent at Subaihiyeh on 29th instant that the Amir Saud had reached al-Shuwaish*s camp, is true. (b) Shaikh Abdullah al Khalifa of Bahrain is reported to have landed near Jubail on a hawking expedition and to be working up to Jarriya where he has been invited by ibn Shuiaair. It is probable that he has met the Amir Saud. (c) News has reached Kuwait but not yet confirmed that ibn Saud*s Customs Director *Jf for Hassa, has placed a customs postirwiii Dohat Balbul near Jebel Llainfa on the coast. This point being the Southernmost point bf the old Kuwait boundary. (d) A telegram frbm Mecca to Kuwait dated 26t]ii December 1930 said that H.M. the King was about to leave for Riath shortly with 80 cars. : Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.4 ) 0,, 1 I CONQDEmiAL.

Zubair have entered the northern area of Kuwait as well as the Bani llallk (Basrah). These shoild not be confused with Bani Malik Muntafik. Both are scattered in the area north of the Bay of Kuwait, and are in very poor way, most of this yea^s lambs having died from want of nourish ment already. These unfortunate people apparently iL gamble on reaching Kuwait as the first rains fell, and are now suffering in consequence. A few of the Basra Bani Malik shepherds, are also at 'Malah' 15 miles South of Kuwait and are labouriogsly moving South towards the area whene rain has fallen, (9) RAIN . During the period under review excellent rain has fallen about Araifjan, Subaihiyefc, North Hassa, Tawil and Manaqish, also in the G-araa region (Nejd). Closer inp Rain is very urgently required, especially for 50 miles round about Kuwait. Local shepherds are in great dis tress and are finding the greatest difficulty in feeding their flocks. do). ammAL . (a) On 6th January H.E. the Shaikh received a very cordial letter from H.M. King Bin Saud dated Riath 26th Decem ber, in which the latter said he had just arrived, but would be compelled to return to kecca on 15th January on account of urgent business there. (b) Shaikh Sirfcan al Zuwaid btother of Shaikh Shirshab al- Sahan al Zuwaid of the important Muntafik shepherd tribe of the Budur visited the Political Agent on IG^h January 1931. He gave out confidentially that he was on his way to Riath to see the King. (c) Shaikh Salman al Humud al Subah reached Jarriya by car recently (5th January 1951) on one of his hawking expeditions; and H.E. Jhaikh Ahmad reached Khabari Watha. Game has been so scarce this year owing tolate rains that sportsmen have had to go very far afield in search of bustard. (d) A1 Shuwaish, the official in charge of ttie King 1 s ca mels in the Garaa is reliable reported to have been ^ sent for to Riath to meet the ^ing # (e) A persistant rumour is current fcn Kuwait that ii.k. King Bin Saud has arranged wi th the Persian Government that Persian Haj Pilgrims should from next year be landed at Balbul 3a./ on the Has^a coast and be con veyed to NTA, After a period of rest, they would be conveyed to Riath by cameL convoy and then on to Mecca by car convoy. It is said that Bin Saud f s Customs Director for Hassa 'Al Tawil' not only pro ceeded to Dohat Bulbul recently to open a custom house, but also to push forward the above arrangements for the pilgrims traffic. 11, K&amp;i'L KiSWS , One Ibrahim al l.luzaiyin 'Standard Bearer' to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and a reliable man returned from a three weeks sojourn in Riath on 27th December• He visited the Political Agent on 6th January and among other things reported the following tather interesting news. (a) Great scarcity existed throughout Kejd and in the capital. During his visit there wheat was being sold at 7 lbs per 1/-. Rice was even more expensive. (b) From Hail had also come the report that rice had reached the high figure of Rs 35/- per 80 lb bag. (c) Three relief kitchens were in daily operation at Riath for poor women of the town and for poor Bedouin women, and men respectively. (d) Food at the coast ports apparently existed in plenty but camel transport wax not ^available to convey it into the interior owing to lack of grazing which had reduced the working capacity of Nejd camels by 75^&lt;, (e) The recent rains in Nejd were considered a special~4r— Ciod send in this respect, as it was hoped caiosls would uaoover rapidly with the grazing that would follow. (f) The Amir Saud r s popularity was fast catching up that of his august parent, and every where he was received with enthusiasm and acclamation. In physique, appear ance, personal bravery and capacity to stand hardship^ the narrator said^ he was an exact copy of his father. Apparently liie chief charm of the Heir Apparent lay in his ability to make himself pleasent to small and great and to reach and poor alike# ( GOMkiflNT:y po much attention need not be paid to this. No doubt suitable largesse had had its effect on the narrator.) (g) Faisal al Duwish, Ibn Humaid^Ibn Hathlain and Ibn Lami were all in good health. By day they were allowed to roam about the interior of the fort under the eye of a couple of attendant sentries and were not even manacled. At sunset they all had to enter a long room or Diwan and after having one leg placed in wooden 'stocks', they partook of food. This was not of bad quality. The prisoners possessed bedding to sleep on and to cover themselves with. Svery Friday 'ibn Shalhub' the King^ Comptroller of Household visited the prisoners and asked if they wanted of anything. The narrator^ said he got the above facts from one of the jailors and from the Amir Saud himself. (COMMENT: While it is refreshing to hear of the better treatment of these unfortunates, too much reliance cannot be placed on the above story). 12. Early in January it came to the knowledge of the Poli tical Agent that a small party of Azerij tribesmen arrived from Nasriyeh 'Iraq, with some 40 British pattern .305 rifles for sale in Kuwait. These were duly disposed of after paying the usual customs duty required of Bedouins entering the town and desiring to sellsell their weapons. While there is no law to prevent the sale of arms brought in from the desert, it might be interesting to find out where the rifles came from in the first jilace. In most cases when weapons are for sale, the local Grovemment purchases transfers them to the State Armoury. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

I am in hljh hopes that the above forms the closing chapter of a rather troublesome case, and I consider that the Shaikh of Huwait has shown ^ isdom and jud^eiiBiit in bringing it to such a satisfactory conclusion, for it must not be forgotten that considerable pressure lias from time to tii.a been brought to bear on him to confuse the isoue and make away /' with the clained camels, a course which would not have been very difficult of accomplishment. It certainly would have .led to his ima ination to do so for kxx like his au usl; appej —o~au ust rival he is largely a Jedouin at heart, and would have loved nothing better than to have sot the best of the bargain.

They reported to the Political Agent that the .amir Saud came up to the Suiaman Area (Tawal al Mutair) only, and did not enter the Garaa district as reported in this o-Tice Intelligence Report No. 3^3 dated 27th December 1930. (C ) Reference paragraph I (c) of Report No.3^3 dated 27th December 1930. Shailch ibn Junaifir never reached Baghdad, he changed his mind and joined the Araibdar instead. ,^ a oaravan of Sbei tribesmen reached Kuwait on 19th January 1931 to purchase provisions. It is very unusual to see members of such a distant tribe ooming into Luwait # ^ q ) Reference paragraph 10(d) of Intelligence' S ' Intelligence Report No.9 dated 13th January 1931, Al- Sliuwaish has sent word to the LutairjTrom xiiath, that transport oamels to convey goods from the coast to the interior were urgentJLy required in the South and that good prices were 'being offered and would be paid. He advised all those having strong camels to take them South. This connects with the news of food scarcity in Nejd reported in paragraph 11 of report No* 9 dated ISth January «' ■ 1931. (f) On 27th January 1931 a fairly reliable Kuwaiti employed by the Shaikh, returned from Riath. He left there on 20th January and reported that the King had left the same day for Llecca. This news has since been Confirmed in a telegram from Jeddah which says that Bin Saud reached Llecca on 25th January. (g) The same Kuwaiti reported that a fort was in process of construction at Jarriya and that the walls were now 5 feet high. (h) The same person reported that Ibn Lami died in Riath the day he reached that town. He also stated that he was present at the funeral* Further confirmation is being sought of this* (i) Local rumour has it that when the Jarriya fort is finished, others will be commenced at Safa and Haffar and that a telephone line will connect the three. This last is highly improbable. The building of these forts has of course long been rumoured, and there is little doubt that their construction Y /ill in time he carried out. It should be realized however that by 'fort* 1 is only meant the usual Arab enclosure consisting of a mud wall 10 feet high, with mud towers at the four corners. The whole being usually 50 to 80 yards square* Obviously the object of these forts is firstly to command the wells where Ajman and Mutair tribal camels must drink and se- / condly to control the main trade routes frcm Kuwait to I.ejd which pass through the places where these forts areare contemplated.

I also attach traiislation of a letter (c) fran His Excel lency the Shaikh of Kuwait to myself dated 19th Hamadhan (7tli February 193l)whidh is relevant to the facts disclosed in letter (B). • Regarding letter^and first enclosure# Bin ^aud obviously here acknowledges the Shaikh of Kuwait f s letter mentioned in paragraph 9 'B' of my confidential despatch No, 10 dated 24th January 1931 to your address merely reiterating someway; confusedly what he wrote in his letter dated 9th Jamad Awal 1349 (1st October 1930) to ohaikh Ahmad* This was fully dealt with in my confi- dential despatcn ^.o, 334 of 2nd I.oveaber 1930, Bin Saud evidently approves the measures taken by the Shaikh and is leaving his son,the Amir Saud, to remit the money for the camels and bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion. ■'■ s - e&amp;ards the second enclosure to letter (ii). This refers to the claim of Faleh ibn Khudaiyir reported\ / 1 (vru \ v V &gt; reported in my confidential despatches No.350 dated 17th. December 1930 and No#354 dated 29tb. December 1930. Bin Saud here has seen fit to reply on behalf of his son the Amir Saud to the letter and sad; 'Mulhaq' sent to the latter by the Shaikh of Kuwait on 24th Shaban (14th January v vi^ 1931)^ paragraph 9 C. of my confidential despatch No.10 of 24th January 1931. Reading between the lines it would appear that Bin Saud is annoyed at the conciliatory attitude adopted by his son^and as reported in my confi- ^ dential despatch 354 dated 29th December, and as good as tells the Shaikh that ibn Khudaiyir may consider himself lucky to have got back 4 of his camels, and will be given no more. The letter is rather disquieting and shows Bin Saud in 'minatory' and 'difficult' mood. I fear also that it may reflect a possible change in the King's attitude towards Kuwait. 4« I now come to the King's letter (B). V This seems to ipessage danger, or at least a reversal of the recent friendly policy of Bin Saud towards Kuwait of the last six months. The Shaikh of Kuwait agrees with my interpretation of the letter and is somewbat worried and anxious about Bin Saud's unreasonable accusations© He has recalled to mp the well known trait in Bin Saud's character which leads him always to look round for an excuse or 'hajja' to justify himself in the jiyes of his people (the Kussalmeen) and incidentally himself, when ever he is about to strike a blow or do something unpleasent « The something unpleasent^I think f is not very far to seek and means ^as far as one can fore see^a renewal of the 'blockade' in all its original strictness in the not too distant future. As will be seen from my Intelligence Report for the 1st half of February, rather disquieting news has recently reached Kuwait from Riath regarding the King's fut'ire intention in this respect# For several months past as you are aware the Bedouin of North East Arabia have oeen permitted to come into Kuwait anfl buy provisions — ^ ' - /A. ( provisions, possibly because of the famine conditions ^ ^ that have prevailed in the interior ) though I have pre ferred to put it down to a change of heart and increased good will. There are however signs that this state of affairs is to cease, as soon as the projected ring of forts at Lita, Jurriya, Safa and Hafar is completed - of these Nta is ready and Jarriyah will shortly be completed, the other two have not yet been started. According to shaikh Ahmad, the method to be employed is for armed Fords scour working between these posts to/sEzs the country and block all routes from Kuwait to the interior, a c^uite easy 0De— ration, and far more efficient way of working the blockade than by the old raiding party system. ^• According to the Shaikh also al~Shuwaish the important l-Iutairi entrusted with the ICing* s flocks and camels in the Summan has secretly sent word into Kuwait that the above is the plan adding that Bin Saud himself issued these commands to him the day before he left Riath for Mecca on 20th January last and told him to warn other Llutair leaders. The story has also been confirmed a responsible Agent recently in from Artawiyeh and by another equally reliable message sent me from the LIutair headquarter camp, it is of course less easy to say when this tightening up of things is to commence, but the Shaikh thinks it will be evident after month of Ramadan is over. ^'turn now to the accusations made by Bin Saud in his letter (B)and which it is anticipated will be used to justify his change of policy,. The murders referred to were reported in this office confidential Intelligence r QPort No^&gt; dated 27th December paragraph 11 (a) and (b), and in spite of most streneous efforts on the part of the Shaikh and his people no trace at all has so^ far been found of the murderers, though secret agents are still searching day and night among Bedouins and townsmen for the slightest clue. 8 * ' in Sand'sb^ld statement that the murdererst * Imurderers must be Ajman or llutair Arabs is both unjust and rediculous. It is far more likely that both were cases of olood-feud especially as none of the murdered persons* goods were touched# * • .oin Saud assumes that both murders occurred in Kuwait territory, he is incorrect in this ; as that of the 2 men (a) occurred in the Shaqq. depression South- West of Thamilat Turki and West of Jebel Fawaris i.e. on the border-line between Nejd and the Kuwait neutral area — so outside Kuwait territory proper. 10 • Again Bin Saud implies that all five murdered men were Nejd subjects. He is again wrong. The two mentioned in paragraph (b) of this letter, though certainly of Nejd extraction, were Kuwait subjects, x'atxier and son having resided here for 30 and 17 years respectively. • - L ' s 2 men killed in the Shaqq were however Nejd subjects, and were part of a small caravan from Anaiza which nad been to oubail and was returning via tne northern route of Jartiya Safa etc. for fear of the Ajman. Whilst camped near Khabari 7/atha three of the caravan*s members came up to Kuwait to replenish supplies and possibly to take contraband also. It was when they jQ~e returning that they were ambushed A significant point and worth noting is that a standing order of Bin Baud's has long existed among the oedouin to the effect tiiat oaly Nejd merchant trying to take goods from Kuwait into the interior, could be attacked] killed and his goods taken from him with impunity. The possioility that some of Bin Saud's own Bedouin committed the deed must not be ruled out. 15 * ln conclusion I beg to tender apologies for the inordinate length of this despatch, but experience has shown me that small events connected with Nsjd often assume very large proportions later, but that if they are aeait with fully at the time and on the principle offuy&lt;t§ 4 of 'getting ones blow in first', it becomes easy to counter the attack, when it comes, by the use of the in formation so collected.

It is that on the 17th Rajab (8th December 1930) 4 three persons, natives^Anaizah left Kuwait. They were al- Muhaillani, ibn •Ubaidallah, and Muhammad al-Muhaimid al- Abdul Jabbar. They had with^them provisions for the owners of their animals at the Qra'ah. When they reached ash-Shaq they halted for the night, but were attacked and killed by some unknown people. Their articles were left and nothing Marginal Note, J was taken away at all. actually 4 days) (b) Also on the same day on which this event took later ) place, Ibn Nafjan and his son, natives of Anaizah, were travelling from Zubair to K UW ait. When they reached the Raudhatain, they were killed, and the murderers took none of their goods. (c) .prom this it appears that the murder was not conmatted for uiie purpose of robbing or plundering, as usual- khe case, out was an act of vengence directed against the people of Najd. The crime we believe, was committed by none Oiyher than those Mutair and AJman ^persons who have taken refuge in Kuwait, namely the remnants of the rebels whose fathers and relatives we killed in defense of Nejd and -2-• '3. ^ c ' v; lr -2- and Kuwait and tlie adjacent oo\intries # (d) You will recognize tliat these two cases are not like ordinary ones, whlcli can be neglected or cosidered as matters of no importance. If yfctirt strict investigations both to discover the criminals and ptmish them with the most severe punishment of death, is not taken troubles will continue and will result in further calamities for both countries, which will neither please you nor us. (e) It is impossible that the people of Nejd should stand with their hands tied and be prevented from defendin themselves and taking their revenge on a small remnant of criminal persons who do not care what consequence their wicked deeds may bring. (f) We expect that you will send us an immediate reply about the steps taken to arrest the murderers before matters become so serious that they cannot be mended, and before the criminals discover further opportunities of doing harm on the frontiers generally. (g) It is very incumbent to start immediately on the suffocation of this revolt against authority while it is in its craddle, and before it grows up. 1 : i —* ) mM* I m iransLation a Lulliaq to letter No. nil dated the 26tli Sha'ban 1349 (mh January 1931) from H.M.King of the Hij^z and x.ajd and Dependencies, to K.3.

This caused much dissatisfaction. (c). Most of the Mutair Shaikhs went to Riath, but only ibn Shuaair, ibn Musaiyir and ibn Maziad were granted interviews. (d) Bandar son of Faisal A1 Duwish applied for and was granted permission to reside at Artawiyeh much to ibn Maziad's disgust. Apparently he accompanied the King from Mecca. (e). The agent had no reliable news of the important rebel /leaders, and could say nothing in confirmation of ibn Lamis death. (11). The same informant who came up via Jarriya al Ilya, said that he was told by Ibn Shuqair that Bin Saud's intention was to complete the Jarriya fort, and then start building others at Safa an Haffar. That immediately after the 'ID', he had ordered the strictest Blockade to commence against Kuwait, and that all Nejd tribes would be once again forbidden to purchase supplies from there. This blockade would be worked by armed motor cars working between each fort and scouring the country right up to the borders of Kuwait. (IS) General . (a). The Nta fort as already reported was completed some weeks back and is a powerful building containing some 50 rooms (b). The news about the coming blockade was confirmed on 12.2.31 by a messenger who visited some Mutair Tribes men camped at Abu Halaifa, and warned thsm to return to-4' ■(, * ■™) to Nejd, and to leave their present oamp as soon as possible, as no Nejd Tribes would in future be allowed taxfutMra to come to Kuwait. (o) A1 Shuwaisb in charge ot Bin Saud's camels, sent in on 13-2-31 and informed some friends in Kuwait that Bin Saud had personally told him at Riath of the coming tightening up of the Blockade# He Al Shuwaish stated tharf he had begged that the Mutair and AJman be allowed to make one more visit to buy supplies for ths Spring and Summer, but that Bin Saud had only said he would consider the matter# (d). On 15-2-31 news was received in Kuwait that 5 Ajman men probeeding to Buraida with six camels laden with foodstuff were seized near Safa by one of fr**- ibn Jaloui^ patrols under al Shajaan, and had had all their goods as well as camels confiscated. (e) Tribal gossip has it that Bin Saud is furious at the escape of ibn Mashur and that not only will all Nejd tribes be forbidden in future to visit Iraq or Kuwait for the purchase of supplies, but that patrols are already out to drive all Nejd tribes south from the frontier line and prevent them fraternizing with their Northern neigh bours. Conment. It seems clear that Bin Saud intends tightening up the Blockade at an early date, and that Iraq generally as well as Kuwait, will be included in his programine. (12)•(a). On 10-2-31 one Nassar bin Barjas al Ali al Saadun arrived from Riath and visited the Political Agent. (b) Nassar stated that he had been on a visit to Abdullah al Mohamed al Ali, a relative of his who 11 years ago went to Riath and became a Wahabi 'Alim'. (c). He added that he met Mr.Philby at Riath and saw him pray in the Great Mosque on several occasions. Mr.Philby had a I6ng beard and wore a red Kaffiya and black Agal, and appeared on terns of friendship with the Riath Ulema, -5-[\Zl) /(f Ulema, whom he oontinually visited# (d).

Bin Saud may have come to the conclusion that vre mean business over the question of the blockade, and in order to forestall a determined demand from His ^ajesty's Government in this direction, he may have decided to place ' Customs xosts '-nt each of these Places covered by 'strong points'' so tint if he is forced to allow ..uwait trade to enter Nejd, he will be in a posi tion to take full Nejd customs duty from any caravans leaving Kuwait. Actually this course would not only be a wise move and settle the whole of Kuwait's problem, but iim ^aud could effectively prevent caravanfe getting past such customs posts, both in winter and in summer for the only available water lies where they are situate during nine months of the year.

I am desired to say that,in view of the friendly spirit dis played by Ibn 3aud in sending this cordial invitation to the Shaikh, Colonel Biscoe doubts the necessity of taking the matter any further at the present momen^and feels that it is not of sufficient importance to risk causing annoyance to Ibn Saud and thus upsetting the friendly relations which it is our policy to maintain and upon which will depend to a large extent the successful i^sue of any representation that may be made later in regard to the raising of the blockade. If, however, the Shaikh is particularly desirous that represen tations should be made in the matter, Colonel Biscoe, on hearing from you, will be prepared to reconsider his decision. He was interested to hear about the Shaikh's contemplated ... Lt.Col.H.R.P. icicson, /.i .T^. , Political Agent, KUWAIT .ill contemplated risit to ^n^land, and presumes that if under taken it would be a private visit. As you will see he has not mentioned the visit in his telegram, since he gathers that the Shaikh has not yet come to any definite decision in the matter, and Orientals are somewhat addicted to moot ing such projects without any real intention of carrying them out. In the present acute financial crisis in .ngland it is doubtful if His Majesty's Government would be prepared to incur any Ir^rge expenditure on the entertainment of the Shaikh, though doubtless they would show him some courtesies and afford him all possible facilities for seeing thin^s^ etc* .Vould it cost the Shaikh less to go to ^.n^land than it would to go to i^ecca, or is the excuse given to Ibn Saud merely a. pretext? There is no likelihood of Colonel 'iscoe meeting Ibn Saud before next autumn at the earliest, since as far as is known ^bn Saud will remain in the liejaz till then. iiy 53/7 &amp; 61/23 Telegram From P. • Political Agent, Kuwait. Political Hesident, Bushire, No. 29 To Dated 13th. March 1931 I personally think visit to Mecca would he sotnl move. Sheikh would genuinely like to go hut monev question forhids him. Trip would certainly have good polit- -ical results though Sheikh is careful to say that settle- -ment of 'blockade question need not he expected unless His Majesty's Government take a hand in negotiations. Sheikh calculates that presents he would have to make in Mecca would come to Es. 60,000 ftpart from actual Journey expenses which are hea®y, as 'by custom, he must take leading citizens of Kuwait with him. These journey expenses woiId total an- -other lis.20,000 if he went 'by car ana Ks.40,000 if he went b&gt; camel. In present serious financial condition of Kuwait Sheikh does not consider ahpve expenditure justified; on the other hand trip to England, Sheikh thinks will not ex- -ceed Rs. 20,000 as he would travel privately in European style with a c .uple of companions only.

I write to you in Arabic because it is easy to write thits. ./inter is nearly finished here, and I thank ^od that we had nothing to complain of from the severity of cold weather. We only were annoyed by the fog which came near to suffocating us. Truly winter here is very nice, but very annoying when rain falls. I like England very much, as well as the English people, although outwardly ohey would appear to be somev/hat rough in their manners and do not like ti to be acquainted with the strangers. This appears most to those who did not mix with them. But I like their ways and general • # characteristics much. They are great in everything, and I believe that these very characteristics of iiracxi theirs are stronger for ggod, than the Navy of which they boast. The more I mix with the people the more I admire them. 2. On the 23rd April I s^all deliver a lecture about Arabia in the Royal Asiatic Society, in which I shall include the dis positions (or location) of Arabs in general, and some of the Arab customs ignored by many who know nothing about the Arabs. 3. On the 20th February we shall hold a Reception at Hyde Park Hotel to commemorate the Coronation-day of King Abdul Aziz in the Hijaz. We postponed this party from the 8th January on account of the death of H.M.the King's sister. , 4. There have been many efforts to remove the misunderstanding] that has existed between King ibn Saud and the ^on'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and both Sir Andrew^ and I have succeeded in removing same. We also tried to arrange that -2-that the Hon'ble the Political Resident should meet with the King j last month, but the short tjp£e stay of the Kin^. in Nejd prevented this. 5. We both hope that an opportunity will occur for the Hon T ble the Political Resident 1 to visit Hijaz, so that all difficulties may be removed from hearts. He may be able to settle all questions connected with the Gulf, especially those of Kuwait, which grow more complicated as time passes. 6. I am very delighted because of the permission given by H?M,the King to some tribes and people of Nejd to travel to Kuwait for w Musabalah n , and because of the progress of the n Baladiyah n in Kuwait, and the satisfaction that it is giving to the people. Colonel Dickson's name will always be remembered as long as i ^Baladiyahs' are mentioned in the Persian Gulf.IJJ 7. As to the use of 'Abas' which Shaikh Ahmad has ordered i to be given up, this has certainly economic advantages, but it is the minds that have to be changed and not the dress. The Shaikh | may possibly on his own do so, but you must certainly advise him to pay attention to education which acts as^shining light over every country. Shaikh Ahmad is man of great heart, and can easily be convinced. I love Kuwait and its people from the bottom of my heart and wish it every success. Therefore, the best that I should like to wish for her and to hear, is that you are advising the Shaikh to progress and civilize Kuwait, which indeed will make everyone remember you for all time. 8* Last month London was full of those who attended the i -^ndian Round Table Conference, but now after the delegations have left for home, the movement is transferred to India.

I agree that it is too early for us to really know the Shaikh's mind about a trip to London. About Faleh bin Khudaiyr's 12 camels, I agree with the Political Resident, and think we may leave the matoer in abeyance lor the time being. I can square the Shaikh about this. You wil1 notice from my confidential despatch No.36 dated 20th March 1931 to the Political Resident that Faleh bin Khudaiyir left for Riath on 9th March 1931 armed witi a letter to the Amir Saud. He may quite possibly get all he wants. I personally think he will, with the good atmosphere that exists now. I hope he does for Saud as you know has 40 of the Harb camels taken as a fine. 5 * It was great getting Bin Saud to stump up the ooso of the 53 camels. This is far greater triumph than you may think. Bin Saud never admits a fault, or disgorges like this. On top of all has come your cheque for £ 3,000 received today, which is splendid.

Ofilv OChFiQtHTlALJ^^l Sir, k 1 * la continuation of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.22 dated 28th February, I have the honour to report the following items of Tribal and Hinterland news. 1. KUWAIT TRIBES (Araibdar &amp; Fidawiyeh). The majority of these are in the southern! portion of the Kuwait neutral area and just over the Nejd border. Some sections have moved West to Khabari Watha. 2. DHAFIR &lt;Sc SHAHMAR (Ajemi and ibn Towala). Reported to be in the Summan round about Mahaqqabba.Reports from the Mutair country show that their presence is not welcome and that considerable friction exists between them and the Mutair. 3. HARB. as for (2) above. 1 4. AJMAN &amp; AWAZIM. » No change. One of the Ajman Shaikhs re cently in Kuwait informed the Political Agent (9th March 19 31) that nearly all the Ajnan Shaikhs were going to Mecca this year, and had arranged to complain to the King in a body to the effect that they felt keenly that he the king had not forgiven them properly yet, that they were very poor and needed his favour upon them once more,and that he should either pardon them from his heart and treat them as he used to do, or allow them to migrate to some other country. The informer himself then proceeded to the Haj.5 o GENERAL . (a), Watha the sister of Faisal al Duwish visited the Political -^gent on the 9th I'aroh 1931, and repOtBd that her brother was being better treated sinoe the King came to Riath* She definitely denied the report of ibn Lami , s death^a couple of Mufcair follov/ers only had died in prisono (b) • Abdullah son of Mahamoud ibn Dhari al Iviohamad Shaikh of the Zoba (Iraq) visited tfogsobk Kuwait on the 2nd Liarch 1931. It is not known whetlfcrt? he v/ent from Kuwait. (c). The report was current in Kuwait on End Llarch 1931 that Mohamed ibn Tallal al Raschid the Ex Emir of Hail had escaped from custody. There is no confirmation at all of the story so far, (d). Abduliah al Hajeri, one of Bin Saud's Customs officials in Hoffuf arrived at Kuwait on the 3rd March 1931 J en route to Egypt and Hijaz via Baghdad. He visited the Political Agent and said it was he who had recently built the Nta fort. It contained 2 wells of sweet water. He seemed anxious to avoid discussing the question® (e). Some 500 pilgrims left Kuwait for Mecca (Haj) on ^th, 6th, 7th and 8th Of march. Many more are reported to have gone from the Kuwait tribes, as well as from the Ivlutair, Ajman and Awazim. (fii. A cordial invitation has come from King Bin Saud to the Shaikh inviting him to Mecca, this was followed by another letter from the Amir Saud from Riath asking if he could go with him. Although the Shaikh has felt obliged to dfecline for financial reasons, the letterSji^ show greatly improved relation between these two rulers«» (g). His Majesty King B^n Saud has sent in the value of the 53 camels, which Nejd claimed as having belonged to the late rebels and the camels have been handed over® It will be recalled that Kuwait from the first refueed to return the camels until the price paid for them by the Araibdar had been \ produced. The Shaikh supported by the Political Agent hadU yDl^&gt; had asked tliat the inatter be settled under the tribal Lav; of 'ARAFA'. This was agreed to by the King who has now sent in the money. The satisfactory ending of this old case is an additional proof of improved reltions. (hK Travellers from Riath who arrived on 17th March 1931 report great flights of Locusts between that town and the Summan. It is stated that thesejd have come too late in the season to do much damage, as their young even though they hatch will be killed by the summer sun. This remains to be seen# (i). The Political Agent visited Araifjan on the south- e^.n uO-i JejT ol Kuwait twice during the fortnight under review# He has now a standing camp pitched close to the large lake which v/as recently formed immediately to the east of the Araifjan wells.

(a) oiiaikhs Ajemi as Suwait and Hantush are reportei to have moved to the Bishuq area from the Sum- man where they nearly came to blows with the Mutair. (b) Shaiidi Jadaan was reliably reported to have camped in the Shaab al Faisal a shallow valley North East of Safa at the end at the mouth. ^ /Ith him was caaped Shaikh Amash ibn Abul CJhair of the Tuatha section of the Dahamsha (Anizeh) with 40 tents. This individual claims to be connected with Kumit since Mubarak's days, to) Bo in Ajemi and Hantush are reported to have \(^ X &gt; n 1have individually gone to Hail on a vis it f to ibn M t saad the Governor there but this is doubted # (d) The Samidda group of the Dhafir under Lezzam al Badrah are also reported in the Summan (kVestern end) but it is not known whether they went West with AJemio Probably not # The appearance of this tribe so far South is remarkable• ie) Latest reports show that Lezzam al Badr*^ Jadaan « aud Jali ibn Juraivid all prominent Shaikhs of the Dhafir recently left for Mecca and the Haj, though one suspects their main object is to see Bin Saud to get what they can out of him, (f) Ibn Hallaf Shaikh of the al-Said section recently was fined by ibn Jaloui 25 she- camels, 1 rifle and 1 mare for some reason unknown to the writer. NOTE . Movements of the above tribe are not usually reported by this office, seeing that they are an * Iraq, tribe, and are no doubt always care fully watched. Their having moved as far Souiii as tiie Summan, the country of their hereditary enemies the Mutair, has however caused somewhat of a sensation in Kuwait, where they are credited with a desire to go over to Nejd # Probably it was only lack of grazing in the North that drove them so far to the South* The whole of the Summan and Bahana areas certainly have splendid grazing this year. On the other hand the Dhafir are a shifty lot and can always be trusted to get the most out of both sides if opportunity comet their way and Ajemi Tiio may be definitely ^S, AL JASHAM V This smftll but aristocratic Muntafik tribe under its Shaikh Agab, has also moved down to the Summan region, the camels of al-Barak al Saadun and bint Maziad Pasha al Saadun as well as other Euphrates Shaikhs* 4 # SHAMMAR (Ibn Tawala) are reported to have moved West to the Bishuk area# 5.

Several thousands of these nomads are now concentrated in the Kuwait neutral area between Subaihiyeh and Arak and are enjoying splendid grazing along side of the Kuwait Araibdar# Both they and the Awazim almost daily send up to Kuwait large quantities of rich n ghi n by donkey caravan for sale in the bazaar and the waggiya of this commodity (4% lbs) now stands at Rs 2/3/- showing how well they are faring. They will not s oart fo -L i;oine till after the Id* Among these shepherd or ^Shawiyeh' tribes are the Juareen, the Sharaifat, some sections of the Zahairiyeh, the Alb^ Sal eh, the al G-hazzi and Jani Malik (Basrah and Hartha sections)* (b) The Zaiyad and Budur shepherd tribes are reported to be on the north edge of the Dahana South of th. Bishuk area (due South from the 'Iraq neutral zone). (c) Shaikh Nasir al Gubeh chief of the Juareen accompanied by Obaid al Sallal Shaikh of the Sharaifat visited the Political Agent on 3rd April 1931, Both have their camps half way between Jahara and Safwan as well as a considerable number of their tribesmen. From this central position they said, they could keep touch with their folk further South and their friends nearer home. t id) Muhaisin al Dhuwaif and Atshan al Hussain al Dhuwaif t Shaikhs of the Zuhaiyiyeh visited the PoliticalfV* i (in) Aggnt on 6tli April 1931. They reported that their people were camped West of Jebel Sanam still and had suffered much from lack of grazing. They had not started ifrnrt early enough for the South and it was too iate to do so now* (e) The Shaikhs mentioned in (C) and (d) as well as most of the other Shepherd Shaikhs are known to the Political Agent. f. TAKING OF ZIKAT &amp; KODA BY KSJD OgglGlAIS FROM llWfi? i_ I l iVv/ TRIBES . As far as can be gathered, all the Dhafir Shaikhs mentioned in paragraph 2 above including these Muntafik tribes like the Jasham, and camels belonging generally to the various Saddun families who are or have been in the Mutair country or West of it, have this year paid Zikat to t^e Bin Saud 1 s officials. The 'Zaiyad' (sheep tribe) also had to pay sheep tax, when camped between the Bashuk and the Batin. The official who collected this Zikat and Koda tax was one Ibn Mirjan, Ibn Musaad's negro official who was responsible for the loss of Farhan ibn Khudaiyi^s camels some time back. This individual apparently said he was ordered to collect the tax by ibn Musaad in spite of many protests that neither t Iraq nor Kuwait ever taxed Shammar or Sa^at tribesmen when they were at Safwan Jahara and Subaihiyeh last year f and that the officials of Nejd were even allowed to cross the border and take their own taxes. Their protests hed no effect. The only per son urtio was not taxed was Shaikh Amash of the Tuatha section of the Dahamsha and his following who claimed to be Kuwait subjects v No Kuwait tribes or shepherds who have crossed the Kuwait border into Nejd have had any demands made on them so far and are not likely to* As regards the Zaiyad and their sheep tax, it is rumoured that Ajemi as Suwait was at the bottom of/(]-5 Aj of the business and persuaded ibn Mirjan to take the tax in kind to provide food and meat for a series of banquets that were given* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait. fi /i XjHCOHglDajTI-L .

Kuwait Nejd Relations * (a) • During the first week of April large numbers of Ataiba tribesmen ^ r ibn Rab4iyan) with o aire Is estimated to be about 6000 in number arrived at Kuwait from Shaqra in Nejd and beyond for the purpose of purchasing Rice. Smaller caravans of the same tribe still continue to arrive® The route taken by these tribal caravans was via Artawiyeh, the Summan and Subaihiyeh. (b). In conversation with a Hejdi from Llajmaa on the 8th April 1931, the Political Agent learnt that ibn Askar had come home on leave from Ebha in Asir and that the speaker himself was one of ibn Askar's followers. He added that both he and the Ataiba were in Kuwait to buy rice which cost 13 Rials in Kuwait (E39/4/-)as against 50 Rials in Nejdo (c). The same person volunteered the rather curious piece of nev/s that he had heard it from his rjaster that eiforts would be made to settle the Kuwait Nejd dispute after the Haj: when asked how it was that Bin Saud permitted so many Ataiba tribesmen to come up to Kuwait, the same person xG^liod ojab ne had j.eard the -^ing, with his own ears, give 6- public permission to all Nejd tribes who wished to do so ; to visit Kuwait.owing to the ^hard'^ times that existed in Nejd at the present moment. Such permission the King had said held good till the - afterwards other measures would have to be thought ofo (d) # xhe Ataiba camels which were examined by therf- tlie Poliuioa.1 xigent appeared smaller breed than those of the i -Aitair and injinan and the Eastern Stock generally. In colour they were all dark many verging on the black. (e). An Ataiba tribesman in conversation with the Political Agent, said that grazing was very good all along the route they had come, but that in Qjasslm it/ was now very bad owing to the depredations of locusts there. (f). A traveller in from Riath on the 8th April 1931 described how he had seen many heavy lorries with doubie driving wheels previous to 15th Inarch 1931 engaged in transporting the date produce of Hastsa from Riath to I^ecca. 6. Oenei'al . (a). Persistent rumours continue in Kuwait to the mtm effect that Mohamad ibn Tallal al Raschid has escaped from Mecca and has reached Syria or Egypt. The story is 'that he got away in a motor car, after having asked for and been given permission to go out hunting. (b).% The above news has reached Kuwait from several quarters including Riath and Al Shuwaish the man in charge of Bin Saud's herds in the Llutair country. Comment o The same story was reported six weeks ago so is not exactly new. Its persistence makes one wonder if there is after all any truth in the storyo (c). It is rumoured that Hurnaid has been given partial liberty and goes out by day into tbs Riath bazaar. There is nothing to confirm the story. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Tribal Looatlon . (a) Kuwait Tribes, Uraibdar and Fidawiyeh). Some of these have moved as far south as Ingair and Hamdth in Hassa, although the majority are still scattered over the Kuwait Neutral Zone in charge of Amir Haif bin Hassan. Grazing is excellent everywhere and heavy rain again fell over a wide area on 2Snd April. (b). Iraq Shepherd tribes. Nothing fresh to report? All are concentrated in the Kuwait Neutral Zone and about Subaihiyelu There is no si^n yet of any intention on their part to move back to Iraq. Some of the shepherds talk of suramering about Subaihiyeh, but this is considered most unlikely. The end of May should see them starting homeo In the meantime all have plenty of water and grazing and wool and Ghi continues to be sold-2- 7 ^ &gt; sold in Kuwait in large quantities.

Qatif and Ojair® Nothing of interest * to report about them® (g). ^utair,® ITothing fresh to report. Grazing is still plentiful tiiroughout Suimnan and the Tawal al Mutair, generally. Though poor the tribe is making better pi ogreso towards recovery than the AJman, as with the deception o. Faisal al Duwish they have all their Shaikhs to guide and assist them. The Mutair are reported to have recently got rid of Al Firm (Harb) and the Dhafir from thier country, but this requires confirmation. Only Shaikh Hamdan of the Dhafir with his section has been allowed to stay—3- stay and drink from Safa© 2 a Soarcity in Western He.jd and Hl.laz and migration of Atalba and Beml Abdllla Eastvvurds o Owing to the difficulty of grazing thiir oamels in the country west of passim several thousands of Ataiba have recently appeared in the Summan region, together with mefflbere- of Bani Abdillah tribesnicm# The latter are related to the Braih section of the I-iutair, though their home is in the Hijaz. The stay of these people is likely to be prolonged, and accounj for the great increase in the number of tribal kszctsce caravans that have been coming up to Kuwait for supplies since the beginning of Aprilc Sa Kuwait Ne.jd Relations and 'MusabllahV Reference paragraph 5 of this office Intelligence Summary of 17th April. The usually well informed Shaikh Hillal al Mutairi told the Political Agent on 30th April 1931, that the Eastward move of the Bani Abdillah and Ataiba was significant, and had been done without Bin Baud's authority: great scarcity and the depression of the Rial in the Hijaz had forced these tribes to migrate# Shaikh Hillal added that many of the &gt;^arb tribe were similarly moving eastward and although few were seen in Kuwait, they were visiting Zubair in large numbers to purchase supplies. Hillal was definite that the Ataiba, Bani Abdillah and the tribes of North-East Arabia v/ho were drawing supplies from Kuwait, were today doing so in spite of Bin Saud, and that the latter v/as only acquies cing, because he felt powerless today to prevent this mass movement. Reported unrest among Nejg tribes and Bedouin gossip general- ^a/ o^ome ^ani Abdillah tribesmen in conversation v/ith the-4- &lt;5 vilH 1 the Political -^gent stated that one of the reasons for their leaving Hijaz was the fact that Bin Saud had taken many of the best Hijaz grazing areas and turned them into private resdf»es for members of the al Saud family. Eighty such now existed in the Hijaz&lt; • The same persons said that the Hijaz 'Harb' were fai from happy at the advent of the motor car. and bitterly complained that whereas they formerly conveys pilgrims on their camels from Mecca to Medina etc*, today their bread was taken out of their mouths by the accursed fMSROMBIL'. Muifcuir gossip evidently staxted by the Ataiba and 3ani Abdillah newly arrived in their country, hab it that the Egyptian Government's relations with King Bin Saud are strained these days, and that matters A sxib^lcl coiie to a head and Great Britian stand aside, Egypt would easily come off best in any conflict that would insue, for the tribes of Northern Nejd and the Hijaz would immediately throw in thfe&amp;r lot with the ^Syptian forces. The overthrow of Nejd by Ibrahim -asha during last century and the methods he used are in this connection feeing freely discussed in the ouriiman today, ./hile one does not know what has started the story, the fact that such things are oein^, talked about, shows that the Ataiba and Llutalr are still nursing their wrongs and like to hope that the day for revenge may yet come. The story of the escape of Mohamed al Raschid is still being widely discus: ed, only now he is repre sented to have escaped into Yamen not to the North, 'lie curious story also obtains credence in some quarters that al Duwish has been sent to the Hijaz by Bin Saud's ordere. There is nothing to confirm tais however and informed opinion rejects the possibility oiT such a thing happening.(f). (gl • After Note. -5- 'V v There is a grov/ins tendency on the part of the tribes in the hinterland to put all the blame on Bin | Saud for the way the Rial has lost its purchasing powero The 'Saudi' Rial it is said is practically not current out of Hijaz, It certainly would not be tendered in Kuwait ( where its value is about 7 annas in payment for supplies, nor would it be accepted® The ordinary Rial (Maria Theresa dollar) which Bedouins alv/ays purchase their supplies with from the coast towns is in little better state, for its value on 24th April 1931 stood at 10 annas in Kuwait, or half what it was worth six months ago. To the tribesman upto buy food, this is a most serious mattei and is doin£; more than anything else undermine his loyalty for his -Qlng. The 'Dibba' or newly hatched locusts appeared 8 miles south of Kuwait on 19th April 1931 and reached the suburbs of the Town on 30th April 1931. It is hoped they have arrived too late to do any real harm. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Kuwait Intelligence Summary for period 1st to 15th I.Iay 1931. V /V Sir, ( a In continuation of my confidential No. 62 dated 2nd May, I have the honour to report the following items of tribal, hinterland and Nejd news which may be found of interest. lo TRIBAL LOCATIONS. (a) Kuwait Tribes (Araibdar &amp; Fidawiyeh). With the weather getting hotter these show signs of concentrating on water in the Neutral Zone. Accord ing to H.E. the Shaikh, the Kuwait tribes will remain (con trary to usual custom) in the Neutral Zone till near the end of summer and will only come up to Jahara at the tail end of the hot weather. (b) ^raq Shepherd Tribes . -J /; As anticipated in this Agency Intelligence Report No. 62 for 2nd half of April paragraph 1(b) these elements are now well en route for their Homes on the Eu phrates. A considerable number of their tents were located on Khabrat al Duwish near i^anaqish in the early part of May, but these have now gone with the drying up of this lake. Only a few tents remain in the Neutral Zone and at Subaihiyeh at the time cf writing. A similar northward move is taking place with the Muntafik oamel tribes (Dhafir, Jasham. Saadun etc./ till recentlyrecently in the Summan). (c) Mutalrwi.liaan,Awaziiii&gt;Murrah Tribes . Beyond a perceptible tendency for these tribes to start concentrating on water, there is no change in their locations. 2 0 M 07HCSNTS OF NOTABLSS. (a) Ibn Arfaj ,King Bin Saud*s representa tive on his North Sastem frontier, arrived at Jarriya on 12th May, and sent in his servant Abdur Rahman bin Muhairib to Kuwait, no doubt to discuss with al-Nafisi how best to get news of any Bedouin caravans finding their way tip to the coast. (b). On 15th May the religious Wahabi leader Shaikh Abdullah bin Mansur al-3aadun arrived at Kuwait and called on the Political Agent f He brought letters from the Amir Saud asking for assistance from the Political Agent, Shaikh of Kuwait and Nafisi to help him get his sister down from Nassiyeh (Muntafik) to enable him to escort her to Nejd. This sister apparently has for long been badly treated, and prevented from enjoying any of her own property by Ali al-LIansur al-Sadun. Necessary assistance in the form of a D.O. to the Administrative Inspector, Nasiriyeh was rendered and the lady is believed to be on her way to Kuwait. 3. 'M USABILAH' &amp; KUWA IT N EJD RE LATIO NS. (a) On 5th May four armed Nejd motor cars ex Jubail, appeared in the Kuwait Neutral Zone and moved about for 3 days warning all Bedouins,especially the Awazim and Ajman, that they were now forbidden to go up to Kuwait and purchase provisions. It was also rumoured that the cars had entered Kuwait territory and had reached Subaihiyeh. Prompt steps were taken to confirm this, but the rumour turned out to be false. (b) On the 6th May news reached Kuwait from Artawiyeh that Ibn M^saad, Governor of Hail had issued a notification in that township to the effect that no Bedouin from the Summan area or South of it would be permitted too 'W vS permitted to (jjo up to Kuwait. The order was especially intended, it was said, for the Ataiba, Bani Abdilla and Mutair elements now crowded all over the S\xminan« ^ CfflfflMTS. The above news together with Ibn Arfaj^s sudden appearance fcnc ccnfirms the report mentioned in para graph 5 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 55 dated 17th April, that 'Musabilah' would be forbidden after M ID rt , and also that the arrival of the Bani Abdillah and Ataiba from West Nejd to the Suraman region was causing anxiety to the Nejd authorities, see paragraph 3 of Intelligence Summary No.62 dated 2nd May. Certainly since the second week in May all Liejd Bedouin caravans have suddenly ceased coming up to Kuwait. 4. RAIDS. On 6th May a party of 5 Mutair men con veying supplies from jluwait were attacked by a small party of&gt; ^ Mashaala '^ tribesmen (Muntafik shepherds) near Manaqish. One man was shot and his rifle and money taken from him. The Kuwait authorities took immediate action in the shape of clapping into jail a prominent leader of the tribe who happened to be in Kuwait. The incident has little political significance, 5. v ■ UN REST AMONG NEJD TRIBES. / The curious story mentioned in Kuwait Summary No. 62 of 2nd May paragraph 4(e) that trouble had broken out between Egypt and Bin Saud had become so xt&amp;t? widely believed throughout the Mutair tribe in the Summan area, and among the Awazim and Ajman by the 10th Jif May, that reliable persons such as Hillal al-Mutairi aaxiously visited the political Agent to enquire if he had any con fidential news on the subject to impart. According to Shaikh Hillal, the Bedouin belief was that a force of Bin Saud T s had been attacked by the Egyptians who insisted on coming to Mecca armed, and that Bin Saud's troops had suffered a reverse# 1] On 13th May the rumour changed, andand Yemen not Egypt was mentioned as being the attackers, (c) On 14tli, it was stated that the Ataiba had got out of hand and had raided the Sbei North West of Riath and carried off 7 he^rds of camels (approximately 700 heads) (^) On 14th it was reported that the/ 'loyal' Awazim had received secret instructions from ibn Jaloui to move bouth and nearer to Hoffuf as a precautionary measure. GQMLISNTS. The writer and the Shaikh of Kuwait think that possibly the recent 'riots' in Egypt may be at the bottom of the whole story. Otherwise it is difficult to account for it. 6* HSFORTED RELEASE OF FAISAL AL DU./ISH IBN HATHLA IN AND IBN I^V MlT Following hard on the rumours mentioned in the previous paragraph of trouble between Bin Saud and some neighbouring Government, has come the story that the im prisoned rebel leaders had all been released and sent to ^ Mecca. Certain itr is that at the time of writing the report is very widely believed, and most circumstantial stories continue to reach Kuwait in support of same. For example . On May 15th, a Mutairi in from al-Shuwaish 1 s camp near Safa, brought the message that al-Shuwaish had received a letter from Ihe Amir Saud and also from his son in Riath - both of which he read out in the hearing of the messanger - to the effect that al-Duwish was now free, and that he, al-Shuwaish, had promptly sent congratulations to 'Amsha' Duwish T s wife at ,Artawiyeh. On May 16th, Duwish's wife 'Amsha' and two other ladies of Duwish's family residing at a distance from her, and known to the Political Agent, sent in separate messages to the Political Agent to the effect * that their beloved leader had been released, but was still in Riath awaiting order from the King, that the latter had ordered Mutair, Ajman, Awazim, Murrah tribes to at once camp their women and cattle on water, and hold themselves in readiness for war. Ihe ladies added that they would haver*% * ,x&amp; Vt have come to Kuwait themselves to give the good news, but could not very well do so , in view of the King^ recent orders regarding 'Musabilah'. COJSNT. The above reports though widely believed, must be received with the greatest caution. I myself am inclined to think that it is a case of the 'wish is father to the thought', »aid that no release has taken place. It is certain however that the news has caused much excite ment everywhere, and might easily have awkward repercussions 7. CAPTAIN GLUBB. Bedouin gossip has it that this officer was recently in action with some Nejd raiders in Transjordan in which he came off worst, his wliola it is said, being destroyed only he himself escaping in a fast car. * * The story is reported as an interesting example of desert gossip. 8. - J-IQ^LIK D LBK HASCHID . The reported escape of this person is still talked about except that while previous reports threw a doubt on the story, latest ones positively confirm the Report. CO^IENTS . ■ The Shaikh of Kuwait still doubts the truth of the rumour so do I. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.
