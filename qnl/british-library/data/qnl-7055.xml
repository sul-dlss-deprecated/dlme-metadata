INDIA OFFICE, - B. 399 P. 463^/28. Status of certain Groups of Islands in the Persian Gulf. * Tell. tel. 259 to F.O.. Auer. 2S 1928. Teh. Desp. 353 to The recent reassertion by the Persian Government of their claim to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, coupled with their refusal to recognise as independent the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima on the Trucial Coast, or the claim of Mis Majesty’s Government under their treaty engagements to protect the Trucial Sheikhs,'' and Mr. Parrs report'''’ as to the extreme sensitiveness of Persia at the. present time about her authority in the islands, .. Teh Des 3 .J suggest the desirability ol a clear understanding in connection with the f o., .inly 27 1928 deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee as to the status of the more important islands in the Gulf other than Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, which are dealt with in the ^Memorandum on page The present Note, accordingly, deals with the following groups of islands:— (a) Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, Aubah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el- M a rad in, which lie off the coast of Koweit and the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. (7&gt;) Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Sheikh Shuaib, Haiderabi, Kais, laiur (and Little or Nabiyu harur), which lie olf the south Persian coast, and the position of which came under discussion before and during the war. (c) The Bahrein Archipelago. (d) Halul, Dalinah, Sir Beni \ as, Sir Abu Xair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. A.—Bubiyan, Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el-Maradin. These islands were before the war in Turkish possession. They were attributed to the administrative control of the Sheikh of Koweit in the (uniatifled) Anglo-1 urkish Convention of 29th duly 1913, and were occupied by the Sheikh on the outbreak of war with Turkey in November 1914. They were formally recognised by TIis Majesty s Government as forming part of His Excellency’s dominions in April 1923 (see Koweit Memorandum para. 35, on page Bfl ). No Persian claim to these islands can reasonably be preferred. B.—Sheikh Shuaib, Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Hinderabi, Kais, Farur, Nabiyu or Little Farur. The status of Henjam is examined in greater detail in paras. 5 and 6 of the Memorandum on Henjam on p. With the exception of Nabiyu or Little larur, these islands appear to be indisputably Persian; and in 1914 His Majesty’s Government made a formal offer to the Persian Government to lease or purchase all except Hinderabi, Kais, and Farur.t In 1918, when + Teh. Deep, to f.o., the renewal of this offer was under consideration, the addition of the three last-named islands to the lists to be communicated to Persia was approved.J : F .o. tei 137 1 ,. X' Teheran. Mar. 8 ISABIYU TARUR. 1918, P. 1024/18. The status of Nabiyu or Little Farur is not formally determined The island, which is uninhabited, and lies about 10 miles south-west of the southern extremity of Farur Island, is circular in shape and about half a mile in diameter. 1 he Persian Government were stated in 1900$ “as yet” to have paid no attention to it; the Government of India and the India Otlice in 1908 expressed the view;] that, on the analogy of Little Tamb, it should be regarded as depending from Farur, “which admittedly belonoed to Persia ” and the boreign Office did not dissent from this view. 1 he question was again raised in 1924 in connection with a proposal to erect a light on the island. The Political Resident then suggested that the precedent of Little l amb was not necessarily binding on His Majestv s vrovernment, adding; We have precise facts that Nabiyu Farur is a barren rock, useless, and not claimed by anyone, and that in 1875 the Farur Sudanis 306.3 75 10.28 § Lor. ii, 584. Viceroy to S. of S for I., Nov. 11 1908 1.0. to F.O.. |Jec. 2 1908, P. 2111.9 were recognised as belonging to the Jowasim Tribe of Trucial Oman.” No reference to the incident of 1875 could be traced by the India Olfice ; but i' 9 -VVs 39 /*r' 26 the Secretary of State for India agreed with the Government of India that it would be undesirable to start the erection of a lighthouse on the island without prior intimation to Persia, and the matter was not pursued. It would appear therefore that there is little question that the island must be regarded as Persian, though a slight element of doubt as to a Jowasimi claim exists. C.—The Bahrein Archipelago. The archipelago consists of the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na’assan, Sitrah, and Nabi Salih, and a number of lesser islets and rocks forming part of the same compact geographical group. The archipelago is under the rule of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and the status of Bahrein governs the status of all the other islands composing it. D.—Farsi, Arabi, Harqus; Halul, Dalmah, Shura-awah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. The status of these islands is important, not merely because of the claims which may be urged to them by the Trucial Chiefs, to whom His Majesty’s Government are under treaty obligations, but because their control is in many cases of importance in connection with the policing of the pearl banks, for which responsibility has been assumed by ^flis Majesty’s Government, and because of the possible value of certain of them in connection with an air route along the north Arabian coast. Farsi, Arabi and Harqus. Lor. ii. 115, 553, (142. * 1.0. to F.O., Oct. 20 1914, P. 3940. t Tel. from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Dec. 15 1914 , P. 4600. Farsi is an uninhabited island about a quarter mile across, in the middle of the Gulf, about halfway between Musallamiyah Bay in Hasa and the Tangistan district in south Persia. Arabi is 15 miles south of Farsi* and Harqus, “a mere sandbank,” 30 miles west of it. Oil seepages were alleged in 1914 (Engler’s “ Petroleum ”) to exist in the sea near all three islands, and Arabi carries a deposit of guano. ^ 1 he owneiship of all thiee islands was stated m the Persian Gulf Gazetteer to be undetermined, Mr. Lorimer adding in the cases of Arabi and Harqus that the question had never arisen. The India Ollice in 1914 expressed the view, 0 which the Foreign Office did not contest, that His Majesty’s Government should eventually claim the right to deal with all three islands (as with Halul); and beacons were at the same time erected on them with the concurrence of Admiralty and Foreign Office.! No steps were, however, in fact ever taken to regularise the status of the islands which geographically would most easily have been assigned to Koweit. Halul.

Arabs from Bahrein, the Tracial Coast and El Katr, might lead to claims being raised by the El Katr Sheikhs to which the Turkish Government [suzerain of Katr till 1916, since when the Sheikh has been recognised as an independent Trucial Chief] might lend their support.”]!* Deep, to G. of I., b'eb. in mi,, para. 9. a few feet above sea level, with anchorage in 8 fathoms (sand) abot.t half a mile from the island, frequented by fishermen from MusaHamiyah and Jinuah Islands in Hasa, from Hadd in Bahrein, and possibly liom Kbaiag eisian).
