Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 21 of the 6th April regarding the desire of the Persian Government to engage the services of an expert in hydrography and meteorology, I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter on the subject from the Admiralty. 2. The letter explains the reason why it is not possible to meet the Persian Government's wish that the candidate should be of junior rank. It shews also the manner in which the salary is assessed. 3. I understand that the Admiralty would not insist on the officer receiving the extra seven days' leave mentioned in paragraph 6 of their letter during his period of service with the Persian Government. 4. I understand, also, that the officer would be likely to wish to bring his wife with him. I am, with great truth, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)C®py (E ^875/226/34) C.W.3476/38 Admiralty, S.W.l — 2nd April, 1938. Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter E 6691/5066/34 I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you that they are prepared to second for a period of two years an officer qualified in meteorology and hydrographic surveying for service with the Persian government. 2. My Lords regret that the Persian request for an officer of Lieutenant’s rank cannot be met. Such an officer would not only be comparatively inexperienced but might be hard put to it to assert his authority and get his wishes attended to. Professionally a Lieutenant Commander would be suitable; and from the point of view of prestige and authority My Lords consider that the usual practice should be followed and that he should be given the acting rank of Commander. 3. The emoluments of this officer would consist of the difference between his naval full pay (£623.10.Od) and his half-pay as Lieutenant Commander (£281.7.Id) (which would be paid from Navy funds), plus a consolidated allowance of £682.17.Id. This latter sum includes the naval allowances to which he is entitled - marriage allowance, survey pay, etc. - and also some compensation for the cost of living in a foreign/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.foreign country, and for bad climatic conditions. In addition the Persian government would be required to bear the sum of £80 a year to cover the possible expense to navy votes in respect of attributable disability retired pay etc. The total charge to Persia would thus be £1,105 a year. 4. Two alternative methods of payment present themselves: (a) emoluments could be issued to the officer direct from the Admiralty, recovery being made by this department from Persia; (b) a salary could be paid by the Persian government. In both cases half-pay would be issued direct. My Lords consider that though part of the salary would be spent locally, payment of the whole sum in sterling would be reasonable. 5. It is regretted that the only officer available is married, and apparently it is doubtful whether married quarters will be available. In the event of the officer wishing to take his wife with him some provision towards the upkeep of a separate establishment would also be required. 6. The leave period would be 30 days a year, to be cumulative at the officer’s option, together with a period not exceeding 7 days in all for service in hot climates. Pull pay sick leave is allowed for officers serving in hot climates, up to a maximum of 18 months, but presumably the contract would be terminated at the end of a year in the case of serious illness. 7. I am to request you to communicate these proposals to the Persian government. When a satisfactory arrangement has been reached a formal contract will, of course, be drawn up. I am, etc. (Signed) H.

I enclose a translation of the reply which we have at last received to the letter of which a copy was enclosed in my letter No*19^8/37 of the 18th June. You will see that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ask where and when and how the instruments will be handed over and that, as so often they express no thanks for the gift which is being made to them. I think the simplest arrangement might be to have the instrument sent to the Consulate Office at Bandar Abbas, and to inform the Iranian Government that they are being held at their disposal there and will be handed over whenever a naval officer presents himself. If you agree, would you prrange for the necessary instructions to be sent to whoever has charge of the instruments at lien jam. As soon as we hear from i *andar Abbas that they have been received there, we will tell the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they can be handed over at any time convenient to the naval authorities. 3. The note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says nothing about the use that is to be made of the instruments, nor does it refer to the offer of an exchange of weather telegrams, made in the Foreign and Political Department's letter DO No.F.696-11/36 of the 2nd November and duly communioated to the Iranian Government.

Copy (ii 5066/5066/34) BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN 14th August, 1937 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that since early in 1936, His Majesty’s Legation have been discussing with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the possibility of co-operation between the Iranian Government and the Government of India in Meteorological services* The question was first raised in a despatch from the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India to my predecessor No. D*5652-N/35 of the 20th January 1936, a copy of which was forwarded to the Secretary of State for India. In this despatch Sir Aubrey Metcalfe explained that the Government of India greatly regretted the closure of the meteorological stations hitherto maintained by the branches of Cable and Wireless Limited at Henjam, Jask and Charbar, since this would seriously diminish the supply of meteorological information along the air route over the Persian Gulf. The Government of India would therefore be interested to receive any information regarding the establishment of an Iranian meteorological service. 2. The question was discussed orally with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the late Minister of Posts and Tele graphs (responsible for the proposed air service) and with General Nakchevan, then in command of the Iranian Air Force. It became evident that the Iranian Government were seriously interested, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs enquired if they could purchase the set of instruments formerly in use at Henjam. After further correspondence with the Government of India/ t Honourable ony Sden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.India they were informed, at the end of November 1936, that the Government of India would be prepared to present the Hen jam instruments to ther* as a free gift, without imposing any conditions but in the hope that they would be used somewhere in the same region. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs were also informed that the Government of India would be happy to assist the Iranian Government in the organisation of a meteorological service throughout Iran, that the Meteorological Department of the Government of India would be very glad to give their advice, and if desired to arrange for the vlalt of an officer of the Department to Iran. 3. The Henjam instruments have not yet been handed over, as the Ministry of foreign Affairs subsequently expressed the fear that they might be obsolete. They have recently been informed that though old, they are in good working condi tion. Meanwhile the Government of India are proceeding with the establishment of a new observatory at the Gonaular office at Bandar Abbas. The Iranian Government have been informed of thia and have raised no objection. The Jaak observatory is still maintained by Cable and Wireless Id mited, but they will probably leave before the end of this year. The Qharbar observatory is being maintained by the local agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company. 4. In June of this year Hia Majesty's Legation were informed by the Government of India that it was proposed to send an Inspector to visit the observatories at Jaak, Charbar and Buahire. I thought it well to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in case any objection were raised to his visit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised no obstacle and asked for full Information about the Inspector's tour in case the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs wished to get in touch with him. The Government of India replied that they did not consider/consider the officer who*! they had intended tr&gt; send sufficiently qualified to discuss matters with the Iranian Government hut that if the Iranian Government really wished to consult an expert, one could be sent in addition to the Inspector, This information was communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, As it aeemed unlikely that they were really ready to consult an expert, it was suggested that the expert’s visit should be deferred and that the Inspector should carry out his ordinary tour of inspection as proposed. 5. A reply haa now been received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a translation of which I have the honour to enclose. It will be seen that the Iranian Government agree that the visit of the expert is unnecessary at present, and that what they propose is to engage for two years a meteoro logies! expert to instruct the officers of the Iranian Hevy in (a) meteorology and (b) in marine survey work. In fact this is an entirely new proposal. I do not know whether it would be possible for the Government of India to find an officer qualified to give Instruction in these two entirely different fields. Consultation between Hia Majesty’s Government and the Government of India will clearly be necessary and if a suitable officer can be found, the terms of service will need very careful eonaiderat ion. I shall therefore inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the * proposal has bsen referred to the Government of India but that some little delay is inevitable before a reply can be given. I need scarcely stress the importance of taking this first opportunity of co-operation with the Iranian Tfavy if it is in any way practicable to do so, and I greatly hope that the Iranian Government’s proposal will be given sympathetic consideration/conaideration. I should be grateful If I might be informed as soon as possible of the viewB of Hie Majesty^ Government and the Government of India, 6.

His excellency, The Governor-General, Department of External Affaire of the Governnwsnt of India, SIMLA.His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Mi. Dated New Delhi, the JLtfk January 1936. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 213, dated the 4th October 1935, I am directed to enclose a copy of a note recorded by Dr* Normand, Director General of Observatories in India, and to say that the Government of India cannot but regret extremely the necessity for closing the three observatories at Henjam, Jask and Gharbar. Apart from the serious effect on weather forecasts generally in Northern India, it is clear that the absence of observations from the northern side of the Persian Gulf must greatly handicap forecasts for the Gulf generally, and so adversely affect the security of the air service not only on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf but also down the Arabian coast. I am to say therefore that the Government of India would be greatly interested in any information which it may be possible to obtain regarding the establishment of an Iranian meteorological service. 2. I am to add that the Director General of Observatories is arranging for the safe custody of the instruments at Henjam and Char bar, but wishes to continue •»..continue observations at Jask so long as Gables und Wireless Ltd. maintain a staff at that place. 3. A copy of this letter and enclosure is being sent to the secretary of State for India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be, Your most obedient servant, Sd. H.A.P. Metcalfe, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.(‘f ? Copy of a note recorded by Dr. C.W.B. Normand, Director General of Observatories in India, Poona, dated the 5th December 1935. The closing of the observatories at Henjam, Jask and Charbar will handicap forecasting work at the Karachi R eteorological Office, which is responsible for the issue of aviation forecasts on either side of the Persian Gulf. To Imperial Airways machines flying between Gwador and Uherjah, reports from Charbar and Jask are of value either directly, or indirectly through the forecasts; without them, there becomes a gap of 450 miles without a meteorological station. 2. Forecasting in northern India will also be affected, because the winter disturbances travel through Iran to Afghanistan tnd northern India. Adequate meteorological information from Iran is wanted for the timely issue of accurate forecasts in northern India and in particular for the R.A.F. along the frontier. 3. The black dots in the enclosed map show the meteorological stations maintained by this Department in Iran and Arabia. Most of the countries in south Asia are either starting meteorological services of their own or are rapidly improving the existing ones; e.g. Turkey, Iraq and 3iam now broadcast daily, at a fixed hour or hours, the meterological data recorded at their respective observatories; Malaya has developed within the past five years a virile meteorological service of its own, and the Batavian Observatory is now arranging to start a forecasting service for the Dutch East Indies and will begin to broadcast weather bulletins in the near future. The normal development will be for the Iranian Government to ....• A &gt; to start a meteorological service of its own and to broadcast the data of its observatories from some central station, say Tehran, for the use of neighbour ing countries, just as Turkey broadcasts its synoptic messages thrice daily from Ankara. This is the development which meteorologists hope for and would welcome. This department would be glad to help in any development of this kind and to hand over all meteorological instruments that are now in Iran to an Iranian Meterological Service, when one starts; but how is the suggestion to be made? How can one help on the starting of a meteorological service in Iran? 4. In 1926-27 an American subject, Mr. A.s. Haskell, was Director General of Agriculture and Public Domains in Iran. He made use of the data collected by this Department and regarded them as 'of particular interest and value', because they are almost the only mateorological data MXKix available for Iran and 'certainly they are the only ones that cover a period of any length'. He wrote in torch 1927 that 'I am now taking steps to establish in different parts of Persia a number of meteorological stations. Naturally we will select first those localities or districts not already served by your Service'. At that tlae there seemed to be a chance for development of an Iranian Meteorological Service, but a change of personnel in 1928 seems to have been accompanied by a waning of interest in meteorological data In the Iranian agricul tural service. Mr. Haskell pointed out that the iftissian Cotton Company also had been keeping records in a few localities from 1925, of which we obtained copies until 1929.5. Regarding the immediate action to he taken, the Meteorologist, Karachi had already been in touch with Mr. Bunker, Manager, Cable find Wireless Ltd., Karachi / about the disposal of the instruments at Churbar and Henjam and has been making enquiries about the possibili ty of making other arrangements to continue the meteorological observations. He has informed Mr.Bunker that, if no arrangements can be made to continue the observatories, the meteorological instruments and records may be left with the B.I.3.N. agents who (Mr. Bunker says) are British subjects. 6. As regards Jask, the continuation of the observatory there i s more important than the recovery of the instruments, so that if the Cable and Wireless staff are to remain there another year or more it is preferable to leave the instruments for the present and continue the observations. 6 7. Licences are necessary before we can send any thermometers or other instruments to Iran to replace broken or unserviceable stocks. Delays of 3 to 6 months occur in obtaining the permits. The help of His Majesty's Minister in Tehran in this matter has been most valuable. It is of interest to know that though it has become increasingly difficult for His Majesty's Minister to get licences for importation of meteorolo gical instruments to Henjam, Jask and Charbar, there is still no difficulty in connection with meteorological equipment imported by His Majesty's Legation and Consulates.Hi TF 1 INDIA DIRECT r ' i&gt;z7 7695 In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - / uo andaddress —not to any person by name, but tp— ^ “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. t j v J J {64 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign AfjfQ^^&amp; sentj his compliments to ^Cc^oc&gt;^~ - sjf / . ^ . and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith coj&gt;^l-^ of the under-mentioned paper. % Foreign Office, -T' ^ c , 193/”.

This includes the abandonment of stations operated by Cable and Wireless Limited at Henjam, Charbar [Chabahar], and Jask; the deputation of an Inspector of Observatories to visit stations in the Persian Gulf (see folio 28 for the tour programme); a proposal to appoint a British meteorological and hydrological expert to train officers of the Iranian Navy; and the gift of Henjam's meteorological equipment to the Iranian Government.A note written by Charles William Blyth Normand, Director-General of Observatories in India, outlines how the closure of aforementioned meteorological stations will hinder forecasting in Northern India and the Persian Gulf: see folios 47-50. It includes a map illustrating the locations of meteorological stations in Iran and Arabia.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Tehran (Sir Hugle Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen and Sir Horace James Seymour), officials of the Admiralty (Sidney Hill Phillips and Harold Eastwood), officials of the Foreign Office (George William Rendel) and officials of the Foreign and Political Department (Department of External Affairs from 1937) of the Government of India. There is also some correspondence with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most of the correspondence in the file is forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, rather than addressed directly to the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
