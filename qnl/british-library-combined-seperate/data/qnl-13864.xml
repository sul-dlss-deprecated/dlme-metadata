Parts of the northwest of the city of Mecca are visible in the background.Due to the relatively slow shutter speed used by the photographer, the movement of the pilgrims performing
                           tawaf– the ritual of circumambulation of the Caaba seven times in a counter-clockwise direction during the
                           hadjor
                           umrah, starting from the black stone – is captured here as indistinct blurring of the figures closest to the Caaba.A magnified inspection of the scene reveals an extensive and detailed view west-northwest of the city including many Ottoman-era and earlier structures, including a large white-washed building is situated immediately below the horizon on the foothills of the northern ridge.InscriptionsRecto:Upper centre:‘Picture of the City of Mecca the Great’To the right and left of the title:‘This is Mecca, the beloved residence of God.Within it is His house, the bait al-haram.All the virtues of the world are perfected in it;Blessings from on high descend here day and night.’To the right and left of the image:‘It has many names such as balad al-amin and so on. Adam, peace be upon him, was the first to build the Ka'ba. The surrounding buildings were built during the time of Qasa ibn Kulab, the Prophet's paternal grandfather of the fifth generation. Before this [time], there were only the small huts of Arabs on the two hills. Its greatness is recorded in the books of tradition (hadith) and in the holy Qur'an. At present this city has become extremely graceful and beautiful. It is a veritable example of Islamic glory.In the noble Mecca, the places of pilgrimages are as follows:1) the house of Khuzairan2) Mount Abi Qabus3) the birthplace of the Prophet4) the birthplace of ‘Ali5) the house of Khadija the Great6) the Mosque of the Jinn7) the paradise of al-Ma‘ala8) the mausoleum of Amina, may God be pleased with her9) the mausoleum of Khadija the Great, may God be pleased with her10) Mount Nur or the cave of Hira11) the birthplace of the “sincere one”12) the mosque of Amir Hamza, peace be upon him13) the residence of 'Umar Faruq’Lower centre: 'H.
