The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent at Bahrain (Major Tom Hickinbotham in 1944, Cornelius James Pelly in 1948), the Station Manager for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) at Bahrain, Geoffrey F W Parker, and the Air Liaison Officer for the Royal Air Force (RAF) at Bahrain, Squadron Leader G E Lewis.Correspondence related to the first request in 1944 (ff 2-5) includes a letter from Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Advisor to the Government of Bahrain, indicating payments per annum related to the rent of land and landing fees at Bahrain. A telegram from the Residency Agent at Sharjah (f 5) lists the numbers of planes and fees paid for aircraft landing at Sharjah and Dubai.The 1948 correspondence is in response to the receipt by the Political Agency in Bahrain of a questionnaire (two copies, ff 9-10, 11-12) forwarded from the Ministry of Civil Aviation in London, requesting information on a number of airport-related matters, including: landing fees, schedules of charges issued in notices to airmen; airport authority and operators; taxes and handling charges; ownership of airports. Correspondence from Parker (ff 14-15) and Lewis (ff 18-19) contain replies to the questionnaire, in relation to civil aircraft and RAF aircraft respectively.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Air services agreements</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000341#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000341#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000341#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
