The State of Oman and Muscat does not appear in the annex to Chapter XXII of the Consular General Instructions as under British protection, nor, on the other hand does it figure in the Summary Visa Regulations or, so far as I hcive been able to trace, in any Foreign Office Circular relating to visaa. I h ve therefore been at a loss in dealing with applications I for visas to India made by natives of the :&gt;tate of Om; n and Muscat to whom, as you are aware, Meshed is centre a A pilgrimage If, in the absence of ;,ny papers on the subject! you consider it desirable to iubmit the matter to th~ &lt; secretary of ^&gt;tate you may be uisposea to include a reference to natives of Koweit mention of whom in thi&gt; connexion appears to be equally ; instructions.
