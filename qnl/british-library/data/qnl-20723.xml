ARAB SIDE. General. —In the Review of the Administration Report for 1936 a Retro spect of the years 1926—1936 was given which indicated the considerable changes which had come about during that decade on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. A summary of these changes was given as follows :— ' During the comparatively short period of 10 years, from the commu nications point of view the Gulf has changed from a cul-de-sac to an highway between East and West; from the resources point of view the discovery of oil in an area under our control is of considerable strategical importance ; while from the inter national point of view the relations of the Arab Shaikhdoms with their neighbours have increased considerably in importance and complexity.' During the year under review the Arab side has if anything increased in importance by the multiplication of the Imperial Airways Weekly Services, and by—to anticipate the events of 1937—the finding of oil at Kuwait, and in Saudi territory at Hasa. From the international point of view the relations of the Arab Shaikhdoms with their neighbours show no signs of decreasing in importance. Royal Navy.—The sloops of the Persian Gulf Division continued their useful duties on the Arab coast and frequently transported the Political Resi dent and political officers under him on their tours. Aviation. —The Royal Air Force continued to maintain the strategical air route on the Arab coast. They made numerous routine flights, and, on requests, carried political officers on their duties. The Imperial Airways services were increased from two to four services a week under the Empire Air Mail scheme. In connection with this scheme air facilities were obtained from the Shaikh of Debai and negotiations were opened with the Rulers of Bahrain and Muscat for the revision of the Civil Air Agree ment. Oil Interests. —In June, under the auspices of the Political Agent, Muscat, two concessions covering the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman were obtained by Petroleum Concessions Limited. With the assistance of the political authorities and after prolonged nego tiations, Petroleum Concessions Limited procured concessions from the Shaikhs of Debai and Sharjah, and negotiations continued with regard to the remaining Shaikhdoms. In Qatar drilling operations continued. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited completed the construction of their refinery, and had an even more successful year than during 1936, when 500,400 tons of crude oil and 9,200 tons of fuel oil were exported. During the year under review the total production of oil was 1,061,347 tons. Ihe total personnel of the Company for the last three years is as follows :— 1935. 1936. 1937. Americans . . . . 49 153 126 European British subjects • • 26 157 308 Indian British subjects . • 61 323 214 Bahrainis ... • 1,283 3,747 3,304 f Iranians • • • 1 Others ^ Iraqis • V 244 658 688 (^Kuwaitis, etc. . • J Total 1,663 5,038 4,640 53:'C) ExAflausDept( U ) The Kuwait Oil Company continued drilling throughout the year without success, but early in 1938 found oil in cjuantities which indicated the picscnco of a large field. The Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company continued their opera tions throughout the year in Hasa without any signal success but early in 1938 struck oil in hopeful quantities. Kuwait. —No advance was made during the year towards the settlement of the difficult question of the Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens in Iraq. With regard to Kuwait-Iraqi smuggling the decrease reported for 1936 was maintained. When the Saudi blockade is removed (see below) the Shaikh, of Kuwait is willing to enter into negotiations with the Iraqi Government on the smuggling question. As regards Iraqi incursions these decreased Somewhat in number but a serious incident occurred on October 15th when, according to evidence collect ed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, on the spot, Iraqi police attacked Kuwait tribesmen many miles within Kuwait territory. The incident was under representation to the Iraq Government by His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, at the end of the year. As in 1936 no reparation has been forthcoming irom the Iraq Government for any incursions. The Saudi trade blockade of Kuwait continued but towards the end of the year there were some signs that as a result of negotiations with the Saudi Government agreement would be reached on this question. The pearl season shows a slight improvement over the previous year in catch and in price. Bahrain. —The most important event of the year, which excited strong feeling in Bahrain, was a dispute which broke out in April between the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar on the subject of the ownership of Zubara, a piece of coastal territorv in Qatar, which had long been a cause of contention between the two Shaikhs. This dispute resulted in the forcible subjugation by the Shaikh of Qatar, after some slight armed resistance, of the Nairn tribe, over whom, as well as over Zubara, the Shaikh of Bahrain claimed sovereignty. The Shaikh of Bahrain referred the matter to His Majesty's Government who replied in brief that, on the evidence before them. His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain had no claim to Zubara. As a retaliation for the action taken by the Shaikh ot Qatar, the Shaikh of Bahrain withdrew the concession of reduced transit dues hitherto accorded to Qatar, and prohibited the entry of Qatar subjects into Bahrain. J iiese measures remained in force at the end of the year. There was an improvement, both in catch and in price, in the pearl industry. With the approval of His Majesty s Government the Bahrain Govern ment promulgated a Nationality Law and a Property Law , whk h were applied by King's Regulation to persons subject to the Bahrain Order in Council. The provisions of the former specified the classes of persons possessing Bahrain nationality, and prescribed the procedure for the acquisition of Bahrain nationalitv, or the retention of their own, by foreigners born in Bahrain, The latter enacted that foreigners in Bahrain, whose Governments prohibited in their respective territories the ownership of immoveable property by persons other than their ow n nationals, might by notification be prohibited from owning such property in Bahrain. The only foreigners to whom the prohibition has so far been applied are nationals of Iran. His Royal Highness the Amir Sand, the Heir-apparent to His Majesty Kinu: Ibn Sand, visited Bahrain in December. His Royal Highness was much pleased with his reception and his visit undoubtedly tended to increase cordial relations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Trucial Coast. —Negotiations on the subject of the Trucial Coast-Saudi frontiers continued throughout the year with Saudi Government without a settlement being reached. Muscat.—In February, the Sultan, returned from Dhofar to Muscat, from which he had been absent for a long period.In March His Highness announced his intention not to renew with His Majesty's Government the Treaty of Commerce and Friendship oi beyond February 1938, and asked that a new treaty should replace it. His Highness was persuaded with some difficulty to prolong the treaty unti February 1939 in order to give time for a fresh treaty to be negotiated, and at the end of the year the terms of the new treaty were under the consideration of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. In November His Highness paid an official visit to Delhi as the guest of the Government of India, and was much gratified by his reception. From India His Highness proceeded on a world tour, which included Japan, the United States of America, England, Germany, France and Italy. In England His Highness was to be the guest of His Majesty's Government. PERSIAN SIDE. Bushire District and Tangistan. —The Iranian Authorities continued to disarm the tribes and establish law and order in the more remote districts. For this purpose a Civil Governorate was established in Shibkuh. People continued to emigrate, especially from Lingah, on account of the weight ot heavy indirect taxation and the oppression of the Military Authorities in the districts. No improvement has been made in the primitive roads radiating from Bushire. Iranian wireless communication was established at Jask and Bushire. Cable and Wireless, Limited, now only concern themselves with cable work. Prices of food-stuffs rose steadily during the year and the management of wheat supplies by the Revenue Authorities caused definite hardship. Persian Navy. —The Iranian Navy co-operated at sea in the suppression of smuggling and indeed were given land duties in this connection also. Reljtions with local Iranian officials. —These continued to be most friendly. T. C. FOWLE, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.CHAPTER 1.

His Imperial Majesty was received according to a prearranged programme, and left the following day for Shiraz en route for Tehran. While in Bushire, His Imperial Majesty seems chiefly to have concerned himself with the decrease in the population of Bushire and the bringing of sweet water to Bushire from the Ab-i-Shapur. 53,'C) ExAftairDept.2 2. On the 14th February, Mr. G. W.

W. Watson, from 23rd August to the end of the year. The Company closed down their Jask branch during the year. The Mesopotamia-Iran Corporation, Limited. —This Company was reform ed during the year under the title Gray, Mackenzie and Company, Limited. For the first part of the year, Mr. J. M. Russell was the Company's Agent, and for the remainder, Mr. S. W. Gregor. The change of title does not entail change in business connections. The Imperial Bank of Iran. —Mr. J. K. Millar was the Manager of the Bushire Branch from 1st January to 9th March. Mr. L. C. Cartwright from 10th March to 6th September. Mr. V. H. Glendening from 6th September to the end of the year. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited. —Mr. Y. Gregory was in charge of this Company's Branch throughout the year.

' Deptford ' visited once, and H. M. S- ' Enterprise ' of the East Indies Squadron, once. On all the occasions the usual salutes were fired and calls made. SECTION 3. LOCAL ADMINISTRATION. Governor of the Southern Ports. —Aqai Ahmad Sadri throughout the year. Assistant Governor. —Aqai Taqi Midhat throughout the year. Ciistoms Preventive Department. —The Road Guards having proved them selves to be even more liable to corruption than their predecessors, the Fron tier Guards, the Iranian Government placed this Department in the hands of the Navy. The Navy took over ports north and south of Bushire. The port remains in the charge of the Road Guards. In Bushire itself, the Police Department carries out the necessary duties. Government measures for discouraging the smuggling of contraband good. Wheat Monopoly. —In January, Revenue Authorities purchased all wheat in the Bushire District at the rate of 60 rials for 315 kilos, having deducted 20 per cent, of the total weight for dust and other adulterations. The Revenue3 Department commenced by itself selling wheat to the public, but later mer chants were allowed to purchase wheat in order to prevent delay in purchase a nd destruction by weevil. There was a certain amount of shortage of wheat towards the end of the year on account of excessive exportation to Germany. Monopolisation of Tobacco. —During the year, local stocks of tobacco were bought by the Tobacco Monopoly Authorities, who classified the same into three classes and offered them for sale at two shops at rials 16 (4.s.), rials 15 (3. e . 9c?.) and rials 14 (35. 6cZ.) respectively for every 3 kilos. Cigarettes of the Tob&amp;cco Monopoly Factory, Tehran, were imported into Bushire and sold there. Smuggling continued to be rife during the year though the Customs Pre ventive Department were successful in checking to a great extent the smuggl ing of tea and sugar. In the southern ports, monopoly laws were relaxed as regards rigging for dhows. Roads and Communications. 1. Bushire-Shiraz Road. —This road was repaired in places and the em bankment and bridges between Bushire and Borazjan completed. The sec tion, however, remained closed to traffic upto the end of the year, cars con tinuing to use the old track. 2. Shiraz-Firuzahad-Bushire Road. —In July, construction work of this road was taken in hand from Shiraz side and the section Shiraz and Firuzabad (105 miles east of Bushire) was open by the end of the year. 3. During the year, the construction of two Iranian wireless stations, one at Bushire and another at Jask, was completed and operation commenced. Education. During the year the Education Department pushed on its work. It is reported that arrangements have been made for the teaching of over 3,000 illiterates in night classes in the local schools. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, are reported to have provided plans and estimates for the construction of a model school at Linghah. It seems that Wakf properties have been taxed upto 5 per cent, for providing funds for education. In Bushire, work was commenced on new offices for Education and Wakf Departments. Bushiee Municipality. The Municipality continued to do good work throughout the year and although hampered by lack of funds, did receive a monthly allotment of 2,600 rials. They were unable to do much in the way of street repairs, but a staff of 70 persons were employed on sanitation. There was some attempt made for looking after the poor and eight beds for in-patients were provided in a local infirmary, for which a doctor gave his services free. A small asylum for luna tics and an isolation house for lepers were opened. The Municipality raised a subscription amounting to an equivalent of £150 and purchased a plot of land for a new cemetery outside the town. The old cemetery was turned into a sport club. To augment the monthly income, food-stuffs were taxed, in some cases it is stated as much as 10 per cent. SECTION 4. ARMY. In March, Brigadier-General Ibrahim Zandieh, Officer Commanding the Fars Division, visited Bushire on inspection. The recruiting bureau re-opened with its usual members, the Governor as President, a Doctor from the Military Department, and one from the Iranian . a aval Department, the Imam-i-Jumah, two local merchants, and the Head ofthe Police Department. Branches were also re-opened in the districts. In Bushire, the names of the youths who had attained the age of military service were notified, old exemption papers examined and new ones issued to those youths who were unfit for service or otherwise exempted. 1,212 youths were enrolled from Bushire and districts. Of these, 370 were sent to Khorram- shahr to join the Navy and the rest were admitted into the Military barracks at Bushire at various times during the year. The construction of the Military barracks, which was begun in 1936, remained incomplete by the end of the year. The strength of the Bushire garrison remained at 600 and was under the command of Major Jelayer, who relieved Major Nikman in September. DISARMAMENT OF THE TRIBES. The Iranian Military Authorities continued relentlessly to collect arms in the districts. On the least suspicion that a peasant was in possession of arms, he was bastinadoed, heavily fined, and imprisoned. The authorities succeeded in collecting some 80 rifles, and a small quantity of ammunition, which they sent to Bushire with the few peasants found in possession of arms. NAVY. Lieut.-Colonel Ghulam Ali Bayandor remained in charge of the Iranian Navy throughout the year. During the year, the sloop ' Babr ' seized two smugglers' dhows carrying some 600 packages of contraband goods, and gunboat ' Karkas ' one dhow with 500 packages. The installation of the flash-light near the aerodrome was completed by the Iran Naval Authorities. They installed a similar flash-light on Qais Island. The lights were not regularly operated. SECTION 5. AVIATION. 23 British aviators passed through Bushire during the year. French and Dutch. —Air France maintained their weekly service through out the year. K. L. M. continued flying direct between Jask and Basrah, and a few 'planes landed at Bushire for re-fuelling or for previously booked passengers. SECTION 6. POLITICAL SITUATION. The Iranian Government pursued its policy of removing tribal chiefs from their districts and settling them in Shiraz. The Military Authorities dealt with several raids of villages and caravans, though they were not always with success, for, it is reported, that in many cases the outlaws are still at large in the mountains. There was' an outbreak in the Kuhegalu country in September, to quell which large numbers of troops were sent. The Iranian Census Authorities state that a considerable amount of unauthorized migration to the Arab side of the Gulf took place during the year. There is no doubt that the population of Bushire is much depleted.5 SECTION 7. MANUMISSION. During 1937, the following number of slaves was manumitted:— Bahrain Agency Muscat Agency Sharjah Agency 23 30 22 A. C. GALLOWAY, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, SECTION 8. TRADE AND TRADE FACILITIES. 1. General conditions. —Previous reports have emphasized the effect of the Government's policy of economic centralisation on the trade position in Bushire. Bushire has, in the past two years, ceased to exist as an indepen dent trading centre of any importanoe, and no longer offers openinjrs for foreign trade, as local demand, except for staple goods such as, sugar ai d piece- goods, which are already the object of monopoly, is insufficient to justify trading for the local market. Deprived of this form of activity, the town has come to depend solely to the use made of the port, and such merchants as remain confine themselves to acting as forwarding agents for principals in the industrial and trading centres of the interior. The economy of the town reflects the changed conditions in every sphere. Bazaar activity is restricted to a minimum to meet the demands of local consumers ; the monopoly branches on the other hand, are active. The transport companies, four of which now exist in the ^own, have derived considerable activity from the demands of the forwarding agents; two new garages opened in 1937. Employment in commercial undertakings tends to decline, the population becoming increasingly dependent on the official departments, Customs, Malieh, municipality, etc. In 1937 two branches of monopoly companies were operating in Bushire, both with capital subscribed locally, both under head office in Tehran. The sugar monopoly, which in 1938 is to include the monopoly of tea, earned and naid a dividend of 25 per cent, compared with 22 per cent, net dividend in 1936-37 ; the piece-goods monopoly after an initial year in which no dividend was distributed, this year paid 15 per cent, on capital. Such modification complete the adaptation of Bushire to the system under which the individual as a commercial or industrial unit tends to be superseded by some form of communal activity. The few concessions made during the year to the individual, have had little effect in encouraging new trade ; the response to the placing of various items of export on a free list (category III) entailing the right to retain the foreign exchange proceeds of export, has been disappointing, not so much because merchants are slow or unwilling to trade under these conditions, as because it is increasingly difficult to find exportable goods for which there is sufficient demand abroad to render exportation profit able. The activity of the port presents a contrast to the inactivity of the town- From a peak in the winter 1936-37, Bushire foreign trade has continued active, though receding from the peak level, and landing and customs facilities have improved. In the early part of the year, congestion in the customs was a source of real difficulty ; ships had in some cases to overcarry cargo for lack of space in the wharves and warehouses. The inability of the Exchange Com mission to provide the necessary exchange was responsible for a complete cessation of customs clearances in April and June. In the last three months of the year, however, greater regularity on the part of the Commission (even though hand in hand with delay) has combined with internal organization in the Customs to remedy the position. The appointment of a new Provincial 53(c) ExAffairsDept.6 Director of Customs, Aqai Zelli, in August, was the prelude to the introduction of a rationalized system of marking and storing cargo, and the promulgation of a new tariff of landing charges. A second electric crane is also under construction and the wharves are in process of extension. Finally the revenue and customs departments, previously under one direction, are to be separated. From these signs of extension and reorganization, it is hard to confirm the prevalent opinion that the importance of Bushire is declining with its import ance as a trading centre. Hitherto Bandar Shahpour has not contributed to this end ; it will be interesting to see what will be the condition of Bushire port in a few years time, when and if proper port and railway facilities are provided in Bandar Shahpour. At present the jetty in the middle of marshes is the bogy of ships masters, and, where possible, cargo has been discharged for preference in Bushire or elsewhere. A survey of municipal and public works completed and in hand in 1937 shows : the opening of a new Iranian wireless station which in December was about to take over the duties of Messrs. Cable and Wireless ; the erection of a beacon for aerial and maritime navigation (the light has, however, rarely been seen) ; the placing in United Kingdom of a contract for a new electric light plant; progress in the construction of large Military barracks ; and desultory work on the roads. Three bread shops were also opened by the municipality with the object of curtailing fluctuations of price and possible exploitation by the bakers. Industry. —The spinning section of a new combined cotton mill—a private enterprise with a capital of Rials three million subscribed by merchants here and in Shiraz—was at the end of the year almost complete. Difficulty in obtaining first exchange against imports of machinery from England, and later raw cotton for spinning, has delayed work. The mill employs 200 spinning operatives at daily wages of Rials 2^—5 ; overlookers receive rials 350—450 monthly. It is intended to work two 12-hour shifts. At the time of writing 10 count yarn of good quality is being produced. The plant has been erected and the workers trained by British technicians. Agriculture. —Of the two main crops, wheat and barley grown in the Bushire, Dashti and Dashtistan districts, wheat come under Government monopoly in autumn 1936. A year's working of the monopoly shows its effect to be generally oppressive to the producer, though it is mitigated by the advantage, both to him and to the consumer, of a level price. The prices fixed in 1936 and ruling throughout 1937 were Rials 130 per 315 kilos 1st class. Rials 120 for 2nd, Rials 110 for third and Rials 100 for 4th class wheat. The price is not of itself unsatisfactory, comparing favourably with the wide fluctuation, from Rials 60—250 per kharvar, of barley ; but the method of collection and payment are the subject of universal complaint among growers. The grower himself must deliver his wheat to the monopoly, whose agents determine the quality and value,—a system of one-sided bargaining of obvious weakness. Only a proportion of the value is paid immediately and final settle ment is effected' often after a lapse of months. Early in the season export of wheat was free, but in February stocks in the hands of merchants and growers were taken up by the Revenue Department for sale to the Government and later taken over by the Customs. Considerable quantities of wheat have been exported to Europe to meet Government import commitments, and some doubt has been occasioned of the adequacy of remaining stocks. As necessity arises wheat is shipped between Bushire and Khorramshahr. The export of barley has hitherto remained free to merchants who have taken advantage of this to some extent. Little interest has been shown by the State in the producing as opposed to the marketing side of agriculture. There is no local branch of the Agricultural Bank and farmers are financed in part by merchants who have no better employment for their capital. A certain amount of cotton S3ed has been distributed, but no real attempt has been made to encourage its introduction as a crop. Tobacco is grown as a subsidiary crop in the Borazjan area. Prospects for the coming grain crop are satisfactory. Much the same area is now reported to be under cultivation as in 1936-37 when the harvest was good.7 2. Finance. —The financial activity of the town bears, like its other 4 acti vities, the mark of the general economic policy. The demand for credit is confined to providing bills drawn on merchants up country on account ot forwarding charges, etc., and fluctuates with the issue of exchange licences from Tehran. Both the National and Imperial banks have dufficulty in finding profitable business. Opportunities for investment are few and confidence in the future non-existent. Uncertainty as to the intentions and future (gene rally thought precarious) of the Exchange Commission, has not encouraged trade. During April and June no exchange permits were issued from Tehran to Bushire merchants and clearing came to a complete stop. Business done by the Banks was less towards the end of the year. Money was throughout easy and interest rates varied between the following extremes Bonque Mellie Iran 5—7| per cent., Imperial Bank of Iran 7—1U per cent, per annum. Illegitimate foreign exchange business is not on a large scale and it is not possible with any accuracy to quote a local ' black rate for rials. Indi cations such as the price at which exchange certificates change hands, show that the sterling value of rials on the market has declined through the year and stood in December at about Rials 140 to £1. 3. Foreign trade. —The following table shows the number of foreign steamers calling at Bushire during 1937 with approximate figures of cargo. I have no available earlier figures for comparison :— No. Foreign. No. British. Date. of ships. Import, in pacl Export. Lages, of ships. Import, in pacl Export, cages. 1936-37.

There is little change in the distribution of the carrying trade between British and other lines ^British bottoms continued to carry the larger share of exports, though that share has declined proportionately, and foreign steamers have the larger share of imports. In April British India line sailings were revised so that the fast mail steamer calls at Bushire once a fortnight instead of once weekly. This line, thanks to the regularity of sailings, secures the major part of export trade ; it also enjoys the virtual monopoly of cabo tage between Gulf ports and between those ports and India. If developing8 foreign interests in the Gulf were sufficient to encourage another line to offer equal facilities of frequent and regular sailings, the often very high, monopo listic freight charged by the British India would turn away a number of shippers. German interests. —The Hansa Line, with its fortnightly sailings from Europe direct to the Gulf, continues to bring more cargo for import than any other line. During the period March-December, 1937, thirty-one German steamers called at Bushire, landing 152,554 packages, and loading 30,949. Throughout the latter half of the year trade has been sufficient to justify twice- monthly steamers from Europe and a direct monthly sailing from New York for the car trade. In November 6 German steamers called. Imports consist mainly of machinery and heavy goods, tinplates, pipes and hardware ; exports are gum, barley, wool and seeds. Latterly German steamers have called frequently at Lingah, loading pearl shells. Japanese interests. —During 1937 sixteen Japanese steamers operated in the port and discharged 56,485 packages, an important part of the whole ; exports to Japan were negligible. This shipping activity was greatest in the early part of the year, and it is significant that over the final 6 months only five Japanese steamers called, discharging a mere 800 packages. Russian interests,- —Union of Soviet Socialist Republics trade through Bushire in 1937 consisted solely of imports of sugar and exports of cotton under barter agreement; [indeed this appears to be the only remaining Russian commercial activity in the Gulf. Four ships under charter landed some 91,000 bags of sugar from Odessa, and took 12,000 bales of cotton for that port. Four American, 2 Dutch (carrying tea) and 1 Italian steamer called during the year. Opium. —The following table shows exports through Bushire of opium for legitimate consumption during 1937 :— January . February . March April May June July August September October . November December. 300 cases—Germany. 50 ,, Hamburg. 200 „ Bangkok. 200 „ Macao. 20 „ Hamburg. 260 cases—Hamburg. 250 „ Hamburg. 200 „ London. 200 „ Macao. 200 cases—Far East. 100 Macao. Total 1,980 The cases are of standard weight, 160 lbs. The average value per case was £120. No export duty is levied. Of the above total 900 cases, or 45 per cent, were shipped to the Far East compared with 75 per cent, in 1936. The total export for legitimate con sumption of 1,980 cases compares with 1,350 in 1936 and 2,658 in 1935. Two further shipments made by Japanese steamer, one in March of 800, the other in December of 1,500 cases, were suspected to be for illicit use. On neither occasion did the cases bear a port mark, but both consignments were reported to be for the Far East. 4. Communication.—Sea. —Bushire is served regularly by three lines, the British India Steam Navigation Company to and from India, Hansa and S trick Lines to and from Europe. As from May 1937 the British India fast . J9 steamers ceased to carry the Iranian mails which are now carried by the weekly slow service ; the fast steamer calls in alternate weeks at Bahrain and Bushire. The Hansa line maintains a fortnightly service from North German ports, and a monthly service from New York. Strick steamers to and from United Kingdom call monthly. Other lines whose steamers visit Bushire at irregular intervals are : Ellerman and Bucknall, Java Silver Pacific, and the 4 Japanese, Mitsui Busen Kaisha, Yamashita, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Air. —Air France maintains a weekly connexion with India and Europe. Calls are influenced by the weather and the state of the landing-ground, over- carries being frequent in winter. K. L. M. (Dutch) planes have the option of landing, but their calls are increasingly rare. Road. —The embankment road to Borazjan and Shiraz, is now complete but has not yet been taken over by the authorities. This road, the only means of overland communication, • should, if maintained, ensure uninterrupted communication in future with the interior. Projects rumoured during the year of a lorry road in Bushire separate from the main road, and of a new route via Firuzabad to Shiraz, have not borne fruit. Average monthly transport rates by lorry varied between the following extremes :— Per Kharvar. Bushire to Shiraz Rls 65 in May. 110—120 in December Isfahan 140 „ 230—250 Tehran 180 „ 300—320 Rates are affected by pressure or lack of freight, by difficult road condi tions, by outside influences such as commandeering by authorities for military and other purposes. All three influences contributed to the high rates ruling in December ; conversely lack of demand and easier conditions enabled the more normal rate in May. Attempts by the Governor to fix rates for carrying Government goods have hitherto proved unsuccessful, as the transporters are jn a strong bargaining position and there is usually good demand for space. 5. Social conditions. —Social conditions, bad at the beginning of the year, have not improved. The merchant and small trader are deprived of business by the monopolization of articles of ordinary use, wheat, piece-goods, sugar, tea ; the ordinary consumer sees only the restrictions, high prices and heavy taxation resulting from the national economy, and has not, in Bushire, derived any of its advantages. Nothing but articles of immediate necessity and a verv few primitive comforts are to be bought in the bazaar. The price-index of common consumers' goods is a continuously and steeply rising one, as the table below shows :— Commodities. Cost at January, 1937. Cost at December, 1937. Tea . Rls. 20 per 500 gr. . . Rls. 18 per 500 gr. Bread ,, 2 per 7-75 lbs. . „ 2 • 45 per 7 •75 lbs. Flour „ 2*40 do. . „ 2-50 do. Ghee „ 35 do. • ,, 42 do. Meat . „ 8-25 do. . „ 11-20 do.

That local authorities realize how high is the cost of living and are not unwilling to rectify it, is shown by attempts on two occasions, both unhappily abortive, to fix food prices. An attempt to bring down the price of meat foundered on the opposition of the butchers ; another to regulate the price of bread was inherently unsuitable and the price fixed was never applied. 53(C) ExAffairsD r pt.10 The widespread taxation of articles of common use is particularly hard in its incidence on the poorer people, a relatively high proportion of whose budget must be spent on such taxed articles. Municipal rates are from 6—7 per cent.; there is a local tax of 3 per cent, ad valorem on merchandise brought into the town. During the past year, though wages remain low, employment of labourers has been good, the demand arising from work in progress on the roads, military barracks, and cotton mill. The following are representative daily wage- rates ;— Customs coolie ......... Rials 2—3 Labourer ........... 3J—4 Cotton operative ......... 2^—5 Semi skilled builder ......... 6 Skilled builder ......... 12 Carpenter ......... 12 Builders' foreman or mechanic ....... 20 The effect of these conditions is seen in 2 ways. There is and has been for several years, a tendency for people, both of the merchant and poorer classes, to migrate from Bushire. It is estimated that the population, once about 6 years ago, 20,000, has shrunk to about 8,000. The other effect is the pre valence and comparative success of smuggling : so long as prices are forced up inside the country, trading restricted, and the preventive authorities impers fectly organized or complacent, it is hard to foresee an end to this activity. The contraband trade is mainly in piece-goods, or other articles, tea and sugar, and originates for the most part in Bahrain and the Trucial Coast. T. R. SHAW, His Majesty's Vice-Consul,11 APPENDIX I. NOTES ON THE WORKING OF THE RESIDENCY DISPENSARY, BUSHIRE, FOR THE YEAR 1937. Lieut.-Colonel J. J. Rooney, I.M.S., was in charge from 1st January until he fproceeded on leave on 26th June. He resumed charge on the 27t'h Sep tember and held it until the end of the year. During his absence, 1st Class Assistant Surgeon R. Easey, I.M.D., officiated as Residency Surgeon. 1st Class Assistant Surgeon M. L. A. Steele, I.M.D., was in sub-charge from 1st January until 1st February. 1st Class Assistant Surgeon R. Easey, I.M.D., was in sub-charge from 1st February until the end of the year. Nothing of note occurred during the year. There were no epidemics. The weather throughout the year was average for the Persian Gulf. The number of indoor and outdoor patients compared with those of 19S6 were as follows :— In- Out- Operations, patients. patients. 1936 l 10,990 168 1937 6 11,339 207 Malaria, as usual, was the most prevalent disease and accounted for approximately a third of the total attendances. J. J. ROONEY, Lieut.-Colonel, I.M.S.y Residency Surgeon.15 CHAPTER II. NOTE ON EVENTS IN MISHUN AND GACH QARAGHULI AREAS DURING 1937. Geological and Seismic. —Geological and Geophysical work continued throughout the year in connection with the future development of the Area, and also with the object of finding evidence of further structures. Two oil wells were completed on the main structure and work on 4 other locations was in hand at the end of the year. Roads. —The movable bridge over the Zuhra River on the Ganowah- Gach Saran Road is now in commission, and a diversion was constructed on this road close to the Kuh-i-Mishun, its object being to reduce the length of the road and improve its alignment. Roads internal to the Area were cons tructed and improved as work demanded. The road from Gach Saran to Pazanun via Behbehan is now in regular use and it is proposed during 1938 to construct a permanent bridge over the Khairabad River which will convert this road into an all-weather one. Pending the completion of this bridge the road is closed for some 4 months during the year while the Khairabad river is in spate. This road forms part of the new Government road from Behbehan to Basht and so on to Kazarun, and it is of interest to note that the Government are constructing a number of bridges on this road, one of them being on the section used by the Company over the Shams-i-Arab River. An all-weather aerodrome has been constructed in the Gach Saran Area. Buildings. —New living quarters for all classes of employees have been built, but these are only of a temporary nature as yet pending the final selection of a site for the permanent establishment. A small petrol still has been installed in the area to deal with the local demands for petrol. Water supply. —The new Water Supply has now been completed, and sufficient water for all needs in the Area is pumped from the Zuhra River. Wireless Communications. —The Wireless Station at Gach Saran now contains a short wave transmitter for telegraphy and telephony, the station at Ganowah still operating on Morse only. Oil Reserves. —Work was continued throughout the year in the opening up of the Southern Area with the objective of proving oil reserves in the Gach Saran Area {N.B. —Gach Saran is the name for the area previously c ailed Gach Qaraguli). The Company was successful in obtaining evidence of substantial oil reserves, the extent of which cannot yet be estimated. Oil has been proved, however, in sufficient quantities to justify the laying of a 12' pipeline to connect this area with our Refinery at Abadan. Preparations are now in hand for the laying of this line which will be completed within the next two vears. Staff. —The following British and British Indian subjects were employed in the Area :— 35 British 15 British Indian and the total number of British and British Indian subjects, including the wives and children of those employed in the area was 47 British 17 British Indian. Welfare. —At Ganowah the jetty face has been improved to enable the free movement of barges, and some improvement to the quarters has also been effected.16 CHAPTER III. SUMMARY OF EVENTS AND CONDITIONS IN FARS DURING THE YEAR 1937. 1. General situation. —The outstanding events of the year have been the visit of ^the Shah to Shiraz ; the abrupt departure and downfall of the Gover nor General and the subsequent change of most of the Provincial officials ; the arrest of the ^General Officer Commanding the Fars Division and of many- officers and other persons who had dealing with him ; unrest in tribal areas ; serious drought and partial failure of the crops ; falling off of trade through dislocation of the market for exports and lack of foreign exchange to pay for imports ; and finally the disappearance of Fars as a separate administrative unit. 2. The population of Shiraz is said to be about 120,000, including the military garrison of 7,000. A further force of at least 3,000 is on detachment in the Province or in districts bordering on it. The total population of Fars is in the neighbourhood of 400,000, of whom less than half are settled in towns and villages. During the past few years it is believed that from 60,000 to 80,000 tribesmen have left the country to avoid conscription and forced settlement. 3. In the early part of the year employment was found in Shiraz on finishing the barracks and on preparations for the Shah's visit. The spinning and hand-weaving establishments absorbed a few hundreds, mostly of women and children, while the men were engaged on work in the cotton and beet fields. There has also been a steady movement to other towns, notably Isfahan and Abadan, where work is more plentiful and wages higher. The maximum wage earned in the Shiraz spinning mills is 3 rials per day. 4. Preparations for the visit of His Majesty the Shah included the patch ing of roads, whitewashing buildings, and enclosing all empty spaces on his route with walls. The troops and the school children were drilled day and night and all stray dogs were destroyed. Large funds were collected under pressure from the Governor General and a sum of over a thousand pounds was said to have been required for the erection of thirty arches and pergolas. Most of these were demolished with pickaxe and hammer as soon as they were up, on instructions from Tehran, as the visit was to take place in Muharrem. Expensive gold oranaments were also subscribed for by the women of Shiraz and by t^he industrial companies. An armed police force from the Capital took charge of the town and spies mingled with the people. In short, much was done in advance to render the visit unpalatable and little during its pro gress to make it agreeable to the inhabitants. 5. His Majesty arrived on March 27 and left on March 30. On arrival he inspected some of the assembled School children and he praised the ap pearance of a contingent from Miss Gerrard's Girls' School. There is no record of much else having given satisfaction. He visited nothing but the barracks and an industrial exhibition, but was pleased with neither. The Valiahd, who accompanied his father, was not permitted to deputise for him and few persons were received by the Shah or by any of his suite. This complete aloofness was taken to indicate displeasure with Shiraz and a deli berate intention to show it. Possible causes for this were the petitions present ed, urging modifications of the Government's economic policy, the failure of the industrial community to extend their activities, the complaints received about the cost of living, and the uncompleted state of the barracks. 6. The visit can have done nothing to increase the popularity of the: Shah or of his regime. No opportunity was taken of showing the Valiahd to the people nor of letting him see anything of value to himself. His Majesty's suite included the Qawam ul Mulk, formerly owner of a large part of the town and district and Tribal Governor, and the Amir Chevket ul Mulk, formerly hereditary Governor of Kain and Birjand, who has since been appointed17 Governor General of Fars. Both had been in forced residence at Tehran for some years. An obelisk has since been erected to commemorate the Valiahd's first visit to Fars. 7. The inclusion of the Qawam ill Mulk in the Shah's suite following on a marriage between their children was thought to indicate designs' on some of the properties still owned by the family. It has long been rumoured that the {Shah's daughter may be brought to reside at Shiraz and villages are reported to have been bought or acquired by the Authorities as gifts to her. 8. An official dinner and reception were given by the Governor General on the occasion of the Shah's Birthday, which His Majesty's Consul and the two Vice Consuls were invited to attend in uniform. The usual No Rouz reception was cancelled, as it was decided to have no official or social functions in Muharrem. The Valiahd's Birthday was celebrated with demonstrations of school-boys and Boy Scouts. 9. There have been no incidents during the year in which foreign sub jects were involved, but there has been a falling off in the courtesy shown by officials to foreigners. Permits have frequently been delayed or withheld and social intercourse has been restricted in accordance with orders from Tehran. The boycott of the Consulate has been intensified and has been extended from officials to other notables, most of whom were instructed to stay away from a Garden Party held to celebrate the Coronation of King George VI, though some of them had already accepted the invitation. Spe cial permission was given to a junior employee of the Education Department to teach Persian to the Vice-Consul. Persons who were formerly friendly with the Indian Pro-Consul have been warned to avoid him. The Governor General admits that instructions on these matters have been received but states that they have reference to social contacts only and not to business dealings such as could affect the Imperial Bank of Iran or trade relations. These matters have affected all foreigners equally and no longer seem to be inspired solely by the local military authorities. 10. The unveiling of women is now a thing of the past. The ' chaddur ' is practically never seen and more or less European clothing, is now universal ly worn by men and women of all classes who appear in public. The Shah's Birthday reception might have been in some Eastern European Capital, but it was noticeable that the sexes kept completely separate. Signs of western influence, however, have been completely eliminated in other direc tions. All notices and advertisements in foreign languages have been remov ed. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Imperial Bank of Iran, Indian and Armenian Shops have been instructed to change their English Signboards and the Hotels their French ones. Cinema notices are all exhibited in Per sian. To conform with modern ideas, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ob tained special permission to include camels in a film taken early in the year showing views of Persepolis with a tank lorry as an indication of progress. 11. The cancellation of functions at No Rouz and the removal of the decorations before the Shah's visit have already been mentioned. As these fell in Muharrem it was decided, though in each case at the eleventh hour, to respect religious susceptibilities. It was announced that the Aid-i-Ghurban and the Aid-i-Ghadir could be celebrated instead of No Rouz. 12. On the occasion of the inspection of Registration offices by a high official from Tehran in July, all the Mullahs employed there were reported to be in European dress. So also were a few at the official reception of the Shah, but many stayed away on that occasion. 13. Despite the haphazard sanitation and lack of discipline in barracks and the antiquated town drainage and scavenging arrangements, the general health of the town has been good throughout the year after an epidemic of influenza in the winter. Fevers and malaria are said to be more prevalent in the areas where cotton has been introduced. Work on the new Municipal Hospital was begun but stopped through lack of funds. A small clinic for women and children was opened by the Lion and Red Sun organisation. Towards the end of the year classes for nurses were begun under the Educa tion Department, with the co-operation of an American lady teacher, a local 63(C) EzAfiairtiDept.18 Iranian doctor, and the Church Missionary Society's hospital. The present Municipal Hospital was found to be quite unsuitable and inadequately equip ped for demonstration purposes. 14. Much attention continues to be given to the outdoor training of boys and girls. There are now eighteen troops of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, with 656 members. A local Sports and Youth Commission has had monthly subscriptions amounting to a large sum promised by industrial and trading companies, merchants and cinemas. It is proposed to purchase land and lay out a sports ground. A garden planted by the Municipality on the site of an old cemetery was considered for the purpose but it has been condemned as insanitary by the local Health Officer and by the military doctors. 15. No cases of interference with traffic on the main roads have been reported, but burglaries have been frequent in the town, perhaps not un connected with the vicinity of the barracks to the houses visited. Several Europeans have suffered in this way during the year. Cases of robbery in the Bazaar have been reported in the Press. No doubt the rise in the cost of living and the increasing poverty of large numbers of the people contribute to this state of affairs. 16. The Head of the Municipality was arrested early in August and shortly afterwards several members of his staff were dismissed, of whom some were imprisoned. A month later the Governor General was ordered to go to Tehran. He was arrested in Isfahan and has been in prison since. The Directors of the Agricultural Department and of the Post and Telegraph Depart ment and the local Managers of the Grain Purchasing Office and of the wool and cotton Company were dismissed, and shortly afterwards the Head of the Finance Department and the Director of the Registration Department were transferred. The Officer in Command of Road Guards has also been sus pended. As the result of investigations into the peculations of the late Governor General and of other officials, many arrests have been made and the prison is now full to overflowing. The fall of the Governor General appears to have been largely in connexion with the failure to settle tribes in fixed areas and the acceptance of bribes to permit the usual migrations, while false reports were sent to Tehran. The dealings of merchants, butchers, taxi drivers and others with the Municipality and with the Governor General, and the disposal of funds collected at the time of the Shah's visit have been under examination. The Court for dealing with Officials is still sitting in Shiraz. 17. At the same time, the General Officer Commanding the Fars Divi sion was arrested and a military tribunal, which is also still at work, has ordered the arrest of many officers and the examination of merchants and landowners who have had improper dealings with the military authorities. The tribal settlement arrangements and connivance at smuggling and its pos sible connexion with unrest amongst the tribes of Kuhgilu and in Laristan were the main causes of these investigations. 18. Tribal Affairs. —In the Spring a civil Governor of the Qashgai tribes was appointed and he later became Director of Tribal Settlement for all Fars. It was proposed to abolish all the military sub-Governors. As the result of long tours of inspection carried out through the summer by a General from the Ministry of War, this official was arrested along with other high civil and military officials, as already described. There had been many irregu larities and the^re was much discontent throughout the tribal areas. Ex cessive agricultural difficulties had been made by the Authorities in a year of drought and scarcity. The growing of opium poppies was forbidden. Flocks are said to be less numerous, as crops have to be sown for fodder when free pasturage is no longer available owing to the restriction of migration. For similar reasons lambskins have deteriorated in quality and in quantity and horse-breeding has diminished. More recently, owing to their extreme poverty, and to the difficulties of dealing with the officials of the Skin Mono poly Company, it is said that female lambs are being killed for food by vil lagers in some districts. The former arrangements by which country pro duce was bartered for the necessities of life, piece goods, sugar and tea, have19 been upset by the Village Co-operative Societies under Government control, which have not proved to the advantage of the villager or tribesmen. 19. Discontent came to ahead in August. A report was received of a severe defeat of the troops in Kuhgilu by Boir Ahmedi tribes. 1,500 men were at once sent out in lorries and cars requisitioned from the public. It was rumoured that there had been an attack on Behbehan and that the south ern oilfields were in danger. At the same time the Bahmai tribe engaged troops from Ahwaz and the dissident tribes joined forces. Finally, after 3,000 troops had been despatched from Shiraz to co-operate with the Ahwaz force, the area was surrounded and the military authorities claim to have captured many rifles at the expense of several hundred casualties on both sides. It is evident that there has been much gun-running recently, and the tribes appear to be well supplied with ammunition. The troops are still in Mamassani and Kuhgilu territory, where it is intended to isolate the tribes for the winter. 20. Trouble spread from Kuhgilu to the Khamseh tribes near Lar, who attacked Road Guard posts during the summer, wh ch sought to interfere with their smuggling activities. It was necessary to send a detachment of troops to deal with this, but there was no general rising. Detachments have also been engaged from time to time in the coastal districts of Laristan and Dashtistan. 21. There was talk in Shiraz of a revolution planned to follow a success ful rising of all the Qashgai tribes. Endeavours are now being made to fasten responsibility for this on to the late General Officer Commanding the troops. The general discontent with the Government's settlement policy is a more likely cause, aided by the system of bribery recently in force under which migration, smuggling and gun-running were permitted by the military and civil authorities. 22. Local administration. —There has been no change in the five repre sentatives of Fars in the Mejliss. All of them have visited the Province during the year. They are all local business men or landowners. Deputies were also elected for Lar, Firuzabad, Jahrum, Fasa and Abadeh. 23. Other official visitors during the year have been Aqai Bayat, Direc tor General of the Department of Agriculture ; Sertip Feruz, General Officer in Command of Road Guards ; Aqai Samri, Acting Director General of Public Security ; Aqai Farrukh, Minister of Industries and Mines ; Sertip Na-qdi, Tribal Settlement Department of the Ministry of War ; the Inspector General of Registration Offices ; and the Head of the Wheat Stabilisation Depart ment. 24. Aqai Abul Fath Doulatshahi remained Governor General of Fars until August, when he was summoned to Tehran. His arrest has already been described. He was not popular in the Province and his peculations in collusion with the Military and with the Municipal authorities met their inevitable reward. His preparations for the Shah's visit and his ceaseless attempts to organise Companies and to juggle with the cash subscribed for various purposes are believed to have brought him in a large profit. It is known that considerable private debts were paid off out of the proceeds. 25. His Excellency's dealings with the Consulate were friendly. He was most cordial on the occasion of the Shah's Birthday dinner party, though he ignored most of his subordinates, and he organised a luncheon party in honour of the Head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office. As sistance was given in various personal matters connected with the Police and a polite interest was taken in the Consulate water supply, instructions being given to the Municipality to cease interfering with it after it has already been successfully tapped. Other routine matters were dealt with reason ably promptly. His Excellency was present at a King's Birthday dinner party at the Consulate and the Acting Governor General attended a service in the Mission Church and a Garden Party at the Consulate, in the absence of the Governor General, in celebration of the Coronation. He was not punctilious in the matter of returning vidts.20 26. He was succeeded by Aqai Mohamed Ibrahim Alam (formerly the- Amir Chevket ul Mulk), who arrived in Shiraz on September 7 (His Excellency is mentioned in Personalities in Persia, 1930, under the name of Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, C.I.E.). He was appointed to Ears unexpectedly, not having held any administrative post before under the present regime. He was formerly hereditary Governor of Kain and Birjand, but has resided for some years in Tehran. The appointment of one of the old nobility as Governor General of Fars is an interesting experiment. The district which he adminis ters has since been re-organised and he has been confirmed in his post with the title of Astandar-i-Junub (Governor of the Southern District). 27. His Excellency keeps completely aloof from local society and sees little of his subordinates or military colleagues. Relations with the Consulate hitherto have been courteous and helpful. It has been necessary again to discuss the Consulate water and also the desecration of the' English Cemetery. The Governor General was formerly very friendly towards British consular officers and others who visited his district in East Persia. In view of this and of his British decoration, it has been found prudent to restrict social relations in order not to embarrass him vis-d-vis the present Government. The Acting Political Resident accordingly did not call on him when in Shiraz on recess. 28. The Municipality was under the direction of Aqai Suhaily, brother of the Iranian Minister in London, until August when he was removed. He was brought back from Tehran under escort and has been in prison in Shiraz for two months. Though largely the catspaw of the Governor General, he and the Municipal Council have been guilty of numerous malpractices in the matter of licenses and control of prices. There is little to show for his tenure of office but work begun and not carried out. His successor is carrying on with some of these schemes. They include a Hospital, an Orphanage, a Municipal Tea-house and Guest-room for official visitors near the site of the Quran-Gate, repair of the small bridge over the river on the Isfahan Road, and the continuation of the central avenue of the town, Khiaban Zand, east ward through the centre of the town and bazaar. This street is now opened up and in use by traffic for a distance of one and a half miles, but nearly half its length is bordered by ruined houses. Some of the bazaar demolitions have been cleared away. Compensation was paid to the Imperial Bank of Iran for the expropriation of their land for this purpose. 29. One of the few survivors of the purge is the Chief of Police, who has continued friendly towards the Consulate, though a little over-curious regarding visitors and their movements. He furnished guides on several occasions for British travellers who wished to visit mosques and other public buildings, and he made prompt though unfruitful enquiries when damage was done in the Cemetery. He has effected the change of all foreign notices to the Iranian language without undue friction and has been instructed recently to devote his attention to the sun in the national emblem, as depicted on papers and buildings, from which the human features are to be removed. 30. The Acting Director of Public Security visited Shiraz during the year and the Force has remained smart in appearance since his departure. Burniaries were prevalent in the summer, but articles stolen from the Consul's car and from the Bank Manager's car were in each case recovered, though aitides taken from the latter's house were unfortunately not found. 31. Some difficulties were experienced by the Church Missionary Society in connexion with Church services and literature for Iranian subjects. 32. During the summer economic conferences were held in Tehran to consider future agricultural and industrial prospects, to which the Governor General and the Director of the Finance Department went together with many of the leading notables of the town to watch events and one another. After the departure of the Governor General enquiries were made into the working of various branches of the Finance Department. Finally the Director was transferred in October and the head of the Grain Purchasing Office was dismissed. 33. Stocks of grain and flour have been low throughout the year owing to the operations of the central authorities in Tehran. The local office has made continual difficulties for the German owner of a small flour mill and for21 the general public. During the summer the Director General of the Grain Stabilisation Department visited Shiraz with a view to finding out what stocks were available for supply to other centres and possibly for export. Later in the year the Military Department took over supervision of the collec tion of crops. It was reported that 200 rials per kharvar was being paid to cultivators, who were not allowed to keep even enough for local requirements. When bought back from the stores in Shiraz it cost three times that amount. Towards the end of the year imported wheat arrived from Bushire for local use. There was then only one month's supply in stock and supplies promised from the north were not forthcoming. 34. The Opium Monopoly Office has had little to do during the year. Early in the season ground already sown with seed was ploughed up in ac cordance with the latest instructions. After examination in conjunction with the Agricultural Department, it has been decided to allow limited cultiva tion in the Fasa and Abadeh districts in the coming year. 35. The Tobacco Monopoly Office has been concerned chiefly with ar rangements for winding up the local industry in favour of cigarettes manu factured in the Government factory near Tehran. Local cultivation of to bacco has ceased entirely. 36. The Banque Melli opened new branches at Lar and at Abadeh during the year. These are said to assist in the collection of taxes and to act as a check on other branches of the Finance Department. The Shiraz Manager was transferred to Isfahan. His successor does not appear to be as well dis posed towards the Imperial Bank of Iran. He has made himself unpopular with local merchants, who dislike his peremptory manner. 37. The Customs Department at Bushire has proved dilatory and very tiresome in the clearance of goods addressed to the Consulate at Shiraz and to members of the staff. Complaints have been made against the treatment of ladies arriving and leaving. 38. The Bushire and Isfahan roads were put into tolerably good condi tion for the Shah's visit. Work has been in progress on the Mashileh section. In the autumn work was recommenced on the Firuzabad-Bushire road, which it is apparently intended to carry through. 39. An irrigation scheme for bringing water from the Shapur River to the Kazerun plain has been under consideration. 40. The mail has been most irregular in arrival during the latter part of the year. Censorship operations have resulted in considerable interference with newspapers and other printed matter. Changes in the mail arrange ments in the Persian Gulf caused delay to the overland mail and to the Indian mail for Southern Iran. The local post and telegraph offices have been rea sonably efficient and apologetic. During the summer the Provincial Direc tor was involved in the events connected with the late Governor .General and was dismissed. 41. A telegraph line from Kazerun to Fahlian (Mamessani) has been completed. 42. The Director of Education is an energetic ea:-Army officer who has lived many years in Europe. He has improved the accommodation and the standard of education of many of the Shiraz schools. Primary classes for adults, night classes and lectures have been organised. An Educational Museum was opened during the year. The Department has also been actively concerned with the enrolment and training of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. Recently a course for training nurses has been started under an American specialist. The Education Authorities have also undertaken the restoration of the garden and buildings around the Tomb of Hafiz and in the Masjid-i- Vakil. The Ministry of Education also keeps a vague eye on Persepolis and maintains a representative there, who was much in evidence on the occasion of the Shah's visit and of that of the Head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office. Much help and kindness have been shown to other visitors to Shiraz during the year. The Provincial Director has also been of great assistance to Miss Gerrard, an Anglo-Iranian subject, in connexion with her Girls' School. 53(C) ExAffairsDept22 43. The Lawcourts, Registration and Census Offices have come very little under the notice of the Consulate. A new Rais-i-Estinaf (Judge of the Court of Appeal) was appointed early in the year. Enquiries made after a fatal accident to some workmen at the Church Missionary Society's Church at one time seemed likely to be embarrassing to the Mission Chaplain, who is in charge of the building. The investigations of the Court for Officials have been described. During their course, the Imperial Bank was requested to give statements of various accounts in the names of clients. One of the arrested merchants was able to arrange to be lodged in the Church Missionary Society Hospital, whence he emerged a free man to leave the Iranian Govern ment to pay the bill. 44. Agriculture. —The year has been a bad one for all rain crops owing to prolonged drought, so that returns have barely compensated for seeds sown in some districts. The cotton crop was satisfactory and beet is said to exceed last year's production. The total grain crop was 50 per cent, under normal*. The area sown with cotton, beet and wheat is said to be 600,000 hectares. This area can probably only be increased by irrigation. Two important schemes have been under consideration for some years. The heavy loss consequent on the prohibition of opium production has not been made good by these crops. The result of present conditions has been a rise of 200 per cent, since 1934 in the price of commodities produced for food and fodder. As all production has recently been dependent on the Agricultural Depart ment and the Trading Companies with Government monopolies for all traffic in cotton, wool, sugar, dried fruits, almonds, gums and skins, local interests have small grounds for satisfaction. There is a local project for a Company to be formed to supply agricultural machinery and expert advice, with a capital of 400,000 rials, but so far none has been imported. 45. Cotton is entirely handled by the Sherket-i-Pashm, Pust va Pambeh, which supplies seed and has branches in Shiraz, Abadch, Fasa, Darab, Jehrum, Firuzabad, Kazerun and Mamessani for supervision of sowing and cultiva tion and purchase of the crops. Ginning plants have been installed in Shiraz, Kazerun and Fasa. 26,000 hectares were sown in the Iranian year 1316, which is more than double the previous year. Fars is now third in importance in Iran as a cotton growing area, after Mazanderan and Khorassan. The estimated crop was given as 66,000 kharvars (20,000 tons). This has sup plied the Shiraz and Isfahan mills and a small quantity was shipped from Bushire to the U. S. S. PL 46. Beetroot was produced in sufficient quantity for the Merv Dasht refinery. The production of sugar last season was 5,866 tons in two months working. The area in which beet sowing is compulsory has been reduced, but it is expected that sufficient will be grown to keep the refinery open for three months this winter. The quality of the sugar is good and its price on the market is kept slightly lower than that of imported sugar. 47. The estimated crops of grain last year were :—wheat 100,000 kharvars ; barley 50,000 kharvars, sesame 4,000 khavars. These figures were not realis ed. The harvest was taken in slowly and wastefully, as labourers are better paid for work in cotton and beet fields, in addition to which these are more paying crops to grow. Rice growing has been prohibited entirely. 48. There is a large production of apricots, grapes and other fruits, which are exported dried, and of almonds. These are all a monopolv of the Sherket-i-Khoshkbar. 49. Wool and lambskins are also monopoly products. Production has diminished in quantity and quality owing to Government interference. The 8herket-i-Pust Narm (Soft Skin Company) seems to have lost the regular market and local supplies have been sent to Tehran instead of being shipped abroad as formerly. n 50. Gum Tragacanth is a valuable trade, which is also handled by a sepa rate monopoly company. 51. Flocks and herds are under the supervision of an Austrian veterinary surgeon, under the Agricultural Department, who makes periodical tours of districts where cattle, sheep and goats are bred, in addition to advising the town slaughter houses.23 52. Economic affairs. —Dissatisfaction with trade restrictions, monopolies, exchange control and Government intervention in general caused a petition to be presented to the Shah during his visit to Shiraz. After the death of the Minister of Finance modifications were discussed in Tehran and the new Minister of Commerce has proved sympathetic to the extent of securing the curtailment of some of the powers of the monopoly companies. Not only had production of gum, almonds, dried fruits, carpets, and skins decreased, as the opportunity for individual profit was taken away, but the actual mar kets have been partly lost. Meanwhile Banks have restricted credit consi derably, particularly to the new Companies, which are badly managed. 53. Merchants are now free to export most commodities under license from the Monopoly Company concerned and endeavours are being made to rega n the old markets. A very large proportion of the produce of Fars goes to the U. S. S. R. or to Germany as part of the trading agreements with Iran. A quantity of cotton yarn from the local mills was exported to Germany during the year, but this was stopped owing to Russian representations. 54. Imports are in the main cotton piece-goods, sugar, tea and hardware* Stocks of all of these in the country are said to be in excess of requirements and permits to import more have been refused. The necessary foreign ex change to pay for such imports, however, was not available. Similar consi- derations have prevented the purchase of more machinery for the existing mills or for others planned, and the arrival of motor lorries and cars and accessories has been delayed, thus causing great dislocation to trade, agri culture and industry. Smuggled goods of all kinds are to be seen in increasing quantities. 55. The Sherket-i-Qumash (Cotton Piece Goods Company) has imported a certain quantity of goods from Manchester and from Bombay. Otherwise the market is stocked with Russian cloth. The only other British product of importance is tea. 56. The Trading Companies established in Shiraz at the end of the year were :— Sherket-i-Sahami Tijaret-i-Fars va Banader (general trade). Sherket -i-Sahami Pashm, Pust va Pambeh (wool, hides, cotton). Sherket-i-Sahami Pust Narm-i-Fars (skins). Sherket -i-Sahami Ketira-i-Fars (gum tragacanth). Sherket-i-Sahami Tijaret-i-Junub (general trade). Sherket -i-Sahami Muammelat-i-Amta-i-Vatan (general and local trade in Iranian manufactures). Sherket -i-Tijaret-i-Fars (general trade: in liquidation). Sherket -i-Sahami Dukhaniat-i-Fars (tobacco : in course of reformation). Sherket -i-Sahami Tutun va Sigaret-i-Fars va Banader va Junub (tobacco : in course of reformation). Sherket -i-Sahami Tuntun va Sigaret-i-Fars (tobacco: in course of reformation). Sherket -i-Sahami Otomobil-i-Fars va Banader (motor cars and spare parts). Sherket-i -Sahami Qumash -i -Fars (cotton goods). Sherket -i-Sahami Qumash-i-Shiraz va Tavab (cotton goods). Sherket-i -Sahami Gand va Shcker (sugar : local and imported). Sherket-i -Rusta'i (Village Co-operative Society : local trade). Sherket-i-Qali (carpets). Sherket-i-Kalah-i-Fars (local trade). In most of these. Government has sufficient interest to give a measure of control. 57. Local industries have not been extended during the year owing to the lack of capital and of Government permits to obtain machinery. The Fars Manufacturing Company having actually ordered British Spinning Machinery to double their plant had to cancel the order. The new buildings24 are finished and it is now proposed to import weaving machinery if an ex change permit can be obtained. Production of yarn was kept up for part of the year, until stocks accumulated which could not be disposed of. The selling 'price dropped from Rials 70 to R^als 48 per bundle. Since then only two shifts of one hundred and fifty workers each have been employed and the mill at present is only working five day^in the week. 58. The spinning mill owned by Dehqan Brothers, attached to the Elec tric Company, commenced production at the No Rouz. 30-count yarn is turned out, which does not compete with the other mill. Some was shipped to Germany in the summer. A plan for a second mill has not been proceeded with. 50. The Directors of these mills formed a subsidiary company, which operates the cotton ginning plants in Shiraz and other parts of the Province in co-operation with the Wool and Cotton Company. 60. An establishment started by the Agricultural Bank is producing handwoven cloth and smaller articles. The looms were obtained from India and machines for making ribbons and shoelaces from Japan. The looms are sold or hired to weavers on an instalment plan, payment being effected by sale of the products of the looms. Apprentices are trained. 61. The Fars Electric Company has ordered a new British diesel engine of 650 H. P., which has remained in the Customs at Bushire throughout most of the year. It has now been cleared, but difficulties have arisen over the payment of a foreign expert required to erect it. As from the No Rouz a ten-hour service was given for town lighting, starting at sunset. The price per unit was at the same time reduced from Rials 5 to Rials 3-50. Since the cotton mill started working the plant has been overloaded. 62. The Khollar Wine Factory continued to produce wine, spirits, and various liqueurs, a small quantity being supplied to Tehran and other cen tres. A German engineer is in charge. 63. Plants for a cotton print factory, a second spinning mill, cement works, a pottery factory, and soap and perfumery works have not been pro ceeded with. 64. The Industrial Companies in operation at the end of the year were :— Sherket-i-Sahami Nassaji-i-Fars (Fars Manufacturing Co.). Sherket-i-Sahami Bargh-i-Fars (Fars Electric Co.). Sherket-i-Sanayi-dasti (Handicrafts Co.). Sherket-i-Khollar-i-Fars (Khollar Wine Co.). 65. The Government Sugar Refinery at Merv Dasht, 30 miles north of Shiraz, re-opened for the winter season in November. 66. Military affairs. —The strength of the Fars Division remains about the same. There have been various detachments on duty in different parts of the Province during most of the year. The Shiraz barracks are now com pleted and training has proceeded as usual. Unrest in Kuhgilu necessitated a military expedition in the autumn. General Zandieh was replaced as General Officer in Command by General Amidi. 67. The Road Guards (Amnieh) have been kept up to strength. Various incidents occurred in Laristan with smugglers and troops had to be sent after an attack on a post near Lar in September. The Officer Commanding Amnieh was suspended in December and a new and energetic Colonel from Tehran has taken over. 68. British interests. —The Consulate was in charge of Mr. A. E. Watkinson throughout the year. His Majesty's Consul visited Isfahan from April 4 to May 3 and again from October 10 to November 6, and also paid a visit to Tehran. Mr. W. H. Young, Acting Vice-Consul at Shiraz, left for Tehran on January 3 and was succeeded by Mr. R. F. G. Sarell. Mr. Sarell and Mr. R. Cecil were attached to the Consulate on language duty during the year, a part of which was spent in Isfahan. Mr. Cecil left for the United Kingdom on sick leave in September. Mr. Sarell was posted temporarily to Tehran o*i ,December 15. Khan Bahadur W. A. Ahad remained Pro- Consul throfighout the year.25 69. Official receptions were held in celebration of the King's Coronation and of the King's Birthday. Flanders Poppies were sold to the British community on Armistice Day. The sum of Rials 760 was collected for the Earl Haig Fund ; a sum of Rials 340 was realised by sale of Coronation pro grammes and emblems for the King George V Jubilee Fund. 70. During 1937 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran and family, and Mr. G. W. Rendel, of the Foreign Office, visited Shiraz with his wife. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Officiating Political Resident, the Secretary and the Under-Secretary came up from Bushire on recess. Other visitors included Lady Fowle and Mr. Tomlinson ; Colonel Pybus, Mr. Trott, Mr. Summerhayes, Mr. Loxley, and Mr. Young, of the Legation staff; Major Lincoln, His Majesty's Consul at Kerman ; and Captain Stewart, His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Khorremshahr. 71. Non-official visitors included Lady Fitzherbert, the Bishop in Iran and Mrs. Thompson ; Dr. and Mrs. Schaffter, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Gurney, of the Church Missionary Society in Isfahan ; Mr. Richards, of the Mission in Yezd; Mr. Millar, Mr. Glendenning, Mr. Cartright, and Mr. Kalberer, of the Imperial Bank, with families ; Dr. Pinkerton, the Rev. L. Reed, and Mr. Smith, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ; Colonel Chapman, Indian Medical Service ; Mr. and Mrs. Sowerby and Major Garry, from India ; Miss Palmer Smith, of Tehran ; Miss Camm, of Girton College, and Miss Warburton, of C. M. S. Headquarters ; and a party of students under the auspices of the National Union of Students. 72. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company completed their bulk tanks in Shiraz and at the Sugar Refinery, but pumps are not yet installed for use of the public. Oil is also supplied to the cotton mills. The Isfahan Manager has paid frequent visits to Shiraz during the year. The same Iranian Manager has remained in charge of the local office. Early in the year scenes for a film were taken by the Company at Persepolis. Geologists have been at work in the Western portions of the Province for the last six months. 73. Mr. H. Musker was in charge of the Imperial Bank of Iran throughout the year. There have been four accountants, Mr. Jones, Mr. Quilliam, Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Wilkes. In October the Bank moved into new premises, which had been completed in six months by a local merchant to the Bank's design and taken on a long lease. 74. The Church Missionary Society Hospital has been working at full pressure through the year. Dr. Martin was transferred to Kerman, leaving Dr. Mess in charge with three sisters. The Rev. R. N. Sharp arrived from Yezd in April and commenced to build a church which was partly finished at the end of the year. Miss Gerrard went on furlough in June, leaving Miss Marie Stewart in charge of the Girls' School. Great assistance was given to the American Lady engaged by the Iranian Government to train nurses. 75. The Fars Manufacturing Company employed three English engi neers at the beginning of the year. Mr. Agar left for Bushire and Mr. Ireson for England. Only Mr. Blackwell now remains as Technical Manager. 76. An Indian Electrical engineer is in charge of the Fars Electric Com pany Power Station. 77. The British Community in the Consular district numbers 135, of whom 62 are in Shiraz. 78. Much of the work of the Consulate continued to be connected with Isfahan. In addition to the usual economic and other reports and routine matters, there has been correspondence with Government on Consulate water, the guardianship of the children of a deceased British Indian, estates, exchange control and customs regulations as affecting British subjects, relations of the Bank and of the Mission with the local authorities, and the robbery of the English cemetery. 79. The Consulate was able to assist the Residency in dealing with the landlord and other matters connected with their rented houses in Shiraz and by sending supplies of various stores from time to time. In return the Political Resident was good enough to allow the Vice-Consuls attached to the Consulate for language study to occupy one of the bungalows during a 53(C) ExAffairsDept26 part of the year when it was not required for the Residency staff. The Con sulate is much indebted to the Residency for the frequent arduous work of clearing goods through the Customs at Bushire for use of the Shiraz staff. 80. Foreign interests. —The German colony is now the biggest foreign community in fehiraz. In addition to the two old residents mentioned in last year's Summary, there are Germans in the Agricultural Department, the Municipal Offices, the Wine Factory, the Fars Electric Spinning Mill, and in the I echnical School. A reception was held on the anniversary of the founda tion of the Nazi regime, to which a few Iranian officials were invited. Trade flourished under the clearing agreement till difficulties arose in the autumn. The German Minister visited Persepolis in May. 81. The Agricultural Department employs an Austrian veterinary doctor and an Italian engineer, at present in Bushire, is employed by the Municipality and by various of the Companies as consultant. He also de signed the new buildings at the Tomb of Hafiz for the Education Depart ment. 82. American archaeologists under Professor Erich Schmidt were busy at Persepolis during most of the year. It became the headquarters of the Mission from the Oriental Institute of Chicago University after the closing down of work at Rey. Many coins and pottery articles were dug up. Pro- lessor Schmidt was absent during part of the year on aerial surveys in other parts of Iran for which the Shah gave special permission when he was at Persepolis. Two Americans were working for a time in the old Masjid-i- Juma in Shiraz. During the summer there were various visitors from the Bahrein Oil Company in Shiraz. Towards the end of the year an American training specialist arrived to organise classes for nurses. The United States Charge d' Affaires in Tehran was on tour in the district in October. Other American visitors included Dr. Schenk, of the Amiranian Oil Company ; Miss Parrish, a journalist; the Archimandrite Theodore Isaac, Armenian Bishop of Julfa ; and several students on a world tour. 83. French interests were mainly centred in the excavations at Shapur, where three archaeologists were working for part of the year. Mr. Goddard,' Director of the Antiquities and Fine Arts Department of the Ministry of Education, visited Shiraz several times during the year. The French Charge d'Affaires in Tehran and the Military Attache also passed through. 84. Other Visitors during 1937 included the Czecho Slovakian Minister; M. Blanquet, a French civil engineer ; M. Lundborg, of the Swedish Legation ; M.^ Christianssen, of the Kampsax Consortium ; M. Cemal Husni, leader of a Turkish Mission to Iran ; Dr. Lindt, a Swiss journalist; and various Austrians and Czecho-Slovakian tourists. 85. Miscellaneous subjects. —The cost of living has increased steadily throughout the year, partly owing to the prolonged drought and partly owing to irregularities in the official control of prices and to shortage of transport due to Government restrictions. 86. The Irantours Hotel is in course of construction by the Tourist Department in Tehran. It has the advantage (?) of modern sanitation and is expected to be ready for visitors before next No Rouz. Meanwhile the Hotel Sa'adi offers quite comfortable accommodation. 87. The local cimema showed the British films ' Thirty-nine Steps' &lt;ind Bosambo during the year and also a News Reel of the Coronation, Iranian films made in India were also shown. 88. The maximum temperature recorded in 1937 was 99°. The lowest in the winter of 1936-1937 was 21° in January. Up to the present (mid-Jan- uary ) the thermometer has not been below 25° this winter. 89. Rainfall during the winter season 1936-37 was 10-27 inches, as com pared with 12-27 inches in the previous year. The rainfall so far during the present winter is 3 inches less than normal. Up to the end of December no rain had fallen at all in two-thirds of the Province. 90. Slight earthquake shocks were registered in Shiraz in April and in December. A. E. WATKINSON, H. B. M. Consul.27 CHAPTER IV. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KERMAN AND BAND ABBAS CONSULATES FOR THE YEAR 1937. 1. Personnel. Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., I.M.D., held charge of the Kerman-Bandar Abbas Consulates until relieved on the 1st November by Major G. A. Falconer, Indian Political Service. 2. British Interests. I. 12 British subjects were registered at the Consulate during the year. II, Coronation of His Majesty King George VI. —The occasion was fittingly celebrated at the Consulate on the 12th May. A special service was held at St. Andrews Mission Church in the morning, conducted by the Mission Chaplain. In the afternoon there was an official reception at the Consulate, followed by a garden party with illuminations and fireworks. Of the 94 persons to whom invitations were sent, 54 attended. The only Irani officials present were the Governor-General, Chief of Police, and the President of the Muni cipality. The order prohibiting other Iranian subjects visiting the Consulate was rigidly enforced throughout the year. Many others were very anxious to attend the Coronation celebrations, but the official element were dissuaded from doing so by the Governor, and others were turned back by a detective posted a short distance from the Consulate gate. III. His Majesty's Birthday. —An official reception followed by a garden party was held at the Consulate on the 9th June. 26 persons attended includ ing the three local officials excluded from the ban, and also three Iranian mer chants who were brave enough to ignore the ban. IV. Church Missionary Society, [a) General—The duties of Chaplain were performed throughout the year by the Rev. M. T. Lord. The Rt. Rev. W. J. Thompson, Bishop in Iran, visited Kerman twice during 1937. No active interference in the Society's evangelical work came to notice during the year, but a detective was invariably in the offing to see who at tended the services. (6) Medical. —The society suffered a severe loss by the death of Dr. G. E. Dodson on the 9th May, after 34 years of service to the Mission and the inhabitants of Kerman. His funeral was largely attended by people of all classes who held the late Dr. Dodson in great respect. During July the men's hospital was in temporary charge of Dr. Martin from Shiraz. But in the absence of a permanent doctor there was a big falling off in the attendance. Dr. R. H. Carpenter arrived at the end of October and assumed charge of men's hospital and dispensary. Dr. (Miss) G. A. Henriques was in charge of the women's hospital through out the year. (c) Educational—{i) Boys' School (Dabirestan-i-Jam).—The Revd. M. T. Lord was the Principal during 1937. The school is very popular and filled to capacity. (ii) Girls' School (Daberistan Mariam).—This school under Miss J. F. Woodroffe, is also very popular among the local inhabitants. V. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. —Towards the end of the year an Iranian Armenian, named Faniantz, who has spent several years in England, was appointed local manager. He called on the Consul on arrival. VI. Trade. —With the exception of the limited export of carpets to the United Kingdom, British trade with Kerman is practically non-existent at the present time. Exchange and other restrictions plus excessive import duties have successfully strangled foreign trade. The policy of the merchants seems to be one of waiting until the restrictions hampering trade are removed or appreciably reduced, which they believe to be inevitable.3. Foreign Interests. I. American-Iranian Oil Company. —Mr. H. G. Schunk, a mineralogist of the Company, arrived in Kerman on 13th D3cemb0r. During his stay he visited a number of villages in this district, but from what he had so far seen he was not very hopeful of this area. II. Agriculture. —In June, Mons. A. Wetli, of Swiss nationality, in partnership with two of the leading Zorastrian merchants, of Kerman, ac quired a large area of land near the villages of Hajiabad and Ghakum, about half way between Sirjan and Bandar Abbas, for agricultural development. The price paid is believed to be in the neighbourhood of rials 1,500,000 (£18,750). Mons. Wetli is very optimistic as regards the future of this venture. III. Trade. —With the exception of the export of carpets to America, where the market during the latter half of the year was bad, and a number of bales of Japanese piece goods which find their way to Kerman periodically, there was comparatively little foreign trade with other countries. 4. Local Government. I. Governor-General. —Aqai Ardelan occupied this office until he was suddenly called to the Capital in the middle of July. His suspension was followed by the transfer of a number of other officials, which together with the visit of several civil and military enquiry commissions suggests that all was not well in the working of this and other local departments. Aqai Ardelan was, for past reasons, favourably disposed towards this Consulate. Aqai Ismail Merat was appointed Governor at the beginning of Novem ber, Aqai Arrasteh acting in the interim. Very cordial relations have been established between the Consulate and the new Governor, and there is every prospect that such a state of affairs will continue. On the arrival of Ismail Merat the appointment was designated ' Farmandar-i-Kerman ' (Governor), instead of Governor-General as formerly. But at the close of the year the final adjustment of the new administrative divisions had not been determined. It is believed that a Kerman Division will be evolved from the reshuffling, with Kerman as the headquarters. II. Bank-i-Milli (National Bank).—Aqai Avansian Alexander took over the managership in October. During the year two new branches were opened at Sir j an and Bam. III. Justice. —Aqai Ghyasi, the Chief Judge of the Appellate Court, was the head of this department throughout the year. The most notorious case dealt with was one of murder of a woman by a woman. The accused was sentenced to imprisonment for life. IV. Police. —The Chief of Police, Lt.-Col. Fatemi, was summoned to Tehran on 17th October to answer charges of receiving bribes. His assistant Capt. Gurzin was appointed to act in his absence. V. Customs. —The activities of this department in Kerman are con fined to the examination and sealing of carpets for export abroad, to avoid repacking at the port. VI. Posts and Telegraphs. —On the whole this department functioned with Iranian efficiency so far as this Consulate was concerned. No covers received during November and December showed signs of being tampered with, but towards the end of the year one or two wrappers on books and news papers appeared to have been removed and replaced, and those torn in the process were endorsed ' damaged in transit . In reply to one protest the Kerman Postmaster stated that he received them in this condition, which I believe to be correct. Any tampering with the Kerman Consulate mail can be attributed to Tehran activity. VII. Education. —Aqai Mayel Tawiserkani had control of this depart ment throughout the year. Three new primary schools for girls were opened in October. One crood effect of the introduction of western modes of attire is that of school ll niforms which are a decided improvement. The Boy Scout and Girl Guide movements continue to make progress in most centres, but it is doubtful if there are sufficient qualified instructors to develop the movement along the recognised lines. The Minister of Education visited Kerman from 9th to 11th April. He nspected all the Government schools, but not the C. M. S. schools. To the29 Principal of the C. M. S. Boys school he excused himself ' owing to lack of time,' but felt sure he would have found everything to his satisfaction. VIIT. Municipality. —There was no change dur ng the year in the control of this department. Improvements continue to be made by cutting new thoroughfares through the town. But the alignments are' ruthless and, as is the custom, the owners of affected property suffer in the interests of progress. Towards the end of the year the number of beggars frequenting the Ker- man streets was considerably augmented by the influx of poverty-stricken villagers from the surrounding country. At the instigation of the Governor, a local fund was raised to establish shelters where the genuine poor could be housed and fed. IX. Health. —With the exception of a certain amount of typhoid in the middle of the year, the health of the town was generally good. At the end of the year deaths due to ' heart failure ' became more frequent—a more correct diagnose would probably have been ill-nourishment and exposure. 5. Military. I. Colonel Ali Akbar Seyahpom h remained in Command of the Kerman Brigade throughout the year. General Rouh-Allah Mirza Jehanbani inspected the Brigade in December. The anniversary of the coup d'etat was celebrated by the military on 22nd February. On this occasion invitations to attend the Review were issued only to senior local officials. Foreign residents were not inv.ted as formerly. The Military barracks at Sar Asiab, about 6 miles east of Kerman, are nearlng completion. A Military Mission consisting of the French Marshal in Iran employ and 25 Iranian officers arrived in Kerman on 10th October, proceeding to Bandar Abbas three days later. II. Conscription. —The committee terminated its Kerman session on 6th December. 300 conscripts were called up in October by the committee and distributed among units in the Kerman Brigade. Conscription is not popular among the inhabitants. III, Internal security. —Security has been fairly well maintained through out the province during 1937 by the military and the Amneih (Road Guards). No attacks on motor transport are recorded. In March a party of 6 Baluchi smugglers with three rifles and two bags of sugar were arrested in Rudbar by the military and brought to Kerman for trial. In August a caravan returning to Rudbar from Kerman was attacked by seven armed bandits about 14 miles beyond Mahun. One of the party was killed and one wounded. The Road Guards eventually went in pursuit, but the raiders made good their escape with rials 240,000 (£3,000) in cash and piece-goods valued 60,000 (£750). In October a band of Baluchis of the Ismail Zai tribe attempted to plunder the village of Farrah between Bam and Nusratabad on the Zahidan road. In this case the Road Guards successfully drove off the raiders. Early in December a band of about 150 armed Baluohis raided a number of villages near Shahdad, 65 miles north east of Kerman. A company of in fantry at once moved out from Kerman and are reported to have driven the raiders up to the Dasht-i-Rudbar, but were unable to cut off their escape. 6. Communications. I. Roads. —The main roads from Kerman were maintained in adequate repair during the year. The Bandar Abbas-Kerman road is increasing in importance. Practically all merchandise is now con veyed over this road in heavy lorries. Most of this 350 miles stretch is a natural surface which stands up to heavy traffic exceedingly well, and requires little maintenance. There are however, permanent road gangs along the 63(C) ExAffairsDept30 route, with road guard posts at intervals. The route is liable to temporary breaches from January to March, but for the remainder of the year heavy lorries can make the journey in 2J— 3 days, and an ordinary car in 13-14 hours, II. Wireless. —Except for the weekly test, the Kerman station was practically closed throughout the year. III. Aviation. —No aeroplane landed in Kerman during the year and the two aerodromes are neglected. 7. Trade Developments. I. During 1937 ginning factories were opened at Kerman, Sirjan, Zarand, and Bayaz. The ' Kerman Khorshid Spinning Mill ' has a capital of about rials 3,000,000 (£37,500) and employs some 350 persons. A Soap factory was also opened in Kerman. In common with other centres, Kerman produced a large number of monopoly companies or ' Sherkats '. Of the 21 inaugurated during the year the following are of some importance :— Rials. (1) Khorshid Spinning Mil] Capital ...... 3,000,000 (2) Woollen Textiles ......... 3,000,000 (3) Woollen Carding Company . 1,000,000 (4) Kerman piece-goods Company ...... 1,000,000 (5) Tea and Loaf sugar Company ...... 1,000,000 (6) Dried Fruits Company ........ 2,000,000 (7) Sherkat-i-Kala (Provisions) ....... 300,000 (8) Sherkat-i-Katira (Gum Tragacanth) ..... 1,070,000 (9) Motor Transport Company ....... 300,000 II. Carpet trade. —With the establishment of a Government monopoly company a notice was issued prohibiting private business. The restriction was subsequently withdrawn and private firms were allowed to continue their bus ness. A branch of the monopoly company still exists in Kerman but does not exercise monopoly rights. On the whole the markets for Kerman carpets was not good during 1937, the American market being very poor during the second half of the year. The approximate value of exports in 1,000s of rials to Europe and the United States during 1937 and the three preceding years are :— 1934. 1935. 1936. 1937. Kermanies 11,751 9,545 9,704 9,200 Tribal 940 51 245 200 III. Grain Monopoly Department. —Towards the end of the year when the result of the Government policy of putting more of the land under cotton and other crops instead of grain began to be felt, this department functioned with great difficulty. There was an acute shortage of bread throughout the province and much suffering among the poorer classes in consequence. 7,400 maunds of wheat were brought from Isfahan and Hamadan in Novem ber ^ and December which eased the situation to some extent, but the price of bread rose much beyond the normal seasonal increase. It is understood that the monopoly lost about rials 200,000 (£2,500) on the year's working. IV. Dried Fruits Company. —This company which made a good profit in 1936 did no trade at all in 1937 and the promoters proposed to withdraw their capital and dissolve the company. But at the request of the Governor the company continues to exist on paper with a reduced capital. V. Sherkat-i-Kala (Provisions.)—Amin Zadeh, a local merchant in charge of this company, was dismissed from the control in June and charged with misappropriation of the company's funds to the extent of rials 360,000 (£4,500). Thereafter the company did no business for the remainder of the year. 8. Local politics. I. For obvious reasons there have been no outward manifestations against the existing regime. The death of Aqai Davar, the ea:-Minister of Finance, did not improve local feelings towards the present Government, as it was generally accepted that he committed suicide because he was dissatisfied with the trend of events in Iran.31 II. Press. —There are nominally four newspapers published periodically in Kerman. So far as this Consulate is concerned nothing objectionable was published during the year. 9. The Shah's Birthday. This was celebrated in Kerman on 14th March by a reception given by the Governor, and the day was observed as a public holiday. Only about 50 people of the 200 invited were able to accept the invitation which made morning coat and top hat compulsory. H. M.'s Consul attended. BANDAR-ABBAS. 1. British interests. I. Coronation of His Majesty King George VI. —The Coronation of His Majesty King George VI was celebrated at the British Consulate, Bandar Abbas, on the 12th May. The function was attended by the local Governor, the Officer Commanding the troops. Chief of Police, the manager of the National Bank of Iran, and a few local merchants. II. Gray, Mackenzie and Company Ltd. —The Company maintaned a branch at Bandar Abbas throughout the year. III. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd. —The business of the Company continued to increase, in absence of any foreign competition. Supplies of kerosine oil and petrol for the eastern Iranian markets, and Sirjan, Kerman, Rafsinjan, and Yezd, arrived at this port. The Company's geologists visited this area during January, February* and December. IV. Frank Strick Lines Ltd. —The company entered into a contract with the Iranian Government to purchase during a period of 12 months 15,000 tons of red oxide from the island of Hormuz at a wholesale rate of £3-5-0 per ton, of which 4,593 tons were shipped up to the close of the year. 2. Foreign interests. I. Russian. —13,245 bags of Russian loaf sugar were imported at Bandar Abbas for the Iranian Government during the year. 3,200 bales of cotton were exported to Russia. II. Japanese. —268 bales of cotton piece-goods, and 1,000 chests of tea were imported at Bandar Abbas during the year. III. Italian. —Mr. T. Pastori, Italian, arrived from Muscat on the 22nd April with the object of collecting about 10,000 Iranian labourers for road making in Eritrea (Abyssinia). His quest was not successful. 3. Local Government. I. Governor. —Aqai Ismail Bahadur was Governor of Bandar Abbas throughout the year, a post he has now held for the past six years. II. Bank-i-Milli. —Mons. H. Freudian, Inspector of the National Bank inspected the local branch in December. The question of opening sub-branches in Minab, Lingah, and Charbar was under consideration, but is still in abeyance as the reports submitted were not favourable. III. Justice. —This department moved to Ginu Hills for the summer instead of closing down as hitherto. IV. Police. —During the year the police posts at Lingah, Henjam, Kishm, Jask, Charbar, and Minab, were attached to Bandar Abbas. An Inspector of Police from Tehran visited Bandar Abbas, Charbar, and Lingah during January. Passport Department, —The police were in charge of this department throughout the year. Orders were received during May to refuse exit visas or to issue fresh passports to Iranian subjects unless the applicant was in possession of foreign exchange purchased from one of the authorised Banks. Iranian subjects residing abroad and holding Iranian Consular passports, and foreign subjects and foreign Consulate's official employees were exempted from this rule.32 In July orders were received from Tehran to refuse visas on British passports which were valid for journeys to Muscat and other ports on the i ucial coast, and to treat such passports similar to those bearing Bahrain and Kuwait validity. \. Customs. —Mehdi Nik-Khah held joint charge of both customs and finance departments until 3rd June, when he was suspended and called to 1 ehran to answer charges of corruption and for falsely reporting to the Government that approximately 70,000 tons of salt were ready for shipment at lorn-uz, v Len actually only about 6,000 tons, including impurities were available. Azizullah Mina held joint charge for the remainder of the year. Government inspectors and geologists visited Bandar Abbas to inspect the (uetoms department and the mines at Hormuz respectively on the 26th February, 7th March and 10th April. In March a sum of rials 2,400 (£30) in Iranian currency notes brought for the purchase of dates from Bandar Abbas was confiscated from the dhow of the Sheikh of Bakha (Oman) by the Customs authorities. The Sheikh visited Bandar Abbas in May with the object of getting a refund but was not successful. During his stay he was well treated by the local officials. In June, the Customs authorities received instructions to forbid persons boarding the steamers in harbour, except the Medical Officer, Customs officials. Police, and the staff of the agents of the company. But this order is not now rigorously applied to members of this Consulate proceeding on board the mail steamers. VI. Municipality. —The Governor of Bandar Abbas was an active Presi dent of the Municipality Council during the past year. Much has been done to improve the town by opening a wide central road and improving some of the side roads. Government departments are gradually being better housed. Such improvements as have been effected are largely due to the energy of the present Governor with limited funds. A municipal ' Asylum ' for street beggars was opened in September with the help of local donations, and the absence of beggars from the bazar and elsewhere is a feature of the town. Electricity.—The new plant which was ordered from Germany in January arrived at the close of the year, after the Governor and the company had made several representations to the Exchange Control Commission and the Ministry of Interior for the provision of foreign exchange. Economic. —The harvest, due to scanty rainfall was very poor, and the cost of living rose accordingly. At the close of the year the prices for general foodstuff were :— Rials. Wheat . Barley . Firewood Meat Rice Reshti Rice Sadri Dates . Bread . Sugar . Sugar loaf Ghee Tea VII. Health per Kharwar of 900 lbs. &gt;-per raaund of 9 lbs. per 6 lbs. -The health of the town throughout the year was good. 4. Military. I. The strength of the Bandar Abbas garrison was reduced from a ' Hang' (regiment) to a Gurdan (three companies) in May. The surplus of 330 soldiers and 22 ponies were transferred to Charbar in the Mekran division on the 22nd June. The garrison is now attached to the Kerman Brigade.33 The French Spah-bud (Field Marshal) in the employ of the Iranian Govrernment arrived at Bandar Abbas on the loth October. He was accom panied by 25 Iranian officers. The party embarked in the Iranian Sloop ' Babr ' for Lingah and the intermediate islands. The Marshal was reported to have evinced much interest in the island of Hen jam and declared it to be the most suitable place in the Persian Gulf for the Iranian Naval Base. The Mission left for Sirj an and Shiraz on the 18th October. The coup d'etat was celebrated as usual by the military on the 22nd February and was attended by the local officials, and merchants, accompanied by their wives. II. Conscription. —The Committee during their session of two and a half months (5th October—21st December) dealt with 550 cases out of 1,956 called to appear. III. Internal security. —The security on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road and on all other trade routes in the province was well maintained throughout the year, except for the incident on the Bandar Abbas-Lar road in August when a caravan conveying 100 loads of monopoly loaf sugar, and 24 chests tea and cotton piece-goods and three loads of cotton twists was looted by Nafars near Agha Jamal. With the commencement of summer and influx of people into Minab for the date trade, that district suffered from armed Baluchis, who looted people in outlying villages in broad day light. Six conscripts deserted from the Bandar Abbas garr son in June, taking their rifles with them, were joined by other armed bandits and started to harass people and donkeymen on the outlying caravan routes, chiefly in Shamilat. On 31st July they looted the house of the tenant of Baghu (the village of H. H. Agha Khan) about 10 miles to the east of Bandar Abbas. They were finally rounded up by the joint Amnieh forces of Bandar Abbas and Minab at a village named Raving near Minab, when two of the gang were killed, and one wounded before the remaining six surrendered. 5. I ranian N avy. The following sloops visited Bandar Abbas during the year :— ' Babr ', 11th January, 8th April, 16th October. ' Plang ', 8th April. ' Shahrukh ', 15th February, 1st and 14th September. ' Karkas ', 12th March, and 8th April. ' Shahbaz ', 22nd May and 12th December. 6. 0 O:\IMUNICATI0NS. I. Roads. —No new motor road from Bandar Abbas to the interior was opened during the year. The Shiraz-Bandar Abbas road passing through Lar referred to in last year's report has been little used. II. Aviation. —A German plane (Junkers) ' Kismet-D-UKOP ' made a forced landing on the 21st March, owing to engine trouble and took off for Damascus after an hour. The following were on board :— Captain—Von Blomberg. Pilots—Sterutrurg and Salomon. Crew—Poscuer and Ackermann. 7. Trade Developments. I. Trade. —Trade depression continued throughout the year. The pr ominent causes for this result being exorbitant import duties. Government restrictions, and monopolies. No improvement can be foreshadowed until there is some modification of the present policy. In some cases imported goods remained held up in Customs for months for want of foreign exchange or other minor difficulties. 53(C) EiAffairsDept.34 The Customs revenue suffered greatly in consequence and was the sub ject of frequent enquiries from the Central Administration. With a view to stimulating trade a scheme was introduced in July where by goods to the value of rials 1,000 (£12) may be exported without any ex change undertaking, and unprohibited goods imported into sub-Customs offices in the province. This is believed to have afforded some small relief, especially to trade in the more remote districts. II. Mines. —The salt mines at Namakdan, the concession for which was held by the Sherkat-e-Namak in joint partnership with the Agricultural Bank of Iran, ceased to function after the work of quarrying was stopped in June for the summer. The Ministry of Finance is believed to be against the concession and the question of cancelling the agreement with the Sherkat is under their considera tion. No export of salt from these mines was made during the year, though about 60,000 tons is said to be ready. Hormuz. —The red oxide mines and the salt mines of Hormuz which were under the supervision of the Customs were transferred to the charge of the Governor of Bandar Abbas with effect from May. The Governor's pro posal to give the contract of quarrying the red oxide mines at Hormuz at fixed rate of rials 10 (2/6) per ton to Khan Sahib Ibrahim Gelladary was rejected by Tehran. 2,411 tons of salt were shipped to Japan from the Hormuz mines in February. II,219 tons of red oxide were shipped to various countries during the year. Towards the close of the year the control of the mines at Hormuz was transferred to the Ministry of Industry and special staff was sent down from Tehran in December to take over the charge from the Governor. III. Fishery. —Doctor Blegvad, a Danish Scientist in the employ of the Ministry of Finance, arrived at Bandar Abbas on 15th January in connection with the fishing industry and the construction of a cannery. He paid a second visit to this port on 9th April in the trawler ' Rashgoo He said to have reported to the Shah that Bandar Abbas is the most suitable port for new industry, and to have received instructions to proceed with his plans. The construction of a small factory at Bandar Abbas is estimated to cost about rials 400,000 (£5,000). It is proposed to erect the plant at Naibund about 2-3 miles from the town. 8. Shipping and Navigation. 129 Steamers aggregating 269,574 tons entered and cleared at the port of Bandar Abbas during 1937. The distribution was as follows :— Nationality British German Japan Danish Russian Tonnage. 190,754 49,218 18,172 7,758 3,672 Quarantine was enforced at the port against plague from 22nd September to 28th October on steamers arriving from Indian ports.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1937. I.— T he P olitical A gency. Personnel.—{a) Captain G. S. de Gaury, M.C., held charge of the Agency from 1st January to 7th April and from 11th June to 31st December. Captain A. C. Stewart, I.A., held charge from 8th April to 21st May. Dr. A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (Lond.), I.M.D., held charge from 22nd May to 10th June. (b) Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (Lond)., I.M.D., was in medical charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Officer throughout the year, except for the period from 14th June to 10th October when Dr. C. E. Watts officiated for him. II.— T he R uling F amily. His Highness the Sheikh Sir Ahmed Ibn Jabir as Subah has continued to be the Ruler of Kuwait, and administered the State during the year under review. His Highness did not leave the State. 2. Sheikh Abdulla as-Salim as Subah, cousin of the Ruler, paid a short visit to Baghdad in the autumn. 3. The obligation of His Majesty's Government incurred towards th e Sheikh of Kuwait in 1914, in guaranteeing freedom from taxation for his date gardens in Iraq remains, as reported last year, undischarged although official correspondence on the subject continues. 4. With effect from 1st April the address of the Ruler and his successors was changed from His Excellency to His Highness. The proper style in Arabic is w-®. te. III.—T he P olitical A gent's relations with the S heikh. The personal relations of the Political Agent with the Ruler remained cordial throughout the year. In the background there have, it must be admitted, been shadows caused by the Palestine agitation, and continuous Italian propaganda of all kinds. By the end of the year, action in Palestine, news of the British rearma ment programme, and of the measures projected by Britain to counter Italian propaganda by ' straight news were beginning to restore confi dence in Britain's ability for leadership. IV.—L ocal I nterests. (а) Customs. —A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confidential publication. The Customs duty remained at 5 per cent, except for imports by British sub jects which stays at 4 per cent. (б) Municipality. —No remarkable changes in the township of Kuwait or its administration have taken place during the year. The ruler continues, with excellent results, to forbid a local newspaper, cinemas, theatres, alcoholic drink, and gramophones in coffee shops, (c) Street widening. —The Municipality has carried out some street widening near the Customs sheds on the water front, making an improvement in appearance and convenience. {d) Public Library. —A new library was opened during the year under review for the use of the public.36 His Highruess the Ruler of Kuwait has very kindly agreed to send some of the newspapers subscribed to by him, to the Library. (e) Education. —Education continues to be suited to the requirements. For an Arabian town the standard is high, and the girl schools are particularly good and well attended. The number of ' Khatim ' or graduates during the year was :— Boys Girls 20 (/) jT - c y Semis. —The Boy Scouts movement was inaugurated in Kuwait by the Palestinian teachers during the period under review. More than hundred boys have been enrolled. (r) Bank for Kuwait— After long negotiation the Eastern Bank, having h;.d its competitor, the Ottoman Bank, eliminated, decided to resort to its original policy of not committing itself to open a branch. (/?) Post office. —The Ruler continued during the year under report to press the Political Agent for a Post Office under either his or the Political Agent's influence, unlike the Iraqi Post Office now here, which acknowledges no control of anyone in the State. This has been the subject of correspon dence and progress towards a better arrangement has been made. (i) Telephone system for Kuwait. —The Ruler has continued to hope for a telephone system, and progress towards obtaining one has been made. i j) Imperial Airways. —The two weekly land services were cut down to one from October and information was received that the remaining service would be terminated early in 1938 owing to shortage of landcraft. The percentage of non-landings to the whole number of passages across the territory was roughly 20 per cent., i.e. a proportion of 4 : 1 between land ings and non-landings. [k) Boat building and Pearl diving—Boats. —A note on the number, tonnage, etc. of boats built during the year will be found in the Trade Re port for 1936. The boat building industry has greatly improved and the yards were kept busy throughout the year ; many boats being ordered from elsewhere on the Arabian Coasts, where the leading Kuwaiti builders are gaining a very high reputation for sound building. Pearls. —The pearl season showed a slight improvement in prices and in finds over last year. The number of boats out this year was 300. (/) The Pilgrimage to Mecca [Haj) from Kuwait.—The number of pilgrims who left Kuwait in the year was :— Kuwaitis by camel Kuwaitis by sea Kuwaitis by car Iraqis by car through Kuwait . The Quarantine Building and Isolation Hospital were extensively re paired and are now in very good order. [But see Para, (o) below]. (w) The Radio. —There are now about 100 radios in Kuwait territory. The effect of the Rome (Bari) Arabic broadcast is well known, and has, as was long hoped, since the year terminated, been countered by a London broadcast in Arabic of ' straight news '. The richer people of Kuwait are now definitely wireless ' fans ', and follow all the Arabic and some of the English broadcasts closely. The news, thus received, in the usual topic at the morning ' Mejlis ' of His Highness the Sheikh, to which daily all the notables go, before beginning their day's business. Hunting parties habitually take out Battery sets to their camp, although some hawkers do complain that next day their falcons are the worse for such noise at night. 454 2 134 14137 ( ti ) New village of Doha.—Fov some years fishermen have been spend- ing each winter on Ras Ashairij in the Bay west of Kuwait, living in tempo rary huts. Lately they have been making permanent buildings of a white sand stone found on the spot, and this year have made cement rain water reservoirs which being entirely filled, will enable them to remain throughout the year. There are at present 35 permanent houses, a mosque and communal ' Mejlis ' or assembly room, so that the settlement may now be recorded as entitled to the rank of a permanent ' village and noted as such on maps. It is rather nearer the eastern side of the headland than the west, and two hundred yards from it, and is known as Doha. (o) Quarantine. —The Agency Medical Officer continued to be the Kuwait Quarantine Officer. During the year the Kuwait Quarantine buildings were renovated by the Ruler and are now in good condition. V.—C ondition of the country. Law and order have remained unchanged. Security in the hinterland continues to be good, but see Iraq Para, (a) below for reports of Police raids. VI.—F oreign relations. (a) Saudi Arabia. During the year relations remained unaltered and the Blockade, and correspondence on the subject, continued. The Saudi Arabian Government, however, now permits and officially recognizes for taxation purposes the import ot Saudi goods to Kuwait. It has also this year permitted a very large number of Nejdi tribesmen to enter Kuwait territory for grazing in which permission is implicit for ' Mussabila or restocking in the Kuwait Markets. The Awazim tribe alone numbers over 5,000 in Kuwait territory at the end of the year, and there is perhaps an equal number from other Saudi tribes, which include some like the Subaih from far South in Nejd. (6) Iraq. [а) Incursions by Police. —Incursions by the Iraqi Police were reported by the Ruler to have occurred on the 5th January, 6th March, 28th April, 24th June and 15th October, 1937. Representations were duly made through diplomatic channels. A case in which there was no room for doubt about the facts was that on the 15th October when the Iraqi Police attacked a caravan at Idairat A1 Khulla, thirty miles inside Kuwait territory. The Political Agent visited the scene the next day and a formal protest was addressed to the Iraqi Government in due course. (б) Newspaper articles. —An attack on the Political Agent was made by A1 Nas newspaper of Basra in its article of the 10th September. There have appeared numerous other inaccurate and malicious articles about the British affairs generally in the Persian Gulf. (c) Palestine. There have been no particular incidents in connection with the Palestine disturbances to report; although there were half-hearted attempts to sub scribe to Palestinian funds, and some expression of sympathy by telegraph and otherwise in the earlier part of the yeaf. The disappearance from the scene of the Mufti and the Supreme Muslim Council brought this to an end. oiJ^C) ExAffairsDept38 VII.—Oil. 1. Drilling. (а) Bahra Well. —On 1st January 1937 the depth of the first test well at Bahra was 5984 feet and early in the year, at 6852 feet, oil stained limestone was encountered. Tests were made but only 5 gallons of a very heavy oil was obtained, and consequently, at a depth of 7950 feet, drilling operations on this well were suspended, and dismantling of the rig and derrick com menced. (б) Burgan Well. —Drilling equipment was transferred from Bahrah to Burgan, 30 miles South of Kuwait, where the drilling of a new well commenced on the 16th October. Work on this second well has been slow owing to lost mud circulation, due to fissures between 800 feet and 1100 feet. At the close of the year a depth of only 1556 feet had been reached. 2. Geophysical work. A Geophysical Survey of Kuwait State was carried out by a party of 16 Geophysicists from the Gulf Research and Development Company, Pitts- burgh, U.S.A., who arrived in Kuwait in September 1936. By the end of May 1937 the survey of almost the entire State by the Gravimeter and Magnetometer methods had been completed, while a large area in the vici nities of Bahrah, Burgan and Madaniyat had been seismographically ex plored. This party left for their next task, in West Sussex, in the early summer. 3. Transfer of Company's Drilling Camps. With the end of drilling operations at Bahra in April, the drillers' camp was demolished and re-erected during the summer months at Magwa, about 15 miles due South of Kuwait Town. Construction work at the new camp was completed by the end of the year. 4. General. During the year the health of the staff and local employees has been good. I he labour is gradually becoming more used to routine, and is showino' im proved results. 5. Water explorations. In the course of the Seismic operations about 240 shallow wells to depths ranging from 100 feet to 200 feet were drilled in the Madaniyat/Burgan areas, and about 100 shallow wells of similar depth were also drilled near and to the west of* Bahrah. No useful supplies of fresh water were found. VIII.— Royal Navy. Captain C. E. Morgan, D.S.O., in H.M.S. ' Enterprise ' of the 4th Cruiser Squadron East Indies, visited Kuwait from 14th to 20th October. Visits were paid by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf and by His Majesty's ships, sloops of the Persian Gulf Division during the year. IX.— Royal Air Force. Aircraft of the Royal Air Force landed at Kuwait as usual in the course of their ordinary routine duties during the year under review. Air Vice-Marshall W. G. S.

In June 1937 a disagreement arose between the Shaikh of Qatar and th® Ruler of Bahrain about the overlordship of the Naim Tribe and the owner ship of Zubarah. Representatives of both parties met but were unable to come to an agreement. On the 26th June, the Ruler of Qatar at the invi tation of the Shaikh of Bahrain met Shaikh Abdullah bin Tsa, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad and Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment, at Ghariyah in Qatar in an attempt to settle this problem. This party returned to Bahrain on the 30th of June with the news that the negotiations had ended unsuccessfully and that the Shaikh of Qatar was proposing to take offensive action against the Naim tribe without further delay. On the 1st July a letter was received from the Ruler of Qatar that h e intended to take action to restrain those of his subjects who were violating the laws of his country. The same day the Qatar troops attacked a party of the Naim Tribe and without much difficulty took possession of the Naim stronghold. It appears that one or two men were killed on either side. The effect of this engagement was that the Naim immediately sent their representatives to the Shaikh of Qatar to sue for peace. The Shaikh of Qatar then obtained an agreement from Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammed, the leader of the Naim, to the effect that they would observe the laws of Qatar while they remained in the State.48 There was considerable excitement in Bahrain during the first few days of July while exaggerated rumours were coming from the Qatar Peninsula. His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain asked the Political Agent, Bahrain, for written permission to allow the Nairn Tribe to come to Bahra.n. Ihis was granted and a party of Nairn came across to Bahrain in August 1937. His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain later decided that in view of the ac tion of the Ruler of Qatar against the Naim Tribe, whom he considered as his subjects, he was not disposed to continue the transit due privilege which he had previously extended to the Shaikh of Qatar. As a residt cargo in transit for Qatar is now required to pay the usual duty of 5 per cent, as against the previous concessional rate of 2 per cent.

This number shows a decrease of 316 compared uith last year. J ho daily average attendance was 21-5. 202 minor operations were carried out during the year. There were no outbreaks of any epidemics. Malaria, skin, eye and diseases of the digestive system continued to be the most prevalent. lb) Quarantine. —Quarantine restrictions were imposed against pas sengers arriving from Karachi on three occasions during the year. There was a small epidemic of small-pox reported on the Batinah coast and all persons arriving by caravans were vaccinated before they were allowed to enter Matrah. A total of 1,914 vaccinations were performed. A few minor repairs to the quarantine station were carried out during the year. . „ . 3. Coronation of His Majesty King F/.-The Coronation of Their Maiestv's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth was celebrated at Muscat on Mav 12th H M S ' Deptford ' which had been sent to Muscat specially for the occasion, dressed ship and fired a Royal Salute of 31 guns at Noon and the Sultan s Battery in the Fort fired a similar number of guns m unison. The Agency buildings were suitably decorated with flags and bunting by day and coloured lights by night. In the evening « Deptford ' gave a search light display and fired off several salvoes of rockets. An official reception was held at the Agency in the evening which was attended by His Highness the Sultan, the principal members of the Ruling family and State officials, the Captain and Officers of H.M.S Deptford and representatives of the British Indian Communities of Muscat and Matrah. At Gwadur the British Agent held a reception which was attended by the Wali and leading members of the British Indian Community resident there. 4_ Political AffaiTS. —(o) The political situation remained quiet through- out the year. An event of some importance took place in October when Shaikh Isa bin Salih with his 2 sons and a small band of followers paid a semi-official visit to the Sultan. Shaikh 'Isa is the right hand man of the Imam of the Oman and has probably more influence and authority m that district than the Imam himself. It was Shaikh Tsa who as a young man was the leader of the Omam forces in their abortive attack on Muscat m 1915 which was renelled bv Indian troops then stationed here and since that period he has never visited the capital again. According to the Su tan's statements, which appear to have some degree of truth in them. Shaikh Isa s visit was suggested by the latter himself and his object was to make his peace with the Muscat Government on account of his dissatisfaction with the rule 01 the£2 mrXi™ [ } y • e - S0 '' aS has been reputed, is that the financial om.it.on oi tho Jmam is not very prosperous owing to a serious decline in his revenues consequent upon the heavy fall in the price of dates, on the exaort ' 'hich the prosperity ot the Oman ahnost entirely depends. The news of the Oil oonoession recently granted by the Sultan to Petroleum Concessions Limited has, it is believed, penetrated throughout the State and it is on-*-. provable that Shaikh 'Isa's visit Was connected with the object of shariiVin the spoils the extent of which has no doubt been exaggerated in nrnnr, r to the distance the news has travelled. Though the Sultan denied thit oil matters were referred to by Shaikh 'Isa the latter did all'her fa^ in what was m all probability the real reason of his trip from the mterinr-1 hnancial assistance—as the Sultan admitted ruefullv that thp vicit i • i Rs^ than ' C0St him PreSent8 ^ fromlhaiK t ^ ^ ^ ^ That the situation in the Oman is in a state of flux appears fairly but whether this visit of the leading personage therein to tho pvon cated nominal Ruler of the country means the beginning of the bre-il' 111111 f KnW 'nam's authority and controf over the tribefof the int^or ^ichVe a^Zr: dSfmarr In IMareh the Sultan in accordance with Article 23 nf notice of his desire to revise the Treaty and the Political Aaent wa. 80^,^^ to act as negotiator on behalf of His Majesty's Government After n 1 of discussions the Sultan's draft for tlJrevfsed GovernmlX 10 Pohtieal Res ident for submission to His Majesty 's T r „J rhe Sul t an , has P' 4 for/ard many important proposals in his draft Treaty in which complete fiscal and tariff autonomy is claimed Ti important privilege of extra territoriality enjoyed by British suW«t'&lt;. the existing Treaty is, however, left untouched in the^new Treaty J r 5. (J:I Concession.—In .June the Sultan with the approval of His Maiestv's Government commenced negotiations for an Oil Concession for his State with Petroleum ( oiice&gt;sions Limited, a company principally British in comnosi ion, whose registered office is in London. After less than 3 weeks ZothT tions which is probably a record for celerity in such a matter and whichtas due in considerable measure to the ability and skill of the neffotiptr l^ senting the Company, Mr. B. J. Lermite! the Sultan Sned Ct eeZni giving the exclusive right to prospect for and exploit oil in his ArabianT v tones to Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Concession was in two Parte s,': iz:r' •° d 161 for '»——« The enclave of Gwadur, a small dependencv of Muqmf Sfafo 1 the coast of British Baluchistan, was net included in the above concessions for this area ^ Were n0t lntere6ted in and consequently did not apply 0.

The cheapness and serviceable qualities of Japanese goods fill the wants of the poverty stricken inhabitants of the country. It will be seen that while exports show a very slight decrease compared with the previous year imports are up by over Rs. 3,00,000. This increase is chiefly due to larger imports of sugar, cement and piece-goods, the last two of which were almost entirely of Japanese manufacture. 8. Royal Navy. —Visits of His Majesty's ships and Royal Air Force air craft to Muscat are detailed in Appendix ' A ' to this report. 9. Boyal Air Force.—{a) The establishment of the Royal A r Force in Muscat, consisting of a Rest House and wireless station, wh ch is in direct communication with Shaiba (Basra) and Dhiban ( Iraq), was maintained in charge of three operators up to June, and thereafter increased to four. (b) A tragic event which caused the loss of three lives of members of the Royal Air Force occurred in the first week of November when a machine of a detachment of 84 squadrons from Basra on a reconnaissance flight of the landing grounds between Basra and Aden crashed at Khur Gharim some 400 miles south of Muscat and all 3 occupants were killed. One of these was Wing Commander Richards, O.B.E., who had recently been appointed the first Liaison Officer between the Royal Air Force and the Political authorities in the Gulf. This Officer in addition to having had a distinguished record in his own profession had become well known in Muscat during numerous visits in previous years in connection with Royal Air Force affairs and by his tact, ability and sympathetic understanding of Arab ways had become universally liked and respected by all with whom he had come in contact in the State. The news of his death was received with genuine regret. A noteworthy feature arising out of this sad accident was the attitude of the local inhabitants during the period the other machines of the Flight were standing by until relief aircraft arrived. The neighbourhood of Khur Gharim is in perhaps one of the wildest and most lawless districts of the State where the authority of the Muscat Government is treated with scanty respect. Though the behaviour of some of the tribesmen who appeared quickly on the scene after the disaster when faced with such a wonderful opportunity of Icot was not blameless, and, in fact, but for the marked tact and skilful handling of what at times must have been a delicate situation by the two Non-Com missioned Officers of the remaining machines of the Flight, the general atti tude of the local Bedu was not unfriendly and their conduct certainly not as dangerous as their reputation would lead to suspect. 10. Aviation General. —The annual special authorisation for aircraft to land and fly over Muscat and Oman required by the Civil Air Agreement entered into between His Majesty's Government and the Sultan in 1934 was renewed on the 2nd January. The Civil aerodrome at Gwadur continued to be used throughout the year by the bi-weekly East and West services main tained by Imperial Airways. 14 machines of Air France and 3 of the Dutch K.L.M. laiided for refuelling under the special authorisation for these com panies granted annually by the Sultan. A number of private aircraft also landed here in the course of the year and a few machines of the Royal Air Force on flights between Iraq and India and vice versa. In September one land plane service was withdrawn and its place taken by one of the new Flying Boats of the type to be employed under the proposed Empire Air Mail Scheme. 11. Foreign Interests. —(a) The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. At the request of the Consul for France at Bombay a few repairs to the Consulate building were carried out by the Supervisor, Public Works Department, attached to this Agency. (6) American interests remained in the hands of the Political Agent during the year. 12. Missionary Work. —The Missionary side of the activities of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) were carried out by the Reverend and Mrs. Dykstra. 63(C) ExAffaireDept54 Dr. P. W. Harrison continued throughout the year in charge of the medical side of the Mission at their hospital at Matrah. Dr. (Miss) Hosman attached to the Zenana Mission Hospital at Muscat spent the gi eater part of the year in touring the Batinah Coast treating the sick. During the summer months the entire staff of the Mission left Muscat on recess in India as usual. 13. Slave Trade. —During the year 42 slaves applied for Manumission Certificates either for themselves or for their relatives or both. 30 slaves including children were manumitted during the year. Of the 42 applicants 23 were Baluchis and remainder Africans. 14. Weather and rainfall. —The total rainfall during the year was 5 inches which compares favourably with that of the past year oi 4-66 inches. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, FOR THE YEAR 1937. Part II. 1. Ruling family. —(a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur. —After a prolonged absence of nearly a year and a half in the province of Dhofar in the extreme south of the Sultanate His Highness returned to Muscat in the' third week of February. In the latter half of June he left for a short holiday in India. After visiting Karachi, Baluchistan, Kashmere and Bombay the Sultan returned to Musca-t in the last week of August. The Sultan left Muscat on November 81 h in H.M.S.' Enterprise ' for Karachi en roate to Delhi on an official visit to His Excellency the Viceroy. Accom panying the Sultan were Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, his uncle, Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, his cousin, and Hilal bin Badr, Secretary. On disembarkation at Karachi on November 10th the Sultan was met by the Collector of Karachi representing the Sind Government, the Brigadier General Commanding the Sind Independent Brigade and a Guard of Honour furnished by the Royal West Kent Regiment. As His Highness disembarked a salute of 21 guns was^ fired by H.M.S. ' Enterprise '. On 11th November the Sultan left by rail for Delhi in a special saloon provided for him by the Government of India. At New Delhi Station the Sultan was met by Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, the Military Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy, the Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and an Aide-de-Camp to His Excellency the Viceroy. After inspecting the Guard of Honour provided at the station, the Sultan accompanied by his suite and Sir Aubrey Metcalfe drove in procession to the Viceroy's House where he was received informally by His Excellency. The Sultan and his party stayed at the Viceroy's House until the 16th after which they were the guests of the Government of India at Maiden's Hotel Delhi. The Sultan was accorded an official interview with His Excellency on November 16th and on November 18th with the Secretary in the External Affairs Department at which various matters were discussed. These inter views have been reported on separately. For the Sultan's stay in Delhi the Government of India had arranged a varied and comprehensive programme of sight-seeing and demonstrations of different sorts. These were all genuinely enjoyed and appreciated by His Highness. Perhaps the object of the greatest interest to the Sultan was his visit to the Imperial Agricultural Institute and certainly the greatest thrill he experienced was the demonstration by the Delhi Flying Club at an At Home given in his honour and his nightflight over Delhi in a machine of Indian Airways. The Sultan and suite left Delhi in a special railway saloon provided by the Government of India for Bombay on November 22nd.The Sultan's official visit (the first he has paid to India) can be described as a great success. Thanks to the excellent arrangements made by the various Departments concerned everything went off without a hitch and His Highness it seems was genuinely impressed with the treatment he received and grateful for all the trouble taken to ensure his comfort and amusement. On 30th November the Sultan left Bombay via Singapore for Japan where he intends to stay about one month with his father, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, late Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who has settled down in that country and is living at present at Kobe. From Japan the Sultan proposes to proceed to the United States of America where his visit to Washington will be official and where he will be the guest of President Roosevelt. After leaving the United States of America the Sultan is to pay an official visit to England in March and probably to France later on. It is possible he may visit Germany and Italy privately on his way back to Muscat, which he hopes to reach early in May 1938. (6) Saiyid Nadir. —The Senior Member of the Ruling Family, as in re cent years, took no part in State affairs but invariably was present at all official functions. (c) Saiyid Shahab, who is a ' real ' uncle of the Sultan, acted as the latter's Representative on the various occasions during the year when he was absent from the State. During the Sultan's presence in Muscat Saiyid Shahab as previously occupied no particular office. In March he proceeded to Karachi for Medical treatment and returned to Muscat towards the end of May. {d) Saiyid Hamad, who had been removed from the post of Wali of Matrah in 1935, was reinstated in that appointment by the Sultan when the latter returned to Muscat from Dhofar in February and at the end of the year was still in that office. (e) Saiyid Mahmud, who had relieved Saiyid Hamad as Wali of Matrah in October 1935, was removed from the post by the Sultan in February since which time he has taken no part in public life. His removal from the Wali- ship of Matrah is believed to be due to his general inefficiency and lack of interest in his work which resulted in an appreciable loss in the revenue and other receipts of the Town. 2. Financial Adviser.- —While at Delhi during his official visit to His Excellency the Viceroy the Sultan expressed a desire to obtain the services of a suitable officer as Financial Adviser which post has now been vacant for several years. 3. Trade and General. —This subject has already been dealt with in Part I of this Report. 4. Municipal Taxation. —Under Article 19 of the 1891 Treaty of Com merce, Navigation and Friendship His Majesty's Government had agreed in principle to the payment under certain conditions by British subjects of Muni cipal Taxes in the towns of Muscat and Matrah. So far back as the early part of 1935 a King's Regulation (No. 1 of 1935) had been issued announcing that conditional upon the prior approval of the Political Resident, Muscat, Gov ernment Municipal Taxes could be imposed on those persons subject to the Muscat Order in Council of 1915. On publication of this King's Regulation the Muscat Government were requested to form proper Municipalities for the towns of Muscat and Matrah and to draw up a scheme of Municipal taxation for the approval of the Political Resident. Owing principally to the prolonged absence of the Sultan for nearly a year and a half in a remote and inaccessible part of his dominions and also to the inability of the State officials to draw up a suitable scheme of taxation no progress was made in the matter until His Highness's return to the Capital early in the year. Owing to the lack of experience and proper organization in the State Administration it was found impossible to work out the usual form of muni cipal taxation and a proposal was then put forward by the Sultan and ultimately agreed to by the Political Resident to impose a tax of one anna56 per package on all goods imported from abroad. A further delay prolonged by the Sultan's absence in India ensued in forming an approved Municipality as required by the Political Resident but this was eventually accomplished in November and the Political Agent was authorized to issue a Notification making the tax, when formally announced by the Muscat Government, appli cable to British subjects. At the close of the year the publication of the tax by the Muscat Government was still being awaited. With the formation of a proper Municipality provided with adequate funds which the new tax is expected to provide there seems a hope of some measures for the sorely needed sanitation of Muscat and Matrah being put into effect at long last. It should then be possible to make use of the lish and meat markets and slaughter houses built in 1936 for the State at consi derable cost and trouble and which ever since their completion have been lying unused. 5. Events in Oman. —Nothing of importance took place during the year. An event which may eventually affect the Oman situation, i.e., the visit of Shaikh 'Isa bin Salih, the right hand man of the Imam, to the Sultan in Muscat in October, has been dealt with in Part I of this Report. 6. General communications. —In March Mr. W. Watson, Officer in charge Cable and Wireless Ltd., was relieved by Mr. G. Gilby who remained in charge for the remainder of the year. 7. Muscat Infantry. —Captain A. C. Byard, British Army, retired, was in Command throughout the year. The discipline and efficiency of the Levy continued to improve under his care. 8. State Finances. —The opening balance at the commencement of the year showed a credit of 640,100. This figure, however, excludes debts due by the State to local creditors which amount to Rs. 71,974. Compared with last year a credit of Rs. 13,072 is shown. r lhe financial position of the State appears satisfactory. R. P. WATTS, Major, I.A., Political Agent and H. B.
