He agrees that if that is the state of affairs he will have to do his best with the 1945 ammunition. Would it be possible for us to offer to replace some of it if the supply position improves ?

Wty dear Dredge, * lour letter of January I7th a'bout the Sultan* s amnunition* I cannot ask His Highness afcout the discrepancy in figures until he comes back from Dhofar, but I expect it is a confusion with the figure of 250 rifles. Greenwood says that, according to his recollections, it used to be the practice to return all ammunition over 5 years old for destruction. But it may be that owing to the big war stocks little or no ammunition has been made since 1945* If that is so, we should have a good answer for the Sultan. Greenwood believes there is no expiry date on the boxes, but is looking this up. I do not want to delay this letter, and will telegraph if his reply is of interest. Yours sincerely. ^ LuJ 6 \trir 0\ Cst* lU.' a A.L.A. Dredge, M.B.E., Secretary to His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain .

Ihe 160,000 rounds of SAA contained in the 160 boxes of the consignment represent the full amount to which the Sultan is entitled under the appendix of the Air Agreement as a ,, lump ,, am- , ount (as opposed to the annual instalment), and I do not know why he should consider that he is due to receive another 100,000. Can you throw any light on this ? 3 . I notice that he is also worried about the life of the ammunition. Regiments in India usually received ammunition that was at least 6 years old and the consignment may be regarded as very fresh. Ihe expiry date is presumably marked on the boxes.
