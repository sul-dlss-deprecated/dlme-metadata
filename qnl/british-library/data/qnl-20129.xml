Tith. regard to the proposed revision of the Muscat Tariff and specially the raising of it from 5 to 2b% on spirits and tobacco, I would liice to point out what seems to me a serious objection to the whole scheme. 2# About £ 7,ooo worth of beer, ¥;his±cy, gin dba are imported into Luscat annually, most of it is sold outside Muscat and some, I am told, finds its way to Persia. 3. with unimportant exceptions such as few bottles of vermoutn &amp;c, all the alcohol is British and is supplied by such firms as Alsops, Tennents, Joimie Waiic©r, Coatei 3ec, As you know British trade is 'right up against it' 1 . Exorbitant tariff barriers not oniy of foreign countries but even of our own possessions such as India and Ceylon are ruining thsr- British trade. ^ £ 7,OOu a year is not to be despised and the proposed raising of the duty to 25% would not only kill this but also quite a thriving trade in cigarettes supplied by British or .Anglo-American^ combines. /S- State is even now putting by money (we have just asked the Bank to invest Is 40,000/- in Government securities) no extra money is therefore required now, and I have a shrewd suspicion that even when the Arms Traffic Subsidy goes, ends will still meet. 6 « The Sultan does very ..ell out of the British and The Kon'ble Lieutenant Colonel T. C. Powle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.and without the assistance of our Navy he v /ould not be getting one rupee from the State, let alone the Ics 6,000/- per month which he is now drawing. The ladies of the palace in addition to receiving generous allowances from the State also get about lis 50,000/- a year in rations, pay of servants &amp;c• So it cannot he said that no room for economy still exists. 7. Hy suggestion is that if and when the new tariff is finaAXy sanctioned that it ce kept under locic and icej with you at Bushire and not communicate^xto 1iie State unless the Financial Adviser specifically asks for it and proves that the State is on the verge of bamcruptcy.8 coimmENriAL H0.6BB-S of 1933.

'■3. ^06. --A - Sir, zs o- r t-''' ' | TI a^ v.ith reference to my confidential despatch No. of the 5th September, 1931, regarding a 450 proposal that the tariff provisions of the Ooraraercial Treaty with Muscat of 1891, and of similar treaties between Muscat and France, and Muscat and the United States of America, should be revised, I have the honour to state, for the information of His Majesty's ijovernment in Newfoundland . Your Ministers, that the French G-overnment consented to a modification of their Ireaty rights on the lines indicated in my despatch under reference, subject to the concurrence of the United States G-overnment in a similar modification of their rights. Negotiations, however, with the United otates G-overnment proved unsuccessful, since they would only consent to a modification of their Treaty rights on terms which were unacceptable to the Muscat Government. Since, however, the financial situation of Muscat still rendered an increase in the Customs duties imperative, some other method became requisite in order to attain the end desired. 2. After consultation with the French Government it was decided that a note should be addressed to the Muscat Government to the effect that, despite Article 6 of/of the Treaty of 1891, which Treaty will remain in force, no objection will be raisea on behalf of His Majesty T s Government in the United Kingdom ana of the Government of India to an increase in the customs duties to lO/o (- o S /j on tooacco and on alcoholic liquor of 55 or less degrees under proof). 'ihis acquiescence, however, is subject to the understanding (a) that a similar increase applies to ships of all other nations except those of the united otates (wiiicii, as stateo. in the enclosure to my despatch under reference, are protected by Treaty) and of the Netherlands (which enjoy most-favoured nation treatment); (b) that if any ships so protected exploit their Treaty advantage, the right is reserved of immediately withdrawing this acquiescence. Jince no united states vessels participate in the Muscat trade, and there is no prospect that any will do so, no exploitation is expected from United States vessels, and His Majesty ! 3 Government in the United Kingdom are satisfied that none will come from Netherlands vessels. 3. The French Government were willing that a note in similar terms, and subject to a similar understanding, should be addressed to the Muscat Government on theii behalf by the local British Representative, and His Majesty f .s Governments in Canada and the Irish Free State also agreed to similar notes being addressed to tfie oultan on their oenalf# Instructions have therefore recently been sent to His Maiestv T s Representative at Muscat to proceed to address such V J X notes to the Sultan. 4.

In our despatch No.466 of the 17th October we sent £f. jt. V to the Canadian Government copies of hites addressed to the Sultan of Muscat by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on behalf of His Majesty's Governments in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Irish Free State, and on behalf of the French 1 Government regarding the modification of the Muscat Customs tariff. I enclose a print of this despatch, and its enclosure, together with a copy of a semi-official letter from the Foreign Office to the India Office regarding registration of the note with the League of Nations. We have discussed the action to be taken on this letter with the Foreign Office and have decided that, in the circumstances, we will say nothing to the Irish Free State Government about withholding registration as, on the whole ? there seemed to be a very good chance that registration with the League might not be considered by the Free State Government if we did not call their attention to it. One of the grounds for this belief is that we have already explained, semi-officially, to the Ministry of External Affairs at Dublin that the Political Agent at Muscat is not a member of the Diplomatic Service but is responsible to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who, in tuijj is responsible to the Government of India. We do not know whether you have the means of judging if there is any risk of the question of registration with the League being considered by the Canadian Government, but, if you think there is, perhaps you would drop a hint, informally to the Department that we should prefer that this correspondence should not be registered with the League..

Similarly, as mentioned by you, the government of the United States found themselves unable to change their agreement entered into in the year 1833 except on terms unacceptable to us; His Britannic Majesty's Government as well as the Republican Government of France thought out some other means which made it possible to concede to our wisheS as far as demanded by circumstances; and you were directed to inform me on behalf of His Majesty's government, that they hve no A obj ectionobjection to raising the tariffs to ten percent ( and twenty- WWHHlWliWWlWIi 1 1 mil five percent on tobaxco and alcoholic wines which are found to contain fifty-five per cent or less alcohol ) and so on.

As for his imposing the tariff with such haste he stated that if he had given previous warning the local merchants would heve quickly laid in large stocics of goods/u goods imported under the old rate 3.

Any wine containing le^r. alcohol would be subject to the lower rate of duty, yiz. t 1^. 3. Under the ter if of the ultan f B reply this meaning is, as you say, reversed, but in addition to this it seems to me that the higher rate of duty, instead of being limited to a certain range of wines, is applicable to all alcoholic wines of whatever alcoholic content under 55 . From enquiries I have made it appears that this difference is of something more than merely theoretical interest. ^Proof' is i understand a term used in connexion with gun imping and explosives and in the case W' 1 ' ''' ''W'-' W of alcohol denotes the point at which a mixture of alcohol and water at a certain temperature becomes explosive (the actual figure it seems is 57/ alcohol by volume K Light wine is about 8o degrees under proof. Black and White Tihieky. at present, 30 degrees anu pre-war whisky 2D degree^. It follows wherefore that there is a considerable ran /te of ines of less alcoholic content than 55 degrees below proof which under the wording of the Sultan's note woula be dutiable at the higher rate^ 4/ Laithwaite, Esq., ' J4. In these circumptancer I must say I find it very difficult to regard the discrepancy as being nothing more then a verbbi inaccuracy. A more probable explanation 10 ly mina is that thore who arafted the ultan'F note have nisunderstoua the position altogether. 5. 1 gather, however, that you do not anticipate that any difficultieB will ari^e in practice ana ihat you are only concerned with any iormal objection which may exi^t to the discrepancy being treated as of no consequence. On this head 1 have strong misgivings, as it seeap to me to be a matter of considerable speculation whether the United 'ingaom note alone could be reliea upon to quell any doubt which mijht at some distant date arife as to the proper interpretation of the agreement, more especially if, as I have already suggested, the ultan's advisers have indeed misunderstood the meaning of our note. 6. irom this point of view 1 consider that it is very advisable that th» • ultan should be induced to furnish an amended note.

I suggest therefore that the extracts enclosed should he submitted for examination to an Arabic scholar, in the School of Oriental Studies for instance, and I would be grateful for a brief telegram intimating whether the phrase has been correctly rendered into Arabic* The word 'correct' would be sufficient. 3, The error has, however, served one useful purpose in that it has suggested a doubt as to whether the expressionj '66 degrees or less under proof' has been understood by His i Highness the Sultan.

My dear Laithwaite^ With reference to our telephone conversation this morning, may I ask you to look at your letter to Ken Johnstone, lo. p,Z*2458/34 of the 17th April, enclosing copies of the Sultan of Muscat's replies to the notes addressed to him on the subject of the modification of the Muscat tariff. ^ jr u Ay 2* You vuill see that in the Sultan's 1 reply to the note sent him on behalf of the French Government, he merely refers to n the terms mentioned in the 10th Article of the Pact...namely, the enhancement of a 10% tariff on commodities brought by French boats without any objection and so on.' 3. Since it was the B?ench who made the special proviso regarding the content of alcoholic liquors on which the duty might be raised to 25%, I fear that they will find it unsatisfactory that no reference is made to the point in the Sultan's reply* 4. As I explained to you on the telephone, we communicated to the French copies of the notes addressed to the Sultan on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the Canadian and the Irish Free State Governments, as well as the text of the note addressed to him on behalf of the French Government. The French may well therefore ask to see copies of the Sultan's reply/reply to these other three notes, and the fact that in those replies he does mention the special provision in regard to the increase of the tariff on tobacco and alcoholic liquors to 25^ would almost certainly make them say that the reply to the note addressed to the Sultan on behalf of the i^ench Government vsas unsatisfactory. It is in addition relevant, that the Sultan has just raised the duty on alcoholic liquors to 10^ and that, as we agree, we are morally bound to inform the French accordingly. 5. In these circumstances, it would be best, I think, if you would, as agreed, telegraph instructions to the Resident that the Sultan's reply to the note addressed to him on behalf of the ITrench Government should unless much objection is seen, be brought into line with his other replies.

The second paragraph of each of the Sultan ! s Notes gives an admirable description of the working of the 'under proof' scale, 'but the statement at the beginning of paragraph 3 of the ITotes to the effect that 'liquors which are less than 55 degrees 'under proof are liquors which contain more than 55 per cent.alcohol' is wrong. It is merely a matter of arithmetic. 'Proof' means 'containing 57^ by volume of pure alcohol'. '55 degrees under proof' means containing 45/100 of 57 per cent, viz. about 25 per cent , of pure alcohol. (You will notice that this figure is given in paragraph 3 of the Board of Trade's demi-official letter of 11th March, 1933, «• a A 0 copy/ &gt;1. P.G.Loch, C.I.E. A v ^ u ■B.M.

Similarly 40 degrees under proof means containing 60/100 of 57 per cent, viz. about 34 per cent, of pure alcohol, and so on. ''Containing 55 per cent of pure alcohol', the figure given by the Sultan, means about 4 degrees under proof I 3. You will see, however, from the enclosed copy of a demi-official letter from the Foreign Office that the latter have decided that the Sultan's latest Notes can be accepted as satisfactory in view of the fairly clear statement towards the end of the third paragraph that it is 'on liquors of these strengths, i.e. 55 degrees and less 'under proof that the increased duty will be charged and liquors of weaker strength will still come under the old rates.' This statement should be quite satisfactory to the French Government who, as you may remember, are anxious to ensure that the higher rate of duty will not be charged on light wines,etc. Indeed, the only party who would suffer if the Sultan were actually to charge the higher rate only on liquors containing more than 55 per cent, of pure alcohol, would be the Sultan himself, but we trust that the Political Agent/i Agent will be able to explain to His Highness that, in fact, he is at liberty to charge the higher rate on any liquors which contain more than 25 per cent , by volume of alcohol. 4. In these circumstances we should be glad if you could now obtain for us, as soon as possible, the original correspondence and the certified copies of the Notes exchanged with the Sultan which are specified in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter in order that the Foreign Office and the Dominions Office may be in a position to complete the necessary formalities with the Governments of France, Canada and the Irish Free State at an early date. 5.

Although, at first sight, they looked unpromising we have reached the conclusion that they can 'be accepted in view of the fairly clear statement in their last paragraphs that it is w on liquors of these strengths, o i.e. 55 and less 1 under proof 1 that the increased duty will be charged and liquors of weaker strength will still come under the old rates'. 3. The only reason of importance for asking for the amended notes - at least the only reason of importance apart from our natural desire to see replies in somewhat 'better form - was to ensure that the higher rate of duty would not be charged on light wines etc. whose alcoholic o strengths range a good deal below 55 under proof. That point is now made clear. It is true that the Sultan still clings to his *55$' idea but if he charges the higher rate only on liquors containing more than 55$ pure alcohol it will not be the importers who will complain, and I think we can leave it to the Gulf authorities to see that the Sultan does not impoverish himself by doing so.

'Proof spirit' contains 67 % by volume of pure alcohol.

Although, at first sight, the notes, even as amended, still appear unsatisfactory as regards the phrase '55 degrees under proof 1 ', it is evident, from the fairly clear statement in the last paragraph that it is 'on liquors of these strengths, i.e. 55 degrees and less under proof, that the increased duty will be charged and that liquors of weaker strength will still come in under the old rates', that the higher rate of duty will not be charged on light wines whose alcoholic strength is considerably below 55 degrees under proof. To have this made clear was the main reason for asking for amended notes, and, now that it has been achieved, it is proposed to leave the matter where it is. only) Will you please inform the Canadian Government?

N ^»W ««69r^, 2, i now enclose a copy of this Notification, together with the covering letter received j.r®ni the Sultan dated 4th June 1935 and much regret that the omission was not discovered before* 0^ It will be seen that, amongst other things, the Notification imposes an increased duty of 20% on a-1 alcoholic liq.uors whereas this rate should have been limited to those containing 55% under proof of alcohol or less (i .e. ®f greater alcoholic strength) vide Bushire Residency letter No. 2p0 dated 19th June 1933. I took the opportunity of my last visit to Dhofar to point out / the irregularity in this Notification t® the Sultan whe agreed that it was an error and that it should be imme diately rectified. At my request His Highness gave me- 2 - !?• a letter to his Hepresentative in Muscat, authorising him to issue an amended notice which I shall see is correctly worded. ^ copy of the notice will be forwarded to you in due course, 4* Fr «m enquiries I have made it appears that the sole importer of alcoholic liquors in Muscat - a Portu guese subject - has since the date of the Notification paid 20% duty on liquors which contain less alcohol than the prescribed strength mentioned above. These liquors consisted of beer, Italian and French Vermouth and Champagne. As regards the two last named liquors it does not seem that the French Government could lodge a protest, in the unlikely event of the matter coming t® their notice, since the wines were not imported in French ships. I pointed out to His Highness that the importer would have to be repaid the excess of Custaras duty should he put forward such a claim. The Sultan agreed but suggested that in view of the trifling amount of such liquors imported and the small amount involved under all the circumstances no repayment on the part «f the Muscat Government need be volunteered and the only action necessary will be the immediate amendment »f the Notification. I agree with His Highness and as the question is unlikely to be taken up further nothing more, I think, need be done.

In compliance with your request we would ask you please to convey to our friend the French Republic that the meaning of our letter dated the 17th Dhil ftaadah 1352 (4th March 1934) is that we have understood and agree to the fact that the agreement of the French Republic to the revision of Article 10 of the 1844 Treaty, as explained in your letter of the 19th June 1933, is subject to the reserved conditions marJced (a) and (b) in paragraph 2 of that letter, and also that this is to be understood if the goods arrive by their steamers.

In the last sentence of his letter the Sultan nas mentioned the fact tnat the agreement only covers goods which arrive in Trench bottoms. Since French vessels never call at Muscat in practice this will leave the Hultan free to charge ary duty he likes on goods not arriving in French bottoms.

In his replies to the Notes on behalf of H.M»G., pp. 46-53. the Irish Free State and H.M.G.in Canada, His High ness, not understanding the expression '66 or less degrees under proof', used the incorrect expres sion '66% or less alcohol', and in his re^ly to p. 46. the Note on behalf of the French Bovernment entirely omitted any reference to this proviso. On examination it was found impossible to translate correctly into Arabic the English technical phrase 'under proof'.

This is in oraer that the French » who were responsible for the insertion of this proviso - may not find the Sultan's reply un satisfactory when it is communicated to them, as it has to be. No cause for complaint by any of the Governments involved has arisen so far because the Sultan has merely raised the duty on alcoholic liquors, irrespective of their alchholic content, to 10^ only and has not imposed the higher duty of 26%. d fH, ? - 71 12 - / /iv // 9$ r • y-/2~' i : ■(1) Confidential i.etter from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 94-S. of 1929, dated the 2nd April 1929.

It will be seen that conditions in Muscat are at present easier, but that the financial difficulty is a continuing one. This difficulty would not he lessened by the Sultan's abdication as His Highness would doubtless take with him on retirement an allowance which would increase the burden which payments to members of the royal house throws on the Muscat State. 3. Apparently the Imam's Government are prepared to meet the prospect of additional customs duty in a reasonable spirit and as a matter el; fact under the agreement of 1920, (S. E., March 1921, Nos. 55—194), so long as the Zikat remains untouched, they do not seem entitled to object to an increase in customs duty. 4. I would therefore ask that the international aspect of the increase in customs be taken up, as in the event of no additional revenue being obtained there seems little doubt that the Muscat State will eventually shrink into a Muscat-Matrah enclave. 5. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Enclosure. Confidential letter from the Political Agent and H. B. M.'s Consul, Muscat, to the Secretary to the Hon'bee the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 40-C. of 1929, dated the 18 th March 1929. With reference to your letter No. 4-S., dated 19th January 1929, I have the honour to submit the following report for the information of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1. Attitude of the Sultan, —In accordance with the instructions of the Hon'ble the Political Resident, I interviewed the Sultan. In view of the consistent attitude which His Highness has adopted for the past nine years, I had little hope of persuading him in the course of one interview, to change that attitude and undertake the task of actually ruling his country. I was surprised, however, at the reasonable, frank and friendly way in which the Sultan discussed the matter with me and how he suffered under no delusions either as to the weakness of the present administration or as to the necessity for the ruler to co-operate actively in the Government. He summed up the requirements in two words. Power and Money. At the same time, he declared himself a sick man and stated that the constant worry which he would experience from the tribes was more than he was pre23ared to undertake. He declared his readiness to give over the Government to any one the British Government might select, not necessarily to his son Saiyid Said and stated that in any case he had already made up his mind to return to Muscat twice more after which he proposed to leave Muscat permanently. He added that of course the British Government could force him to remain in Muscat. I presume this remark was with reference to the question of his allowance. As I had no wish to allow the conversation to take a definite line towards abdication, I did not discuss the question of such allowance with him. Lc99FD #2 His Highness assured me that he would do all he could to help the administration whilst in Muscat and he certainly is taking an interest in local affairs at present. His activities include :— (1) Whilst in Bombay he induced the General Electric Company to send an engineer to work out a scheme for the supply of electric light in Muscat and Matrah. It is hoped to form a company for this purpose, the General Electric Company taking a proportion of the shares and undertaking the management. (2) He has taken an interest in the improvement of the town. Some streets have been broadened vftider the direction of Saiyid Mohmood. Some ruined houses have been demolished and a tennis court for Saiyid Said is under construction on their site. (3) He has had new passports printed for the State in book form. (4) He proposes making a tour of the Batineh Coast. The Sultan's attitude towards the Arab members of his Council also seems to have undergone modification, and he does not now regard them as useless but realizes that they are of material value in carrying out the administration. He contemplates adding to their numbers to make them up to their original strength. The attitude of the interior too is more favourable than it has been for many years. His Highness the Sultan has received friendly letters recently, for the first time since the rebellion, both from the Imam and from Sheikh Isa bin Sal eh. I am hopeful that it may be possible to induce the Sultan to under take the administration at least for a few years until Saiyid Said is old enough to be able to assert his authority without being in the hands of others. It would probably be easier to achieve this object by indirect rather than by direct methods. It seems possible that by encouraging his activities in local improve- ments and by increasing his revenues so that he would be in a position to entertain Sheikhs and to exercise something more than a nominal authority. His Highness may become more interested and thereby in duced to take control of affairs. 2. ^SW.—-With the death of the Amir Mahomed bin Naser and in the absence of the Amir Ali bin Abdulla in the Hejaz, there is no influential bneikh ot the Bam Bu Ah present with whom negotiations would serve any use u purpose and it will be necessary in any case to postpone any iscussion as contemplated in Foreign telegram No. 304-S., dated 22nd File No 7 248 ¥.|28] t0Wards the end of the . year [Serial No. (74) in Bn Ah- S +?i! hneSS r.? nsi( i ers ^ ^ ie went to Sur and ordered the Bani in +1 eir ^ aiul customs post and cease from interfering hp wnnlrl mprouf k l011 - was 110 . a position to enforce these demands, he would merely be giving an exhibition of his own weakness.

(7) Expenses in connection with the rebellions themselves. (8) Loss of valuable gardens and other property in Semail which fell to the Imam under the terms of peace 1920. By the introduction of customs and other reforms and by cheesepar ing economies, the Finance Minister has been able to make his budget meet but he has had a difficult task. Trade depression and other causes have given ground for uneasiness and it has not been possible to carry out in full, the reform proposals sanctioned in Foreign telegram No. 2344, dated 6th November 1918 (Pro. No. 84 in S. E., May 1919, Nos. 24—67). Each year has seen the elimination of all items of public works from the budget whilst a diminution of the strength of the Muscat Infantry has had to be carried out in order to make the budget meet, The Sultan has found himself unable to entertain Sheikhs and keep up friendly intercourse with them as formerly. Such stringent economies in administration have caused a gradual wane in the prestige of the Muscat State with the natural repercussion that customs become more difficult to collect whilst the imposition of any other forms of revenue are out of the question. I am of opinion that a more healthy financial aspect is necessary if the State is to be put on a sufficiently sound basis to enable it to carry out a reasonably effective administration and to stop the gradual disintegra tion which is taking place. I would therefore recommend a serious examination of the question of the removal of the 5 per cent, limitation on customs dues. I attach to this report an appreciation by Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., Finance Minister, Muscat State, on the subject. I fully agree with Mr. Thomas's views which are very ably expressed. Mr. Thomas recommends an increase in duty to 7| per cent, on the basis of Mr. Bower's report (15 per cent, in the case of alcohol and cigarettes) and calculates that this will produce an additional revenue of IJ lakhs. ANNEXIJEE. Confidential lettek prom the Finance Minister, to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat , No. 40, dated the 16 th March 1929. I. I have the honour in compliance with your request to give a brief appreciation of the financial situation in relation to the proposal to increase State revenues. TI. Judged purely on financial grounds, the State has in recent years enjoyed comparative stability. That is to say it has been paying its way without recourse to a new loan : it has without default met interest and capital refundment charges on the 1920 Government of India Loan which is now almost liquidated : and it has during this time found funds to institute and maintain the following new services all recurrent expendi ture :— (i) a State patrol ship, (ii) an Arab State school at Muscat,(in) the appointment of Qaclhis to all but three Qadhas in the country. This has only been made possible by (i) vigilant economies in the lean periods including- reduction of the original strength of the Muscat Infantry, (ii) redistribution of the Government of India Loan instal ments, (Hi) the starvation of public works (a half lakh could be spent with advantage on Government forts up and down the country), (iv) the institution of a Dhow Registration Tax, (v) closer supervision of Customs revenues, and (vi) absorption by the Central Treasury of Shamailiyah Zakat and customs administration. III. The general economic condition of the country has not improved during this period. The reason for this is that Oman's primary source of wealth, its date crop, has declined as a result of failing rains during the past 15 years in the interior. Drought conditions have led to sporadic emigration from the Sharqiyah province, the chief sufferer, to the Batinah and to Zanzibar. The middle Ilajar has suffered to a smaller extent while the Ja'alan and the Batinah seem to have been little affected. Other lesser factors, though these are largely common to neighbours, are (i) a fall in the value of the country's produce since the war years : (ii) a fall, in sympathy with the silver market, of the value of the Maria Theresa Dollar, Oman's principal currency, and (in) depressed condition in recent years of the pearl industry at Dibai and Bahrain—this reacts on the Batinah because Dibai and Bahrain besides providing a livelihood for some 400 Batinah divers constitute the chief markets for Batinah wet dates and firewood. Phe^ complaint of Muscat and Matrah merchants that the people of Shumailiyah and Batinah are not buying their wants from Muscat, but from Dibai because the latter is a customs free port is not entirely correct : it may largely be accounted for bv a natural process ot exchange. But while merchant and cultivator is alike less well off than he has been, the present 5 per cent, ad valorem customs duties plus a ,1' ^ a kat cannot be considered to bear oppressively on him, or place a limit to the State's taxable capacity. desirable reforms demanding a flourshing Excheouer are con ditioned by increasing State revenues. The expenditure side of the Budget is inelastic Its scale and scope drawn up in 1922 had relation to a dollar exc lange o Rs. 200 as against Rs. 323 to-day, and leave no margin to provide the Sultan with means to spend on a Shaikh's guest house, or bv douceurs and entertainment to attract powerful tribal personages from the remoter parts of the Sultanate : such expenditure would be a first charge on the means of the Ruler on an Arab State run on traditional lines, my leonen 0 ^P 0 ^ c y in this direction thus involves the increasing revenues, and the State s only means of doing this would appear to be by increasing customs duties. Higher Customs duties, if authorised, can be collected though some preliminary discontent is inevitable. Any in ^ ^ 1Yin ^' however small, will naturally be unpopular i ie geneial public, but this feelins: should disapnear with familiarity, o o icr sources of opposition—without considering Sur which has a pated^ S re ^ )U aT1( ^ practice of evasion—should however be antici- (i) 'Isa bin Salih (Sharqiyah).

(r (Troperial Oustoms Service) sent to Muscat on deputation trom the Government of India in March of 1925 for the pur pose ot examining the State's Customs Department, addressed himself in his report to the question of tlie revision of the State's 5 per cent, ad valorem duties. He therein expressed three alternative views. (i) Against an increase (a) on the hypothesis that 'it is possible tnat imports would show a falling off to such an extent that no extra duty would be realised (h) on political grounds. (ii) An increase of 1J per cent, to 6J per cent, (plus alcohol and cigarettes tax of 15 per cent.). (Hi) An increase of 2J per cent, to per cent, (plus alcohol and cigarettes tax of 15 per cent.). As legaids (i), Mr. Bower's apprehensions of such a considerable falling off in the value of imports would appear to be unduly pessimistic in the light of a slightly increased tax. As regards his alternatives (ii) and (Hi), i.e., of revision either to a 64 per cent, or 7J per cent, tariff, the former would cause more trouble than it is worth. An}^ increase will meet with some opposition on principle. To incur opposition for inadequate results is not worth while : and it is only the yield from the 7i per cent, duties which may achieve, even partially, the desired ends. The result of a 74 per cent, duty would I anticipate increase the revenue by one lakh and a quarter of rupees. Mr. Bower's more liberal estimate would appear to have been based on total f customs ' receipts. In arriving at my figure I have taken into consideration two factors representing together nearly a half of the total volume of taxable trade— (i) Gwadur. V rv - 1 ' (ii) Interior exports. As regards (i) I have disregarded Gwadur as perhaps its present tariff had most profitably be left unaltered. Gwadur is already virtually a 7i per cent, port (State duties of 5 per cent, plus Makran duties of 21 per cent, on its borders) against other Makran ports having 4 per cent, duties, and in view of its size and position a further increase may divert its trade. A small Indian trading ship in 1927 had only to anchor and land its cargoes a few miles up or down the coast to circumvent our customs authorties there, and an application of the increased duty is calculated to encourage similar activities having for their result ends precisely opposite to those desired. As regards (ii) the 5 per cent, duties on dates and other produce from Interior Oman, whose yield for purposes of administrative convenience lias always been brought to account as customs revenues, are not customs duties in real it v, and would not be liable to the increased tax. The present tax (there is no wharfage as for legitimate customs transactions) is in ?Talitv in lieu of zakat and the Treaty of 1920 between the Sultan and the Interior Sheikhs (see page 104 in S. K, March 1921, Nos. 55—194) follow ing Sheikh 'Isa bin Saleh lavs down that this 5 per cent, shall not be ex ceeded. I have therefore excluded export figures, customarily lumped together as customs revenues, from my calculations. The tiguies which provide the basis of incidence for the 74 per ceni. tax ai e the actual impoi is along Oman Sultanate shores from overseas. The pioposed additional 2h per cent customs duty renresents a vield to the Exchequer of 1:40 of the value of such imports. The total value of '^rseas inmorts (eKnlnding Gwadur) for 19^6-27 was Rs. 49,03.010 and for 19-7 -8 Rs. oo 5 i,149 which would thus have yielded on the basis indicated, an additional revenue of Rs 122.575 and Rs. 1.38.928 in those respective years. The proposal of a 71 per cent, customs dutv is calculated therefore directly to increase State revenues by about If lakhs annually. Lc99FD(2) ill Letter to the Secretary, Political Department, India O ffice , London, No. P. 225-N., dated the 4th september 1929. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter No. 94-S. of 1929, dated the 2nd April, from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and enclosure [Serial No. (1)], of which a copy was forwarded to II. M. 's Secretary of State for India, on the sub ject of the finances of Muscat. 2. From the papers forwarded to His Majesty's Secretary of State with Foreign Secretary's letters Nos. 78-M. and 31-M., dated the 27th September 1923 and 17th April 1924, respectively [Serial Nos. (2) and (14) in File No. 749-X j23], it will be seen that in 1924 a similar proposal to that now made by the Political Resident for the raising of the tariff was not adopted by the (xovernment of India, though they implied their prepared ness to entertain it in the last resort. Their reason was the anticipated difficulty with France and the United States of America in connection with the commercial treaties, guaranteeing the 5 per cent, maximum rate, between those countries and Muscat. 3. Muscat affairs have of late shown a tendency to deteriorate. The integrity of the state is admittedly of great importance in view of its position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and the recommendation, re newed as it is after mature consideration in view of the growing danger of dissolution with which the kingdom is faced, seems now to call for more careful review. i r ^? iei ' e . se 1 ems ^ttle doubt that the present trouble in Muscat is largely financial, and the Government of India concur with the Political Resident that the best hope of restoring the Sultan's prestige and control lies m a permanent strengthening of his State finances. The causes of their present weakness are well analysed bv the Political Ao-ent The principal causes are evidently permanent, and there is little prospect of an unaided recovery m the normal ebb and flow of commercial prosperity o.The tariff increase suggested as a remedy, namely from 5 per cent to 7i per cent generally, and 15 per cent, on alcohol and cigarettes ° s shght and if it were not for the international difficulty, there wouWseem to be little 100m for hesitation in adopting it. The extent to wbieb opposition from France and the Unitefl States of America is to be c33ent e to 1 |u a dr t Tbr. Wh iV he 0o ™' ent of India are hardt competent to ,iudge.

(4) Letter from the India Office , No. P. 6148, dated the 28th November 1929. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of the 4:th September 1929, No. F. 225-N. [Serial No. (2)], and to his telegram No. 3674, dated 26th November [Serial No. (3)]. 2. Copy is enclosed of a letter which has been addressed to the Foreign Office. As the question of Muscat finances may become an urgent one if the present Sultan abdicates (especially if in that event the existing Arms Traffic subsidy were discontinued), the Secretary of State would suggest that it might be worthwhile to examine the question of increasing the tariff except in respect of those goods which are covered by the provisions of the treaties with the United States of America, France and the Netherlands If it should appear that the desired increase in the cus toms revenue could be obtained while preserving the existing treaty rights of those three countries, and if the practical difficulties of differentiation could be surmounted, it might become desirable to impose the increased duties on other goods (which presumably at present constitute the vast bulk of the imports), without waiting for the conclusion of negotiations which are likely to occupy a considerable time with France and the United States of America. 3. The Secretary of State would be glad to learn whether the Govern ment of India are satisfied that the increase in the tariff which they suggest would not be neutralised by a diversion of trade to Debai and Sur, or by an increase in smuggling. He would also be glad of the views of the Grov- ernment of India as to the practicability of establishing the Sultan's authority, and an efficient customs control, at Sur.

G. 13. bo farI I 8 as can be judged, French interests are now negligible, and, although a French Consulate is still maintained, it has had no incumbent for some years. United States interests in Muscat have, at any rate since the end, of the war, been in charge of the Political Agent, and, while it would appear from the Department of Overseas Trade report of 1929 on economic, conditions in the Persian Gulf that there is a regular trade between the United States and Muscat, it is in itself of little importance, and has shown a marked decrease in the last three years. There is no indication of any connection between Muscat and the Netherlands, and the commercial agreement of 1877 between the two countries in any case provides for the grant of most-favoured-nation treatment only. 3. Mr. Secretary Benn is in complete agreement with the Government of India as to the importance, especially in view of the development of air communications in the Gulf, and of the reassertion of Persian authority on the Persian littoral, of maintaining the stability of the Muscat State, and he is impressed by the unanimity with which expert opinion urges the impossibility of securing this without some improvement in the financial position. Despite the presence of an experienced European Finance Minister, this has shown no improvement of late years. The budget estimates for 1929 record a decrease on actuals in the principal source of revenue (customs) of Rs. 1,39,000 between 1925 and 1928 in a total budget of some Rs. 10 lakhs ^ no new sources of revenue are apparently in view ; and, while the liquidation in 1932 of the liabilities of the State to the Government of India will release a sum of some Rs. 43,000 nei annum for general purposes, the effect of this cannot be considerable Some improvement might result from the consolidation of the Sultan's authority at Sur and the imposition there of an effective customs regime, i T i ^i 11S Secretary of State is consulting the Government of India : but the question presents difficulties of its own, and even should these be surmounted, it would probably be some time before any material increase in revenue from this source could be secured. It seems clear, in the cir- f It 1 + 1S 0 - 1 ^' 011 ^ Ties I10w proposed by the Government ot India that the situation can be satisfactorily eased.

I am accordingly to enquire whether Mr. Secretary Henderson sees airy objection to the Sultan being approached in the manner proposed in paragraph 6 of the Oovernment of India's letter. His Majesty's Grovern- ment's subsequent proposals to the French and United States Govern ments would be based on the strong case which exists for improving the financial position of the Muscat State, and could presumably be supported by the recent precedents for conceding the principle of tariff autonomy to Asiatic countries. 8.

I have recently paid a visit to Muscat where I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of His Highness whom I had not previously met, and was glad to find him looking well and on the whole in good spirits . •Original copy on File N'.). 33-l-N.[29. Le99FD10 2. On my arrival in Muscat I was informed by Major Murphy that His Highness had returned to Muscat early in November and had since been taking greater interest in the affairs of the state than on any previous occasion within recent times. His Highness had paid a visit in his yacht to the Batineh coast and another visit to Sur and was contemplating a trip to Bhofar, and Major Murphy was inclined to think that for the moment at any rate His Highness had given up his intention to abdicate. Mr. Thomas, the Wazir, while agreeing that His Highness was taking greater interest in state affairs than formerly told me that he was con vinced that he was still firm in his resolve to abdicate at an early date and would mention the matter to me during our interview. And having regard to the statement made by His Highness to Colonel Barrett a few months ago I went to see His Highness expecting to be confronted by something in the nature of an ultimatum : I am glad to be able to report, however, that these anticipations were not fulfilled and that my interview with His Highness was on the whole satisfactory. 3. As already stated T found His Highness looking much better than I anticipated and after complimenting him on his appearance and on the fact that he had been able to visit various outlying portions of his state, I turned the conversation to the subject of finance The state financial year coincides with the calendar year'; and Major Murphy had informed me that despite the strictest economy he anticipated that the year would close with a deficit of Us. 7,000 or 8,000. His Highness stated that m his opinion it was essential that measures should be taken to increase the revenues of the state and expressed the very earnest hope that His Majesty s Government would obtain the consent of the French and American Governments without further delay to the increase in the customs duty I informed him that I did not know exactlv how the matter f 1 a ^eed with him that it was essential that something should Government Pay ltS Way and W0Uld re P reseilt his wishes to 4 : Highness then went on to discuss Sur affairs. He had him- \li bin Allhd^rfh 7 eri( J eav T re . d to /7 iYe at a settlement with Shaikh All bin Abdullah, the so-called Amir of Jaalan of the Beni Bu Ali tribe who was still levying unauthorised customs duties at Sur and flvine- a fla^ which though of the Wahabi colours the Amir has al^ w f rf l' 8 - rnttrh In Mb,J ,I,i„ !„ tl, e interior impunity 'l t',' sfto S: ts* 'r h .t b ': iiTi y kn ' M fiav' ass - &gt;« were knocked down by one of Hi« Moil ?&gt;, t eus '' o:lns house whether the result would not 8 | hl P s - 1 then asked him departure of the ship the Beni Pn A )' 10 a,s ,',' or ^ 'amely, that after the control at Sur occunyino- if npL 1 ag ? in lm P ose their customs His Highness agreed that this wo^fa ffer hmldmg for the purpose, opinion it would be nece SSar ^ l I ^ obabl - v be c , so said that in his T replied that in my opiSon the rZ'fr, ' f''?V for a certai » Period, despatch troons in thn lief v + T - or Xnf.ia would.only agree to tion to the hnportance be out P^opor- admitted the force of this and sfafo'rl ih f ( - 1 s ?^ lle ^ 1 ; SCIlss ion His HighnessBMWWMlfBBHBBWSWBBHBBBMBIBHHBWi 11 bombardment. The Beni Bn Ali were a very primitive people : the moral effect would be considerable : it would not be necessary for the aeroplane or the flying boat to canse any casualties but if it also dropped some bombs on the customs house while the ship was knocking it down it would impress upon the Beni Bu Ali that His Majesty's Government on the present occasion meant business and could reach them not only on the coast but also if necessary inland from the air. 5. His Highness then went on the say that before resorting to these drastic measures he thought that the negotiations that he had initiated might be continued though in a different form. In September last the Amir of Jalaan visited Aden and submitted to the Resident and Com mander-in-Chief there a letter addressed to Colonel Barrett. In this letter the Amir claimed that the Muscat state had no right to interfere in the Ghafiri country : that if the Political Agent at Muscat wished to see him he should come to Sur for the purpose ! that letters should come direct and not through, the Muscat authorities and finally asked that he should be permitted to issue passports and also allowed to import 300 mauser rifles. In short it virtually amounted to a demand to be recognised as independent of Muscat, and I have just received a report from the Politi cal Agent at Muscat that Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah has since his return * been issuing printed travelling permits purporting to be issued by the Government of Jaalan and its dependencies. These permits have been signed and sealed by the Shaikh but have been distributed blank for all and sundry to fill in as required. A copy of Shaikh Ali's letter was forwarded to the Political Agent at Muscat and he was told that in case any further enquiries were made by Sur he should reply that no represen tations would be considered unless submitted through the Muscat Govern ment. No further enquiries have, however, been made from Sur and the letter has remained unacknowledged. His Highness informed me that he thought Shaikh All was waiting to see what reply the British authorities were going to give and that this was one of the reasons why the discussions with him had proved abortive and the Amir had maintained his recalcitrant attitude. His Highness asked if I would send a reply refuting the claim to independence and calling on the Amir to refrain from interfering on the coast. I asked His Highness to let me have in writing the exact tenor of the reply he wished me to give and also enquired whether he would prefer that the reply should be sent through the Muscat State authorities. His Highness said he would do so and I am expecting a letter from him on the subject shortly but stated that it would be preferable that I should write to the Amir direct instead of through the Muscat authorities. I propose therefore on receipt of His Highness' communication to address a letter to the Am ir calling on him to abstain from any interference at Sur and informing him that he has no right to issue passports, etc. I am not very hopeful that this letter will have much effect but it will, at any rate, fill in the time till a definite decision is arrived at regarding the measures to be taken at Sur, and the Amir will have been seriously warned before more drastic measures are resorted to : also. His Highness will know that something is being done in the matter and will be encouraged to contain his soul in patience for a short time longer. 6. After we had concluded our discussion of Sur affairs I asked His Highness somewhat pointedly whether there were any other matters which he wished to discuss and to my surprise he stated that there were none and accordingly after a few platitudes I took my leave. 7. It is difficult to account for His Highness' apparent change of attitude and intention and I do not think that he has altogether given up Ins intention to abdicate. I am inclined rather to think that in view of the fact that a new Political Resident has come to the Gulf and one who has never formerly held the post of Political Agent at Muscat or taken any part in Muscat affairs, and who may possibly hold the post for a somewhat longer period than some of his immediate predecessors, His Highness is/ II W 'i. i : ' i 'I ■ ■ ■ : t l II • ; 1 i 'l &lt; 12 disposed for tlie time being to adopt a waiting attitude, and to see whether the new Resident will be able to do something to remedy his fancied grievances, before finally and definitely abdicating. His desire to abdi cate is, I believe, largely due to his alleged grievances against the British Government and their local representatives in the past. He thinks that an opportunity offered for recovering inland Oman after the repulse by Indian troops of Isa Bin Saleh's attack on Muttrah in 1915 and that it was the British Government who refused to allow him to take advantage of it thus humbling him before Isa bin Sal eh with whom and his family he has a long-standing blood feud, and he further considers that he has'not been adequately supported over Sur affairs. If the two matters to which he attaches importance, namely, the re-habilitation of the finances of his state and the re-establishment of his authority on the coast, can be settled to his satisfaction, I have hopes—though it is much too soon yet to express a definite opinion—that His Highness may take a renewed interest in the affairs of his state and that it may be possible to ward off for some years at any rate the long-threatened abdication. 8. Just as I was in the course of drafting this despatch I received a copy of letter No. P. 6148 of the 28th November 1929, from the India Office o you fSerial No. (4)], and am glad that His Majesty's Government are lully apprised of the necessity for the increase of the customs tariff. I am at once consulting the Political Agent as to the possibility of increasing f 011 goods other than those covered by the terms of the treaties 1 rari '. : J- and the Netherlands.

E. 62071166] 91, dated the 31 st J anuary 1930. T am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to inform you that your tetter No. P. 6567 of the 27th November [Serial No. (4-A.)], regarding the proposed increase in the tariff of the State of Muscat, has engaged his attention. 2. It is of course impossible to foretell what will be the attitude of the French and United States Oovernments towards a proposal that they should agree to such a revision of their treaties with Muscat as will permit of a higher duty than five per cent, being levied on goods carried in French and American vessels. Mr. Henderson, however, sees no reason to antici pate that such objections as they may raise will prove insuperable, or to fear, in the present case, a repetition of the difficulties experienced before the war in obtaining the consent of the French Government to the regula tions for the prevention of the illicit trade in arms in the Sultanate (cf., ;P. O. 13, pages 45 and 46). He would, therefore, should Mr. Secretary ^enn so desire, be prepared to approach the French and United States Oovernments in the matter, and lie concurs in the proposal, put forward paragraph 7 of your letter under reply, that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman should be moved formally to request His Majesty's Government to lake art ion accordingly. Lc99FD14 3. On the other hand the suggestion put forward in paragraph 5 of your letter, that the important duties on goods other than those covered by the treaties between Muscat and the United States of America, France and the Netherlands, should be raised forthwith, appears open to consider able objection. Were this proposal adopted, France and the United States (and^consequently the Netherlands) would in effect obtain a privileged position in Muscat trade as against other Powers. Any subsequent request for the consent of the French and United States Oovernments to an increase m the maximum duties provided for in their treaties, would there fore amount to a request for the abandonment by them of the privileged position thus obtained, and it would, in Mr. Henderson's opinion, be more difficult to approach those Governments in the manner suggested, after the tariff had been raised in respect of goods not covered by their treaties, than it would be to do so while they are, as at present, in a position of equality with other Powers, and while the suggestion is merelv one for raising duties all round. 4.

MEMORANDUM. Conditions have entirely altered since the conclusion of the treaties between Muscat and the United States and French governments, under w hich Muscat customs dues on goods carried in American and French vessels are limited to five per cent. L C 99FD18 During- the intervening period the revenues of the Sultans of Muscat have steadily diminished, owing principally to (1) the loss of their sea-power and overseas dominions ; (2) the introduction of steamers into the Persian Gulf and the abandonment of Muscat as an entrepot for trade ; (3) the arrest of the prosperity of the country and its gradual impoverishment owing to the persistent drought in the interior. 4? ^ ie y e ^ rs ? i n particular, the general economic conditions oi the country has deteriorated to an alarming extent. The date cron Oman s primary source of wealth, has greatly declined in value as a result of the continued failure of the rains. There has in addition been a fall in the value of the country's produce since the war, and a fall in the value of tie Maria Theresa dollar, Oman's principal currency, in svmpathv with the silver marker [in 1922 the dollar exchange was reckoned at Rs 200 (two hundred rupees) as against Rs. 123 (one hundred and twentv -three lupees) m 19291 Moreover the depressed conditions of the pearl industrv in recent years has reacted unfavourably on the finances of Muscat sinw Bahrein and Dibai are one ot her principal markets.

After compliments. The necessity has arisen for increasing the customs duties of our State for revenue purpose. These are at present limited to 5 per cent, by Treaty relations with the Governments of Great Britain, the U. S. A. and of France. We shall be grateful if His Britannic Majesty's Government will approach the Governments of U. S. A. and France respectively on our behalf to obtain a revision of those clauses of (I) Treaty of Amity and Commerce between TJ. 8. A. and His Highness Syyed Said, dated 21st September 1833, (II) Treaty of Commerce between the Imam of Muscat and The King of the French dated 4th February 1846 that impose the present 5 per cent, restriction. A revision of the Treaty of Commerce with His Majesty The Queen of Government of Britain and Ireland dated 1839 is also desired in this sense. There is no intention on our part to differentiate in favour of or against any nation and it is intended that the Powers in question will continue to receive ' most favoured nations ' treatment. And you are aware of the actual facts which make it necessary for treaty revision in this matter.20 (16) (Received on 6th April 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 1.2, dated the 20th March 1930.) L etter from F oreign O ffice, to H is M ajesty's A mbassador, P aris, No. 570, dated the 18 th M arch 1930. The State of Muscat and Oman, in South-Eastern Arabia, with which His Majesty's Government are in special relations, has suffered for a period of several years from a condition of increasing financial stringency, and a critical situation has now arisen which calls for an immediate remedy. After much careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached the conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can only be effected by an increase in the rate of the tariff on imported ^oods, and that it is important, in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the State, that this proposed increase should take effect with the least possible delay. 2. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyond a rate of five per cent. is. however, limited by Article 3 of the Treaty between Muscat and the United States of America of 1833, and bv Article 10 of the Treaty between Muscat and France of 1844. Copies of the texts of these articles are enclosed herein. X^nless therefore the United States and French Grovernments will consent to waive their rights to a maximum tariff of five per cent, under these treaties, no general increase in the tariff will be practicable, and it will be impossible to adopt the suggested remedy. „ il 3 - Tn thes-c ^irciimstances the Sultan desires that the Governments oi the United btates of America and France should he approached with a view to securing from them at the earliest possible moment such a waiver ot their rights under the articles of the two treaties referred to above as will allow of a general increase in the Muscat tariff above the present flat j I' ' 0 , ,y e ' 101 'J' 1 Since there has been no French Consular representa- tive at Muscat for some years past, and United States interests there are m charge of the Government of India's Political Ag-ent His Hidmess ■viiV tW P hat HiS M , a 'i est - V ' s Government should take up the matter wmi the two Governments concerned on his behalf. fnrfT^ , ir!'n!i rai + Sin ^ + 0 'T^?

His Majesty's GovermiL^t 111 -Eastern Arabia, with which \ ernment are m special relations, has suffered for a21 period of several years from a condition of increasing financial stringency, and a critical situation lias now arisen which calls for an immediate' remedy. _ 01 ranch careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached the conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can onlv be effected bv an increase in tho rate of the tariff on imported goods, and that it is important! in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the State that the proposed increase should take effect with the least possible delay. 2. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyond a rate of five per cent, is. however, limited by Article ?&gt; of the Treaty between Muscat and the United States of America of 1833, and by Article 10 of the Treaty between Muscat and France of 1844. Copies of the texts of these articles are enclosed herein. Unless therefore the United States and French Governments will consent to waive their rights to a maximum tariff of hve per cent, under these treaties, no general increase in the tariff will be practicable, and it will be impossible to adopt the suggested remedy. 3. In these circumstances the Sultan desires that the Governments of the United States of America and France should be approached with a view to securing from them at the earliest possible moment such a waiver of their rights under the articles of the two treaties referred to above as will allow of a general increase in the Muscat tariff above the present flat rate of five per cent. Since there has been no French Consular re presentative at Muscat for some years past, and United States interests there are in charge of the Government of India's Political Agent, His Highness has requested that His Majesty's Government should take up the matter with the two Governments concerned on his behalf. 4. I transmit to you, herewith, a memorandum setting forth in greater detail the reasons which have impelled the Sultan to make this request, and arguments in its support, and I shall be glad if you will address a note to the Government to which you are accredited based on the material contained in this memorandum, and will urge them to give the matter their early and favourable consideration. United States trade with Muscat appears now to be of very slight importance, and you may find it desirable to make use of this point. But His Majesty's Govern ment would be very reluctant to make any statement the effect of which might be to encourage United States interest in this State, and you may therefore, on consideration, think it preferable not to draw attention to the unimportant character of their interests at the present time, unless the course of discussion should render this inevitable. Should the United States Government be prepared in principle to consent to this modifica tion of their treaty rights, the question of the best method of giving legal effect to the modification of the relevant treaty position can be subsequent ly considered. 5. Instructions in a similar sense are being sent to His Majesty's Ambassador in Paris, CONFIDENTIAL, (18) E ndorsed by F oreign and P olitical D epartment , No. F .-225-N.|29, dated 16 tk A pril 1930.
