Shaik Mohumed is believed to have become alarmed by the release of Mohumed Nebbe Khan and fled the town. The Prince is sending a representative to verify this, as he claims that he has no reason to be alarmed at this turn of events. The firmaun also questions why no words of warning were received from the British Resident.Please note that the date of this item is the date the letter was received, rather than the date it was created.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052054.0x00003b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
