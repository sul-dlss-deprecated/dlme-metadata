Judicial . On the death of a wealthy Indian shopkeeper in Ahwaz, whose next-of-kin was in India, His Majesty's Consul asked the Public Prosecutor whether there was any objection to his temporarily taking charge of the estate, i.e.sealing up the contents of the shop and of a house, in accordance with General Consular Instructions which are based on normal international usage. He replied that there was every objection, as it would be contrary to Persian law and to the regulations issued by the Ministry of Justice. (A report on this subject was furnished by His Majesty's Yice Consul at Mohammerah in July,1934,with special reference to staff of the Anglo Persian Oil Company at Abadan.) Aqa Mirza Ali Khan Mu'azami arrived from Tehran as a Juror of the High Court of Khuzistan.INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote boC/'W and address —not to any person by name} but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

My Lord Marquess, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, a copy of a despatch from the Acting British Vice-Consul at Resht regarding the threatened expropriation (which has since taken place) by the Muni cipality of Lahijan of a certain piece of property belong ing to Monsieur Dracos Pilides, a Greek citizen. The proper ty consisted of a silk cocoon drying shed and the site was required for street widening. His Majesty’s Government are, as v our Lordship is aware, in charge of Greek interests in this country. 2. Upon receiving this despatch I addressed a note, of which I enclose a copy, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, urging that no further steps should be taken until the question of compensation had been equitably settled. The date of this note was August 19th. At the same time I instructed Mr. Vice-Consul Davis to inform the Governor of Gilan of my action and to request him to see that in the meanwhile the municipality made no further move towards expropriation. 3. On August 31st I received a telegram from Mr. Davis stating that the municipality had told Mr. ilides that, unless he destroyed the dryin -sheds within forty- eight hours, the Municipality would destroy it themselves. Mr. Davis 7 ^he Most Honourable The Marquesa of Reading G,C.B,, etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.Mr. Devis added that the forty-eight hours expired that same evening (August 31st) and that he had again urged the Governor to prevent further action pending the receipt of instructions from Tehran. I thereupon addressed a second, and urgent, note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of which a copy is enclos ed, informing him of the threat made by the municipality and requesting him to stop further proceedings, if it were not already too late to do so. I added that if it proved to be too late, I must reserve the right to address him further on the question of compensation. 4. On September 3rd I received a telegram from Mr. Davis stating that, according to Mr. Pilides, the destruction of the property had begun on September 2nd and was then proceeding. I instructed Mr. Davis by telegram on September 9th to obtain and forward to me by despatch full particulars on which to base a claim for compensation, which I would propose, subject to the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government to present to the Persian Government in default of a local settlement. I warned him against encouraging Mr. Pilldee to suppose that I was likely to obtain an early settlement in Tehran and advised Mr. Davis to make every effort to obtain a settlement locally. I also mentioned the question orally to Feroughi on September 6th, but found, as was perhaps to be expected, that my notes had not been submitted to him personally. He promised, however, to make enquiries. 5. Since the despatch of my telegram of September 9th, I have received from Mr. Davis two further despatches, of which I also enclose copies. The first shows that prior/prior to the destruction, the Municipality offered r.; Hides Ts. 300 a sum of three hundred tomans as comoensation for property valued Ts.5,0C at five thousand tomans. The second gives certain details regard ing the property which has been destroyed and indicates that a local settlement is improbable. I may add that according to Mr. Davis, who recently visited Tehran, the property is on the out skirts of the town and there is no apparent reason why the new road could not easily have avoided it. I have also received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a note, dated September 14, of which a copy is enclosed, stating that instructions have been given to the local authorities that if the property is needed by the Municipality they should act in accordance with the municipal regulations with regard to compensation. The trouble is that there are almost unlikely to be any such regulations (see para graph 6 below). 6. I have reported upon this question at some length, be cause it is possible that a similar difficulty may a rise at any time in connexion with property belonging to a British subject. Such difficulties did in fact arise in 1928 and 1929. I need not trouble Your Lordship with the details at this stage, but the view which Sir Robert Clive then took was to the general effect that white expropriation in itself could not be resisted, ade quate compensation could, and should, be exacted. I enclose a copy of a circular despatch which he addressed to Consular Officers in Persia on April 17, 1929, which shows the position at that time. 7. The legal position of British subjects in this respect is presumably governed by Article 1 of the Judicial safeguards which states that they will enjoy the fullest protection of the laws of the country and will receive the stone treatment as Persian subjects. There is, however, no/no l&amp;w empowering munieipelitiee to expropriate and destroy property for the purposes of street widening. There may be in some cases municipal regulations, but so far as can be seenthe municipalities simply take the property by force, and the Persian owner, unless he is an influential man, seldom receives even the smallest compensation. In these circum stances the authorities are no doubt content to remain without legal sanction for their acts, since it is inconceivable that any law on the subject could pass the Mejlis if it did not provide for compensation. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs did indeed inform Sir Robert Clive in 1929, in con nexion with one of the cases mentioned above, that municip alities were bound to carry out their duties in accordance with the law. But a request for further particulars as to this law received no reply. 8. It is clear that when Persian subjects are treated with so much injustice, a mere appeal for national treatment would be of small avail. but I presume that no Government could excuse itself for illegal actions against foreign nationals on the ground that it also acted illegally towards its own subjects. The laws of ;ersia recognise private pronerty and until the law is changed so as to make expro priation without compensation legal, British subjects are presumably entitled to claim the protection of the law, irres- oective of whether such protection can or cannot be effectively claimed by 'erslan subjects. 9. It is upon such grounds as these that I prooose to endeavour to secure sompensation for British subjects if further cases occur. The position of Greek citizens is substanti ally/substantially the same in practice. Article 1 of the Greco- Persian 'Convention d’F.tablissement de Commerce et de Navigation' signed on January 9th, 1931 (see my despatch No. 530 of to-day’s date) accords to Greek citizens in Persia the protection of the laws of the country in respect of their persons and property and lays down that they shall be treated in these matters in accordance with the principles and customs of international law, and in any case not lees favourably than nationals of the most favoured nation. Moreover, Article VII states that in regard to expropriation for reasons of public ut ility or general interest, Greek citizens shall receive most favoured nation treatment, and adds that they will, in case of expropriation, receive an equitable indemnity in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the country governing such indemnities. There are of course no such laws, but as most favoured nation treatment presumably entitles Greek citizens to the same rights as the nationals of those countries which enjoy the judicial safeguards, it should be possible to formulate a valid claim for compensation on the grounds of the treaty. 10. In conclusion I venture to seek Your Lordship’s authority to present a claim to the s^ersian Government on behalf of Monsieur Pilides on the lines I have already indicated. I am not sanguine of early results if a claim is made, for in Persia it is one thing to formulate a valid claim, another to secure its acceptance by the Persian Government/Government, and yet another to extract the actual money when they do accept it. It is as yet too early to anticipate what action may be necessary if the Persian Govern ment refuse adequate compensation, but in that case I can only hope that full publicity will be given to the case by the Greek Government. It is even possible that the threat of publicity might, if used judiciously, prove a useful weapon in extracting compensation. 11. I should be glad if I may receive Your Lord ship’s instructions as to presenting a claiip, as suggested in paragraph four, at an early date. IS.

A Britisu Vice-Consulate, Heaht f w iiiL-- August 8th, 1951. Sir, I have the aonour to report that Mr.Dracos Pilides a Greek national long established os a merchant in Keaht, owns an installation for drying and storing silk cocoons at Lahijan. This installation is situated on the proposed alignment of the new avenue which the Municipality of Lahijan is making through the town to connect the Kesht road with the Longerud road and make a through route for motor vehicles travelling from Gilan to Mazandaran. The Municipality of T ahijan therefore tore down the fencing in front of Mr. Pilidea* installation and informed him that the silk-cocoon drying-sheds would he destroyed within one month. 2. At this stage Mr. j Hides brought the affaire to my notice and I wrote to His Kxcellency the Governor of Gilan requesting him to order the Municipality of Lahijan to determine the price of the installation and pay compensation to Mr. Pilides before proceeding to the destruction of the installation. In reply His Kxcellency stated that the Municipality would agree to compensate Mr. Pilides for the losses he would suffer, within the limits of its budgetary credits, and in instalments. As tne Municipality’s budget only amounts to ;s.12/XX) per annum while Mr.Pilides estimates the value of his installation at Ts.5,000, he does not consider that this proposal is satisfactory, since any C* K. 3* Dodd, Ksq., His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affalres, British Legation, Gulhekf any payments made are bound to be small in amount and uncertain in time* 5. I have suggested to Mr. Pilides that the Municipality might be prevailed upon to rebuild the silk cocoon installation Xor him at its own cost and charges instead of paying compensation, and ^ he is now considering this suggestion. He would however much prefer that the value of the installation should be paid to him in cash at once before the destruction is accomplished. I have informed him that to the best of my knowledge and belief there is no treaty and no law which we can invoke as a reason for insisting that full compensation should be paid to him in cash before his property is destroyed. I therefore beg leave to re guest you to instruct me whether there is in fact any treaty or law on this subject, or whether any precedents exist in which the Persian Government has clearly accepted the principle of immediate payment of compensation when property belonging to foreigners is required for municipal improvements.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to bring the following facts to Your Highness* notice. Monsieur Dracos Hides, a Greek national lon^ established as a merchant in Heaht, owns an installation for drying and storing silk cocoons at Lahijan. This installation is situated on the proposed alignment of the new avenue which the Municipality of Lahijan is making through the town to connect the Kesht road with the Langarud road and make a through route for motor vehicles from Gilan to Mazanderan. The Municipality of Lahijan therefoi'e tore down the fencing in front of Monsieur Pilides* installation and informed him that the silk-cocoon drying-sheds would be dectroyed within one month. At this stage Monsieur Pilides brought the affair to the notice of His Majesty*a Vice-Consul at Eesht, who wrote to His Excellency the Governor of Gilan requesting him to order the Municipality of Lahijan to determine the price of the installation and pay compensation to Monsieur Pilides before proceeding to the destruction of the installation. In reply His Excellency stated that the Municipality would agree to compensate Monsieur Pilides for the losses he would suffer, within the limits of its budgetary credits, and in instalments. As the Municipality’s budget only amounts tomans twelve thousand per annum, while Monsieur i/ilides estimates the value of his installation at Tomans five thousand, he does not consider that this proposal is His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Perough!,is satisfactory, since any payments made are bound to be small in amount and spread over an ino dinately long period. as a Greek nationsl. Monsieur Pilides is entitled to the protection of this Legation, and I therefore request Your Highness to be so good as to cause immediate instructions to be issued to the Lahijan Municipality to take no further action in regard to this property until the matter has been thoroughly investigated and the legal position elucidated. There exists, as far as I am aware no law covering the expro priation of private property by local municipalities, and Monsieur Pilides is entitled to the protection of the laws in force, which recognise private property. His Excellency the Governor of Gilan has himself recognised this fundamental principle in promising some measure of compensation, but it is evident that the Municipality is only entitled to carry out such improvements as it can afford to pay for in full and without undue delay. Before, therefore, any steps are taken to demolish the property in yueution, I should be grateful if Your Highness would be so good as to assure me that the sum claimed by Monsieur Pilides as the value of his property will be paid to him in full as compensation and to inform me in what manner this compensation will be paid.

Monsieur le Ministry, In my note No. 398 of August 19th I had the honour to inform Your Highness of a proposal to destroy certain property belonging to a Greek national, Monsieur Dracos Pilides, resident at Resht and to request Your Highness to be so good as to take steps in order that the property should not actually he destroyed until the question of the compensation payable to Monsieur Pilides had been eettled. In a note dated August 26th (shahrivar 3, 1310), No.18115/8105380, the Director-General of the Ministry was good enough to inform me that my note had been communicated to the proper quarters for enquiry and necessary action. 2. I have low received information to the effect that Monsieur Pilides has been told by the Municipality of Lahijan that he must destroy his property (a silk cocoon installation) within forty-eight hours or that the Municipality will destroy it themselves. Owing to the time taken for this information to reach me, the forty-eight hours in question expire tonight (Auguat 31st). This and the fact that the Ministry is now closed makes it impossible for me to place the facts before Your Highness in the time available. 3. I can in consequence only appeal to Your Highness to send urgent instructions to the effect that, if the destruction has not already been carried out, it shall be delayed until the question has been settled between the Ministry and this Legation. Should, it, however, prove that the destruction has Copy of English text . No.414 . Urgent .

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No.^2 of the 19th August last on the subject of the property of Monsieur Dracos Pilides at Lahijan, and to report that I at once informed the Governor of Gilan that you had taken up the question with the central government. 2. Between AUijust 8th, when my despatch No. 56 was written, and August 25th, when your despatch No.22 reached me, certain developments occurred in this case which are perhaps worth recording. On August 11th I wrote to the Governor of Gilan pointing out that 1C. Pilides had about 5,000 mans of silk cocoons stored in the drying sheds and re^uestin ;: , that the Municipality of Lahijan should grant him a delay of fifteen days to pack up and remove the cocoons. On August 17th M. Pilides 1 son informed me that the destruction of the drying-shed had b*.en begun. It afterwards transpired that only a small section of the sheet iron roof had been removed when the Governor 1 s order came through granting the delay. 3. In the meantime M. Pilides, who was himself at Lahijan, had been invited by the Municipality to appoint two arbitrators who were to proceed to the drying-shed in company with two arbitrators appointed by the Municipality and determine the value of the building and the loss which M. Pilides would suffer as the result of the destruction of part C* A• S« Dodd, £si^«, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires, Britisa Legation, Gulhekpart of it. The arbitrators submitted a report estimating the cost of destroying and rebuilding part of the drying shed at a little over three hundred tomans. The Municipality therefore called upon M. . Hides to accept an arrangement for the payment of the sum agreed upon by the arbitrators. M. Pilides contends th^t when part of the drying shed is destroyed, the remnant will be useless to him. He therefore c nsiders that the Municipality should pay him the whole value of the building, which cost him five thousand tomans, as he states. I imagine that the fact that he appointed arbitrators will be considered by the Municipality as binding him to accept their finding. 4. In conversation this morning His Kxcellency the Governor of Gilan stated to me that the ground on which the installation is built does not belong to M. Pilides. Only the building is his. The silk cocoons sbred in the dryin, ahet are also not Mr. Pilides 1 own property, as his son admitted to me. They belong to a Persian merchant of Resht who has hired the installation from M. Pilides for the season. I have, etc., (Signed) A. V. DAVIS.to be re-used if the drying-shed is rebuilt. Some of the bricks, timber and canvas have also been carried off by the workmen engaged in the destruction and by the general public, who roam unchecked over the site now that the fence has been torn down. 3. M. Pilides states that he filed an application in the local Registration Department for the registration of his installation, which was valued for the purpose at Te. 5,000. He estimates that the tilambar (as the drying-shed is called locally) cost Ts. 3,000 of this. The three hundred tomans odd which the Municipality offered to pay M. Pilides by instalments would not go far towards the cost of recon structing the tilarabar . 4. Apart from the loss which he has suffered in respect of the drying-shed, M. Pilides points out that he is also en titled to compensation for the lose of about half of the ground which he had leased and which he was entitled to use for four years to come yet. 5. I have told M. Pilides that it will probably be necessary for him to make a claim against the Persian Govern ment through you for the compensation to which he appears in equity to be entitled. I presume that for this purpose an affidavit or statutory declaration from M. Pilides will be reouired, suoported by copies of his correspondence with the Municipality of Lahijan. For the description and value of the -nronerty, I imagine that the best evidence will be a certi fied cony of the application for registration filed in the Registration Department’s archives. 6. As regards the possibility of reaching a settlement locally, I regret to report that I have been unable to inter view the Governor of Gilan on the subject lately, His Excell ency having been fully occupied with arrangements for thevisit of H.I.M. Reza Shah to this province and the departure of H.R.H. the Wali Ahd for Kurope. It is to he remarked how- ever that the discrepancy between the sum offered by the Municipality and the amount claimed by M. Pilides is so large that the possibility of arriving at a compromise is rather remote. I have, etc., (Sd) A. W.

Sir, It seems not improbable that the energy now being displayed by various municipal authorities in carrying out town improvement schemes will result, as it has already in some instances, in the demolition and appropriation of property belonging to British subjects. 2. The attitude which I propose to adopt in this question will, gen.rally speaking, be found in my note No.299 of November 20th to the Acting Minister for foreign Affairs, a copy of which is enclosed for your information and guidance. 3. You will be aware that the safeguards provide only that British subjects shall not be treated less favourably than Persians. I propose however to base myself on the law generally obtaining in civilised countries and I have every hope that in this way it will be possible to secure fair treat ment for British subjects. 4. I recently discussed this question with the Minister of Court who stated that there was no law on the subject of compensation for ex-propriation and that the only safeguard he could suggest was that property should be registered with the competent Persian authority (see my circular despatch No.bB of the 21st December, 1927). In this case, he said, should it be necessary to expropriate property so registered, the value at which it had been registered would be take i into consideration. 5. I request therefore that you will remind British subjects His Majesty’s Consular Officers In Persiasubjects in your district that they would he well advised to register their property forthwith. a I am, etc., (Signed) R.

I have now received a report from His Majesty’s Consul at Duzdab statin £ that the Military Governor proposes, in connection with the Duzdab Municipal town planning scheme, to demolish houses belonging to certain British subjects without compensation. As a result of His Majesty’s Consul’s represent ations the Governor has, however, agreed to two or three days respite in order to refer the matter to Tehran. 3. I need hardly point out to Your Excellency that His Majesty’s government are unable to admit that the Persian Government has the right to treat British subjects in this way and I h^ve accordingly the honour to request Your Excellency to be so good as to cause immediate instructions to be sent to the Military Governor of Duzdab that in no case is property owned by a British subject to be demolished without adequate compensation 4.

The papers chiefly concern a set of silk cocoon drying sheds and storage facilities belonging to a Greek subject in Resht [Rasht], which were demolished by the town’s municipal authorities in 1931 for the purpose of street widening. Papers also discuss the subsequent claim made by the Hellenic Government against the Persian Government. The file’s principal correspondents are: the British Vice-Consulate at Resht (Archibald William Davis); the British Legation at Tehran (Robert Henry Clive); the British Chargé d’Affaires in Persia (Lacy Baggallay).Later correspondence in the file, dated 1934, relates to the transfer of responsibility for Greek nationals in Persia, from the British to the Turkish Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Resht</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreigners</topic></subject><subject><topic>Seizure of property</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
