Two reports sent to Kemball by the British agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassem, are enclosed with the letter, the first dated 7 April 1852, the second 15 April 1852. In the first report, Jassem (f 246) states that he recently discovered and freed two female slaves brought to Bahrain from Amulgavine [Umm al-Qaywayn], but that they were seized from him by Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefah [Muhammad bin Khalifa]. In the second report (f 246) Jassem informs Kemball that he has sent to him the Ghoncha [boat] used to bring the slaves from Umm al-Qaywayn to Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x00005b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
