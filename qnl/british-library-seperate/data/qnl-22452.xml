            information obtained from Abdol Russool [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] regarding a Bugalah
            acquired by him. It states that he has paid a sum mediated by Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd,
            the Imam of Muscat, to the original owner of the boat. However, the Resident is not
            aware of how exactly he acquired the boat, and what if anything he paid for it. The
            letter notes that the Resident expects to obtain this information upon his return to
            Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre></mods></metadata></record>
