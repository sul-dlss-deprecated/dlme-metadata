Marquis Imperiali has the honour, in accordance with his instructions, to request that he may be informed of the decision of His Britannic Majesty*s Government respecting the continuance of payments for the wages of tne cavasses of the British Consulate, and for the rent of the offices of the British Consul and Vice-Consul at Jeddah. LOKDON, June 17th 1915.// o Extract from a report addressed on the 8th May 1915 'by the Italian Vice-Consul at Jeddah to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Rome, As stated in a previous report the funds left with me by the British Vice-Consul are exhausted. To pay the wages due on the 1st January to the two cavasses of the Consulate (43 rupees monthly) and to the guardian of the Vice-Consulate (42 rupees) further funds are necessary which I request Your Excellency to cause to be forwarded to me. As regards the Archives and other property of the British Government left by Dr. Abdul Rahman, I have already reported that the Ottoman Authorities of Jeddah have removed part of the Archives without ray knowledge and in spite of my protests, placing seals on the premises of the Consulate and Vice-Consulate, and stationing a guard there. Before I can take charge of the remainder of the Archives other property of to obtain consent the British Government, with the intervention it is necessary of the local AuthoritiesAuthorities of Jeddah, to the removal of the seals and to regularise the transfer. With regard to the other wish of the British Government to cease paying the rent and other charges of the Consulate and Vice-Consulate, it appears to me that this would he hardly feasible since, as the houses would have to he handed over to their respective proprietors, it would he necessary in the absence of available room in this Vice-Consulate to transfer the Archives, Dr. Abdul Rahman's bulky furniture and the contents of the English dispensary to another place which naturally cannot be obtained here without payment of rent (Signed) Bernabei.Please refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No. P. 1374, dated the 15th April 1915, regard ing the payment of those members of the Consular and Vice- Consular staffs who were left behind at Jeddah on the withdrawal of His Majesty’s late Vice-Consul and Acting Consul at that place on the outbreak of war. There is nothing in the Vice-Consul’s letter of the 3rd March 1915 to the Foreign Office which would appear to justify a reconsideration of our suggestion that we should cease to pay rent for the Vice-Consular buildings. The Italian Consul has already been asked to retain archives and other G-oveminent property left tleft behind by Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman and, if he requires any additional accommodation for the purpose, he will no doubt make the necessary arrangements to rent a suitable building. He may also, it is presumed, be left to engage a door-keeper, if one is required. In the letter from the Foreign Office to the India Office No, 20655/l5 / dated the 29th March 1915, a copy of which was received with your letter No, P. 1239 of the 1st April, it is mentioned that the payments made on account of the wages of the Consulate establishment left behind at Jeddah will continue to be charged against the office allowance. With reference to this I would point out that the Vice-Consul has no office allowance from Indian Revenues. The wages of the two Vice-Consular cavasses have hitherto been paid from those revenues— — Iltf jind not from tno ofilco til 1 owmic 8 01 th© Con^ulcito.

On arrival at a post abroad they receive full salary (300/.), and are subject to the same regulations as regards leave as other Consular officers. 17. In cases of transfer the officer transferred, if at Scale of pay- . , ment on his post at the date of his transfer, is entitled to the transfer, salary of the new post on the day after he vacates his old post. From that date a deduction at the rate of one quarter of his salary is made and is paid to the acting officer until the officer assumes charge, and if he is granted leave after departure from his old post, but before taking charge at the new post, the deduction continues. If he is on leave of absence at the date of his transfer the deduction from the salary of the new post commences from the date of his appointment to it, and the office allowance of the old post ceases to be paid to him.

The office allowance is paid, up to the date of the officer’s arrival, to the substitute. 18. A Consular officer applying for leave of absence, and recommending as his substitute his clerk or any other person not in the regular Consular service, is held responsible to His Majesty’s Government for any loss, whether of fees or other public moneys, which may occur during the time that his substitute is acting for him. 19. A Consular officer should not, without urgent necessity, leave his post at the end of a quarter. By so doing he throws on his substitute the making up of the accounts, for which he is personally liable ; causing thereby inconvenience, and incurring risk which, in his own interest, he should avoid. 20. If a post is vacant, the acting Consular officer receives half the salary, unless he is a salaried officer of the Crown, in which case he receives not more than one-fourth of the salary. (See note 1 at the end of § 7.) He also receives the office allowance. 21. The proper designation of the substitute is Acting British Consul-General, Consul, Vice-Consul, or Consular Agent.ae^ap.

January 6 th 1915 Sir: - Knowing from the telegram of to-day that you are ordered by the Government of India to immediately proceed to Aden on a special duty, I have the honour to request you that, before you leave the Indian shore for that re gion, my this humble application may kindly be forwarded to the F reign Office, London, as follov.s:- (1) That I, as you know, have formerly been as a non-commissioned officer and clerk in the 12th K.I.G Regiment and 21st Punjabis respectively for about seven years and there for fighting on the Frontier in 1908 was awarded a Kaiser-i-Hind medal by the British Government. (2) That afterwards, seeing no better chance of my Khan Bahadur 3.Abdurrahman, L.M.S., F.R.A.3. (Acting British Consul, Jeddah) Delhi, India.promotion, I resigned the Military service in the end of 1908 and as to make much improvement in my life entered the political service at Jeddah and there, after a proba tionary period of six months, was permanently appointed Registrar of His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate on an ini tial pay of £7 and soon after lapse of about ten months, being taken my good and useful services into consideration, was given an increment of £1 with further promises. But I regret to say that in the very days when I was expecting to be gazetted as a Pro-Consul, the outbreak of war be tween Turkey and our Britannic Government put an obstruc tion in way of my flourishing hopes and immediately on re ceipt of telegraphic orders of His Excellency the British Ambassador, Constantinople, I was obliged to heap up the necessary records of the office and sail for India, in your company. (5) That here on arrival in India, you and other members ol your Vice-Consular Staff, who are paid by the Indian Government, are being given different appointments as to continue their service, but I, on account of being in ser vice ol the Foreign Office, London and having no direct concern with the Office of Government of India, am still in a lounging state and spending rny useful life idly.(4) That at such a critical time when our most gracious King-Emperor need the services of his servants to crush the peace-breakers of the world (the haughty and tyrant Kaiser of Germany and his wretched puppet, Turkey), 1 feel constrained to request you to kindly ask for the kind orders of the Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey that I, until the peace is restored in the world and the Jeddah Office is re-opened, may be conferred upon any of the following duties (a) As a Hindustani, Persian and English interpreter in the battle-field. (b) As a detective in any British territory. (c) As a writing hand in the Egyptian or Indian Govern ment Office or in any Consulate in Persia. In the end I feel boastful to say that in case there unfortunately may at present be some objection to my appointment to any of the above duties I may be order ed to take up arms and immediately proceed to the front as a common soldier. Never mind il I lose my life, be cause the martyrdom, I shall meet in the service oi our dearest King-Emperor, his Empire, his peace-enjoying subjectssubjects and the good natured British nation, shall be a great pride lor my old parents and their young grandson. ^ Fraying lor the success of Great Britain and its eternity and impatiently waiting for a favourable reply, I have &amp;c. , (Signed) Barkat Ali Kasuri (Registrar, British Consulate,Jeddah)(I I Foreign Office, P 5 0 I O February 4* &gt; 5^V, / am directed by the Secretary of State to transmit to yon, to be laid before the iAarcuess Ox n re e , the annexed Statement, supported as far as possible by Vouchers, of Sums paid by this Office for Services chargeable to the otes administered by your Department; and I am to request that the necessary directions may be given for the transfer of the Sum of l 3. 10.
