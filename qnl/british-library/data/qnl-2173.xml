J 2lst January, 1948. dhur Jfayv* ' ^vJ % ’ vff Please refer to your letter EXT.2940/47_of 5th January about launches for the Residency and the Agencies in the Persian Gulf. We are not particularly anxious to raise with the Government of India at present the question of taking over individual items of equipment until the general negotiations started in New Delhi by 1;he High Commissioner as a result of Cabinet Office telegrams Nns-TTKPT 497 and 498 o f 26th July last have made further progress. You will remember that in these telegrams the High Commissioner was asked to negotiate primarily about buildings, but that I think it is generally understood that these negotiations cover not only buildings but all equipment as well. We do not want to start negotiations with the Government of India on a piecemeal basis about individual items of equipment such as launches. The point seems to be that the Political Resident and the Agencies have the use of buildings, launches, equipment, etc., and that there is no danger of the present Government of India or Pakistan wanting any of these assets in the Persian Gulf. On that basis therefore the Resident and his officers will continue to enjoy the use of their launches. Moreover, the method of valuation proposed is according to the current market prices. While this would be all very well if it were a question of /selling P.A.K. Hartlson, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Officeselling these assets on the open market, we have, as you know, previously stipulated as a basis for negotiation that the buildings and other assets required by His Majesty’s Government if possible be taken over at an agreed valuation of cost price less depreciation. You will remember that Gardener made this point as well in his letter of the 2lst November to Donaldson covering Foreign Office telegr am No.888 t o Tehran about the disposal of ex-Government of India property in Persia* We therefore think it would be better to leave matters as they are for the present until the * negotiations in New Delhi have made some progress. The only point which appears to need action is the question of a launch for the Trucial Coast. We are not quite clear from the papers what the case actually is and in order to save a lot of correspondence we are asking the Inspectors to discuss with Sir R. Hay what launches will be essential in future in the Gulf. • ^ « a- We very much doubt whether the question of payment, if any, by His Majesty’s Government for the purchase of these launches will arise during the course of the next financial year but if it does we shall have enough money in the estimates to cover the amount required. We are however grateful for Donaldson’s letter to Gardener SxtfX502/47 of 6th January in which attention is drawn to the need for provision in the estimates. I am sending a copy of this letter to Beighton at the Treasury. ;-t K* V DRAFT LETTER '&lt; $ L.F.L.Pyraan, Esq., Foreign Office. V»/h i 1 ' Cf-J '^C) 3&gt; da d-JL.^ &gt; * ?

The slight increase in the valuation of the Kuwait launch since its original purchase ten years ago can be accounted for by the greatly increased cost of such craft In present conditions. The Bahrain launch is a very old one having been originally purchased in 1921, and I consider that the estimated present value of the launch inclu^ ng the engine provided for it in 1944, viz Rs. 35,000/-, is reasonable. The Kuwait launch is of a more or less modern type whereas the Bahrain craft is merely a dhow provided with an engine. = REPGU The issue of the above has been authorised. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.indexed PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN.

Residency T s requirements. We are at present using the small motor launch mentioned in paragraph 3 (b)(iii) of his Express Letter. This is not adequate and we badly need a fast up-to-date launch with sleeping accommodation and a lavatory. At present I usually have to borrow a launch from the Sheikh or an oil Company when I want to do a sea trip of ten miles or more. The larger launch on charge of the Agency is a converted dhow and very slow and not really suitable for the Political Resident to tour in. 3. i do not press for any immediate action in present circumstances but I merely wish to place our requirements on record so that our case may not go by default. 4. The launch at Bushire is owned half by H.M.G* and half by the Government of India. If at any time it were found to be no longer required at Bushire it would, I think, suit our purposes. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Tehran Embassy. 2 I notice that Galloway has made no mention of this E.P.

Your telegram No. 10259 dated August 10th. 2. Following are details of the launches on the Arab side of the Gulf and my recommendations as requested. The cost of items shown is their present day valuation determined at the request of the Government of India. 3* (a) Kuwait . # (i) One sea-going motor launch, (ii) dinghy valued at Rs. 13,000 and at Rs. 400 respectively, and (iii) a tender with an outboard engine valued Rs. 1,350. 'The need for a launch has long been established and this need, if anything, is on the increase due to the expansion of political duties at sea. The launch is necessary for the political Agent, and as all the above equipment is in good condition I recommend its purchase for that Agency. The above properties are shared in moieties between H.M.G. and Government of India. (b) Bahra in. (i) One re-constructed sea-going motor launch (former Felix Jones) valued at Rs. 35,000 and (ii) One dinghy valued at Rs. 400 solely the property of the Government of India. The boat was originally, since it was the Bandar Abbas Consulate boat, owned in moieties between H.M.G. and Government of India. In view of the fact that the cost of a new engine, refitting, and of maintenance since 1933 has been met wholly by the Government of India I consider that the ownership of the launch should be regarded as -j-ths Government of India and -£-th His Majesty*s Government. This equipment ha® proved reliable, and the necessity of providing the political Agent, Bahrain, with a sea-worthy boat to enable him to perform his numerous duties at sea, and to visit various places under his juris diction in Qatar and on the Trucial Coast, shoals and islands has long been recognised and does not need further emphasis. I therefore recommend H.M.G. should purchase the Government of India share in the launch together with the dinghy. (i^Jr^ One small motor-launch paid for wholly by the Government of India and valued at Rs. 6,000. This boat is used as a tender to the Bahrain launch and as a harbour boat. It is in good condition and I think it should be purchased from the Government of India. (c) Muscatr EXT 11 ' 2 - I / L: it i (c) Muscat , (i) One sea-going motor launch (ii) a dinghy valued at Rs. 69,500 and Rs, 500 respectively. The above is the property of the Government of India and in good condition, (iii) A whaler in fair condition valued at Rs, 500 - the property of the Government of India, daring the war owing to the opening up of the south-east coast of Arabia and the lack of shipping. This has now in part passed, but I still think it desireable for the Agency to have its own launch to enable the Political Agent to tour by sea and be mobile in that isolated place and to make him independent of State transport, I recommend that the above equipment should be acquired from the Government of India. (d) Bandar Abbas and Trucial Coa st. One sea-going motor launch valued at Rs. 33,200 paid in moieties between H.M.G. and Government of India, Bandar Abbas and the Trucial Coast was established at the time of sanction, but due to various delays the boat has only recently been put to sea and a few fittings are still required. The Bandar Abbas Consulate has been closed, but as regards the Trucial Coast the renewal of the petroleum Concessions, Limited^ operations increases the necessity for the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and the Residency Agent to tour the Shaikhdoms and the islands in the vicinity. Desert tracks do exist, &lt;bf course, but, excepting Sharjah, there is no accommodation in any town, the headquarters of the Shaikhs, and a launch, besides providing transport, also provides accommodation when on tour. The transport of tents and the pitching of camp is impracticable and without a launch, therefore, only rush visits can be paid. A suitable launch is seldom available for hire and then only at high rates of some Rs. 400 a day. The launch is in good condition and I recommend that it should be acquired for the Trucial Coast. 4. Reference paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference. The Bandar Abbas-Trucial Coast launch is the only one that is likely to become available due to closing of Consulates on the Persian littoral. 5. Reference Ambassador, Tehran^ telegram No. 48 of the 15th August. The Bandar Abbas - Trucial Coast launch is not suited for Khorramshahr where a river boat is required. It could be utilised at Bushire if it is decided not to acquire it for the Trucial Coast, but being designed for touring it would not be really suitable. 6.
