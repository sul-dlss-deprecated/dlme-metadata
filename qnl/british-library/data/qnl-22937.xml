The Company’s operations at Zekrit in preparation for L&gt;eep Test drilling are proceeding satisfactorily and no serious obstruction is being experienced from the Ruler or his Advisers. 2 . 3. SITUATION REGARDING CERTAIN CONTROVERSIAL MATTERS. (a) There is no change in the situation given irj our PCL/SaD 4/548 dated 11th December. The Ruler has sent us no reply to our letter PCL/ SAD4/647 dated 11th December. Harbour Dues. We are arranging to pay harbour dues outstanding on behalf of the hired launch owners through our Agent Mohd. Manna at Dohah. This will be sent up by the transport proceeding with you on the 7th instant. Customs on Provisions . Lists for Customs assessment are also on this transport and payment when assessed will be made through our Agent. Representatives Question . There is no change as the Ruler has not given the concurrence &amp; confirnation asked for in our No.647 of 11th December. OTHER POINTS WHICH MAT BE RAISED BY THE RULER . (a) A Custom’s Representative at Zekrit . This is a subject we wish to avoid. Our contention is that at present there is no necessity for this and owing to lack of accommodation Sc • • te • • v.'ater it is most essential to limit personnel. (b) Increase of Guards . The Ruler regards this as a unique opportunity to pay his private retainers at the Company’s expense. He himself draws their salaries from the Company direct and pays them practically nothing. The Company contend that 20 guards as at present are ample to look after any camp which may be formed at 'Sekrit and will resist any attempt at increase. The Ruler is inclined to take the line thpt security is nothing to do with the Company and to bring in his responsibilities to H.B.M’s Government. When it was hinted that the Company was quite prepared to take the guards’ question to arbitration oy H.B.M’s Government he abandoned the line at once. 1°) /^Company Liaison Representative at Doha h. The Company contend that this is unnecessary in the present stages and Mr.E.V.Packer by occasional visits can do all that is necessary, ouch a representative would only encourage the Ruler fir his advisers to redouble their efforts to exploit the Company unfairly. (d) Control of Employment . The Ruler (or his Adviser - Saleh) have from the earliest days endeavoured to maintain that recruitment of employees should be in the hands of the Ruler’s representative. The Company have in all countries steadfastly refused to agree to this as experience has shewn that it is unoontrolable and leads to countless abuses. The Company maintains its right of selection of employees provided they are eligible under the concession.- 3 - \4 &amp; The Rul.er has of course the right to ask for the discharge of ineligible person or persons who are for any. reason unsuitable but it must be assumed that the great majority are eligible &amp; suitable. Reasons why the advisers try to control recruitment are - (a) To employ their own supporters, families &amp; favorites. (b) To sell vacancies. (c) To take permanent taxes on the salaries of those appointed.From Telegram En clair. Political Agent, Bahrain.

Dated 20th February 1938. For various reasons am very anxious to accom pany you to Abu Dhabi night February 27th returning Sharjah by car 28th. Gan you possibly accommodate me without inconvenience? Am writing to Resident by air mail to Gwadur. PoliticalD.O. No •C/143-12/15 The 20th February 1938. 1 have been thinking over my proposed visit to the Coast to meet you when you come in to Dubai, and the following seem to me to be the main points. (i) I think it is most desirable that I should make contact with the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi at least with^. out further delay. I shall not be able to go down to the Coast between the 5th Larch, when you leave Bahrain, and the 17th March, when the Athlones are due, as I feel there is a strong possibility that the Athlones may turn up early (if they come at all) since there may be water difficulties, forcing them to raake doub:i *9 stages. Then from the 20th March I may be unable to leave Bahrain for a month for reasons of which you are aware. Consequently unless I go down next week-end my Coastal contacts will probably have to be postponed for another two months, and this seems most undesirable. (ii) Owing to the vagaries of the Gulf greyhounds I cannot get an interpreter to Sharjah by the time I am due to arrive in Dubai myself. Consequently I shall have to be dependent on the Residency Agent v/ho will be going as far as Abu Dhabi with you. (iii) The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has now stated finally that he will not consider any Concession other than the one given to Bin Jaud, and Lermitte has had to leave /bu Dhabi. I am particularly anxious to ear and watch him while you are talk ing to him - possibly on this question and certainly regarding the trip to Reraini. I am also very anxious to meet some of the/- The Hon ! ble Lieutenant-Colonel dir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.B., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Calf, On board H.M.S. Bideford, Cwadur.- 2 - © the other Abu Dhabi people, and in particular old Khalaf, Shar.i ah about his refusal to write the proper letter cover ing the Political Agreement* (v) All this can be fixed if I can go along in Bideford from Dubai to Abu Dhabi on the night of the 27th February, returning to oharjah with the Residency Agent by car on the 28th after discussions with the Shaikh and others. I am told it takes about 4i hours by car, and I can borrow one from Lemitte to supplement the 'esidency Agent's car, there by reaucing the risk of a breakdown. This would give me Varch 1st in Sharjah, returning by air on farch 2nd and arriving in Bahrain pretty well simultaneously with you. I have therefore sent off a message to ^aulkner asking him if he can possibly take me along on the night of the 27th February, and I hope to get a reply from him tomorrow. Perhaps you would be kind enough to explain to Faulkner my reasons for butting in and making ra ther a nuisance of myself on the ni;ht of February 27th. 2. The Shaikh of Bahrain is now on his way to Karachi and it is just possible that he will get there in time to catch ths r-sil on the 26th February, in which case he also will | be arriving in iahrain on March 2nd. X hope he does, as you will ^nen oe able to have a talk with him before going back to dushire. I shaxl probably know for certain when I come down to Dubai. 3.

I am hoping to go down by air on the 27th to meet the Poli tical Resident. I do not of course know at what time the sloop will reach Dubai but unless its arrival coincides with the time of arrival of the flying boat at Dubai I would like you to come and meet me and go off with me to the sloop. In any case please make arrangements for me to get from the creek where the flying boats land across to the sloop. 2. The Political Resident will want you to go with him to Abu Dhabi, and I am expecting to go along also. In ® that case you and I will return from Abu Dhabi to Sharjah by car, and I will ask F r. Lermitte to lend me his car so that we shall have two cars with us in case of breakdown. I understand it takes about 4^ hours from Abu Dhabi to Sharjah and we shall be able to get back to Sharjah on the 28th evening. I shall then want to see the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 1st March. 3. I assume you have warned the Shaikhs 6f Dubai and Abu Dhabi that the Political Resident is coming by sloop and will expect to see them.4« I will send you a telegram confirming my arrange ments before Saturday.

I enclose herewith notes on my recent visits to Dohah, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. 2. At Umm al Qaiwain and Ajman I had no particular business to discuss, and have not therefore recorded notes. 3. At Sharjah I did no business - at any rate with the Shaikh of Sharjah - beyond taking over the prisoner Khammis (vide Slave Case of Nakhuda Ja Mohammad of Sohar - your Express letter No. 973-6/198 dated the 28th May 1938). He is being brought by sloop to Bahrain, where I hope tobe able to break down his reticence. 4. My ibrther discussions at Sharjah with the Shaikh of Dubai in regard to the Air Agreement are reported sepa rately. 6. I did not visit Has al Khahnah, but am submitting a separate report. 1 was also unable to go to Kalba as in- k tended owing to my premature return to Bahrain. I wrote a letter of regret - and careful encouragement - to Shaikh 0 ' 1 #' V'' Khalid and asked the Senior Naval Officer to deliver it to him on arrival at kalba. Political Agent, Bahrain, / i •JjNote on Visit to Donah.. Jnsrf if i ST Having had to wait for the Bushire mail, we arrived off ^ohah in the early afternoon/when visibility was extremely poor. The approach to the 'harbour' is bad and the solitary beacon is now only a few feet above water level. Consequently we did not anchor till nearly 4. p.m. a boat was immediately sent to stop the Shaikh coming off and I went ashore soon afterwards. The old Shaikh is looking rather frail and ill ana I doubt if he will last much longer. He is incapable ol controlling his appetites and he is steadily growing weaker. The following subjects were discussed:- ii. Customs exemption for K.A.F.fuel. I thankeu him &lt;rtt.itably for agreeing to this. 3. Purchase ol e.rms. I told him Abdul Aziz al Liana 1 was still in Bahrain awaiting quotations from England. I explained that the delay was probably due to re-armament 1 ? m Englana. He expressea gratituae for the assistance given. Q. i^atar Order-in-Comical. He said he had received my letter m regard to transfer or division ol jurisdict ion and was replying to confirm it. He reverted to his old plea for a guarantee that other Moslem powers (i.e., Saudi Arabia) would raise no objection to his exercising jurisdiction over their subjects when in Oatar. I repeated my previous reply that he need have no anxiety on that score provided he dealt justly and fairly with such people ana adhered strictly to tne mam principles of Mohammedan Law. 3. Hawar Islands. I questioned him closely in regard to his claim. He statea he had no further proof to offer beyond the statements made m his petitions of claim. He thought he shoula receive a copy of tne«s% Bahrain G-overninent T s statement oi claim ,f in order to rebut their evidence’’* To this I replied it was tor His LIajesty T s Government to assess the value ot* the evidence offered by both sides* If each was to be allowed to examine and criticise every statement made by the other - claim, counter-claim, rebuttal, answer to rebuttal, answer to answer to rebuttal and so on ad infinitum, the matter would never be settled. I impressed on him the need for controlling his subjects while the case was under examination by His majesty’s Government. I told him I naa heard rumours (which I said I did not believe; that his son, Shaikh Hamad, was contemplating^armed descent on the Islands. He and Shaikh Hamad, of course, denied this, but as there will certainly be no disturbance unless it is organised by ohaikii or his sons, the mention of this rumour should have the result of preventing ’’accidents’’* He asked that the Bahrain Government should be prevented from occupying the Islands until the decision ot the case, i saiu I could offer no hope of this, as the Bahrain Government was actually in possession at present, and the status quo would be maintained until a decision was reached. I told him he should arrange to reconstruct the beacon outside the harbour; and I will write to him about this after the pearling season. Various other matters of less importance were discussed, and I left the shore just after dusk. L, 30/5/38. !HNote on a Visit to Abu Dhabi. We arrived off Abu Dbabi at about 1 p.m# on the 31st May 1936. We haa passed very few pearling dhows, but the weather was rough and we found considerable numbers anchored off the shore behind the reef at Abu Dhabi. Many of them were Dubai and Sharjah dhows and there were even some Shihuh boats. The Shaikh did not leave the shore for nearly 40 minutes after we had anchored. This may not have been altogether his fault as we saw his car apparently stuck in the sand near his Fort. He was accompanied by his brothers Zayid and Hazza T , by Ahmad bin Khalaf and one or two others He was affable and smiled frequently and answered a long string of questions from me about the pearling fleet without exhibiting impatience. He stayed on board for well over one hour. He took ashore with him the Air Liaison Officer, who wanted to see the aerodrome and petrol store^ and was mostly friendly towards him. I went ashore with the Senior Naval Officer at 5 p.m. The Shaikh met us on the beach ana took us to his guest house, where tT Uncle Khalifah r! was waiting. After considerable polite conversation, some talk about Baraimi and further enquiries about the pearling fleet, I raised the question of slave-trading. I reminded him of the conversation on the Political Hesiaent f s last visit, and spoke of the withdrawal of the good offices of His Majesty T s Government; ana I asked what he was doing to stop this traffic. He claimed to have made extensive enquiries but to have found no trace of it in his territory. I said I had information from various directions that it was going on, and he really must get to grips with it. He then said that if I gave him the name of anyone in Abu Dhabi who was trading in slaves to Nejd and Eassa he would deal with him to my satisfaction. He claimed to- 2 - 5V 1 U /tij T ^ ' be anxious to serve tne Britisii Government ana to abide faithfully by his Engagements. I contented myself with remarking that one proved one T s loyalty and friendship by deeds, not by words, and I did not think his actions demonstrated any particular sincerity on his part. Apart from anything else, his point-blank refusal to the Political Resident to arrange to take a party to Baraimi seemed to me to indicate hostility rather than friendship. He replied that it was not an easy matter to arrange with the 'Arabs', though he indicated that of course such difficulties Could be surmounted if one haa time. His whole attitude was unexpectedly conciliatory. When I showed signs of leaving he raised two matters. Tne first was that the Liwa people had reported that some Europeans or Americans with Saudi guards had come almost up to Liwa in three cars this April. They had been stopped by sand but the Arab guard had said they would be coming again in 'cars that run on sand'. I am not quite sure ot the position of Liwa and will enquire from the Residency Agent. If, as I think, it is quite definitely in Abu Dhabi territory, I will take the matter up with Mr.Thornberg, whom I have already asked to control the California Arabia Standard Oil Company*s geologists more effectively. The second matter was a long complaint that Bin Jiluwi(Amir of Hassa) haa been sending men to collect Zakat from Beni Yas bedouins of Liwa. He said he had written to Ibn Jiluwi to complain and asked if he haa done right. I said no; he should have written to me, as his relations with Foreign Powers were controlled by His Majesty’s Government. I asked him to put his complaint in writing in full and to send it to me at Sharjah. I then took some photographs and we departed. Meanwhile both the Air Liaison Officer and the Shipps Interpreter had been making enquiries on the beach under3 0 my instructions in regard to the pearling fleet. Doubtless this will be reported to&gt; the Shaikh. I had anticipated an uncomfortable visit and was pleasantly surprised by Shaikh Shakhbut ! s attitude. The Senior Naval Officer was equally impressed. We observed that the Shaikhs Fort is well separated from other buildings and offers an excellent mark(or perhaps the word might be target). 3/6/38Note on a Visit to Dubai We arrived oft Dubai at 11.30 a.m. on the 1st June 1938. The Shaikh came aboard soon after with his son Rashid and two or three othefs. Shaikh Juma T was ill, and there have been family quarrels which account for the paucity of his retinue. Discussion was on general subjects and the shaikh had little news. As usual there were moans about the state of the pearl market. I informed him that on my return visit I should want to discuss the renewal ot tne Civil Air Agreement. He went ashore after about an hour. The early afternoon was spent in discussions with the Residency Agent and I went ashore with the Senior Naval Officer at b p.m. We took the Ship’s Surgeon to administer to Muhammad bin Dalmuk and others. After coffee and sweet-meats I opened the conversation about the Civil Air Agreement. I reierred to the final article in the present Agreement (which provides for renewal) and reminded the Shaikh it had been inserted at his request. I explained the additional facilities that would be required, and remarked that there had already been some discussions about the additional rent which the Shaikh wanted for them. I asked him what rent he would want for a b year Agreement. The Shaikh hesitated to name a figure and asked me to suggest one. I said that very similar (building) facilities had been obtained at Bahrain for a nominal rent oi Es.2b/- per annum, but I thought that in the circumstances of Dubai a monthly figure of Rs. 650/- would be fair, to include guards and everything except landing fees. The Shaikh then said that, as he had previously informed me, his family were very averse to the renewal of the Agreement, and they also thought his previous demand of Rs# 1000/- amonth rent in addition to guards 1 pay was far too low a figure. In regard to the former point I said I could not take the reported views of the iamily very seriously, anc after all he was the Shaikh and I knew he himself realised the advantages of the Air Agreement. The Shaikh protested mildly but the point was not pursued, everyone being far more interested in the rent tigure. The ShaiKh could not be persuaded to name his figure, as he said he must consult his family and many of them were away or sick. (The fact is, there has been a nasty row over running taxis to Sharjan, in which Shaikh Rashid has made a fool of himself). I said it was exactly to avoid delay oi this sort that I had sent an advance message saying I hoped to see his Notables with him, but I was coming to Sharjah in a few days and wanted his answer then. He asked for 10 days which I refused and he finally undertook to have a reply ready by Sunday, the 5th June. After some further conversation, including informing the Shaikh that immediate arrangements were being made to shift the aviation petrol from the godown in the Town, the visit terminated. I propose to discuss postal matters after we have settled the Air Agreement. 4/3/38Confidential D.O. Wo.

I stayed in the P*C*L* camp at Jebel Dukhan and found them all very cheerful. They have built a ver pleasant small camp and have nine or ten people there who seem to get on very well together and also with the ^atar coolies. They are down to 2050 ft. and are setting casing to that depth this week. Afterwards they start drilling again into what may be the first oil horizon. There has been a little gas showing but it is still too soon to say whether there is more than a 50 - 50 chance of oil. Relations beLween the Compan:^ and the Shaikh ere now excellent, after a little difficulty in the late summer which Packer succeeded in putting right* 3. I went across to see the Shaikh in Rayan and found him in excellent health and very cheerful. He was extremely affable and compliments flew about in all directions. I handed him a translation of the Bahrain counter-claim to the Hawar Islands Cf. my Express letter Ho.

He complained that the Bahrain Shaikhs are his rejoinder as soon as he very hostile towards him and are trying to seduce some of his Bedu from him. As a natter of fact I believe there is some thing in this as one of the Haim leaders named f'ansur, who is in charge of the guard at the Oil Camp, has been in correspond ence with Shaikh Abdullah bin ’Isa and will probably come across &gt; to/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B*E*, Political Resident in the Persian Sulf, Bushire.- 2 - to Bahrain with his followers before very long. The fact is that although most people in Tatar quite like the old Shaikh they cannot bear Shaikh Hamad, his son, or Saleh al Mana*, both of whom try to loot them. However I said to the old Shaikh that T did not see that he h^d anything to worry about provided he kept his Bedu happy. This was a gentle hint not to hang on to all the oil money himself, as he has done hitherto, 4. The Shaikh raised the qu-s^tion of his armoured cars, Cf. correspondence resting with your 5 and I told him that the Printed letter No. C/737 dated the 3 7th October 1938. / r* ® matter was under considera tion and that I hoped to fly across his territory shortly with some experts who would be able to advise whether armoured cars m m - C ' - . fl, would be of any use or not. This I should be doing tomorrow | ^ &gt;v‘ with Price. The Shaikh mentioned the point that though His Majesty^ Government had undertaken to give him protection against outside aggression by means of the loyal Air Force, still they do expect him to co-operate; and he felt quite sure that he could co-operate best by having armoured or armed cars. He was not very much in favour of the Kuwait type, though I pointed out to him that really heavy armoured vehicles would never be able to get round his country. 5. He protested against the continuance of the Bahrain boycott, and I must say that I sympathise with him. When we have finished here with oil concessions and 'reforms' I hope to try to induce the Shaikhs to resume normal relations with Qatar.

I have given orders that the Residency Agent is to ask for a refund as he had no right to paythebill on my behalf without consulting me, nor had Imperial Airways any right to send the bill to him when it was just as easy for them to send it to me direct. 2. This is the first time that the Political Agent, so far a. I am aware, has ever been billed at the 30 sh. a day rate by Sharjah. I think it ia aa well that they should understand immediately there that the Political Agent does not intend to pay luxury hotel rates for accommodation and food in the Sharjah Rest House, especially when he goes there mainly for the purnose of serving the interests of Imperial Airways. I always have been and am perfectly willing to pay ordinary mess rates for the food that I consume there, just as I pay for my drinks. But if I am going to be charged these quite ludicrous rates then I shall have to take up the ^ matter officially with a view to recovering from Imnerial ■ fir Airways the cost of all services performed by on Uieir behalf^and I think that Imperial Air that this will put them well down on the debi I hope that'you will mention this to the Stat the matter will not ha e to go any f have hitherto managed very well on a reasonab basis.

The Eesi ,ency Agent paid this very unwisely and I have instructed him to demand a refund since of course personal bills for me should be sent to me direct. 2. This is the first time since T have been here, and I believe the first time in history, that the Political Agent Bahrain has been billed in this way by Imperial Airways at Sharjah; end I do not propose to pay. I have always been and am prepared to pay for messing at the Sharjah messing rates for any food that I consume there, just as I have always paid for my drinks. But I refuse absolutely to pay luxury hotel rates for the fifth rate accommodation which one gets there. And incidentally the acceptance of a bill at 30 sh. a day for any tour to Sharjah means 100 % loss on daily allowance, and I see no reason why I should accept this for myself or my successor* 3. It is tc be remembered that this journey, like 70 % of the Political Agent* s visits to Sharjah, was made in the interests of Imperial Airways themselves. I have never quite been able to understand why we have t6 pay full rates for air passages to and from Sharjah when, as I have said, our main objective is very often the maintenance of the air route* This however is a principle which seems to have been accepted in the past and it is not for me to say whether the question should be taken up for the future.

G* Prior, C.I.E., Political Resilent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire .absurd penal rate for staying in the extremely uncomfortable p v est House at Sharjah, then v/e ought to consider why we should not recover from Imperial Airways the cost of all services performed on their behalf. For instance we spent quite a lot of money in telegrams recently when their Hannibal disappeared in the sea and we shall have to pay Howes his travelling allowance for journeys performed in the course of the search. 4. Howes has spoken to the Station Superintendent at Sharjah about this bill and was given the reply that the charges were made ,f in accordance with their handbook'*• I propose unless you see any objection to raise the matter with the Area Manager, Baghdad, and to request that definite arrangements be made in future that the 'Political Agent when on visits to Sharjah should be charged no more than local messing rates.

C/350-12/15 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 23rd April 1940 To /“N The Area Manager, British Overseas Airways Corporation, BAGHDAD Dear Sir, I think it would be advantageous if some agreement could now be reached about the charges to be made against the Political Agent, Bahrain, or his Assistant^ when cir cumstances compel them to visit Sharjah and to stay at the Fort there. 2* It will, I think, be acknowledged that this Agency performs a number of services on behalf of the British Overseas Airways Corporation for which no charge is made. And as you are probably aware the majority of the Political Agent’s Malts at Sharjah are for the purpose of making such arrangements as he can to prevent or minimise interference with the air route. In such circumstances it seems scarcely reasonable that he (or his Assistant^) should be charged rates equivalent to those which one may expect to pay in a luxury hotel in Europe. 3. During his visits to Sharjah the Political Agent of course pays for any drinks which he may have there. I suggest that he should pay similarly at local Mess rates for the food which he may consume and that the balance of the very heavy charges for accoramodation should be waived.

Dear Sir, Thank you of 23i*d April. for your letter C/350-1 3 / 1 5 2) I am Just as anxious as you are to arrive at a clear understanding with regard to this ques tion of your occasional accommodation at Sharjah, and the resultant charge. 3) The Political Agent when at Sharjah is invoiced for messing and accommodation at the same rate as are members of the Royal Air Force. This is done principally as a result of my understanding of the position that His Majesty 1 s Government in both cases foots the bill. 4) I may be quite wrong in my assumption and if so you will of course put me right, but as the Corporation’s operations and aircraft now come directly under Air Ministry control, it has been felt that intervention by the Political Agent on the Corporation’s behalf at Sharjah and Dubai, is primarily in the interests of the maintenance of Imperial Communications and as such, a direct ser vice to the British Government. In the circumstances, charges arising out of the Political Agents accom modation at Sharjah on such occasions have been treated as recoverable from the Government at the agreed rate. 3) I am perfectly willing and in fact most an xious to meet your requirements. My feeling is that the Political Agent or his Assistant if performing duties at Sharjah solely in the Corporation’s in terests should be treated as the Corporation’s guests.BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION.

Dear Sir Thank you for your letter No.C/411 - 12/15 of the 13th May, and I have now had a further opportunity of in vestigating the question of accornmodation for you and your Assistant at Sharjah. It was suggested by you that staff rates for accom modation and messing should be extended to you, but in view of the fact that such rates are not applied to the R.A. F. or to various members of the Rafidain Oil Company resident at Sharjah and performing duties solely in the interest of the Corporation, it would seem inadvisable and unfair to make an allowance of this description in your case. It is suggested, hov/ever, for your consideration that in future accommodation for yourself and your Assistant should be provided free of charge at Sharjah and that messing only at the following rates should be charged: These rates I am sure you will appreciate represent a very considerable reduction on the standard rates of charge and I should be most grateful if you would be good enough to let me have your frank comments.

I am assuming that you propose to leave Sitra about 7 a.m. on Sunday, the 23rd, and will be returning to Sitra at 6 p.m. approximately on Monday. It is advisable, though not essential, to get back to Sitra before dark. This means leaving Zekhrit not later than 1 p.m. If you left Doha on Monday morning by 8.30 you should have plenty of time to have an early lunch in Dukhan before leaving. If you are short of time you can have your lunch put on the boat. In this case, perhaps you will be good enough to inform Dickson on Sunday before leaving for Doha. Dr. Storm is postponing his visit for a few days and will not be at Doha during your visit. Yo Enel. Major R. G.

Dfited the 16th December 1941- This is just to let you know that I visited Trucial Oman (3harjah) by air on the 28th November and left the same evening by hired launch for Khor Fakkan. Felly and Abdur Razzaq were with me. 2. During the next afternoon (29th) we stopped at Dibah for about an hour and went ashore. The beach here is about 6 miles long, between the mountain spurs running down to the sea and there are a number of villages along the foreshore. On the north is the village of BaiUh which belongs to the Shihuh (Muscat subjects), in the centre is Dibah (named 'Hian' owing to its fort) this is inhabited by (awasim, foll owers of Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalbaj on the south again are a string of poor habitations belonging to Sharcjiyin followers of Fujairah. Behind the whole are pleasant date groves and the people seem to divide their attention between fishing and agriculture. %ell water is plentiful and of good quality and seeps down the ' adi Faiyah from the high mountains behind. On the northern edge of Dibah (Hisn) stands the tower ft erected by the Qawasim to discourage agressions by their neighbours, the &gt;hihuh. This tower has been a bone of contention ever since it was begun and forma one of the subjects for discussion between Shaikh Khalid and the Sultan of Muscat. The population of Dibah is estimated at 6 - 7 The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel hundred /- &lt; •. R • Hay, C«X. F., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, K Bushire.- 2 - hundred all told and that of Bai*ah considerably more. 3. Passing on from Dibah we reached Khor Fakkan late at night (29th), after about 24 hours run from Sharjah. Khor Fakkan is a wide, pleasant bay and appears to be partly sheltered from the monsoon swells which make loading and un loading on this coast difficult in summer. The people are followers of Shaikh Khalid who keeps a Wall there. There are a number of date gardens and well water appears plentiful. 4. At 6 a.m. (30th) we embarked in Shaikh Humaid 1 s (Khalid* s nephew) car and drove to Kalba which we reached about 7.15 a.m. The road, about 35 miles, after surmounting the 'Aqaba’', a small pass leading over the hills out of Khor Fakkan, proceeds for a few miles over stony ground covered with M samr' (mimosa) trees until it emerges from the hills onto the beginning of the Batinah coastal plain along which it proceeds, sometimes across salt flats (sabkha) and some times past date gardens and villages. Kalba, or Ghallah, is a small seaside village of 400 - 500 inhabitants who exist partly on cultivation and partly on fishing. The fish is exported to Muscat. 5. The Minor Shaikh of Kalba, Hamad bin Said, is aged about 10 years, he is obviously negroid (rather common on this coast) and looked quite a likeable lad. He is treated with scant ceremony by Shaikhs Khalid and Humaid and the latter's manner suggested that he might entertain visions of himself becoming Shaikh. Indeed, it would be surprising if he did not, seeing that Kalba carries with it a substantial income from Zakat, Customs, landing ground subsidy, Shaikh's gardens and oil payments. 6. After breakfast with Shaikhs Khalid and Humaid, in a room so filled with flies that it was with some difficulty that /-that we were able to eat, we passed on to Fujairah a few minutes run to the north. Here we found the Shaikh, Mohammad bin Hamad, a young man aged about 26 years, av/aiting us outside his fort, which is situated amo^ng the date groves some 2 miles from the sea. After the usual ceremo nies were over, I had a private talk with the Shaikh in the presence of Felly and Abdur Rezzaq. I detailed the recent outrages committed by Mir Barkat, culminating in the attack on the Shaikh of Kuwait* s r, Sd Dhow” and explained that the British Government were determined to stamp out this gang, who were known to be working from Fujairah territory, and that his co-operation in this was expected. The Shaikh was quite frank and said that Mir Barkat had been living there but was now in Persia with his gang; his women folk were still in Fujairah, near the fort. He said that there were many Baluchis living on the Batinah and that some of them were bad characters and had been troubling the Arabs recently. He had heard of and regretted the attacks on the Has al Khaimah boats. He asserted that he would try and arrest Mir Barkat and any of his gang if they returned for the women and in any case he would prevent them living in his territory again. 7. I think this is all that can be expected of a compa ratively minor Shaikh in the circumstances. There are large numbers of Baluchis settled on this coast and some of them are bad characters and carry arms. Arabs as a rule do not care to come into conflict with them if it can be avoided. I enquired whether the gang had left any dhows behind but the Shaikh said there was only one which was unseav/orthy and broken. Possibly this was true as the gang would naturally have taken away their best boat. There /■I 4 There is no doubt that the Shaikh profited by the presence of the gang, who, it is reported, combined slave running with their other activities? but as they have now incurred the displeasure both of the Rritish authorities and of the Arab Rulers in the Gulf, he appears anxious to be rid of them* 8. Shaikh Mohammad binrHaraad appears moderately intelli- gei t and energetic, he is pleasant to talk to and seems anxious to please the British, I think that if a sloop now visits Fujairah with Howes as projected, the impression already made on the Shaikh will be strengthened* I instructed Felly to revisit the Shaikh after a suitable interval to make sure that i ir Barkat and his gang really have been turned out* 9* After this we returned to Khor Fakkan and weighed anchor at 10 a*m* (30th), on the 1st December we reached Umm al ' aiwain and completed the rest of the way to Sharjah in the Shaikh* s car* 10* On the 2nd December we left for /bu Dhabi by car at 6 a.m., reaching there at 10.30 a.m. after an easy, if rather cold journey. The only difficulty is the M maqta' rt or ford across the creek some 9 miles from the town which can only be crossed at low tide. The Shaikh (Shakhbut) is a youngish man with an open appearance and pleasant, friendly manner. He is held in much respect. We returned in the evening to Sharjah which we reached about 9 p.m. Yours sincerely, L ♦C02IFIDEITTIAL • I aiD moat grateful for this interesting repoit on your tour and hope your successor may be able to arrange something on the same lines for me -- I visit the Trucial Coast from Bahrain in March*D.O.

There is practically noth ing to do in Abu Dhabi town and exceedingly little to see. For that reason I have not included a halt ohere. (b) Ajnan and T Jin al Qaiwain are on Hie way to Ras al KJiaimah. E Ajman is of very little importance and its ghaikli of no influence out- S side his tov/n. The Shaikh of Urn al Qaiwain is of more importance but the visit mo him proposed, is, I think, adequate. (c) If possible it would be well to bring a shot-gun and cartridge es as the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah will probhbly offer some sand grouse shooting. (d} The visit to Kalba by aeroplane was a thought after I left Bahrain. I spoke to S^adr#n-Leader^fewall, the Officer Commanding the R.A.F.Detacliment here, and he says that he will be very pleased to fly B us to Kalba during your tour here. His machines as Vincent bi-planes and he would take two or three of them on the trip. 2. If you approve of this programme I should be grateful if you would send me a signal to that effect.

During the last three months I have been unable to obtain any confinaation of the suspicion that the present bin Jilnwi is not trusted by Ibn Saud. It is generally recognised that the famous Abdullah bin Jiluwi, during the latter years of his life, was not trusted by Ibn Saud and was fortunate to have been able to retain his high office. But no one from whom I have made inquiries has heard of any lack of warmth or trust in Ibn Saud 1 s relations with Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi. My latest informant, Dr. Harrison, who recently returned from a visit to Haaa, tells me that he has reason to believe that the present bin Jiluwi is on excellent terms with Ibn Saud, and is given his full confidence. Dr. Harrison believed that Ibn Baud*s ministers were, for this very reason, jealous of bin liv i and he added that, if there were suspicions of bin Jiluwi in Riyadh, they were entertained by the King*a ministers rather than by the King.

(Not to be trlegTaptod) 7‘feVisit to Khobar I left Bahrain in the CA3CC launch at 1.45 p.m. on 9th March and arrived at A1 Khobar four hours later. 1 was met at the pier by Mr. Ohliger (Resident Manager, CASOC), Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl (Ibn Saud's Personal Representative i with CASOCjWho is also acting as Saudi Trade Agent in Bahrain) and Shaikh Mohammad bin Mathi, Amir of Al Khobar. Before motoring out with Mr. Ohliger to the CASOC Camp at Dhahran 8 miles away I spent half an hour taking coffee with the Amir of Al Khobar in his house. The house is a ramshackle building, dirty and ill-kept, it is approach ed by a narrow and unsavoury passage at the entrance to which a small guard of honour, composed of police dressed in military clothes, was drawn up^. ^ . 2. on the morning of March 10th 1 motored with Mr. f chiller to las Tanura, 60 miles away. We took the inland road which is, on the whole, in good condition. For much of the way the road runs beside the pipeline connecting the Company's oil field at Dhahran with the refinery at Has Tanura. Opposite Tarut Island the road crosses one of the Bahrain. 3. The refinery at Has Tanura is a small one with a maximum throughput of only 3000 to 3500 barrels per day. So small a unit is not economic and Mr. Ohliger told me, in response to my enc^iiries on this subject, that it had only been erected by the Company in order to comply with the con ditions of their Concession. The refinery is not at present being operated though a stock of kerosene (brought over by barge from Bahrain) is kept in one of the storage tahks for supply to the Saudi Government when required. Near the refinery is a large collection of barasti huts — a labour camp which is at present unoccupied. The Company's installs- ‘ tions at Has Tanura are looked after by two American emcirgcwpy land / &lt;V&lt;4t grounds which the yil Compa ny preparedemployees whose sole duty Is to see that the plant and installations are kept in good repair. 4. The M.E.S.C. propose to use Has Tanura as a port of entry for foodstuffs supplied by them to the Saudi Government for consumption in East Saudi Arabia. I was anxious to see, therefore, what facilities existed at Has Tanura for the handling of imports. The sea approach is good. There is an anchorage off the eastern point of Has Tanura, close to shore, suitable for freighters or tankers y and cargoes would have to be carried less than a mile by lighters to a sheltered jetty west the point of Has Tanura. This jetty, which is equipped with a crane, belongs^ to the Oil Company but they would, it is understood, have no objection to its use by the Saudi Government. It % seems to me that the main difficulty in using Has Tanura now as a port of supply would be the lack of adequate storage. There is only one godown (an extension of a Turkish building now used as a customs house) approximately V ’ , 90 ft. long by 60 ft. broad. This did not appear to be in good repair. Unless the Saudi Government are able to arrange immediate transportation*^- inla nd by l orries or to coastal towns by country craft --^for imports as they^jr*'^ — va foodstuffs in excess of what can be accommodated in the single godown will have to be stacked in the open^ with the danger - indeed the certainty - of rapid deterioration. 5. Prom Has Tanura I motored to Qatif where I was entertained to tea by Shaikh^Mashari, Amir of Qatif and brother of the Amir of A1 Khobar. For some miles before entering Oatif the road from the north runs through iLicJc [ date gardens watered mainly from natural springs. The town of Qatif comprises a collection of the most dilapidated stone and mortar buildings that I have ever seen. There were, however, signs of activity in two directions. The road leading into Qatif from the north was being systematically widened even though this involved cutting- 3 - © down a number of date palms; and there was a lot of movement and bustle at the port,where boats were being c _ loaded with lucerne for Bahrain and salug (dates boiled when immature) and dibs (date juicej/. (I was told that the embargo on the export of dates from Oatif did not apply ( ) c ' to salug and dibs). 6. The Amir of A1 Khobar was present -wh4^_e his brother, ftijL. Z£r the Amir of Qatif, waa antertia-ining tea. In accordance with a suggestion which I had previously made to Mr. Chliger the conversation was directed by him to the subject of food- supplies. The Amirs of A1 Khobar and Oatif, who are reported to have made large fortunes during the last six months by the part they have taken in manipufiting food prices, displayed no embarrassment in discussing the subject. They^stated [ucslL that they have recently been instructed by ibn Saud to make a census of stocks of food and that there were, apart/^bom Government stocks, 8000 bags of rice in Oatif and 15000 bags in Hofuf. They also stated that they had received orders the previous day that the selling price of rice and dates was to be controlled. Maximum selling prices were to be as follows: Calcutta Bice Karachi nice Dates Rs 39/- per bag; Rs 33/- per bag; Rs 3/- per basket. If merchants claimed that their stocks of rice had cost more than the selling price now fixed the Saudi Government would, on production of the merchants’ invoices, take over their stocks at the cost price and would placfc them on the market at the new controlled price. 7. In the course of conversation «any references were made to the failure of this year's crop of wheat sown with faJ- Canadian wheat^. It will be recalled that 3000 bags of Canadian wheat were lent to the Saudi Government by the Shaikh of Bahrain in October 1942 when, we were told, there was no grain in Eastern Saudi Arabia and the people were dying of starvation. Apparently the Canadian wheat intended for immediate consumption in Saudi Arabia was used as seed- 4 - graln^wi^h tinfei'timQtg'Tegtilta as the crop expected from it has been a complete failure• 8. From Qatif v/e returned to Dhahran via Dammam. Along the road south of Qatif very large areas of land are being developed. 1 saw enclosures, many acres in extent, which were said to belong to Najib Saleh (Ibn Baud’s Minister of Mines and t Public Works), Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl and Saleh Islam (Shaikh AlfguJ^ah al fadhl* s assistant). New wells have been bored and 4500 new date palms were, I was informed, to be planted this season. 9. In the evening I attended a dinner given for me at his house in Dammam by Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl. The house is a very handsome one, A well-kept and clean, with electric installed. The food provided was, of course, on a lavish scale^and far exceeded in quantity and variety anything that I have experienced in Bahrain. 10. On the morning of March 11th I was shown round the Oil Company’s Camp and was impressed by the enterprise shown in its organisation. The well stocked commissary and the home-made poultry incubators in an air-conditioned house were of particular interest. 11. Later in the morning I attended a midday dinner given for me by the Amir of Al Khobar. The number of guests was small - not more than a dozen - but the food provided included six sheep roasted whole and more than 250 side dishes (including fried locusts). At this feast I was accompanied by Mr. Bertram Thomas and, at its con clusion, we were both presented by the Amir with swords of honour. 12. I said good-bye to the Amir of Al Khobar at his house and to Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl and Mur. Ohliger at the jetty which I left at 3 p.m. en route for Bahrain. 13. I was given a very friendly welcome by the Saudi CCu. authorities at Al Khobar, Qatif and Dammam, of whom I was meeting for the first time. % visit to the mainlandi &gt; also enabled me to discuss on the spot with Mr* Chliger a number of problems about personnel which had been troubling him.- 4 - grain^wlfch unfortunate rt'sul'ts as the crop expected from it has been a complete failure. 8.

I hope you will not feel that we are malcing difficulties if I go into the position regarding the 'Ghazal' in some detail. 2. As you know, we do not enjoy any 'priorities” in respect of our operations in the Persian Gulf and it is very difficult, if not impossible, for us to replace any of our equipment or to obtain spares of any kind. Our Managing Director takes the view that, in the present circumstances and until some time after the war, any equipment we possess is invaluable in that it is irreplaceable. This applies very much to our launch 'Ghazal' as, should anything happen to her, the Company would be unable to get another launch. Lack of spares also might easily put her out of action indefinitely. 3. In these circumstances, you will realise that we should not be prepared to take the risk of losing the launch on any ordinary hire proposition. 4. We understand your difficulties, however, in that other suitable launches are not procurable in these days, and, if you are prepared to accept the loan of the launch, we should feel that the Company would be repaying to some extent the assistance and many courtesies experienced from the Agency. 5. If you decide to use the 'Ghazal', we should like to bring the following points to your notice (a) Mr. Dickson regards the engine as not sufficiently reli able for a trip involving continuous use of the engine over five hours.

DO/Q. 14-2/2120 6tii June, 1944. Dear Major Hickinbotham, LAUNCH 'GHAZAL' Reference your note dated the 6th June 1944. The present situation regarding the 'Ghazal' is that she is being prepared to take Lermitte to Ajman. He proposes to live on the boat while the discussions with the Shaikh are proceeding. The preparations include adjusting thS 1 radio tele phone to comply with the Navy’s new instructions, scraping and re-painting her bottom and swinging the compassAwith the aid of the Navy. So far, only the radio has been attended to. The scraping and painting depends .on good weather to some extent, but Lermitte hopes to be able to leave in a few days t time. There are circumstances which make it desirable to complete the Ajman negotiations as soon as possible, and if your visit is not of an urgent nature, it would suit us best if you could see your way to postpone your trip until Lermitte returns.
