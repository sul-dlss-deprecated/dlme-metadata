Sir, I'anga Khan has completed his duty in Bahrain and le returning to India by the fast mail leaving Bahrain to-day, and should arrive in Karachi on the 28th December. 2. I enclose herewith a report on Havildar Manga Khan's work in Bahrain, recorded by Lieutenant H.D.H. Ranee of the Indian Political Service, who has been in general charge of the training of the Bahrain Police in the use of light machine guns. I wish to endorse the remarks made by Lieutenant Hance and to record my very high opinion of Havildar Manga Khan's work and character. He has had a difficult task in Bahrain and has dischai^ged it admirably. I should like also to add my personal thanks to you for deputing so very capable an instructor to aid us here in Bahrain. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.Report on Havlida Instructor Manga Khan. Havilda Manga Khan has now compj.eted his period of duty as V.B. Gu*t Instructor to the Bahrain Polif*^ force* During the three months he has been here his work has been excellent, and despite the language difficulty he has achieved very good results* A total of sixteen men have been trained in two batches, and of these eight have qualified as First Class Shots and five as Second Class: only three have failed to qualify. These are surprising satisfactory results for men who have never fired a light automatic before, and who have only fired the rifle up to ranges of 300 yards, I was present through all the firing on the Range but most of the Preliminary instruction was left entirely to Haviidar Manga Khan, and he did it exceedingly well* He is a first class Instructor and a very likeable person Into the bargain, and I hope that when he returns to his own unit promotion will not be long in coming to him.

As it stands at present the proposal is that a British Officer should be appointed as Gull Defence Officer, one of whose Quties will be the supervision and direction of a permanent force detailed in Bahrain to provide protection against sabotage for the Oil Field and Refinery. This force is to consist of 50 specially recruited Bahraini police, aided by 12 British personnel who are being recruited in London by the Oil Company. Tnese latter men will have no knowledge ol Arabic. Although the present proposals contemplate that the Defence Officer shall be Captain Byard, who has some knowledge of Arabic, it is apparent that his duties will not permit nm to devote his full time to the supervision and command of the ppecial police force. It follows that he must have a deputy who can be on whole /- g ^ (Designation) MFP —367 S&amp;P—(M- 508 )— 1 S- 7 . 36 — 10 , 0 C 0 .- 2 - t\ \ whole time duty and can aid not only in training the special police for their particular duty but also in what may be described as the 'care and maintenance' of this force* The Bahrain Government have no local officer who can be entrusted with this duty and since a knowledge of Arabic and of Arab mentality is a vital requisite it is necessary to look else where for such an officer* The Iraq Levies enjoy an excellent reputation and it is believed that it will be possible to obtain an officer from that Corps who has just retired or is approaching retirement age* The Bahrain Government would be prepared to meet the pay of such an officer and of course to meet all travelling expenses. Neither the Adviser nor I arable to suggest a rate of pay since we are unaware of the rates sanctioned for the Iraq Levies. It is however realised that it will probably be necessary to offer 25 per cent more &lt;5\ than the rate of pay sanctioned for th® Jamadar (or the equi valent) in the Levies. It is suggested that enquiries be made from Air Headquarters, Iraq, whether such an officer can be made available and if so on what scale of remuneration* 2. It might further be explained that the special police force of 50 men will be totally separate from the normal Bahrain police and will be located permanently in the Oil Field area. It is for this reason impossible for them to be included in the normal organisation of the Bahrain police. / Political Agent, Bahrain.1 CONFIDENTIAL .

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. ! ^ 12th February, 1940. Dear Handley, Would you please reDer to your letter of the 5th February, 1940, 3.566615/39/F2 in regard to rates of pay for the Indian Army Adjutant and H.0.0.Instructor to be employed primarily at Bahrein under the Persian Gulf Defence schemes. We have now seen correspondence between the political Resident and the Government of India in which the Government of India say that they have already called for volunteers, without stating any special terms, but have had only four applicants all of whom are unsuitable. It is, therefore, obviously necessary to offer terms which will be a sufficient attraction to Indian Army officers to persuade them to put up with conditions in the Gulf, with separation from their families, and with the extra expenditure involved in maintaining two establishments. The terms which you suggest in your letter for trie Adjutant seem to us quite inadequate to achieve this object. On the lov/est rate of pay for a married Indian Army Major these show a loss of about £10 per annum as compared with Indian Army pay, inclusive of separation allowance and additional pay as an Adjutant under Indian rules and taking into account that single rates of lodging allowance would be withheld under Indian rules if free quarters were provided. I enclose a statement showing how these rates are made up. We appreciate tnat your proposal is based on a comparison, which you are naturally bound to make, with the Air Liaison Officer in Bahrein who is a Squadron Leader, but we should like to point out that, as we understand it, the Air Force officer is/ E.W.Handley, Esq., Air Ministry, (Dept. QJ), Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2.2 {,&lt;*&amp;**) fiu is posted to Bahrein as part of his normal duty, v/horcas an Indian Army officer can only ho ashed to serve there voluntarily. This fact in itself justifies the grant of considerably hotter terms to the Indian Army officer, and it is surely v/ell recognised that an Indian Army officer receives a higher rate of pay than officers of the British Service in respect of his continuous service in the East. If you see objection to the Government of India’s proposal as it stands it seems to us that it would be much better to give Indian Army rates of pay plus an allowance of about £250 per annum which will produce a result similar to the Government of India’s proposals. Unless this is dono we are very doubtful whether a suitable volunteer will be forthcoming. On receipt of your reply we will put to India the proposed rate for the Instructor.

Instructor to be employed primarily at Bahrein under the Persian &gt;ulf defence We, therefore, euggeot that, provided the Indian rmy officer is of the rank of Major and married, he should receive £1,156 per annum as shewn above together with India allowance of £125 pgr ; nnun. In addition the ur would be entitled to free accommodation and water or appropriate allowances in lieu. AS regards the 2U$# . Instructor, we unde rid that^ Ceylon Defence instructor receives 15/5^d. a day out o which he has to rrovidu hi own ’uarters. e think, tuerefore, that oatisfactory terms would be ay at 15/5id. a dry together with the provision of free quarters or an appropriate allowance in lieu. The addition o~ free quarters or an appropriate allowance seems to us to eliminate the need for the equivalent of a coast allowance-. In any case we understand fro n the ar Office that the la.tter allowance is inappropriate to Bahrein. We are afraid that we sho Id have to obtain Treasury approval of these terms but if they are acceptable to the Government of India we would Beck such approval as a master of urgency. If, as I gather, the N.C.O* Instructor is to be obtained from the British Axw in India, it is a sumed tiiat the Government of India will obtain the concent of t-e Tar ffice to his loan. schemes.

With reference to your 289/2/40 dated 12th March 1940, on the subject of the provision of a Levy officer for permanent duty in the Special Police Force which is now being recruited for the purpose of protecting the oil field and refinery in Bahrain against sabotage. 2. It is considered that a Levy officer would be most suitable for the appointment, and that an Arab Levy Officer should be selected rathan than an Assyrian. 3. The O.G. Iraq. Levies recommends an Arab Officer named * Zabit Mehadi Sad, who was enlisted in 1932 and promoted to Officer rank in 19 38. His present age is- 37 and he is now employed as Machine Gun Officer in his Company at Basrah. Besides being a good Machine Gun Instructor he is a good rifle shot and can read and write. He is due for re-engagement (one year at a time) on 15th Tune, 194C, and in the ordinary course of events would be re-engaged on this date. He can, hov/ever, be released from service at any time before 15th Tune ,194c. 4. It is suggested that, subject to this officer’s willingness to accept the appointment, he should be sent to Bahrain in the first instance for a period of one month’s probation so as to safeguard the interests of both the Bahrain Government and the individual. During this period of probation there is no objection to his being paid as a Levy Officer, ashe can be shown as being on 'temporary instruction duty'. Regarding the rates of pay, etc. it is suggested that a British levy Officer from the Iraq Levies should go to Bahrain during the early part of the probation period, where he can discuss details of pay, rations, married quarters, leave and bonus concessions on retirement. His present rate of pay is i.B. J.J..25C per mensem, plus rations and quarters. In addition he is entitled on retirement to a bonus of one month's pay foi every year's service* 5. It is presumed that the Bahrain Government v;ould he willing to pay Travelling Allowances for the ^rab Levy Officer during the probationary period if it is not found possible to send him by air* 6. it is not intended to approach this Arab Levy Officer until your reply is received. isgd.)

The Shaikhs were not attracted by the idea of employing an Iraqi in the Bahrain Police and at first suggested bringing back Abdul Karim from Nasik, but I suggested that it would be a pit/y to do this before he finishes his training. The man recommended in your letter sounds very suitable and we should like to employ him and to have him as soon as possible. The Bahrain Government is willing to pay travelling allowance for this Officer during pro bationary period, regarding air travel, I think there is so such urgency as to require him to come by air, which is expensive.

C/481-1.a/43 Dated the 12th June 1940. You will probably wish to have a brief account of my visit to Air Headquarters, Iraq In connection with the Defence Plan for Bahrain. 2. The first and mein problem had of course been settled the day before I left Bahrain by the offer of reasonable terms to Byard and by his acceptance of them. However 1 tool: the opportunity at Habbaniyah to Insist that the Air Ministry be requested to issue immediate telegraphic confirmation of Byard ’a appoi n tment with thft rsmc of • 3 . I found, as we had anticipated, that they knew nothing whatsoever at Headquarters about Volunteer Defence Forces. Sven Hose, the one Soldier on the staff, has had no experienc. . and it was at once apparent that the only thing to do was to sand Byard to India to meet the Adjutant of some (Infantry) Auxiliary Force there and find out exactly how such a show is ran. I thought also that it would ba a good thing for the N.C.O. to meet Byard in India end to help in ascertiining and recording information. Fence A.H.O's telegrar! T?o. A. 365 dated the 8th June. I hope that this procedure will enable Byard to obtain more information and more real insight into his Job than would six months of correspondence. 4. The next thing to do was to arrange about equipment. By this time A.H.Q. were quite pliable and did all that was necessary without even an argument l They are actually n ort of rifles and machine guns and we shall probably have to get them from India In due course, but meanwhile I can borrow from the Bahrain Government. .e Lieutenant Colonel 6 * C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident In the Persian Gulf, Bushire.8 /- p .vit /^N - 2 - 'ftK ¥&gt; I 5. I succeeded in making A.H.Q* understand that Byard would have dual functions in Bahrain, one to run the Volun teer Defence Force with the aid of the British N # C.O. and the other to conmand the standing anti-sabotage organisation here* I explained that the original Recommended Plan had been found not workable in practice and I think they now appreciate the position in Bahrain more fully* It was agreed too that Byard should work direct under A*H*Q* (i*e* there should be no effort to make the A.L*0. his Commanding Officer), but that all questions of policy and all questions having any political aspect, however remote, should be dis cussed with the Political Agent concerned (he deals with Kuwait also) and that Byard should then make his own report to A.H*Q* and send a copy to the Political Agent who would forward it with his views to you* 6* After a certain amount of difficulty due to the fact that the Iraq Levy Officer originally proposed for loan to Bahrain had refused the offer, we got hold of another young officer of an Amarah family whom I afterwards met in Basra and who looked to me to be a very good type* He is due to come down here by the next mailboat* 7* I then had a day, which subsequently became two days, to spare before the next eastbound plane and so went to Baghdad. There I talked to the American Minister about the possibility of enlisting Americans in the Volunteer Defence Force. He was enthusiastic, provided of course that they are not called on to take any oath of allegiance, and he advised me to ”go ahead” without any official reference being made, since an official reference would involve his addressing the State Department in Washington with consequent delays. I asked him what would happen if we had to deal with an American subject for breach of discipline and he said we need not worry about that, provided we did not actually shoot him i Ki 'V/ 7 3 - 8. Immediately the confirmation of Byard* s appointment comes through from the Air Ministry, I propose to inform everyone here that a Volunteer Defence Force will be enlisted directly Byard returns from India and that every European British subject is expected to join. I hope, too, that we shall get some Indian Volunteers for clerical and ambulance work. 3y the end of this month or very soon after that I hope we shall have a Force in being. Meanwhile recruitment for the 50 Special Police for the standing anti-sabotage protection of the Oil Field and Refinery has been undertaken at once, quarters for Byard, his N.C.O* and the Iraq Levy Officer are being fixed and a barasti camp is practically ready for the Police between the Refinery and Awali. Generally speaking we are at last getting a move on. Yours sincerely.So. C/486-1.a/43 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th June 1J40 To The Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain.
