Dated Bushire, the 14th February 1920. I submit herewith a copy of Memorandum No.48, dated 12th January 1920 from the Political Agent, Koweit, requesting that the allotment of Rs.4Q0/- for the maintenance of the Ras-al-Arz beacon may be raised to Rs,700/-. The proposal has my support and in the circums tances explained by Captain McCollum, I trust that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction it with effect from 1st January 1920.

Reference the allotment of Rs „400/- per a nr)'™ sanctioned in 1915 for the maintenance of the Ras-al- Arz beacon. The caretake^r of the beacon has up to the end of December 1919 been paid at rate of Rs,30/- per anx 1 mensem. He has been for a long time combining of being unable to live on this wage and has now intimated his intention to resign if he does not get sufficient to support himself and his family. I propose that he should get Rs *50/- per mensem. At the present time a bag of rice costs Ra .35/- and other necessaries are equally expensive. It is clear therefore that the wage of Rs.30/- is an absolutely absurd one at present day cost of living. Besides this the cost of oil has gone up considerably. I request therefore that sanction of the Govern ment of India may be obtained to raise the allotment to Rs.TOO/- per annum with effect from 1st January 1980. This will allow a wage of Rs.50/- per mensem to be paid to the caretaker and the extra Rs.100/- will be required for lighting.Copy ■From - The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To - - The Deputy Political Kesldent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Their Lordships concur moreover in the opinion of Mr. Secretary Chamberlain that this amount should be included in the quarterly claims in respect of recurring expenditure on buoyage and lighting, and not, as suggested by the Government of India, in those relating to diplomatic and consular charges. In this connection the Lords Commissioners suggest that it is undesirable to reopen accounts for years the accounts for which are closed, and Lord Grey would therefore he glad if in future cases other than the annual contribution for Persia, claims could be presented The Under Secretary of State,V y f: presented not more than six months after the close of the financial year to which they relate.

Two accidents to Merchant vessels have recent ly taken place off Ras-al-Ars, the point which has to be cleared before Koweit harbour can be made. In 1912 the British India St earn Navigation C ompany's steamer 'Putiala' ran aground at this point, and in December last another vessel of the same Company, the S. S. H Kasara', met with a similar accident at the entrance to the harbour. To avoid the repetition of such occurrences in future the Port Officer, Bom bay, has suggested to this Government the necessity of placing a small light on the beacon which exis^ts on this point in order to assist masters of vessels in making the harbour with safety. The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, who was consulted, re commends that as a temporary measure a Marine Pattern No• 3725-A masthead steaming light, costing Ds&gt; 70 , should be placed on the present beacon, and that arrangements should be made with the Political Resi dent, Persian Gulf, for the care and maintenance ofthe light by the caretaker at present in charge of the beacon.

In submitting these proposals I am to suggest, that, pending the consideration of the question of constructing a new light, the Director's proposal to place as a temporary measure a steaming light on the Ras-al-Arz beacon may, in view of the require ments of navigation and the smallness of the expendi ture involved in carrying out the work, be sanctioned at o nc e♦ I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. / ! Sd/- J. L. Eieu Secretary to the C-overrment of Bombay.^HOOD f ON THE LIGHTING AND BUOYING IN THE PEEISAN GULF. •- 50 Eas - al - Arz* The most convenient and test site for a light house at Eas-al-Arz is inimediately in rear of the existing beacon, and nothing is to be gained by placing the structure on the higher ground inland of this position, as suggested in paragraph 4 of a. letter from Naior Knox dated the fist TT ay 1907, and printed on page 2 of paper No.189, dated 5th November 1908. The site there is of blown sand, and though a lower tower would suffice, the foundations would be a very expensive item. The tower should be a braced castAiron structure about 40 feet high, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 45 feet above high water, or suff icient for a geographical range of 12 miles as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, It should I consider he of the Fourth Order and show one white Flash every 5 seconds. This light could be of a serni- watched nature, the luminery being a two-wick c apillary 1 amp. A watchman is already maintained to guard the heacon and the provision of another keeper would complete the establishment necessary for the re- , quirements of such a light. With the proposed seipi-watched system the driving clock is arranged to maintain the light in action all night without rewinding and the lamp to burn without attention* I estimate the cost of such a light with tower 1 ant era and lighting apparatus oil storehouse store 10 » complete at 3,000 I and its maintenance at 100 I perper annum, inclusive of all depot charges. It is noteworthy that the present watchman a Bedouin, although provided with aihouse of two rooms of the usual native construction does not occupy it preferring to live with his family life tent of native matting. Local opinion is against the provision of further permanent living quarters, as Bedouin prefer the tents. An oil store and light house store room have however heen provided for in the above estimate. The type of light provided for in the estimates embodied in pages 9 and 10 of paper No. 189 of 1908 is, I consider, unsuitable for the position, and would not fulfil the conditions laid down by the Committee of Enquiry. The estimate for its establishment on the lines proposed 1 also inadequate. In estimating the cost of erecting the iron tower etc., it has been assumed that a foreman of works to supervise the construction of the foundations, and an erecting mechanic, are already engaged in the Persian Gulf, as no allowance has been fede for the sea passages of skilled workmen from England, the employment of whom is recommended on page 11 of paper IBS, dated 5th Novem-No. 1323/29-M.

Sir, I am directed to refer to Marine Department endorsement No. 1323-1-M., dated tk the 3rd June 1913, with which was forwarded a copy of Foreign Department letter j 1253-E.A., dated the 10th June 1913, regarding administrative and financial arrangements connected with the scheme of lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf. 2 . In the letter quoted above it was decided that for the present the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should function as the Chief Lighting authority and ex- officio Inspector of Lights and that once the political problems were solved and the light house tender was in being those functions would be exercised by you in consultation when necessary v/ith the Political Resident. These conditions having now been fulfilled, the Government of India have decided that the administration of the whole scheme should ansferred to the Director, Royal Indian Marine.

In reply to your reference sheet of 2nd instant, there are nine more dhow loads of stone to be landed, at Tamb Island two of which are at present at Henjam. There are twelve more dhow loads of sand to go from Tamb to Quoin Island. Owing to the uncertainty of the weather, it is difficult to report when this work can be completed. Taking into consideration the unreliability of the Arab crews, I do not consider it safe to tow more than one laden dhow at night unless favour able weather is expected. Provisions arrive at Henjam for the Islands twice a month ; in addition to this, workmen and stores have to be conveyed between the Islands and Henjam each mail. r Mr. Homer states that his letter to you regarding the “ Miner ” was -written on \ 3 the understanding that arrangements were being made by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, for a special vessel for this duty. Mr. Homer expects work will be continued on Tamb and Quoin Islands until the end of June, until which time workmen, stores, and mails will be continually passing between the three places. Extract from letter from Mr. Homer, to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Divi sion, dated the 21st January 1914. I am indeed grateful for the extended services of an armed launch in connection with this work, and in reply to your question as to the date on which I shall be able to dispense with her services, I beg to say that, if you can conveniently spare her, I should like to retain her services for a further period of four or five weeks, as out of the fifteen boat loads of stone to be sent to Tamb Island, mentioned in my letter No. 767, dated 28th December 1912, only six have been landed there up to date. *(69).

Have submitted an indent for lighter cable, which on receipt should be exchanged for the one in use at present, at the same time clearing the moorings.

Telegram P., No. 1323-17-M., dated the 10th January 1911. p rom —The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department, To—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron. The Director, Royal Indian Marine, put forward the suggestion that the R. I. M. S. Lawrence might be utilised for employment on temporary light-house work at Little Quoin after the end of December 1913, but the proposal has been deprecated by the Political Resident on the grounds that it would render the vessel unavailable for urgent political work in the Persian Gulf. No report has yet been received from the Director, Royal Indian Marine, as to whether a tug can be procured from one of the ports on the East Coast of India, but even if one is obtainable, it would hardly reach Little Quoin much before the end of January and the expense of hire would be considerable. Would it be possible, in these circumstances, for Your Excel lency to allow, without considerable risk, an armed launch to remain at Little Quoin till the end of January 1914. The filtering through of arms is not much j in evidence at present and arrangements with the arms dealers are about to be ; concluded, vide my telegram* dated the \ *On Ama Traffic Series.

COPY OF TELEGRAM. From Dated Received at London Office Aue /g- . j ^ f 4 FEB1814 .191 f; Q Reference Paper. Uegister No. JP m 559/14 Political and Secret Department. 191 Referred to the Secretary, Political and Secret Department, 3rd February, 1914. Please see observation 2 of the Auditor's reference below regarding the employment of the *Pal inurus ” in the spring of 1911. Fhe appears to have left Karachi for the duty on 25th Feb. 1911 (Pol. 540/11), and to have been engaged together with H.M.S. 'Odin' in the survey of the Shat-el-Arab which was completed about 23rd April. Poes the Political Secretary agree that the cost of her employment at that' time is, under agreement, payable as to a half by H.M's. Govt ? (Sd) S.F.Stewart. It was not till 29th Feb.1912 that we asked that the cost of surveys in the Persian Gulf sd. be shared by the Imperial Govt. The Treasury agreed on 11th April 1912. The arrange ment was not specifically sai4 to be retro spective and the third para, of our letter seems to indicate that it was then contemplated that the arrangement sd. affect the surveys of 1911-12 and onward (i.e. begun after the hot weather of 1911). But the survey made of the Shat-el-Arah ba between 25th Feb. 1911 and 15293. I. 863. 500.—6/1913.(i.e* in the cold weather of 1910-11) and 23rd April Idll^hy the Palinurns is undoubtedly part of the general work, and the spirit of the arrange ment ought to apply to this period. It might however he as well to get the Treasury to accept it definitely as coming under the subsequent agreement. The Palinurus left Karachi on 25th Feb. 1911 and according to the usual practice her survey work may be considered to have begun on that date. The 23rd April might, I think, be taken as the date of completion of the work, tho 1 it is only approximate. This Dept, has considered the work in question to be 'survey” as distinct from 'lighting and buoying”. It was howeve r taken in hand in connection with the buoy- °f the Shat-el-Arab bar and, if it is more convenient to do so, it might with reason be regard.ed as a 'buoying” operation jor purposes of adjustment, as the Auditor seems to suggest. But I doubt whether this course would commiend itself to the Treasury; we have already had to ask them - twice at least- to agree to considerable increases of the original estimates for 'lighting and buoying ”. (Sd ) J. E. Shuck burgh. 5th Feb. 1914.WA/ / Secretary, Po1i tical ^ept. The best course I think would be to submit the claim, when the amount is known, to the Foreign Office in a separate letter, with reference to their letter of 201^ Jnly, 1910, which cormunicated the Treasury undertaking to defray n a moiety of the cost of taking over from the B.I.Co., and maintaining the buoys”. The claim would involve an excess over the estimate of initial cost, in spite of a smaller outlay on Tie buoys themselves than was estimated, but ive have a strong subsidiary argument in the fact that the surveying vjork done in connexion loith the relaying of the buoys diminished grp tgnto_(if I am right in presuming this is the case) the operations included in the larger scheme of survey work accepted by the Treasury in 1912. The estimate referred to above is oj course quite distinct from the estimate for the main Lighting and Buoyage scheme which has been the subject of so much dzsprite with the Treasury. If tie claim is put in as a Survey claim,pure and simple, I think there is little likelihood of the Treasury overlooking its connexion with the Shatt-el- Arab buoys and, it seems undesirable that it should, he left to them to find out the connexion. If however they did overlook it, the claim would, almost certainly be rejected on the ground that it arose out of work undertaken prior to theschem.e accepted by the Treasury in 1912. I shall be glad to have your observations on the above suggestion. (Sd) W.Bob in son . 3/4/14 Over.tv : Lif Financial Secretary. Please see reply on separate sheet. (Sd) A.Hirtzel 14/4/14. I think the assumption at 'A' is correct. The expert local Committee which reported in 1909 said that surveys would he required, before useful lighting could he effected, at (1) the Shat-el-Arab bar (2) Kuhbar Island- in the section 'approaches to Kuweit' (3) approaches to Bahrein. ( 2 ) &amp; ( 3 ) form part of the programre of survey subsequently sanctioned by the Treasury, and it seems a fair inference that (1) would also have been included in that programme if it had not been dealt with already. I concur in the proposal to make the claim on the F.O. with reference to the cost of the buoys laid on the bar. It might strengthen our case if reference is made to the remark of the Committee referred to, that buoys could not be laid there' without a survey being made first, and if it is pointed out that these connected operations had to be performed in a hurry owing to the Turks' unexpected energy in laying their buoys : in the hur^y it was overlooked that sanction had been obtained only for taking over and maintaining the buoys, but not for surveying the bar. As regards the period which the survey covered, I see from the extract attached, to your note that the 'Palinums' left Bombay for the Shatt-el-Arab on 12th Feb. 1911.But J ro?n the printed telegraiis (flagged with a red cross) you will see that she broke down and had to put in to Karachi which she did not leave till 25th ?eh. It seems 1 r - l c li U 1 m &gt; -f° r u Period beginning earlier than v 24,h April seems satisfactorily established as ^he date o, completion of the survey. 14th April, 1914.No. 1323-!.'!, Government of India, arine Department.

Reply to be sent Delhi. “ Swiftsure ” at Maskat ; 16th November 1913. No. 330—1462-XIY L. Sir, With reference to Government of India telegram No. 1323—10-M., of the 14th October 1913, I have the honour to forward for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the attached letter received from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, relative to the Armed Launch “ Mashona ” now in attendance upon Quoin Lighthouse. 2. I concur with the observation made in paragraph 3 of his letter. The number of Armed Launches now maintained for the arms traffic blockade is regarded as the absolute minimum if this service is to be performed with any j degree of efficiency. 3. As “ Minto ” cannot be spared either, I would suggest to Government that a suitable tug be hired as soon as possible for this lighthouse duty and thus free the launch for her more legitimate work. f I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, R. H. PEIRSE, Rear-Admiral, Naval Commander-in-Chief The Secretary to the Marine Department. ARMED LAUNCH ATTENDING ON QUOIN LIGHTHOUSE. H. M. S. “ Eox ” at Maskat; 13th November 1913. 1—118. Sir, With reference to your telegraphic orders No. 147 of 16th October 1913, that an Armed Launch was to be permanently detailed to attend on Quoin Lighthouse funder construction) until further orders possibly to end of January 1914, I have the honour to respectfully submit that the work of carrying out an efficient blockade of the Mekran Coast (recently altered to the Batineh Coast) is seriously handicapped by the withdrawal of the Armed Launch above- mentioned. 2. One of the Armed Launches is, as a rule, undergoing her quarterly overhaul, and, in the absence of any other available ship than “ Eox, one Armed Launch is frequently required to visit some particular locality. This y ' * * : 1 . - v * India, Foreign Secretary's lM,- dated DEC 191 ?ordinarily leaves only two Armed Launches available for blockade work a T number in my opinion inadequate to the needs of the situation. 3. I would respectfully observe that the use of one of the Armed Launches manned chiefly by officers and men of His Majesty’s Navy, as a tuj? in (neces sarily) permanent attendance on Quoin Lighthouse construction work, is hardly' compatible with the service for which such Armed Launch was originally armed and commissioned. n j I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, F.
