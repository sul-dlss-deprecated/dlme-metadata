The latter ever optimistic, and possibly, as has been suggested, with a view to ingratiating himself further with the Shaikh, at once offered to take the boy to his own The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel T*C.tf.Fowle, C.B.E., Politioal Resident in the Persian Gulf,(i&gt; own home in England where he would be properly oared for and would rapidly develop hia English. From there Major Holmee was to arrange for a private ooaoh to take him in hand, and prepare him tor one of the Oxford Colleges# Major Holmes it seems told the Shaikh that the cost (by this method) of educating his son, would not exceed £500 per atmum* Possibly Vajor Holmes was anxious to show what his firm could do as compered with the A*P#0#C# The latter I believe run a special institution in Rendon for the looking after and education of sons of prominent Persians# krv/C 4 , My interview,,the boy Mohomed showed me that he was a keen bright lad with undoubted ambitions. He saw clearly that in Kuwait he would have no chance at all unless it was to cotae back as e doctor or something similer. I saw no signs Of his having developed an American accent as suggested by Major Holmes, but his English was weak and several times he had to ask me what I meant whan I was talking to him* He did not strike me as being of the lazy sort at all* 5. I think the boy is made of the right stuff and should be pushed, but clearly also he is not anywhere near fit enough to pass any entrance examination for the University t yet awhile* He will have to do at the very least a year s work with a special tutor or coach before he can hope to pass 'small®”* If such coach could at the seme time board and lodge him as a member of his family, so much the better* Major Holmes was working on the right lines therefore when he suggest* ed that the boy live with i* an English family, preferably his, from and go and get his tutoring/there* 6* As regards the questions put to you by the India Office, the following are the shaikh f s replies:* (a) He wants hie boy to be prepared for and sent to Oxford* If the India Office will assist him, with or without the collaboration of Major Holmes, he will be most grateful* At present he was like a man working in the dark, he“V •3- !o he said, and did not know any 'ropes', so if His Majesty's Government could help him he would he deeply appreciative# (b) He had no idears on the subject of a particular profession for his son but, talked about his taking a 'Law'degree, or possibly 'Modioine ,, t Whatever happened he said the boy would come back from England improved, and nol grow up a mere Bedouin# (oi fie tfcou^it that a period of 5 years in England was all that he could af ord but in the next breath, agreed to keep him there as long as was necessary# (d) He noted that in the India Office opinion between £300 and £1000 per annum would be the cost of his sou's education# Personally I would like to see the boy helped on hie way# He Is the only one of the Shaikh's family who has shown any desire at all to improve himself# The Shaikh also sa^s tills, and because he is fond of the boy, he wants to help In the realisation of Ms ambitions# d^t the same time, in a priroitive State like Kuwait, which nay be called '*leid by the sea', where only personal rule exists, and the 'Sheria' is the only law recognised, 1 doubt if the hoy will ever find £ scope for his ability or ambitions# This I do not hink matters much, and the boy hlmeelf realizes this, and told rae that if ho could only get a law, Medical er Engineering degree, ho would go and make his living in Iraq and not remain in Kuwait unless he saw a distinct operning, trS' j) JUA^j \asZALt JU. trr VurT ° JLL^SVK.# J .ifc') \y) i).0. jno• 733-S of 1932.

There is no urgency about the matter and I therefore propose to discuss it with $he Shaikh during my visit this month ^uctober;. 3* i cannot help pointing out that the shaikh, not for the first or even the second time, has muddled up matters by playing hide and seek with us. What he should have done of course was to apply to you in the first instance, you would have then written to me, and i would have approached the xndia Office, instead of this he first opened negotiations with holmes and a good deal of unnecessary correspondence has been the result.

I am not quite sure from it whether what you want is a whole-time man who will devote all his attention to a single pupil. I douht if Goldring would he well advised to accept such a post as that, because he has a connexion with some half-dozen hoys whom he tutors, or causes to he tutored, in his own house, ana it would obviously he a pity to give that up for a single job which might come to an end after a year, leaving him high and dry. If the Sheikhlet is prepared to form part of a tutoring establishment, then it is a different matter. Goldring has already got a Siamese with him, who seems to get on quite happily, though he is 21 and most of the people who are tutored by Goldring are mere boys* A reference to Evelyn Gardew, whom you probably know, might give you some idea whether the arrangement has been a success or not. The bother is that G. is just having to move from Begbroke Place, a very nice house where he has been carrying on so far, because the lease is up. His intention is to move into a house in North Oxford; I think it is called the Old Parsonage, Summertown - not of course the one next St. Giles' , I am tola it is a nice house with a good garden, but I ao not know it. Ana then of course being in Oxford, instead of several miles out, will make the discipline of the show a more complicated business. So all I can say really is that Goldring is a pleasant man and 7and that hoys seem happy there. If you think it worth following up, I think you will have to write to Goldring direct about the new residence, because I have no particulars of it, and am just off for my holiday. ***** Yours ever, (Sd.)

Dear Sir, CCNF3D BNTIAL. 4y\ Reference your confidential letter No. P.Z. 868/33 dated 11th March 1933, regarding the son of the Sheikh of Koweit. I have met Major Frank Holmes, and also know well Mr. Goldring of Begbroke Place whom I recommended to Major Holmes. Mr• Goldring is a man of about years of age who retired some three years ago from an educational post in South Africa, and took on the Begbroke Place coaching establishment. He took his degree from Kxeter College. He is married, his wife being not strong but not an invalid and he is assisted so far as household matters are concerned by a daughter of about 25, vTho strikes me as a particularly sensible and able young woman. Mr. Goldring is socially quite suitable to undertake the work and though, being a comparative stranger in -he locality, he cannot offer his pupils many outside social amenities (the value of which would be in any case doubtful); x am of opinion that 30 far as social training is concerned the provision would be perfectly adequate. Mr. Goldring does some of the tuition himself, and is assisted by tutors, the majority of whom I have mysell supplied. One of these men has obtained a mastership at inch ester, and another at the Royal Naval College/r J O'') 7 \ ( S College, Dartmouth; and this will give an idea of the standard of men employed by him. At the same time the position of all coaching establishments of which I know is now precarious, and Mr. Goldring, whom I saw only recently, informs me that he is giving up Begbroke Place (a big country house about four miles from Oxford) and is taking a house in Oxford, which can be run more economically. This means that the conditions as to which Major Holmes has advised the sheikh of Koweit have changed, and I recommend that you allow me to put Mr. Goldring in touch with you so that he can given you a more detailed account of what he offers* In my opinion, although there are some disadvantages in the change, Mr. Goldring I know looks aiter his pupils well and there will be many advart ages in the way of companionship, sports facilities and coaching which are not available outside Oxford. Mr. Goldring is prepared to keep the boy the whole year round, but if a change is desirable I promised Major Holmes that I would try to arrange for adequate holiday provision. Yours faithfully, E .A.

The School is now full, with l2p boarders and 350 dayboys. I should, however, be glad to admit the boy of whom you speak as he is only 11 years of age. We do not now admit boarders over the age of 12. I shall be glad to give you any father information you may care to have. .1 am sending you an extra copy of the prospectus and the book of views in case you should have any further applications.from parents for an English education for their sons. We have a number of boys from Iraq and this year we have admitted IT. Kadjar, son of the ex-Shah of Persia, but so far we have had no one from Kowait. The advantage which these people appreciate ^L-'LiA/Vv. at Victoria College is the of an English*■■M&amp;s - 2 - education with Arabic and the opportunity for Moslem religious teaching. Believe me, Yours very truly, HEADMASTER —i/A CONFIDENTIAL , (141/4/49) 8th March, 1949. During Felly*s visit to London, Eastern Department asked him to mention to me that they consider it most desirable that the Gulf Rulers should be pressed to give some of their sons a reasonable degree of western education. In Bahrain as you know, some of Shaikh Mohammed*s sons speak quite good English and one of them is now studying in a university in America. So far as I know, none of the As Subah family have received any education worth speaking of on western lines. Do you think that any good result is likely to be obtained by pressing the Shaikh to arrange for the proper education of some of the younger mem bers of the family ? Col. A.C.

April 25, 1949 Please refer to your letter No. 141/4/49 of the 8th March, 1949. 2 I mentioned this to the Sheikh to see his reactions. He replied that every one in Kuwait is persuaded of the essential need for a knowledge of English as the key to a knowledge of what is going on in the modem world, and he assured me that it was his intention that all the younger members of his family should learn it. He also mentioned that Jabir who is now about 24 years of age is learning English. Subah and Mubarak the sons of Abdulla Jabir are also learning it. 3. The Sheikh assured me that he intended to send his younger sons to universities after they had been through the Kuwait schools; and that he would asxc for our help when he felt he needed it.
