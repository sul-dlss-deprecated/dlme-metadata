Most of the papers pertain to a broad attempt to control the illegal trade in arms. The correspondents speculate and investigate the manufacture of arms- and the geographic origins, smuggling routes, and identities of intermediaries involved in the arms trade. Most of the trade occurs between the Arab ports of the Persian Gulf, southern Iraq, and the ports of the Persian side of the Gulf, but particularly the Makran coast.Of note is a widespread investigation into the theft of arms from the Iraqi Army carried into the Arabian Peninsula by way of Bedouin tribesmen.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Arms control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00015f#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00015f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
