Will you please let me know (a) why Bahrain has been included in the Company's 'zone of operations' 1 when their activities are confined to Sau'di Arabia, and^(b) why the Political Agent, Bahrain, has been shown as the arbitrating authority when he has no jurisdiction over affairs in Saudi Arabia. 3. Will you please also let me know whether there are any other British subjects serving in Saudi Arabia under similar contracts, and, if so, how many? Yours faithfully, i for Political Agent, Bahrain.

I passed a principals in Arabia reply thereto: copy of your abovnmentioned lett and now am pleased to quote^comm iter on to my lents in (2) The instruction to our Agent in Bombay was to write in Bahrein or Saudi Arabia. However, some contracts have only Bahrein. Under definitions in the contract you will note Zone of Operations - blank, or any other locality which the employee may be transferred to for service during the term of this assignment. Strictly spepking, Clause 22 applies only when the employee is located in Bahrein. In any case, the employee considers the Political Agents decision final if in the employee's favor. If against the employee, the case is again presented to the Prbtector of Imlgrants. It is the policy of this Cotopany to allow each employee a just settlement according to the contract and only cases are called to the attention of the Political Agent when the employee demands settlement not according to his agreement. We feel sure that the Political Agent is passing judgement on any case will hand out a just decision when both sides of the case are presented and also, we feel sure that the Political Agent knows the Indian and therefore realizes that they do not give all the facts when presenting their case. (3) Seventeen out of fifty four of our British Indian contracts have 'Bahrein' as the plae e to report for duty. All others have Bahrein or Saudi Arabia.?fe have wired our Agent in Bombay and all future contracts will read w Bahrein n or 'Saudi Arabia'. If there is any further information I can secure for you from Arabia in connection with the subject of Foreign Service Agreements for our British Indian subjects, will you please advise.

Rodstrom, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Ba hrain. b Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter No.PA-466 dated the 24th February, 1940. 2, I fear it is incorrect to include Bahnain in the 'zone of operations' 1 in so far as the California Arabian Standard Oil Company 's operations in Arabia are concerned. It is true that a very small number of British Indian clerks are employed by you here in Bahrain, and of course so ar as they are concerned there is no objection to defining the ^zone of operations^ as bein^ Bahrain; but for the rest they are recruited definitely fcr service in Saudi Arabia and (with^slngle exception of your own office) the Company's zone of operations is solely and only Saudi Arabia. n these cases the Political Agent, Bahrain, is in no position to act as arbitrating authority since he has nojurisdiction in Saudi Arabia and no arbitration award given by him in respect of British Indians working in Saudi Arabia has any legal force. 3. i should be obliged therefore if you would instruct your recruiting agents in India to ensure that in ^11 contracts of British Indians required fcr service in Saudi Arabia the zone of operations shou d be described as Saudi Arabia only; and that all references to the Political Agent at Bahrain or to the 'British Government Officer exercislnr judicial powers in Bahrain' should be omitted. Presumably you recruit special men fcr your OM»n of ice in Manama an i -n their/- 2 • their cases alone can Bahrain be mentioned and the Political Agent cited as the arbitrating authority. 4. Will you be good enough to send me a copy of the instructions vhich you send to your recruiting agents at Bombay and Karachi, which should include provision for the Protector of Emigrants at those places to be fully apprised of the situation concerning the recruitment of British Indians for work in Saudi Arabia.

Section 22 will now read as follows - 'If any - -to arbitration of the British Government Officer excercising judicial powers in India both parties'.

Please note that there is no mention of a 'trial period' or that he would 'be considered as on agreement after the said period if approved'. On the 15th of April, 1940 (which, you will note, brings his service to 10 months only and not one year) Sher Mohamed re fused to do the work assigned to him unless he received more money. In fact he actually quit while on the job. He was consequently sent to the office where he repeated his statement that he would no longer work for the wages paid him. Ae accepted this resignation and told him so. Later he tried to change his mind but as his attitude had not been satisfactory for some time, we did not allow him to return to work. - He asked to remain over for one day to settle some accounts and was therefore not paid for April 17th, but he was paid for the 16th. He was recruited in Bahrein and returned to Bahrein. We hope that this will answer your inquiry satis factorily and clear up any misunderstanding that may exist in Sher Llohamed's mind.

The vriter, a resident of Ras Tanura, is endevoring to obtain the name of some individual or company capable of assuming the responsibility of constructing a sail boat of British or U. S. design. The vessel will be approximately forty-five feet over all with auxiliary power. Since its size will make the cost of shipment to Arabia by steamer prohibitive, the builder's yard will almost certainly have to be located within easy sailing distance of Arabia, that is thirty to sixty days. Mr. Monroe believes that somewhere in India or Ceylon there is a competent boat builder who would be willing to construct the boat from drawings I will supply. If you can give me the name and address of a qualified boat yard in the areas mentioned or the source thru which I may be able to contact a suitable yard, I will be more than gratful.
