Aqai Qav/ami left for Shiraz by air on the 23rd to discuss^ personally the question of inoroving the torm and port of Bushire # II • ■I'Q c a 1 Aff a ir.s. 66 . It is nov/ about a year since sugar and tea has been allotted by the Iranian Governnent for Bushire. The reason being that during the cribal revolt of last year certain Khans removed all the tea and sugar from the Bushire Customs and until this has been &gt;),•; id for, Governnent is not prepared to make any further aliott- ment of sugar and tea for Bushire. 67. Oving to the recent high tides the Lakfa sands (eastern rxtremety of’Bushire) was flooded to a depth of about 3 feet causing -ror t distress and damage to houses in Jabri Aliabad and hurnrbad; owing to the hard sands'the water, at the time of writing, still ronrins stagnant. If. On the 7 th July Aqai Faramarzi with 4 inspectors under his supervision arrived at Bushire. After inspecting the Revenue and Customs Department and investigating the alleged illegal removal of sugar from the Bushire customs by ’certain .Khans the inspectors left for Bhiraz on the 1 Cth July leaving Aqai Faramarzi in Bushire. HI. E lections 69. Apparently the sole reason for Aqai Faramarzi’s visit to Bnshire was to’ canvass for his election to the Kajlis. 70. Aral Khalil Dashty arrived in Bushire on the 7th July. A few davs later he issued handbills to the effect that only Shins were eligible for election to the iinjlis: Aqai Faramarzi being n ounni wrs'therefore not eligible. The local inhabitants are believed to have informed Aqai Dashty that the Governnent wants capable Iranians Bhias and Bunnis to be elected to parliament. The issue of these handbills seems to have reduced Aqai Dashty*s chances of election. 17. Cornunlca ti o ;is 71. The B.I. slow mail steamers called fairly regularly during the r:outh.

On 7th April it was reported that the Bushire elections had again been postponed. Aqal Baqir Bushirl* a new candidate* arrived at Bushire on 21st April for the first time in his life. In a talk with the Consul-General on whoa he called he deplored the decline of Bushire and said that the British were partly to blame. Challenged on that score he defended himself by expressing disapproval of British develop ment in Khuzistan to the detriment of Bushire. This was not bad for a new-co ner* but he went on to say that if elected* he would press for the building of a vodern port at Bushire where he would bring the railway. He admitted that money might prove a difficulty, lie had nothing to say on any Political issue but said that he was not one of those persons who paid money for a seat in the iajlis. +A few days earlier Khalil uashti* one of the present members* expressed exactly the reverse regarding him. 40. Baqir left for Ghiraz on 26th April. He met many Bushiris and promised to assist the Bushire Girl's Gchool by purchasing a sewing machine* some cooking utensils, about 100 dresses for the poorer girls.

Three men arrived by air on the 21st and having - according to the management*s own word - been duly sweetened proceeded to give a decision unfavourable to the workers. The mill-hands thereupon came out on strike while the management retaliated by inducing the police to clap the ringleaders in Jail; At this juncture the Tehran representatives intervened with the result that they were turned out oi the mil*, one of them being badly beaten and losing a piece of one of his ears. The police then took another hand in the matter and fired wildly into the air wounding one old woman and waking up innocent persons slumbering after lunch. By the end of the month the mill was operating again but had not properly settled down. about the strike, qua strike, but they do worry about Its effect on the elections. This lamentable show 6f Independence has given food for thought in that the workers - sufficient in numbers to sway the elections and accurately to fore-judge the result of their votes - will not vote according to the Tehran plan which no doubt would quite deploreable. Casey's car was attacked by footpads on the nifrht of 16th April, and two sore houses were robbed.

The leadership, tacitly acknowledged aksenh^ee./ of lfa ®y t p lan Qeshqai, the subservience of the nkotiatC-Ikth ke r ^iras, and the fact that recent conducted -hk th CGncral government have mostly been conducted ohiraz, now make it clear that Shiraz is unquestion- &lt; town °I area. Presumably the setting up of a~ 2 - Provincial Council will make the changes more apparent. ^4o. About the middle oi November, the local agent for Messrs otrick, of Basra, from whose ship ,f Fort Gibralta' a consignment ol Australian^sugar had been landed in Bushire during S^otember, asked for official intervention to prevent -this sugar being issued from trie Customs. He stated that the bill of lading had not an surrendered, landing charges had not been paid and that the sugar though landed for the Persian -Government was legally the property of the British Company until it was cleared in the proper manner. The local tribal leaders agreed to non issue of this sugar but meantime tribal representatives from the hinterland armed with authority giveh by the Shiraz officials of the Finance Department, arrived to take away this sugar. Disturbances were threatened, and accordingly it was agreed that issue should be made nrnm ld ^ d T ::Jritl ? h i 5^? r ? sts were Swarded by deposit with the Imperial Bank °f Iran of sufficient money to pay for the sugar ms as anamg charges. Subsequently, the matter was discussed with the uovernment commission who agreed With the action taken. Meanwhile information had been received fhat the sugar had been paid, for bv the ersian Government, and that the bill of lading would be sent from Tehran where it was held by the ministry of Finance, secondingly tl - r - s Consul s official objection to the removal of the sur pr was withdrawn on the understanding that the local authorities would puaiu the interests of the local agent for Messrs Strick and Co 'nd would complete the usual formalities as soon as oossible.

The Assistant Military Attache of the U.S .A.Embassy,Tehran, arrived in Bushire from Shiraz on October 6 th intending to return to Tehran by sea via Khorranshahr. Finding no boat he returned to Shiraz. He informed H.L.Consul that he had been sent to obtain information regarding the disturbances and had had talks with both tribal leaders and Military officers. 233. The families of the staff of the Political He side; icy and Bushire Consulate General were evacuated from Shiraz on October 10 th by road without mishap after unsuccessful attempts to obtain an A. I.. 0 . C. plane . II. Local Affairs . 234. Life in Bushire has been quiet but owing to their having extremely small cash balances, the Bushire branch of the Bank-i- Mille has been unable to meet demands made on it. This fact together with the continued difficulties over communications has brought business almost to a standstill. Certain demands for payment of the credit balance held by them in the name of the Customs Department were made on the Imperial Bank of Iran by Hiat Daudi, but after at first adopting a truculent and titreaton ing attitude calmer counsels prevailed and the natter was amicably settled. III. Communication s. 235. Hoad traffic between Bushire and Shiraz became possible with tribal escort abmrt the middle of the month, but owing to public uneasiness the road was hardly used until very recently. Vehicles of all kinds now use the road freely and even travel at night — something they have-been unable to do for some years. There is still no telegraph communication from Bushire, and the Cable &amp; Wireless orovide almost the only link with the rest of the world. No A,I,0.C. tugs called until near the end of the month and the visits of mail steamers were more irregular than usual. The inland postal service is reported to be starting age 1 n and air service may recommence as there is no reason why they should not do so. IV. Political. 236. There has been no political activity except towards the end of the month when it bedame clear that the tribal lenders would have to embark on political battles to consolidate what they had gained by more forceful means. It is understood that some sort of oolitical party is now being formed by them to contest future provincial and National elections. V. T ribal . 237. With the surrender of the Military garrisons at Khormuj on October 1 st and Kazerun on October 3 rd, all fighting in the district ceased, and the chief occupations of the tribes have been connected with administration of the captured areas. Iliat Daudi has been in Shiraz almost all the month and has had great diffi culty in curbing the other tribal leaders whose activities have been directed more to personal gain rather than for the public benefit. Petty quarrels have been common, but on the whole the / tribal • • •a * tribal adminir.tration had been more efx*ectivo than any experienced in Bushire for some years. The issue of sugar and tea rations to the public of the ?/hole area - which had not been done for the last 7 months - has met ivith much puilic approval. It is understood that the settlement reached betw&lt; on the Qasheais and the Central Government will also apply to Bush „ area and that General Zahidi has been asked to send someone v take over the civil administration. It is stated that all bul ntout 50 tribesmen are returning to their homes, where they ar.: required for ploughing their land, and that until the arrival o' the Governor the Assistant Governor Nnwab will carry on» G.I.Pettigrew His Majesty’s Consul, Bushire. -SECRET r t i J 737 X t 46 Bushire Consulate General Intelligence Summary No.9 for the month of September 1 9 4-6 I .

II. LOCAL AF FAIRS . 225. As a result of the tribal revolt some changes have occurred in the local administration. The Governor is still absent in Shiraz and the Assistant Governor no longer officiates - his place being taken by the tribal leader Fathullah Khan Hiat Daudi. Directors for all Central Government departments have been appointed from among the staff of these departments. In the case of the police a member of the tribes has' been appointed. III. COMMUNICATIONS .‘ 226. As a result of the tribal revolt the road from Bushire to Shiraz was virtually closed from Sepfcembcr•19th. No damage to the road is reported. Telegraph communication from Bushire to the remainder of Persian by inland lines ceased on the same day. Cable &amp; Wireless continue to operate. IV. P OLITICAL 227. Reference paragraph 218 of Intelligence Summary No.9 of 1946. At a meeting of the Tudeh party held in Bushire on September 2 nd, the leading speaker stated clearly that the / departure of the Resident ana his staff from Bushire to | Bahrain had been due to the efforts of the Tudeh party. 228. After 19th September all Tudeh activities ceased. Some of the leaders have fled from Bushire. It is not known what action, if any, the tribal - leaders will take against those that remain, but this is likely to be some form of arrest. V. TRIBAL. 229. During the first half of the month there was considerable activity amongst the tribal leaders and on* _ September ]4th it became widely known that some sort of revolt was likely. On 19th September it was heard that tribal forces were collecting near Choghadak, and on the same day all telegraph lines from Bushire were cut. No sort of warning of any impending disturbance was received from the Assistant Governor (the Governor was overstaying his leave in Shiraz) who even replied to a person; 1 enouiry made by H.M.Consul on 19th that there was no trouble. He was unable to explain, and in fact displayed ignorance of, the unusual activity amongst the Gendarmerie and Military, who were moving about in a state of armed readiness. On 20th September the military and Gendarmerie collected in the barracks of the latter opposite the house of the Consulate u'led until recent! r bv2 of the Military barracks and at S p.m. it was reported tha the house of the Consulate power house engineer had been entered by Tangistanis Suhse.uently i was leerned^t t , 4 »as done in error, it b ®^g believea tnat ^ rl d a ingt son . e e engineer wno c Little damage was done ana brj-uax w toarp removed.

Aqai Marzeban a special Inspector of the Customs Department same from Tehran during July charged with the prevention of smuggling in South Persia. He imposed certain rules to allow check of the movements of goods after passing through the Port Customs. These were bitterly opposed by the merchants who called on the Governor to intervene. The matter is still un settled, but it is understood that the Persian Government regard smuggling with extreme gravity and the matter is to be discussed in the forthcoming Economic conference in Tehran. *See paragraph be low). 208. A 5trick boat carrying Government sugar arrived at Bushire during the month. She discharged a total amount of 22,665 bags. 245 bags were short delivered from the ship. The goods were booked f.o.b. and it is reported that the Persian officials and other boatmen stole a large quantity of sugar by taking some from each bag while in transit to the shore. The price of the stolen sugar Is from Rials 1500 to Rials 1S00 per bag. The Customs are now trying to hold the Insurance Company responsible for this shortage. There is slittle doubt that insurance of goods for any stage beyond delivery off the steamers calling at Bushire is not a profitable risk. 209. Shaikh Jabbareh Nasuri, brother of Shaikh Sulaiman Uasuri, the Bakhshdar of Kangan visite-d Bushire during the month. / 210.210. It is reported that the Police Department have receivod _ instructions from Tehran that all foreigners arriving at Busnirc by sea must have passports on which a visa^by a Persian Consulate officer has been given. In default they will not be alloweu to land. No case of this nature has yet occurred and it is yet uncertain v/hether the orders will be implemented. 211. The Bushire Chamber of Commerce has been instructed to ^ send a representative from Bushire to join the conference which is going to be held at Tehran very shortly to discuss the economic situation in the country. Mr* Khalil Dashty the M.P. sought nomination but Mr.Agar was selected instead, left for Tehran on 28th August. 212.

The restriction on movement of wheat imposed by*the Finance Department led to various telegraphic complaints beinr made to Tehran. The Government, eventually, allowed holders of wheat to sell their previous stock freely and only the sale of the current year’s crop was prohibited except to Government. Despatch of grain from the ports of Diium, Ganaveh, and Bandar Rig to Bushire therefore stopped. The town at^ present obtains its requirements from the daily arr-L.va_ oi mrain from Tangistan and Dashtisan to which the Govemmenv appears to have no objection, 214. Reference paragraoh 185 of Bushire Intelligence Summary No,7 for July 1946.

IV. POLITICAL, 217* During a meeting of the local Tudeh party the present leader (a petty Bushire merchant named All Kudsi) stated that / they...d / ^ they were tryin ' eend a representative to Bahrain in order to organise' a party there. He approached without success, one of the Bushiri merchants residing at Bahrain, to act on their behalf. 21S. The transfer of the office of the Political Resident to Bahrain has naturally excited keen interest among the Bushire inhabitants. The departure of the Residency is viewed with great concern by nest Bushiris, though this is largely due to their belief that the prosperity of the port will now. decrease still further. V.

Under orders from Tehran all grain depots in Bushire and district have been sealed by the Finance Department who appear to have received orders to purchase wheat. As they are however only offering Tomans 260/- per ton, no one is willing to sell to them. Hiat Daudi has been stopped from fulfilling his contract with the A.I.O.C. for the supply of wheat (paragraph 102 of Bushire Intelligence Summary No. 4 refers) but has offered to sell wheat to the Finance Department at Tomans 375/- per ton. He has not yet received a ? e Ply to this offer and _it is not known what are the intentions of Government regarding the wheat in the sealed godowns. It is not known what is the reason for the orders which have already ‘caused ah artificial 'shortage locally, but it is common gossip that it is due to false Tudeh reoorts that wheat was being exported abroad. The Governor Bushire protested against the orders without success. As a result of t’ 1 : action by Government officials, Hiat Daudi has cancelled ,ii' ivreement to supply wheat to bakers, which anyhow he could not .'ulfill as wheat sent to Bushire would be seized by the Finau Department (Paragraph 123 of Bushire Intelligence Sura- nar'- ’t . / 5 refers). 153.

IV- PUBLIC HEALTH . 161, The health of Bushire has been normal. V. POLITICAL . 162, Reference paragraph 135 of Bushire Intelligence Summary No. 5 of 1946. The Bushire newspaper 'Noor Afshan” has publish ed a letter from the Governor of Bushire denying the truth of the allegations contained in the articles which appeared in ''Surush* 1 regarding the alleged export qf wheat to foreign countries. 163. Reference paragraph 149. The object of the visit to Bu shire of the Russian Consul-General, Ahwaz and party appears to have been to enquire into the radio broadcasts alleging the pre- -o•of British troops in Bushire (paragraph 136 of Bushire In- -• 3 nee Summary No, 5 of Hay 1946 refers). In response to pea ted enquiries on, this point the Governor Bushire assured n there were no such droops in Bushire and added that one hear r falsehoods on the radio. 164. ' h party activities in Bushiro have increased consider- A 3 rike in the Etimadieh Mills was used, if not fostered, to {.,■ de i excuse for interference by Tudeh agitators from Shiraz whe cceedod in obtaining the agreement of'the Managing Director /-3 Director to an exorbitant increase of wages, as -oil as denands calculated to give the Tudeh party a large share in the control of the Hill. It is now claimed that as a Vesult of this inter ference the output of the Mill has dropped by 35^1 and that the mill is running at a heavy loss. The workers however are recovering from their original enthusiasm for the Tudeh party intervention and are enquiring into the rumour that the amount collected by the Tudeh party from them for their common use, has found its way into the private bank account of the Tudeh leader Parvizi. 165. After the successful termination of the strike in the Mill the Tudeh party agitators of Shiraz induced the dock labourers to demand an increase of wages from 25 to 70 Rials oer day. In the absence of any ship in the harbour and after the departure of tie agitators the matter was settled by the Governor by fixing wages of 45 Rials only. 166. It is reported that Abdur Rcahman Faramarzi is likely to be elected to the Majlis as member for Lar at the next elections. in the Lingeh area, no boting is likely to take place as the local inhabitants have petitioned to be separated from Lar and to bo made a separate province. It is understood that voting ooxos received will be returned empty, VI. TRIBAL . 167. Reference paragraph 126 of Bushire Intelligence Summary ho. - o .' May 1946. It appears that Laser Khan Qashaai has still not i. do uo his mind as to his future attitude to the Chakutahis and that the Persian authorities in Shiraz are tryinm to induce them to vacate the area they seized. 168. Reference paragraph V(d) of Bushire Intelligence Summary No. 23 of December 1944. It is reported that the notorious Ali Ismail has raided D a iyir recently in order to expel Ahmed /mxtt Daiyin and has captured an old fort near Daiyir. Sargurd Arasteh with some troops has gone from Khur$uj to Daiyir to inter vene. 169. Hiat D„.udi has recently succeeded in forming a sort of tribal union in which most of the Khans of the Southern area are members. Apart from preventing disputes among the members them selves the real object of the union is probably to oppose the influence of the Tudeh party and to represent to Government the case of the tribes in matters of common interest. VII.

Fathullah Khan Hist Daudl returned from Tehran on 19th March. He reported to Coneul that he had reluctantly made a private compromise with Mohammad Ali Liravi because Loth Persian higher authorities and Suliani the deputy in i.ne Majlis for Behbehan were strongly supporting Mohammad All- because of the political situation prevailing In Tehran; and also because the Bushire deputies in the Majlis had insufficient influence to assist him. 3v this agreement he has sold one of lour shares in the Liravi to Mohammad Ali Liravi to whom he has also leased the balance of his shares. Mohammad Ali Liravi in return has executed a registered undertaking to behave properly and ^o be /faithful...•V 2 - (\/)} dithf'.i to Hiat Daudi in future. Fathullah Khan Hiat Daudi with i'.nhomraad Ali Liravi who had accompanied him from Tehran left fo, ,iisar on 20th March. The military garrisons at Ganaveh, Hisar and Bandar Dilar. have not yet moved and are unlikely to do so fc’' ^onie time, 74* P i’erence paragraphs 45 and 46 of Intelligence Summary No* 2, The previous history of this case is that in about 1920 the Chahkutahi family (from the village of Chahkuta which adjoins Tangistan) urchased 4 dongs of the Balook from Fathull-Mulk Shirazi, who sold the two additional 'dongs 1 at the same time to othc purchasers. After Reza Shah's rise to power, in accord ance with the oolicy he adopted towards tribal leaders in other parts of Persia, he exiled the five Chahkutahi brothers to Tehran and Azerbaijan, and had the revenue of the area collected and credited to Ms treasury. After the Allied occ ’.nation of Persia in 1941 for some reasca or otM- the .Chahkatahi Shaikhs delayed their return to the south ?Mut a year, during whion time Ghulam Razmi of Lavar in Dasnty, (just^north of Khurmuj) took possession of the whole area. Later, to regularise his position he took a 3 years lease at Rials 60,000 a year from the Government. This lease expired in November 1945. On the termination of the lease the Finance Department issued a notice calling for tenders for a $*eah lease. Ghulam Razmi offered mo increase his yearly payments to Rials 70,000, while Nasir Khan o a shqai is said to have offered Rials 80,000. The Persian authorities in Shiraz, who did not welcome the prospect of the Qashqais taking over the area, lying as it does outside Qashqai territory, referred the matter to Tehran. In the meanwhile the Qnshqar’s took matters into their own hands. Shaikh Mohammad, the eldest of the sons of Shaikh Hussein of Chahn.atahi, came to Sushue and visited the Consul on 4th March and took the opportunity of justifying the action of his family who, he eaplained, in addition to taking by force the area occupied by Ghulam Razmi whose lease of 4 of the 6 sharoo had expired, had also arranged to lease from the owners the remaining two shares. He stressed the friendship to the Bri h ;: ; h Government of himself and his brothers who have recently written letters to the Political Resident in the same vein. The sons of Chahkutahi appear to have settled down in the Balook- i-Bushkan and are trying to make friends with all neighbouring chiefs of Dashti, Tangistan, and Dashtistan. It is reported that they have retained at Bushkan a considerable alaount of grain and numbers n cattle, animals etc, belonging to Ghulam Razmi. The latter 3S reported to have met All Tar-istani (Chahpiri) of Ahram and is endeavouring to gain support to fight the Chahkutahis directly their Qashqai supporters migrate to Sarhad. He Ghulam Rqzmx - appears to have paid a^considerable amount of money to Sarha.ng Nawisi of the Kazerun military garrison and to the Bushire O.w. garrison in order to get the Chahkutahis expelled from the Balook-i-Bushkan, but so far the military authorities have only opened a military post at Chahkutah on the pretext of meeting any further trouble. In the meanwhile, as Ghulam Razmi is unpopular in the pashti area, all but a few of the petty chiefs of Dashti have taken oaths not to assist him. Aqai Khalil bashty the Bushire Deputy in the Majlis appears to be opposed to the Chahkutahis, the reason being that he is afraid that the Chahkutahi? may in the next election vote for their relative, Fr-msrzi the Editor of newspaper 'Kaihan . ./TheThe c 1 ount of support Rais Ali Tangistani will give to GhulamX . ^azmi iepends to a ooiiaideyable extent on how strongly the enahki 5 his wUl press their own claims against Raia Ali Tangir. i . These are for the return of the villages of Chugha^ A’ ali Ghangi and ,Tul-i-3ieh which belonged to the Ghahkuf ah area and were occupied by the Chahkutahi family until thei.. - pul: Lon, when they were taken by Rais Ali Tangistani. Though ohe ( ahkutahi family has a long anti-British record it what is the attitude of the present members of the family. This is likely to be dominated by the policy pursued by the Qashqais, without support of whom, the Chahkutahis would be in considerable difficulty. t 75. Reference paragraph 374 of Intelligence suppary No # 2. In a recent crime wave in the Burazjan area four cases of burglary have been reported at intervals during the month in Daliki and near Burazjan. It is alleged that the cause is the disagreement between 3arwan Urdubadi, Officer Commanding garrison at Burazjan* and the Gendarmerie Department there. An account of Urdubadi's activities is given in the Intelligence Summary No.21 of 1&amp;45| and it is clear that Urdubadl^s continued residence in this area is most undesirable and liable to create unnecessary trouble and hardship. 76. Rainfall during the month was fair and the prospects of the wheat harvest are good. There was a slight earth-quake shock on the 12th March. No Ideal damage was reported. III. COMMUNICATIONS . 77.

Aqai Usfuri with two other members of Tudeh party of Shiraz arrived from Shiraz on 21st March to form a branch of the Tudeh pai'Cy in Bushire and perhaps with some idea of arranging some demonstrations. They, however, were only able to appoint Aqai Sami, Accountant of the fiducation Department, Bushire, as leader for Tudeh party at Bushire. Usfuri and party returned to Shiraz on 25th March. The total membership of this party at Bushire is only 35, and the majority are low class people. 80. Aqai Khaveri leader of 'Bradeh-i-Melli' party (a branch of Seyyed Zia-ud-din) and editor of newspaper 'Eradeh Fars' at Shiraz, arrived from Shiraz on 22nd March with the main intension of frustrating the efforts of Aiqai Usfuri of the Tudeh party. In view of the arrest of his lepder Seyyed Zia, he'acted with caution and returned to Shiraz pn 25th Mfter calling on Consul. 81. Both the Police and Customs Departments have received telegraphic instructions from Tehran to detain Shaikh Abdullah Galadary, the Bandar Abbas Deputy in the 1 Majlis, if he is seen in Bushire. The reason given In the telegram is that Galadary has ran unpaid debt of Rials,, 4,000,000/- but the Chief of Police, Bushire, lawar Muhajir, who is an Azerbaijani, has spread the /news....nows in Bus’ :ro that the reason for the orders was that Abdullah G;&lt;.U.aary is one of tha “right wing” party in the IJajlis* VI.

'It is -erortod that Shaikh Na«tr Khan r’hahkutahi a«) Shaikh Abdur’ Rasul Khan Chahkutahi met Nasir Khan Qashqai at Shiraz on their way from Tehran where, when not looking after their estates in Azerbaijan, they have lived since being exiled from Chahkutah by Reza Shah. They evidently obtained a promise of support fr*m the Qashqai leader, for they proceeded on 12th February from Shiraz direct to the Balook-i-Bushkan accompanied by a party of Qashqais said to number about 500 fighting men. The 'tofangchis* of Rais Ghulam Razmi, of Lavar, (in Dashty, north ^f Khurmuj), who were hopelessly outnumbered, offered hif resistance except at Talheh, where two of them were killed^ the Qashqais sustained n* casualties. Rais Ghulam Razmi's sof 1 ? Ahmad Razmi, who was at his fort at Talheh, on learning that his father could not send him sufficient re-inforcements to oppose the Qashqais effectively, retired with his ‘tofangchis’ to Lavar. The Chahkutahis have, with Qashqai support, thus obtained complete control of Balook-i-Bushkan. 46. The Officer Commanding the Bushire Garrison had orders^ from the Divisional Head Quarters, Shiraz, not to interfere in the above operation. 'Rais Ali Tangistani (Chahpiri), and the Raises of Dashty, who were asked by Rais Ghulam Razmi to send their ‘tofangchis 1 to help him meet the invasion of the Balo#k, all refused to send him assistance. 47. An interesting footnote to H.M’s Consul 1 s^tour in the Balook-i-Bushkan, (paragrap 36 refers) is provided by a report from the Balook that it is being said there that H.M's Consul bas so disgusted by the evidence he saw of Rais Ghulam Razmi s ill-treatment of the people of the Bal«©k that he arranged (withm : de next few days I) for the Chahkutahis to take i^ver the whole area. It is encouraging to learn that there are peep*., who believe that British Diplomacy works so swiftly and so ef-fectj vely I 48. As the abundant rain which fell between 1st and 4th February ^which was badly needed to save the winter crops) w/as also attributed by the more credulous to the Consul’s visit, the days spent in scrambling up and down slippery mountain tracks and'the nights spent in the leaky mud houses of the Kadkhudas of various villages in the Balook, were apparently not wasted. 49. The Quarantine Station jetty on Abbasak Island is reported to be half finished. The Engineer-in-charge has left for to try and obtain further funds to enable him to complete the work. 50. Reference paragraph 20 of Diary No.l of 1946. The Engineer in charge, Dr.Farzaneh, handed over the pipe line, pumping statifn etc., to the Municipality, and f° r Tehran on 24th February. A committee has been formed, the members of which have agreed to put up a sum of Rials 100,000/-, with the idea of arranging to supply water to householders in Bushire on a commercial basis. 51. The Economig Department, Bushire, was amalgamated with the Finance Department, Bushire, with effect from 27th February. IV. COM MUNIC ATIONS. 52. Owing to unfavourable weather conditions in the north of Persjo-, the weekTy Irantour plane service was suspended for three Weeks during February. iri 1 iruzabaci to meet the Q.ashqai leader, and consequently none of the chiefs of Tangistan and Lashty met hasii ihan. 15. Nasir Khan Oashqai is reported to he trying to obtain the lease from the Persian Government of the Balo ■ area f Husain Quli Q.ashqai. The lease, which expired in November 1945, was until then held by Rias Ghularn Razmi, v/ho has threatened that he will make trouble if it is given to a or Qashqai chief. 16. H.M’s Consul’s tour through the villages of Tangistan and Balo ok, enabled him to ascertain how little of the commod ities controlled by the Persian Government finds its way to the villages. In theory each adult villager receives one kilo of sugar and 250 grammes of tea per month. In actual fact the Raises who take delivery of these commodities from the iCconoi: ic Department, Bushire, sell most of the tea and sugar in tnBlack Market in Bushire town. H.M’s Consul f ound that p-is nulam Razmi had never distributed any tea or sugar in 11 . villages of Balook, while Rais Ali Tangistani hands out orn,/ . kilos per month to each of the Khad Khudas of Tangistan. 1 ! , . {ais Ghulam Razmi is a bad landlord in other respects, f r s has been allocating to himself an over-large share of G nnual income of the cultivators in the Balook area, most u. om (even without his exactions) find it very diliicult to .. , a living. Half the population of Bushkan, for instance, h l.l grated elsewhere during the past few years and much of the village is now dereliAt. The condition of the other ’abadis’ in the Balook area is very little better. 18. Rais Hli Tangistani (Chahpiri) has shown the sincerity of his rec ently-ev inced f riendship for tae 3ri tish Government by catching and severely heating the Tangistani thieves who recently purgled the house of the Residency executive ^ngineer. Rais .All’s action, which proved infinitely more eif active than any taken by the local Police and Gendarmerie, resulted in the restoration of part of the stolen property. 19. A memorial service for the late Aqai Samuel A. Sukias, brother of Aqai Philip Iskandari, Director of Finance, Bushire, was 'held in the Church of the Epiphany, Bushire, on 2nd January. 20. The drinking-water pipe line from A’li Changi to Bushire has now been completed. The water which flows out oi the pipe at Bushire is, however, slightly brackish, and, owing to the fact that the pipe has not been connected with any reservoir in Bushire, has so far been running to waste/ in the sand outside Bushire town. III. C O MMBHIC a s TIOH S . 21. In spite of rain earlier in the month the track linking Chughadak (on the main Bu shir e-Shiraz road) with Ahram and Khurrnuj is in good condition. Owing to the irrigation channels which intersect it between Chughadak and Ahram, and the dry water-courses between Ahram and Khormufli, this track is not suitable for ordinary cars, though taxis frequently travel between Khurmuj and Bushire. The whole distance is easily traversable in a light truck, except after rain. IY. PUBLIC HEALTH . 22. A smallpox epidemic broke out at Hughu (30 miles west of Lingeh) during the month.a*3 l V.
