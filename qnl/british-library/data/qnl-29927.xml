To Addressed to Secretary of State for India London - Repeated to Government of India and Political, Muscat at Karachi. No.650 Dated and received 1st July 1937. Your telegram 1346 of June 26th. Sultan has given me no previous intimation either of (a) his Europe tour or of (b) his letter to President of U.S.A. I suggest that I be authorized on behalf of His 2 Majesty T s Government to address a letter to the Sultan in the following sense:- heard That His Majesty 1 s Government 3 of both (a) and (b) above concerning which Sultan gave me no information. With regard to (a) that His Majesty’s Govern- notice as ment would be glad of as possible of His Highness’s intended travels outside his State in case he should wish them to arrange any facilities required. V/ith regard to (b) that when it is to the advantage of his State His Highness avails himself of His Majesty’s Government for communication with foreign Powers on his behalf, which His Majesty’s Government are of course very pleased to do, e.g.raising of assuage (?) tariff. In return for this His Majesty’s Government would be grateful if His Highness would through me inform them/pf any communications which he proposes to make these Powers, having previ- to foreign Powers. ously received communication from His Majesty's Government on His Highness's behalf, naturally refer (as in the present instance) to His Majesty's Government, who are placed in a somewhat/ —2 somewhat awkward position if they have not heard previously from His Highness(if it is not?). With regard to (a) I doubt whether Sultan has any intention of visiting Rome for the purpose of intrigue, as after Abyssinian episode Sultan (at present anyhow) has object..... dislike for Italian. 5. In regard to (b) Sultan is obviously trying to have it both ways, using His Majesty's Government when it is ^ n -grioA advantage, and disregarding them when it suits him. I think that above communication may have a salutory effect. - Britconsul -Telegram - S. ^rom - Secretary of State for India, Lonson.

Eis Highness remarked that he presumed a similar arrangement would be made on this occasion if he can be received by His Excellency next Hoveo* ber as requested. 5. I am writing now to say that I sholud be grateful for several reasons if I could be informed as soon as possible whether I am to accompany the Sultan to Delhi or not. One of these reason is that my wife threatens to come out to Muscat in the autumn and if I have to go to Delhi it would be more convenient for her not to arrive there before my return which would be, X presume, some time in the third week of Movember. To change the date of a passage rather at the last moment is, as you are aware, in the 'rush* season difficult and often impossible, so I would be very gl&amp;d if it could be possible l to receive an early decision in this matter.

In the most auooicious hour have received your letter dated 5th August 1937, from liarat, and have carefully read its contents and. understood your statement that in accordance Tith instructions received froir Our friend, the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Qulf you were to address Us to the following effect: That His Majesty's C-oTernraent hare he^.rd that Ve ’ire planning &amp; tour in rurooe and have written to Our friend His Excellency the President of the U.S,a., ruggCBting that V,e might extend it to tnat country; that w© have not given any information to the bon*tie in* Political Hesidimt on either of these projects; that with regard to the huropean tcur His Majesty ! s Gtvern- ment v.ould he glau of as early notice as possible of Our intended travels outside Our State in case We should -rish them to arrange any facilities recuired, etc. to the end of paragraph 4 of yonj' letter quoted above. Our reply is as follows?- We thank Our friend the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Guli for what he stated in nis message, which comes of nothing but- his well known ^ friendship. And W?e are, as We have ever been, very grateful to Our friend. His Majesty’s Government, ior their kind favours and good wish®* for the prosperity of Our State. We do not doubt their helpful attitude to assist and give all necessary facilities, whenever || these are wished ana required by Us, a* has always been their custom with Our predecessors and with Es in view of the close friendship existing since Treaties have been exchanged *•' 3 ,/£oa will probably remember that after Our return from Dhofar in February last We received the letter addressed to Us by the Hon’ble the Political letter addressed to Us by the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in regard to the Coronation! 1 of His Majesty the King in London. In Our reply to him We mentioned that We would visit London when the opportunity offered and would then see His Majesty the King and have the pleasure of ills Majesty’s personal acquaintance ana that tnat meeting v.ould be a substitute for the meeting at the tiaa^ of ills Coronation. fou will also remember that while in Karachi some one and a half months ago at one of Our meetings a mention was made of Our visit to Knglanc in the course of a talk about Our visit to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General for India in November next. We tnen asked you how long a period was necessary to notiiy His Majesty's Government when Ke intended to proceed to England. You replied that We should notify them at least six months beforehand. There was no doubt that you understood that had the intention of going there. though you were not sure of it and did not know the time V,e intended to be in England. We ourselves were not sure about it and when it should be. So, We were not in a position to intimate it to you, but intended to inform you in good time when *Ve iaa$e Our a m - *- tion. Hence Our question as stated above. There is no doubt that Our travels in Surope is not a matter\#f secrecy and that We have to inform you if goon time, as We shall pass through your Possessions and shall request you to arrange the necessary facilities for Us when We are in your Countries. 5 # for Our writing a letter to Our the president of the U.S.A. and what We stated therein.\It is a/3. is a fact that We wrote a letter to hi* on the occasion of his assuaing the office of the President of the U.S.A. for the second time, offering Our congratulations. This We did in view of the bonds of friendship existing between Us and that Government since a long time. We took this opportunity and aentioned to him what you stated in your letter« that We Intended to travel in Kurope and suggested that fie might visit him in Amerl# to renew the bonds of friendship. ^is letter We wrote to him a few days after We had written Our reply to the Political R esident in the Persian Gulf's letter to which ; w# aave made a reference above. We thought When We decided to travel in Furooe the distance from there to the U.S.A. would be short and Wc could visit it at the same time. Te did not inform the Hon'ble the Political Resident of either of these projects, because, as We have already stated. We had not made Our decision. 6. There is no doubt that We realise what are the Treaty Relations that exist between Us and the British Government. We do not tninlt that Cur writing directly to the president of the U.S.A. would make a breach of the provisions of the Treaty. Further, as you are aware, there are Treaties between Us and she Governments of the U.S.A. and France and *e nave to write to them directly on certain occasions when necessity calls for it. rj. for previous communications on the suoject of the increase of the Muscat Tariff. That was done as a result of special representations made oy Our Government and not by the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for that matter only. We recognize the pains taken by the British Government over this question and Our benefitting therefrom, which is due to their kind and benevolent attitude*3, You stated that 91s Majesty’s Government would be grateful If We would Inform them through the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of any communication We intended to senJPto foreign Powers* We thank you for these expressions. You are well aware that at present We have no treaty relations with any foreign Powers but the U.8.A. and France with whom Our Government have since time long ago been communi cating directly in accordance with the treaty relations existing between Us and them* We do not want to incon venience the British Government with hvy communications but those which We consider ought to go through them. We are confident that the British Governaient would never agree that their officials should make such demands as neither Our predecessors nor Ourselves have been accus tomed to do 9 , There is no doubt that whenever fe have matters on which We think His Majesty’s Government should be consulted, We shall not fail to do so. At present there are no important com?nunications which We intend to make to 'iny foreign power that Wc should, according to the Hon’ble th*? Political Pesidentyask His Majesty’s Government to communicate with such Power on Our behalf. But should We have any such communi cations in future and We consider that It is in Our interests to send them through His Majesty’s Govern ment We would be pleased to do so, in view of th&lt;* advantages that this Hill give to Us, Otherwise We shall continue to act in accordance with the old pro cedure which ia usual to Our Government, and shall not in the least inconvenience His Majesty’* Government and their officials. 10 # We are well aware, as stated by you, oi all the common Interests and close relations existing12? - 5 - between Ua and Sit Majesty*? Government, and We are arrays observant of and following the path of friend ship and affection that bind Us with His Majesty*s Government, in accordance with the old conventions and even more* Moreover, We shall endeavour as far as possible to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Us and maintain the independence and interests of Our State* 11* How T?e would inform you to convey the follow ing to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for communication to Our friend the British Covern- ment:- God willingly and trusting in Almi%^ty God, We intend to visit His Excellency the Viceroy at Delhi in the month of November next, as We have NAready in formed you* This visit having been fulfilled, % shall proceed to Bombay in an unofficial capacity, thence m shall leave for the Far East to visit Our Lord and esteemed Father, which is 0 ur duty towards him (and We have already informed you of this). America being nearer from there We shall make Our way to it and visit His Excellency the President of the U.S.A., having intimated in Our letter to him that We would visit him when We visited Europe. Our intention formerly was to visit Europe first and then America, but as We have now decided to visit Our Father in the Far East, and in view of the short distance from there to America, Our arrival in England will be via those routes. $ r e do not want to return from the Far East to India and thence proceed to Europe, for this means a longer dis tance and We have not got the time for it, as We want to return esrly to Our State and pay attention to the many reforms of which it stands in need.Accordingly, Our arrival in London will, as We calculate, be in the middle of March 1938, when We shall he glad to meet His Majesty the King and make the acquaintance of the Leading Men of His M ajesty*s Cxovermaent, Our stay there will be for a short period according as His Majesty*s Government would advise, if they would he kind enough to do so. We shall then xeturn to Our State, passing through France and visit ing its President and some other European countries if opportunity offers and We consider it suitable at the time. This intimation is sent to you six and a half months before Our arrival in England. 13. We request you to enquire from His Majesty*s Government whether We shall be their guest during Out* stay in London, as was Our esteemed Father when he went for medical treatment. We would further request them kindly to arrange all necessary facilities for Us while We are in their Kingdom, We are no doubt causing His M ajesty*s Government and you a certain amount of in convenience by Our request for this. We are awaiting your reply regarding Our visit to England and other questions as detailed above. The object of these visits is to strengthen | and reinforce the bonds of friendship and affection and everything connected with the interests ot Our Government.

Date proposed for hia departure la likely to be inconvenient in that negotiations will still be afoot for revision of Muscat Commercial Treaty at express request of Sultan himself. Projected tour will take hia through Japan and America in depth of winter and bring hia to England at inclement time of year* Visit to the U.3.A. may possibly lead to some embarrassment, if question of tariff revision is under discussion as a result of negotiations for revision of his treaty *ith His Majesty^ Government. Finally owing to flultan’e protracted recess in Dhofar we have so littl. opportunity of maintaining touch with Mm ti»t renewed absence M this Juncture will certainly be ill-timed. Dultan is due to leave for Delhi on 7th November and, if n e adb*re. to hi 8 programme, he will be unable to meet the Resident again until he returns from hi 3 world tour. 6. Subject however to ?owl.* a views I reel that little is to be gained by placing these considerations before Tultan an i endeavouring to prevail on him to postpone his tour. * ^ *&gt;P. that treaty negotiations will be well on way before visit-3- to Oelni, and it would probably bo preferable to use some - theae argument a as mean a to induce Sultan to agree to continuation of present Treaty until sucft time as new agreement can taice anape. I therefore recoramend that sultan be informed tnat lid -c.j estj a uovernment are glad to near of nis projected visit and will welcome ftim as State guest* ills request to be received by his Majesty will no doubt receive consideration. 7.

The Sultan referred to his desire which he had mentioned he stated at his interview with His Excelxency ox* Dein^ ^ranuea a resumption of the Arms Subsidy, He said at the present time there was H a lack of rupees in his State and though hx its financial condition was just solvent, there were insufficient funds to carry out tne numerous measures required for its improvement and progress. Secretary pointed out that the Arms Traffic Subsidy was originally granted to theSultan's Father as a personal concession to compensate him for any losses he may have incurred over assisting the British Government to suppress the Arms Traffic. Secretary asked the Sultan if the Arms Warehouse in kuscat was still in use. The Sultan repxied that since his Father and himself had forbidden traffic in arms importers had given up using the warehouse but that if he removed the restriction he thought they would speedily resume trade in these articles. Secretary told the Sultan if he desired a resumption of ^he Arms Subsidy he should app^y formally through che usual channels stating the reasons he had mentioned in donversation; when uhe application was received question then would be given due consideration by the Government of India. Purcnase of Arma and Ammun it ion . The Sultan stated that he was desirous of purchasing some arms and aim-iunition for his State from the Government of India. Owing however to ’’lack of rupees’* he wanted to know whether he could have ”aasy terms** and pay in instalments. Secretary replied that if the ^ultan would write in officially mentioning his requirements his request would be sympathetically considered.(fa?) Reduction of Customs duty on Mus cat -^ates . The Sultan referred lo his request first made at his interview with His Excellency for a reduction on uhe Euty charged on dates imported into India from Muscat. Secretary said he would go into the question but explained that there were difficulties in the way owing to a number of agreements entered into by the Government of India with various Foreign Rowers by which they enjoyed most favoured nation treatment. Attitude of Kalat State towards Gwadur. The Sultan brought up tne question, which he had referred to in his interview with His Excellency, of what he declared was the blackade of Gwadur by the Kalat State Authorities. He asserted that both travellers and caravans with goods from the interior especially from Persian Baluchistan were being prevented from entering Gwadur. / Since it was such caravans who used also to take back goods ^ purchased in Gwadur into the interior, a considerable loss in revenue from customs duty was being suffered by his State. Secretary said that he had no information on this matter but that the action alleged to being carried out by the Kalat State was certainly not being none unaer instructions from the Government of India. ne would hov/ever have enquiries made in the case.• V r CONFIDENTIAL.
