Memorandum* A case has recently come to light in which a dealer here was clearing two cases through this Custom House for transhipment to Koweit. As no invoice was available,the merchant desired to place the cases in Bond,and asked for leave to repair one case as it was broken. During the process of repairing the case which was said to contain oriental goods, it was found that the case also contained arms and ammunition. On opening up both cases the contents were found to be as follows;- 268 Metal pots* 43 Aghals. 10 rifles. 26 Magazines* 65 bolts. 1040 rounds* The name of the Merchant here is named Abdul Mehsin El Saleh and he declares that he was quite ignorant of the contents of the cases and affirms that he was only acting as Clearing Agent for the owner of the goods who is said to be Saleh ibn Earaj El zinaidi of Koweit* The goods were shipped from Damascus via Beirut to Basrah by one Mohammed Abdulla Garawi of Damascus,who sent the Bill of Lading but no invoice. The merchant here states that he received Rs 120/- from Rashid Mohammed Almulhim for the necessary expenses of clearing the cases etc., I am not fully satisfied that the merchant here is so innocent of complicity in the matter as he affirms, he is a ^obeiri and is probably in close touch with Koweitmerchants. (2) I should be obliged if* you could make enquiries in Koweit in regard to this case and let me know the result* The cases have been confiscated and the merchant fined Rs500/- for misdederation.

Usual ending. \ CUSTOMS GUARDS’ FIGHT WITH KOWEITI SMUGGLERS. RIFLES AND AMMUNITION CAPTURED. A fight took place near Fao on Sunday evening between Customs golchis (guards) and gun-runners from Koweit. Acting on information received that a consignment of sugar had been despatched from Koweit with the intention of smuggling it into Iraq, the Customs officials at Fao sent out launch and foot patrols. The foot patrol discovered a boom in the Khor Abdullah. They attempted to board the vessel, but were fired on. In the fight that ensued between the Customs golchis, one of whom had a revolver, and the occupants of the vessel, the nokhada (skipper) was shot, and the golchis boarded the boom and captured three of the five persons on board the vessel. Fifteen English rifles and 500 rounds of ammu nition were also captured. The nokhada was taken to Fao hospital and, after examination by the doctor there, was sent in the customs launch to Basrah and admitted to the Maude Memorial Hospital. It is understood that the wound is not serious. [This is not the first time that Iraqi Customs men have clashed with smugglers from Koweit. The last occasion was on the day after the attack on Mr. Crane’s party, when six camel-loads of smuggled goods were captured at Safwan].TELEGRAM ' A FROE^.

Sir, V77&lt;r With reference to your memorandum No*' dated the 50th July 1951, I have the honour to inform you that I am given to understand that Hussain Jabir Tangistani ? used to smuggle arms into Persia years ago, but owing to stringent action taken by His Excellency the Shaikh to prevent the exportation of arms and also the vigilence of Persian Preventative Officers this practice ceased. The above mentioned man is not known as a resident of ku ait, # but was in the habit of smuggling tea and Sugar into Persia from here.

Dated the 26th September 1921 To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire MEMORANDUM z 1 . Reference your confidential No.595-S dated 9th September 1931 I have had an illuminating talk with His Excellency the Shaikh on the subject of the stolen ammunition, with special reference to the possibility of some of it having got across to Persia. evidence which he said had come to light that there was little doubt that the ammunition was made away with during the height of the Akhwan rebellion of 1929-30 and had practically all gone to the rebellious Mutair and Ajman tribes and when especially as in the autumn of 1929 Faisal al Duwish was straining every nerve to replenish supplies. The Shaikh was of opinion that the man Jaffar who was in charge of the Arsenal and Lewis Guns at the time could not resist the temptation of trying to make good money when the prices paid for good .303 ammunition were high. I am inclined to agree with His Excel lency’s view. cal Resident the Shaikh has succeeded in recovering all but 14,000 rounds of the ammunition. He has moreover made those of severe fines. He has also compelled them to pay for the still deficient rounds at the rate of Rs 25/- per 100 cartridges. 2 The Shaikh informed me in the light of further 3 For the information of the Hon’ble the Politi- who confessed to purchasing the rounds pay heavily for dealing in goods which they must have known were stolen, bi| bu a series 4 The man Jaffar is of course still in prison Political Agent, Kuwait . .3 » • # \1 !*&gt; ' ,y Forwarded under Bushire Confidential. (Portion about Slave Traffic of File IX/(lM 7' is at page y ILLICIT a:&lt;ms TRAFFIC The Anns Traffic Convention of the 17th June,1925 la not in force* nevertheless, in taking steps for the prevention of the illicit traffic in arms by native vessels, the procedure laid down in this Convention should be followed. By this Convention, H. M* Ships have the right only to * verify the flag in native vessels under 500 tons which fly the flag of one of the parties to the Convention. Under this convention, if no authority to fly the flag is forth coming, or if, in spite of such authority, strong suspicion still exists that the vessel is carrying an illicit traffic in arms and ammunition, she may be conducted to the nearest port of the Power whose flag she has flown. Ho right of search is given by the Convention. 2. By custom, however, native vessels within the Persian Gulf may be searched for arms except as stated in the following paragraphs. If native vessels searched are found to be carrying a greater number of arms than is necessary for the normal crew, it may be assumed that, in the absence of a special license, they are doing so illegally and any rifles or pistols ( but not swords or daggers } in excess of this number should be confiscated.4- 5. If any considerable quantity of arms is found on board* or if there is a strong suspicion that the vessel is engaged in illegal traffic in arms or ammunition* the procedure laid down in Annex II* Section II, of the Arms Traffic Convention is to be carried out in the case of vessela flying the flag of one of tne signatories to that Convention or flying no flag. 4. The search of Persian vessels for arms could in case of need be justified by an arrangement made with Persia in 1897 which has never been cancelled; but it would be a mistake to appeal to this arrangement at the present time* when there appears to be no extensive illegitimate traffic in arms; the Persian Government would undoubtedly repudiate it if brought to their notice. The existence of this 1897 arrangement might be extremely useful later in the event of a growth of the traffic,e.g. for re-exporta tion to India or Afghanistan. Persian vessels should therefore not be searched for arms in Persian territorial waters, and on the high seas only where definite informa tion or very strong suspicion exists. 5. His Majesty’s Government have no jurisdiction over ’Iraq vessels and no jurisdiction over vessels in ’Iraqi territorial waters. Ho steps have been taken to apply the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919 to ’Iraq* as it has never entered into force; His Majesty’s Government therefore have no power under ’Iraqi municipal law to enforce the stipula tions of the Convention in ’ Iraqi territorial waters. As regards the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925* although the signature of the British representative purports to cover ’Iraq* it was subsequently realised that it was constitution ally impossible for His Majesty’s Government to accede to International **•International Agreements on behalf of 'Iraq and it is proposed that the necessary steps shall be tauten, as soon as the Convention enters into force, to remove ’Iraq from the special zone* In practice the authorities of the Port of Basrah could arrange for action to be taken in ’Iraqi national waters in cases of importance. 6, As regards * Iraqi vessels on the high seas, no change should be made in the present practice, although the legal position is doubtful. In ’Iraqi territorial waters no action should be taken except in great emergency and then in consultation with the Port of Basrah authorities. 7 , Nejdi dhows should as a general rule be exempted from supervision within Sejdi territorial waters. A summary of the special agreements giving E.M.. Ships powers to search vessels suspected of being engaged in illicit traffic in arms is given in the attached Appendix.APPBTOI^, STATBMEKT SilOtYISG SPECIAL AtgCTiir^TS fllViao H.M.

Sir, With reference to your despatch No 15.9/657/S dated 8th October 1931 to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires -Tehran, a copy of which was sent to me, i have the homuE to say that 1 have been able to obtain facts of the case , the prisoners, as reported in para 105 of my diary for September, having been brought to Ahwaz. The merchants now in the military prison, Ahwaz, are Johar Tujar Koweiti, Harbalayeh Hashem and Kara- -balayeh Ali, both of Hindian. Whether Johar is actually a Koweiti or not I cannot say, he may be a Persian, but he is known as I have said above. He and his family have been settled in Koweit for man;y years * now. 1 cannot give actual dates but, at some time, the Eeis-i-Tip here received information that fifty rifles were to be shipped from Koweit to Persia. It seems that this information was sent in the form of at* circular report by a Persian agent in Koweit. recipients of the information were the Customs authori- -ties at Mohammerah, the Governor of that place, also authorities at Sushire and probably other officials in the Gulf. The mohailla was unloaded at some unknown place2 . place and the merchandise put onjto donkeys and mules and moved into the low hills near the coast where apparently most of it was sold or otherwise dispoded of. 1 he shipment was sugar, coffee and piece goods but of course whether in the hags sold in the hills there were rifles is not known yet. It seems quite prohahle that there were. Certainly the Bais-i-Tip is demanding forty rifles from Johar Tujar. The remainder of the goods was again loaded on t to donkeys and moved to ards Hindian. un the way a night was passed in the house of one Naghidash at a village known as Hindian Kucheck, prohahly a small village on the Bushire side of the Hindian river, opposite Hindian. During the night Naghidash went to the Governor of Hindian who in consequence pro- -ceeded to the house of Naghidash , fined Johar and the two Eindianis, gave a receipt and confiscated the merchandise. Three rifles and about five hundred cartridges loose in a hag were found concealed. On the Bais-i-Tip hearing bf the capture he sent a Captain, Lotfullah Kha+i, arrested the three merchants and brought them to Ahwaz together with the rifles and ammunition. In the meantime another merchant of the party, Ali Tangistani Kov/eiti, together with the brother ‘of Mehrab, had run away, it is said to Koweit. Ali Tangastani like Johar, may not he a Koweiti but I am told^he has been living there for a long time. Aehrab is a furrash of the Ahwaz Customs House. The source of my information in this matter may be considered quite reliable. j-here is no doubt that a case of contraband trading has been discovered and also there seems but little doubt that men associ -ated with Koweit are partially responsible tor it.

If you will glance at the following correspon dence, I think you will appreciate that Kuwait is and has taken all proper precautions to see that no anas find their way to the IBAq tribes:- (1) Para 48 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.5. (2) Parc 88 ) (o) (d) of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No* 8 . (3) My D.O. (Confidential) No.C-175 dated 10th June 1935 to the P.a. 3* As regards Watts* par., 3. In para 48 of Summary 5 mentioned in 2(1) above I stated rather stupidly that; there were half a dozen local gunsmiths Lieut. J.E.A. Bazalgette, I.A., Secretary to the Hon * ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I B B .gunsmiths in Kuwait etc* etc. This was a mistake on my part and was due to the fact that X was speaking in geneml terms only: To be exact there are two 'tin pot' Bedouin, local gunsmiths in Kuwait, who are 'Sanas' by profession, which to the uninitiated means that they are of the class who make horse shoes and deal generally in iron repair work and smelting. They are considered to be a low class « of person and no one will intermarry with them, 4 # The two shops referred to do a certain amount of cheap end crude 'repair' work to rifles of Bedouins coming in from the interior of Arabia including Kuwait Bedouins, They are also permittee to sell old shotguns and a certain number of broken down rifles that have been left in 'pawn' by Be&lt; ouin who are unable to redeem them, g # You of course realise that every self respecting Bedouin in the uhole peninsular of Arabia, always more about with a rifle. It would be unsafe for him to do otherwise; These persons must have place to get petty repairs done to their weapons - Hence the existence of the small repair shops in Kuwait. Similar shops of course exist in every town in Nejd and also in every village and tribe in IRAQ. 6 . You may explain to Colonel Fowle from me,tbet he need have no anxiety at all as to there being an arms trade between3- between Kmolt and the IBAq tribes or Ihat the two miserable shops mentioned above repair rifles for IRAQ tribes. The suggestion is absurd on the face of it. 7. Do not forget also that IRAQ, in her fixed policy of discrediting Kuwait will use any 'stick' she can lay hands on to beat Kuwait with. 8 # Believe me ?&amp;en I say that IRAQ, already has all the rifles she oan ever possibly want among her tribes, and tip top ones they are at that. Should these tribes ever went to renew their stock they have only to tap inner Hejd^, through suoh tribes as the Shamnar who keep one foot in IRA^ and another in NeJd. The latter have several underground routes for passing up rifles from Saudi Arabia and even Yemen to the ilorth* 9. Speaking ganeraUy, hew ever, and X say this with the confidence of one who has studied the rifles business in and the desert for the last 15 yeers, the riiles in the possession of the IRA.,, tribes, ure so far superior to the article owned by the Hedouin of Arabia, as to mate the IRA^I tribesmen always disinclined to deal with the desert man: The great war gave IRAQ all the rifles she will want for this generation and anything the IRAQ tribes ewer hand in to Government, in a moment of excess seal is either Q; ft if ieither an out of date or worn out article or is something bought from the Desert Bedouin especially to use as a 'handing In' weapon: The good weapons are never handed in nor have they been by the recent Rumaitha and Suk Esh Shuyukh rebels, whatever the victorious Generals may say. 10* Another point to remember is that the IRAQ tribes man knows how to look after his good weapon and keeps it cleaned and properly oiled. The Bedouin scarcely ever cleans his 'gun' from the day he acquires it f and the rifling in consequence goes very rapidly. Yours sincerely, is \ p.S . You nay or you may not laiow It, but I lived for 8 years among the tribes of the Lliddle and lower Euphrates, (3 years of this alone) and I devoted my time then to knowing the tribes not Just supeficially, but really intin&amp;tely, so if I ru&amp;y say so without appearing to boast, I know something of what I am discussing*Translation of a letter No. R-4/2171, dated the 4th Jamad Thani 1354, corresponding to the 3rd September 1935, from His Excellency the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

Secondly , a consignment of 20 boxes containing 10,000 shotgun cartridges arrived for Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Ghanim on s.s. Uhenfels, This, the consignee admits, was imported without a licence, because my brother H.E. Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir promised to give him a letter to you, permit ting the import of the goods. The consignee, therefore, rely ing upon the Shaikh’s promise, ordered the abovementioned amount of cartridges from Germany. His agent there at once shipped the goods before he received further advice on the matter. Accordingly, I have now given strict orders to the Director of Customs to observe such goods carefully and inform me of anything imported before obtaining the necessary licence. Further I propose that any consignment whose owner : is not in possession of a licence to import it, should be seired and further a customs duty of 15 $ be imposed on it, so that nobody will dare to import such goods without a licence.

In reply to your letter No.C~270, dated the 11th Jamad Thani 1354 (1GU9,35), I have pleasure in agree ing with you in connection with the arms and ammunition, that what I have proposed of the imposition of a lb % customs duty will not, you consider, he a sufficient punishment to one who intends smuggling, and that anything in the arms line that is imported without first obtaining a licence, must be confiscated. In view of my late grandfather Shaikh Mubarak’s undertaking to His Majesty’s Government in this connection, I have issued my orders to the Director of Customs to v/atch very carefully the import of such goods, and to confiscate any consignment that is imported without a licence.

In paragraph 526, as you will see, it is stated thfcit supplies of arms appear to be received from the Persian Gulf. If it is meant that arms come from the Persian side, then it is no concern of mine. If, however, the Arab side is implicated, then Kuwait is the obvious Shaikhdora from tfhich arras would have been smuggled, and in this connection I enclose an extract from a report by de Gaury of a conversation which he had In Kuwait with the new Iraqi Foreign Minister, Asil.

I have replied orally th^t best way to deal with matter and to safeguard all rights is to adopt land settlement procedure set out in Bateman's letter So.347 of July 8th, 1936. 3. Sinister for Foreign Affairs retorts that he has no nope of being able to persuade the Prime Minister to agree to these proposals so long as the Shaikh of Kuwait refuses to take effective measures to stop smuggling. (There is fresh irritation on this point as Iraqi Government strongly suspect tht rifles are being sent from Kuwait to Suphrates tribes). 4 . if I now take the line indicated in your despatch Mo.262 of April 27th 1936, Iraqi Government will probably reply by amending law in such a manner as to provide a legal method of proceeding with cases without service of documents or by r j nnt f»nl£ir£C@ on difficulties to substituted service.

Mr. Walton. f' 0 I « SW ... .«» j/sootf . reading of Dr. Naji’s statement (vide para. 3 of Mr. Scott’s -r letter of 3rd September). The statement made by Dr. Naji is contained in para. 9 Political ^ent, Koweit telegram No. 324 of 10 th November, 1936, (P.Z.8744/36). The Mutassarifs report is give'ri in Ambassador, Bagh- dad, telegram of 7th November 1936 (P.Z.8534/36), and consists of a bald statement that arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq has started again. This is the report (together with other reports) which Dr. Naji denies are correct. How in these circumstances Mr. Scott can read into Dr. Naji’s denial merely 'an admission that re ports of open and active encouragement given by the Shaikh to a rms smuggling were unfounded' personally I do not understand. As for Mr. Scott further saying 'doubtless if Dr. Naji went any further he was not reflecting the view of the matter usually taken in Iraq', it seems to me that a d efinite statement by a r I o ? responsible Iraqi official who at that time held the important post of Foreign Minister jmist have consider- ably more weight than the vie^ of other individuals. As I have pointed out in para. 3 of my letter of June 8 th (P. Z.4378/37), the Iraqi Government are c ontinually bringing accusations against Koweit of arms traffic without producing any proof, and I regard Dr. Naji’s statement as of considerable importance as a protection against such vague accusations. I deprecate very strongly any attempt to whittle Dr. Naji’s statement away/-away, and, if you agree, I suggest that the F.O* might oe informed that the 1 * 0 , do not agree with Mr. Scott’s viev/s on this point, 2. With regard to the particular arms smuggling incident reported in Mr, Scstt’s letter already quoted, I agree that we might await the result of local investi gat ion. I may point out, however, that the Iraqi report of the incident is, as usual, unsatisfactory. The incident is alleged to have taken place on the 15th July, and their report is dated 31st August, i.e. six weeks later. Neither the names of the two Bedouins or their tribes are given, nor is it stated whether they are Iraqi or Koweiti subjects. The make of tie two rifles is also omitted. Before forwarding the Iraqi complaint I think the Embassy might have app roached the Iraq authorities for these furtherdatails. However, doubtless Mr. Caroe will asl£ for them, Sd/- T.C. Fowle.

My dear Baggallay, A week a ^° tlle Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke : to me about the vexed question of smuggling from Koweit. He revive:! the pro osal that the Iraqi Government should ta^e over control of the Koweiti customs, impose the Iraqi tariff and compensate the Shaikh for whatever he might lose through such an arrangement. I made little or no comment other than to say that I would consider the matter. I see now from the Embassy archives that similar suggestions were put forward by the Iraqi Government so long ago as 1932* The Shaikh, however, was obstinately evasive and avoided giving e direct reply. In the early part of 1934 an effort was made to persuade him to send a representative to a conference at which inter alia ideas of this kind were to be discussed, but he wriggled out at the last moment and the conference was abandoned.

Variations of the same proposals were put forward once again hy the Embassy in February 1935, but the foreign Office, in their telegram Ho. 77 of March 1st, 1935, indicated that they were open to the gravest objections from the political roint of view, 'since they would lead to the acquisition by Iraq of a degree of influence in Koweiti affairs which is quite incompatible with the declared policy of Hie Majesty's Government as regards the independence of Koweit.

You will note that Eowle is satisfied that there is no traffic in arms from Koweit into Iraq and his opinion as to this would appear to gain support from the statement in Admiralty letter No, M. 03097/38 of the 4th August that ,f few if any arms enter Koweit by sea”. As regards the reports that arms traffic passes through Koweit ? you will see that Eowle argues ? not unconvincingly ? that in all probability the bulk of the traffic passes into Iraq over the Saudi-Iraq border or through the Saudi-Iraq Neutral Zone. As to the original source of these arms you will see that Eowle is of opinion that enquiries as to the amount of traffic through J.edda might throw some light on the question. J - Baggallay, Esq. ?

On the subject of the alleged smu^glin._, of arms from or through Koweit into Iraq the views of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf have recently been expressed in the correspondence resting with his demi-official letter of the 7th October, -No. 0/744. It is clear from this correspondence that the smuggled arms do not enter Kov/eit by sea but come (if they enter Koweit ai all) from Saudi Arabia. The information available to the Royal Air Force in Iraq does not suggest that the armo are dealt with by Koweiti middlemen, while the Political Resident finds it difficult to understand why ams traffickers on the way from Saudi Arabia to Iraq should , -&gt;-i ■R’vp'nifitis the case enter Koweit territory at all. Even i , _^am„ 4 a carried on by that the alleged iluicio arms Glc ~ isolated parties passing through the desert parts ^ of Koweit on their way from Saudi Araoia -o secretary to the ^overument of India, , , External Affairs Department. 1 ,s. seems unreasonable to expect the Sheikh, v/ith the moans at his disposal, to control traffic across the Saudi- Kov/eit frontier when the Iraqis, with their greatly superior resources and the frontier customs police organisation w •icn oney nov/ maintain, are apparently unaole to cneck the illicit traffic in arms across their own frontier. 3. It will however he seen from the enclosures to the Foreign Office letter that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Adviser in the Ministry of the Interior are convinced (though definite evidence was not adduced by them) that the smuggling of arms across the Kowoit-Iraq frontier has assumed serious proportions, and assert that it is facilitated by the fact that Xoweit has become a recognised market for the sale of arms where they can be bought freely and cheaply. The Secretary of State feels that it is impossible to dismiss lightly this very definite conclusion formed by the Iraqi authorities, contrary though it is to the viewo exuxe.joed by the Political Resident in his letter of the 1th October, referred to above, and should there be ane foundation in fact for their description o._ the situation in Koweit, he would share the d-^quiet which it is viewed hy the Foreign Office. Sven though it may ho admitted that the responsihili gy for tnc control of their own frontier rests with the Iraqi , ■&gt; . u tt- i o Mn iestv* s G-overnmen b Government, it is clear the could not expose themselves to the reproach --that they are tolerating the existence, in a State under taox* protection,3 . indirectly contributes a menace to the security of a neighbouring State. I am therefore to request that the political Resident may he ashed to make further investigation into the matter in the light of the Iraqi Minister’s contentions^ so far as may he possible pending the production of any detailed evidence which the Iraq authorities may he able to supply. Even if further examination tends to confirm the statement made by the Political Resident in his express letter -'h ■ $ $ a of the 21st July^No. 427.S. to the Air Officer Commanding Iraq that nobody in Koweit from the Sheikh downwards, obtain any profit from this traffic, or is in any way engaged in it, the Secretary of State feels that it is desirable, if only to provide an effective answer to the Iraqi allegations, that we should satisfy ourselves that the control of the sale of arms in Soweit is adequate, and it will be observed that the Foreign Office have promised that further consideration should be given to the suggestion made by Major Edmonds to tnis ex feet. The Secretary of State will therefore be i- 1 ^ ie Government of India will consider, in consultation with the Political Resident, whether some stricter form of control is necessary and if so what measures can 'be devised for the purpose* In seeking the conse of the Sheikh to action of this nature it would be relevant to remind him ox the proclamation iss ed his predecessor in 1900 in pursuance of his undertaking to prohibit absolutely the importation o- '-rn s Koweit or the exportation of arms therefrom (vide Aitchison XI pp* 262 f•) 4./4* The representations of His excellency TaufiQ_ Suwaidi on the general question of smuggling from Ho we it into Iraq are discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office letter. The complaints of the Iraqi Government against the Sheikh on this account are of long standing? and the failure of the repeated attempts to mediate a settlement v/hich were made in the past? and particularly in 1934 and 1935? does not greatly encourage the hope of a solution 'being found until the h! ockade imposed Toy Saudi Arabia on imports from Koweit has been removed. He is aware in particular? that objection has been raised in the past to proposals? such as that of Major Edmonds? to raise the Koweit tariff to the level of that of Iraq? on the grounds that it would conflict with the treaty obligation (arising from the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907) to limit the Koweit duty on goods imported by British subjects to 4H , that it would cause discontent in'Koweit through the resultant rise in prices? and that it would seriously effect legitimate trade with uhe interior. But the situation in which a State under the protection of His Majesty’s Government profits from smuggling goods into the territory of an ally of His Majesty’s Government is patently unsatisfactory? and as the negotiations for the removal of the Saudi blockade are bound to take some further time the Secretary of State would, bo glad if the Government of India in consuluation aith the Political Resident would review the question and state whether in their opinion any measures can usefully I5 % og suggested a t this stage tor adoption 'by the Sheikh with the object of reducing the extent of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. 5. Copies of this letter and its enclosures are being sent to the Political Resident aid the Political Agent ? Koweit. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) R. PEEL •» 1 ■J(E 5705/75/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 1 19th October, 1938. Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith for the consideration of the Marquess of Zetland a copy of a memorandum which the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated to the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva before his recent visit to London to serve as a basis for his discussions here with His Majesty’s Governmento It will be observed that in section 3 of this memorandum Taufiq Suwaidi raised the question of the legal status of the Sheikhdom of Koweit and made certain alternative suggestions for the solution of the ^ problem of the smuggling and illegal arms traffic which is alleged to take place from Koweit into Iraq; these were: (a) A customs union between Iraq and Koweit: (b) The cession to Iraq of the northern part of Koweit in order to facilitate police operations, and (c) Combined preventive operations. It will be seen from the enclosed copies of the records of the three conversations which Taufiq Suwaidi had in this department that His Excellency indicated that he did not wish to insist on discussing the Question of the international status of Koweit, hut that he strongly urged that further effort should he made to remove what the Iraqi Government considered as their legitimate grievan in the matter of smuggling and arms traffic from the Sheikhdom. 2./ Under-Secretary of State India office.2* It will further toe seen that TaufiqL Suwaidi, while ready to accept the statement of the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that no arms are imported into Koweit toy sea, maintained that there was at present nothing to prevent the purchase of arms in Koweit and said that it was common knowledge that arms traffic from Koweit into Iraq, takes place on a large scale. The Iraqi Government may possitoly in due course produce the evidence of this for which Taufiq Suwaidi was asked, tout it appears to Lord Halifax that in view of the positive statements on the subject made not only toy Taufiq Suwaidi tout also toy Major Edmonds, the adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, who accompanied His Excellency on the second of his visits to the Foreign Office, there is every likelihood that Koweit is in fact used as a centre at which arms can conveniently toe toought. This is a position which causes Lord Halifax some disquiet, having regard to the serious view which His Majesty's Government have in the past always taicen of their responsibility for checking the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and to the harmful effect on security in Iraij which illegal importation of arms into that country must be expected to have. His Lordship trusts, therefore, that early and sympathetic consideration may be given to the suggestion, made by Major Edmonds, that the sale of arms in Koweit should be subjected to some strict form of Government control. 3. ns far as other forms of smuggling are concerned, it will be seen that it was not possible to give iaufiq. Suwaidi any promise of satisfaction along the lines which he had suggested in his memorandum, and that Major Edmonds/ i 1 v l? 4 /Edmonds then made a further suggestion to the effect that, since the main cause of smuggling into IracL is the low level of the Koweiti tariff, the difficulty might he overcome if the Koweiti customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraq_i tariff* I am to add that in a subsequent conversation Major Edmonds expressed the opinion that if it proved impracticable to raise the tariff level of all goods imported into Koweit, it might remove at least the main causes of friction if an increase of tariff were made on the products, such as tea, sugar, etc*, which are at present smuggled in the greatest quant ities* 4. Lord Halifax is of course aware that it is for the Iraqi Government in the first place to ensure that smuggling into their territory does not take place, and he has not failed to Impress this fact on them, both through His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and now in London. Nevertheless, it is impossible to deny that the consistent refusal of the Sheikh to take, or even to discuss, any practical measures to cooperate with the Iraqi Government in this matter is not consistent with the relations which normally exist between neighbouring countries. Nor can it be denied that His Majesty s Government must accept some degree of responsibility in matter since, but for their protection of the Sheikh, the Iraqi Government would no doubt find the means of inducing him to adopt a more accommodating ana friendly attitude. In view, indeed, of the special relationship of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit, and of their .alliance with Iraq, His Lordship regards the existing position as particularly unfortunate, since it inevitably doubts/doubts in Iraq as to the extent to which it is x^ossihle to rely on the friendship of His Majesty’s Government, end their willingness to provide their ally with reasonable assistance in the protection of Iraqi interests. I am therefore to express the hope that careful consideration may he given to the possibility of taking some action on the lines suggested by Major Edmonds. If no such action proves practicable, Lord Halifax will be grateful for any alternative suggestions that Lord Zetland may be able to maxe with a view to checking smuggling from Koweit, and thus removing what the Iraqi Government undoubtedly consider to be a legitimate grievance.

Before definite later stage proposals to this effect could be made, however, various practical difficulties would } 00 en ^ have to be examined. During a recent tour of the Middle East undertaken by Ins would the Under-Secretary of State for Air, a senior officer of the Air Ministry ff accompanied him to discuss this problem with the authorities in Iraq, but unfortunately, owing to the international crisis, they had to be recalled when they had got as far as Palestine. But the British authorities would continue to consider the question as rapidly as possible. forab Taufiq Suwaidi said that this was an entirely new suggestion, and he could not say how the Iraqi Government would regard it. He would at once telegraph to Bagdad and might possibly receive some indication of the Iraqi Government’s views in the course of a day or two.

Such a gesture on their part would be much appreciated in Iraq. Koweit. (The Secretary of State, in the course of his meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister in the morning of the 4th October, had told his Excellency that His Majesty s Government would find it difficult to admit any Iraqi claim, if the Iraqi Government were ever to put forward such a claim, to sovereignty over Kpweit; and the Iraqi Foreign Minister had agreed not to insist on discussing this point, to which a reference had been made in the aide-memoire which he had communicated as a basis for discussion.)

Thii it-third of ''Uottieshe^ Mr. Baxter referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi s aide-memoire to Jxoweit as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. He would like to considei, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic m arms into Iraq. Hitherto, he believed, His Majesty’s Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, a png place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be a 1 lr J sune that no arms were now entering Koweit, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Koweit. Taufiq Suwaidi replied that the Iraqi Government were convinced that arms smugg mg from Koweit into Iraq had, in fact, assumed serious proportions, and he thought that the Iraqi Government could produce evidence of this. He was, m any case, quite certain that arms were on sale in Koweit in large quantities an at very cheap prices, and that there was nothing to prevent anyone who liked from buying arms freely in the open market and trying to smuggle them across the Iraqi frontier. J &amp; &amp; Major Edmonds added that, to his personal knowledge, as a result of his I f^ a u° nS W -n^ ^ ra r d^ tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an uy a rifle m Koweit for £5 or £6 and to travel with it to Iraq, where bsjf Suwai ; ®1 Koweit i * this alter] hter p We under fen put j Non thal ^ reached a] 111 Cockade I, Suwt Koweit; Helr a( P r oposei p W it b) coi W We ‘'ttoagts 130 e-j\ 3 m ^ 01 '' he would sell it for about twice that amount. The fact was that Koweit had ficult : become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, 'ed went to purchase arms. He was quite prepared to believe that the British ' L d authorities in the Persian Gulf were right when they said that no arms entered Koweit by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were Available for sale in Koweit. Mr. Boater said that His Majesty’s Government would certainly be prepared to give the whole question their earnest attention if the Iraqi Government would, in fact, be good enough to produce all the evidence in their possession. At a later stage in the discussion, Major Edmonds suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to consider a solution whereby substan tial restrictions would be placed on the sale of arms in the Koweiti market. He thought that in Muscat, before the war, His Majesty’s Government had insisted that all the arms available for sale in that territory should be collected and stored in one special warehouse under Government supervision, and that the sale of these arms should be subjected to some form of Government control. He suggested that some such system in Koweit might be the most effective method of dealing with the situation which had arisen. jects.

As regards other forms of smuggling, Mr. Baxter wished to point out in the first Diace that it was really entirely for the Government of a country to see that smuggling into its territory did not take place. The Iraqi Foreign Minister had nut forward three suggestions. The first was for a customs union between Iraq and Koweit. This did not seem to His Majesty’s Government to be an acceptable solution, since such an arrangement between a large State like Iraq and a sma State like Koweit might be expected to undermine the independence of the smaller State. Taujiq Suwaidi said that he did not think that there was much foundation for this fear. He said that for many years now the Iraqi authorities had ru Koweiti postal administration. This had not he thought, to the political position of the sheikhdom, and he did not see ^ ^ any difference if the Iraqi authorities also took over i m TnTu administration Koweit would, of course, be offered a fixed annual sum i aommistration. ivoweiu wul , , h f Koweitis themselves would of its present customs revenue.

The main cause of the smuggling was that the Koweiti tariff was so low. He thought that possibly the Sheikh of Koweit was precluded from raising it by his treaties with His Majesty’s Government. If it was impossible to agree to a customs union between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Iraqi Government, could it not at least be arranged that the two Administrations, even though remaining entirely independent, should impose the same tariff, i.e., the Iraqi tariff ? Jed the she ifarbah and i mal side tc ■idently Taufiq Suwaidi added that in that case the Iraqi Government would no i . doubt wish to assure themselves that the higher tariff was being applied in Koweit ^ s( l uestl( in fact as well as in theory, and also that smuggling into Koweit was not taking place on a large scale. He thought that this difficulty might be overcome if an Iraqi customs, official, perhaps one of the British officials attached to the Iraqi customs administration, could be attached to the Koweiti customs administration. Mr. Baxter undertook that this suggestion would be examined further. t replie ifroach shod' tyhmidi u “JJfioach the to privately w igagreemer rile sheikh. 1 7a qi Government s Wish jor a new Port on the Persian Gulf.

Taufq Suwaidi replied with references to the violent tendencies of Persian po icy as directed by the present Shah. He referred to the difficulties that had already arisen with Persia regarding the Shatt-el-Arab, and to the use of that waterway by Persian warships. ji the know ■wposals woul !r replie ^ place bet Mr. Baxter suggested that in time of peace it was improbable that Persian wars ups would commit hostile acts against Iraqi shipping using the waterway e ween asia and the sea.

Mr. Baxter suggested that first it would be necessary for the Iraqi Govern ment to decide exactly what they would have to ask from the Sheikh of Koweit If they wished the sheikh to cede to them a part of his territory, e.g., the small island of Warbah and the navigable channel between that island and the open sea, Dv they would have to make an offer to compensate him elsewhere. For this purpose acil $tolS!iit would be desirable that the Iraqi Government’s offer should be made as tD0 ^fe|attractive as possible to the sheikh; it would be well that the compensation offered should quite evidently exceed in value the territory which they were asking the sheikh to cede. i Gover* 1 Taufiq Suwaidi asked if he might get into direct touch with the Sheikh of Koweit on this question. Koweit k Mr. Baxter replied that His Majesty’s Government would prefer that any official approach should be made through them. Taufiq Suwaidi urged, nevertheless, that he might be allowed in the first Gul, place to approach the Sheikh of Koweit, whom he knew personally, and discuss the matter privately with him. He was sure that this would be the best procedure for reaching agreement. He, as a fellow Arab, would know how best to put the matter to the sheikh, and induce him to accept some reasonable arrangement. But would like to be able to tell the sheikh that this private approach was being made with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government. The nt’slearc official proposals would be made later, and through us if we wished. Mr. Baxter replied that he must maintain the view that any official approach should be made through His Majesty’s Government, and added that further con sideration would be given to the proposal that a preliminary private discussion should take place between Taufiq Suwaidi and the sheikh, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government.

(No. 568.) gj r Foreign Office, October 11, 1938. 5 THE Iraqi Foreign Minister called on me again on the 10th October at the end of his official visit to this country. 2. His Excellency first mentioned the problem of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. He had, since his previous conversation with me on the 4th October, discussed this difficulty with the competent Department in the Foreign Office, and he wished to press for the adoption of a solution, one of several that had been discussed whereby the tariff in Koweit should be increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. He reminded me that I had at our previous interview expressed the hope that, if legal issues concerning the status of Koweit could be set aside, it might be’ found possible to reach some agreement on other points affecting relations between Iraq and Koweit, including this question of smuggling. I assured his Excellency in reply that his suggestion would be carefully examined 3. Taufiq Suwaidi then referred to British policy in 1 aiestine, and said that he had been a little disappointed with the result of his yceCTitconvei'satioii with the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He appreciated that the Woodhead Commission had’not yet completed their report, and that it was therefore impossible for His Majesty’s Government now to reach a final decision as regalds then future policy. At the same time, he thought that His Majesty s government ought now to decide on the policy which they wou!d adopt if the commission were to report that partition was impracticable. He had P ut fo ' ¥&lt; j , suggestions to Mr. MacDonald, but had received no indication that they weie likely to be acceptable. Alternatively, the Woodhead Commission mig rep^ in favour of partition, and he wished to enquire whether, if His Majesty s Government decided to proceed on that basis, i wou , P K wag c j ear Palestine to join with some neighbouring Arab State i g a i that a small Arab State in Palestine would not be abl « to stand a e £ 4. I replied that I had read with interest the which ^ State for the Colonies had made of his conversation W1 _ ^ to ta p e a Palestine. It was true that His MajestyGovern^ to take^a rewived^o? 11 considered IrGofn'woXaTs' report. The ’ whole situation however, would manifestly hf,® b \ C Sency d S “cent “nlerttion at the thought, if I might say so that fuSi^rwhich he had put forward Colonial Office had been most helpful. 1 gg course and I personally had would certainly receive oonsiderat ^ might ’ he found , which would every hope that a solution of this aimci P i • Kxcellencv’s further be reasonable and fair to all concerned. ^ ^ ^ ar tjt,inn I thought it be reasonable ana lair lo clit f nartition, I thought it question, respecting the P^Hon of . ^ the pro blem at the present stage, would be premature to consider this a p r • J Excellency had made at 5. I proceeded to refer to the remaf^ whm^his '^7^ that H is our previous conversation regarding tn c ta u p initiative in endeavouring Majesty’s Government would not feel ^ ^ of part ition to secure a final settlement tbe T ^ ^ if n we re at any time found that between Turkey and Syria; but I re parties chiefly concerned, partition was acceptable to Turkey an ^ not see an y objection to such a His Majesty’s Government for their part would not y .1 proposal. ^ -yit which his Excellency had raised at 6.

His 3 1 ,' !■ | S\'2 bring to the notice of the French Government the anxiety which his hxcellency had expressed, more especially as regards the position in the Jezireh, and to HO. ask for any information which the French Government could give them as to the progress of negotiations. Taufiq Suwaidi observed that he had hoped that U His Majesty’s Government would have felt able, not merely to pass on the Iraqi) Government’s views and misgivings, but also actively to endorse them. I replied that an enquiry on the lines suggested would no doubt suffice to induce the French Government to examine carefully the Iraqi Government s point of view, and ^ that I thought that he would regard this as satisfactory. 7. I then raised the question of the Iraqi Government’s participation in the Empire Air Mail Scheme. I said that I did not intend to go into details, but only to say that this question had now been under consideration for a very long time, that the original British proposals had been modified on several ( occasions to meet what were believed to be the Iraqi Government’s wishes, and !l that I understood that the latest British offer represented the limit to which the British authorities were prepared to go. We therefore hoped to hear soon that the present proposals, which were thought likely to benefit the interests both of Iraq and of this country, were acceptable to the Iraqi Government. Taufiq Suwaidi replied that he would certainly look into the matter on his return to Bagdad. 8. Finally, Taufiq Suwaidi expressed his thanks for everything that had been done for him during his week’s visit, which he had greatly appreciated. I am, &amp;e.

It has therefore be .n unable to accept tarious proposals which have been put forward in the past for a special 'Air Defence i’orce' which would, except in name, be indistinguishable from the present bevies, the existence of which it was the intention to terminate* 4. - X therefore request His Majesty’s Govern ent to agree that the guards shall be detached from one or ot.i. r of the following Iraqi forces: (a) The regular Iraqi army (in which case the Iraqi ' Government agree that the Commanding Officer | shall be a British Officer attached to the British Military Mission) ; or, (b) The Iraqi Police who, through the Directorate | General, are under the control of the Ministry of the Interior*NO. 2 - QV^KRSHIP OF THK LANDS OCCUPIED BY THK P-)RT OF BAQRA . The continued registration of the lands occupied by the Port of Basra in the name of His Majesty’s Government as owner, is an anachronistic survival from the days of the Mandate. It is considered that registration in the name of the Iraqi Govern ent should no longer be delayed* I thei*efore request His Majesty’s Governtnent to agree unconditionally to the change oi registration* If the fact that the Port loan has not yet been completely repaid is ooaeidered to be an obstacle, tixe Iraqi Govern ent is prepared to make arrangements to repay the balance of the loon without delay.J NO* 3 KU.VAIT . 1. - Kuwait presents a two-fold &gt;robl©m for Iraq. (a) it has become an entrepot for extensive arms traffic and smuggling; (b) it bars Iraq’s access to the open sea. 2. - Hie Majesty’s Foreign Office is already familiar with problem (a)* The activities centred In Kuwait have for many years caused grave financial loss to Iraq in the shape of loss of customs revenue and extraordinary expenditure on preventive measures. The arms traffic also gravely complicates the task of maintaining law and order, particularly in the tribal areas of the Euphrates. 3. - As regards (b), Iraq’s only channel of access to the sea is at present the Shatt-al—Arab. The Iraqi Government feels that it is of vital importance to secure an alternative for the following reasons: (a) the recent dispute with Iran has emphasised the unreliability of the Shatt line: Iran is in a position to interrupt it at any time; (b) the Shatt tends to become more and more congested with the development of the Anglo- irnnlan Oil Company. If oil is discovered in the Bftera Wllayat, developments of equal magnitude may he expected, and these must not T,e restricted by the Shatt-al-Arab bottle neck; (c) after completion of the Tell-Kochik-Baghdad section of the railway, the Government proposes to extend the line as far south as possible with aylew to Inaugurating a fast passenger service to India, and shares the view of the original promoters/promoters of the Baghdad railway, that the terminus should be on the sea and not on the Shatt-al-Arab, 4. - «Tust before the War of 1914-1918, Kuwait was an autonomous qadha of the Wilayat of Basra. The Iraqi Government, as the suoceosor of the Ottoman Government in the Wilayats of Mosul&gt; Baghdad and Basra, considers that Kuwait should prooerly be incorporated in Iraq. If incorporation should take place, Iraq would agree to maintain the local autonomy of Kuwait v/ith a guarantee in the form of a special statute, but of course without prejudice to Iraqi sovereignty. 5. - If His Majesty’s Govern *mt will agree to the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraq, the two problems referred to in paragraph 1 will be automatically solved* If not, the solution of each must be found separately# 6. - Solution of the smuggling and srma-traffic problem can be sought by one of f .he three following methocs, arranged in order of effectiveness: (a) A customs Union between Iraq and Kuwait, Kuwait to receive a fixed annual aim in lieu of its present customs revenue: (b) the northern frontier line of Kuwait to run from west to east at about lat.290 35* instead of about 300 N. as at present, so ns to give the Iraqi preventive services more, space in which to operate south of Zubair, Shaiba and other villages south of the Hammer Lake; (c) combined preventive opernti ns. - As regards direct access to the sen, two alternati tions for a port and railway terminus sug-est themselves Investigation:- («, , suitable site to t« ~le.« a os Ka.alt B W . evf the Khor Abdullah, named (b) the inland extension of the Knoron the map Khor ZUbalr* If the first alternative 1 b found preferable, it vvould be neceeanry for Iraq to lease from Kuwait a site for a &gt;ort on the Bay* and a corridor for the railway line* The second would involve a Blight rectification of the frontier - that pro oscd under paragraph 6 (b&gt; above would be more than ample - at the eastern end - so as to give sufficient room at Umm Qesr (a probable site ) and Leave the whole of the Khor Abdullah in Iraq. Pending further investigation the Iraqi Government would be gXed to be assured that His Majesty's Government, in principle, would be disposed to consider favourably either alternative.NCb 4 P^L STINE. 1 * - The Irnql Govermnent bel^veB that the real interests of the British Empire and of the Arab world coincide so closely that co-operation in the Near Eaat is both possible and desirable. As the ally of Great Britain, Iraq in particular would wish that in a time of world crisis, His Majesty’s Govern ent should be able to count on the loyal and active assistance of all the Arabs, rnd not have to divert any part of their forces to that region to repress disorder or to counter a threat from any Arab element. The Palestine affair is poisoning what mi-^it be a most healthy political condition of the Near Last. The Arabs, the Ba’-adabad Governments and the whole of the Islamic world look upon the policy hitherto followed with fee lings of dismay. 2. - Even the Royal Commissi n, which, for the .first time, suggested partition and the fornotion of an Independent political Jewish State in Palestine, did not claim that this was an ideal solution. They clinched their argument in favour of It as asuinst, for instance, cantonisation, by expressing the Opinion that partition offered 'one supreme advantage - the possibility it offers of eventual peace'. The event, however, has shown beyond all argument that the premise on *ilch the Koyal Commission based its conclusions was false. The very sug cation of partition ta, n™. of to « aoaro. ° r ■»“ neve r be fore re n che d • . . ntimcroue occasions made 3. - The Iraqi Government has on nusK r jus re presentati ns to His Majesty's Government in this conocct, &gt;n both on behalf of the original A rnb inhabitants of destine . tv,„ policy hitherto followed to be on whom it believes - *• - ■ .. _.. ve8t injustice (representations which it inflicting the gravest injut.2. 9 is not proposed to repeat in the pr&lt; sent aide—me mo ire) and also on thf general political grounds summarised in paragraph I shove• His Majesty’s Government have 'been good enough to assure the Iraqi Govern sent in i\ oly, that thfise representations would he considered with the greatest attention, 4 , - The Iraqi Government is therefore genuinely perplexed and disturbed - (a) to note that, in soite of the considerati ne set forth in the three preceding paragraphs, on every occasion that n spokesman of the United Kingdom has occasion to make a declaration on Palestine, the uncororomislng statement is repeated that His Hnjcsty’s Gov m^ent adhe e to the view that partition of 'era the beet solution? end (b) to learn, on what it believes to be respectable authority, that the Woodhouse Technical Cor-mission styled itself 'Partition CornmiSBion' and refused to hear any evidence intended to show that no scheme of partition could be practicable or equitable. 5. ~ There thus appears to be a grave danger that after the Woodhouse Commission hag re sorted, the only solution in the field will be one for partition, l.e. a solution that could only be forced through at greet cost In blood, and treasure, and with unfortunate political consequences. 6 . - I ask to be enlightened w to why His Majesty s Govern:nent (in eoite of the reactions to the proposal for partition, •v’alch of course they could not forsee in July, 1937, when they issued their statement of policy,but whioh have since become manifest) have continued to concentrate on the study of partition to the exclusion of any otht r proposal which might offer possibilities of an arreed solution. Two such schsmes can be mentioned: - (a) the scheme sponsored by Oolonel Newcombe, and already agreed to by many influential Arabs and Jews of moderate views (details have already been communicated to^vern^nt); and (b) a scheme for the division/division oi Palestine into a number «• perhaps between X2 to 20 - of small federated cantons (rather on the lines of a scheme understood to have been pro pounded at one stage by Lord Rune 1 man for Czechoslovakia;. 7. - I earnestly beg His Majesty’s Govern lent to have detailed schemes worked out on these two bases in addition to any scheme for partition which may have been worked out by the Woodhouee Commission, in order that all possible alternatives may be simultaneously studied by a conference of representatives of all interests involved, in the hope that an agreed and durable solution nay emerge*, ALKX/.ill)';; .VTA &gt; The Iraqi Government maintains its opinion that tht; best and also in the best interests of Arab-Turkish nlati &gt;n 8 f would be division between Syria and Turkey. 2 , During the course of rny visit to Paris early in September, 1938 , I ascertained from Monsieur Georges Bonnet that the French Govern xnt, though unwilling to take any initiative in this direction, would have no objection to the Iraqi Government’s doing so at an opportune moment, and also that it had no objection in principle to division. 5, The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this month at Geneva that while Turkey considered the reopening of the question at the present moment inopportune, they would not attempt to bind the Syrian Govern *ent and would continue to consider the Iraqi Gove nment as eventual mediators in ohe matter. Monsieur Aras further promised to use his influence with the French Government, to ratify the Franeo-Syrian treaty not later than November, 1938. 4, In view of these assurances and the declaration of Honsieur Paul Bonoour in the Sixth Committee on :\eptc ■ bcr 1 M 8 that France Intended to ratify the treaty shortly, and that the delay was due/only trivial points of detail, I refrained Prance and Turkey, an arranger sment entirely inconsistent with 5. The Iraqi Goverrxne £ this question with a viewNo. 6 . SYRIA. X, - The Iraqi Gove nment is seriously perturbed by the delay in the ratification of the Franco-Gyrian treaty. It understands that this delay is due, not to minor matters of detail as Monsieur Paul Boncour gave it to be understood in the Sixth Committee of the Assembly, but to fundamental additions and alterations which the French Government wishes to impose, and to which the Syrian Gov rn ent can never agree. The date for the complete emancipation has been fixed for January 1940, the preparations for the taking over of complete responsibility by the Syrian Government are in certain essential particulars, notably, the formation of a regular national army, far less advanced than they were in Iraq at the corresponding date - viz. June 1930, 16 months before our entry into the League. 2, - Of the new proposals which are delaying rati T loot &gt;n, the one which causes the Iraqi Government the gravest preoccupation on its own account is one for a special regime for the upper Jazira.

On 21st.November I arrived by train at Basrah in company with : - Khalaf ibn Kadhim (Cousin of Shaikh Khawwam of Beni Zuraij) . A.bbas ibn Hitachah (brother-in-law of Khawwam). Chuwaiyid al Menahi (a Sa*douni). These men were carrying money from Shaikh Khawwam and were proceeding to Koweit,on his behalf,to procure ammunition. On arrival at Basrah we proceeded to Zobeir and remained one night as guests of one Saiyid Ibrahim al Abdul Aziz whom I believe is a relative of the haqib. On the following morning we left in two light lorries which had been provided by Ibrahim Abdul Aziz and .accompanied by the latter , W e proceeded to SAmH. Here we found that the fc.C.P.'Arif beg was absent in Basrah, but as a result of a telephone call from the S.H.O. ,he returned to SABWAB shortly afterwards. Saiyid Ibrahim then had a long conversation with •Arif beg following which he called Chuwaiyid over and instructed him to pay the following sums to SAITO jrsonnel. A.C.P. 1 •' u&gt; 35/000. S.H.O.

We then proceeded to iAHAHAH where we were mtro- + official who was paid I.D.12/000 in uced to a Customs official wno wa v v hi s real name but he is well known x do not know bis reai L\ i advance.'but he is well known locally as M A.bu Khalaf' and I myself have heard of him in the past. A.fter remaining two hours at his house we left our cars there and proceeded to Koweit in two taxis which A.hu Khalaf procured for us 9 On arrival ,at about sunset,A.bu Khalaf took us to the house of one Abdul Latif Shamlan to whom we were introduced. We also met the latter’s two clerks Abdul Q,ader andKuri. Alongside the house of Abdul Latif was a Khan containing a quantity of wooden cases. One was opened in my presence and inside I saw ten rifles.These we collected together with 16 smaller cases each contain ing 1000 rounds of ammunition. I saw possibly |30 (?) other cases similar to the one containing the rifles, which we had opened,as well as others containing ammunition • The 16 cases of ammunition ,10 rifles and 4 revolvers (or pistols ?) were loaded into our two taxis and hidden under bags of sugar,and we departed on the following night for JA.HA.RA.H, Abdul Qa^er accompanied us as far as the Koweit Gate where he got down from the leading car and engaged the sentry in conversation. I do not know whether any money was handed over but when the Sentry questioned us as to the contents of the car,Abdul Oader said 'Sugar' and we passed through the gate unmolested after bidding goodbye to Abdul qader. On arrival at JAHARAH,we transferred our load to the Zobeir taxis and after paying Abu Khalaf a further I.D. 28/000 (making l.h.40/000 in all) we bade him goodbye also. J AHARAH was left at dawn and we arrived at ,, Here we found the A.O.P.and SAFWAK at about 8 a.mand the S.H.O.and after a cursory glance at our top hags of sugar they instructed the police to let us pass unmolested. We did not proceed straight to Zobeir but stopped at a garden belonging to Ibrahim Abdul A.ziz amongst the ) Tamarisk groves of CKUWA.IBDA.H just beyond SHAl-bAb. Using a wooden ladder we hid our contraband in one of the many disused M charids' in this district. We then returned to Zobeir and stayed with Ibrahim Abdul Aziz until dusk. At 8 p.nu.and in the same cars,we returned to the tamarisk groves and collected our goods.Breaking open the ammunition boxes we transferred the cartridge (which were in khaki canvas slings each holding 200 ) and transferred them into six gunny hags.Straw was added to cover the ammunition. Leaving the tamarisk groves at about midnight we proceeded to the Mudhif of Shaikh Khawwam which we reached at about 8 a.m. Here the goods were handed over to Khawwam who paid a sum of I.D.12/000 to the drivers for taxi hire adding a gift of I.D.6/000 and some wearing apparel. The journey took five days in all. British ammunition is sold in Koweit at one Hupee per clip of five rounds whilst a British rifle fetches 80 to 85 Hupees.CONFIDENTIAL, no. eZ/f The Political Agent at Kuwait presents his compliments to The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document(s). with the remarks that the informant is believed to be reliable POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT.

(a) The reason why T^giish ammunition is cheap in Iraq io because it is plentiful, and it ia plentiful because it was the ammunition in use by xae British in the past, and is the ammunition of Iraq forces today.

(b) The immediate source, for Iraq, of the Turkish and 'leriaan rifles and ammunition is both from Saudi Arab!j via Nejf area and from r&gt;yria via the Jebel Senjar area; bus the majority of good weapons and ammunition come from Nejd. In Syria the bad or “imitation* Turkish ammunition is made secretly in the towns, from old. lead.

(d) They correspond with Kejefi merchants about their trade, but apart from consignments, which are not great, there is a continual drift of arms and ammunition towards Iraq through the tribes, particularly at the time of the res toe* mg of the Saudi bedouins in Iraq. Henrly every bedouin from Saudi Arabia then brings 100 rounds for sale, as it is a convenient and easily convertible a took on which there is profit. (e) The main sources of ammunition supply to tribesmen in Iraq are therefore (a) through the underpaid servants of Ibn 3aud and thenoe through Saudi tribesmen, and (b) from soldiers of the Iraq army. ^ * T this letter with enclosures to 3 .

There was nothing like 2, n 00 rifles in the bazaar for sale, but a number of old weapons of various types were collected, at my suggestion, from the armourers shops the day before the dissolution of the late Council. it has always been and still is the custom here for travellers to give up their weapons on entry to Kuwait, and this incidentally is the custom in all the old welled tovns of ^asira and Nejd. ’Jo change has 'been made In this arrangement recently. 3 . shaikh Ali al Khalifa as 3ahah, head of the family hy primogeniture, a cousin of the riuler, and a well known fighting man, several times wounded, is (unpaid) Director -General of Security for Kuwait, a reliable man and a fine fellow, whom I hope you will meet if anl when you come here with the V^assador.

The results of thesefrom Koweit, and in paragraph 4 of his letter of the 2lst January to the Government of India he has suggested certain points on which it might 'be useful to ask for inxorrnation from the Iraqi Government on this subject. Lord Zetland feels that there is much force in the views expressed hy the Resident in his above-mentioned letter and he wou]d suggest that the Iraqi Government might be asked, with reference to Taufiq Suwaidi’s remarks to which bir T. Fowls refers, to furnish the desired information so tar as they may be able, both to establish that their allegations are well founded and to assist the British and Koweit authorities in devising means to suppress such traffic as may be shown to exist. 3* In his letter of the 21st July, Ho. 427-3. (vide enclosure to my demi-official letter of the 17th August, No, P. Z. 5537/38) , the Resident endorsed the view that the source of the arms smuggled into Iraq lay not in Koweit but in Saudi Arabia, and further colour is given to this belief in his recent letter of the 12th January. It is not clear why smugglers from Saudi Arabia should pass through Koweit territory at all, but even if they do so Lord Zetland would suggest that it rests with Iraq and not with Koweit to institute adequate frontier measures to check the traffic* if the Saudi-Arabian Government are not prepared to take steps to stop the smuggling at its source. 4. On the question of smuggling generally the views of the Government of India and of the Political Resident, which were called for urgently at the request of your Department, are contained in the Goveynmonb of India’s hologram of the 2nd February, No. 20^3, and the3 A 'hS Resident’s telegram of the 29th January, No. 80. Lord Zetland agrees v/itn them tiat the Iraqi authorities might he again reminded of the Sheikh’s willingness to discuss the question when the Saudi—Koweit blockade has been lifted - the prospect of which, as Lord Halifax is aware, is now much brighter - and that they might be informed that, if they so desire, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to approach the Sheikh again with regard to measures (i.e. a system of manifesto by land as well as by sea) which he was prepared to introduce over three years ago but which were then refused by the Iraqi Government. Finally Lord Zetland would commend to I /1 Lord . Halifax’s consideration the views expressed in paragraph 6 of the Resident’s telegram of the 29th January regarding the repeated incursions of Iraqi police into Koweit territory, and his suggestion that the opportunity should be taken to propose that the frontier be Iween Koweit and Iraq should be demarcated.

't . lith ref erence to India Office letter No.P.Z. 7168/36, Gated the 9th November 1938, I am directed to request that the Government of India may kindly be furnished with your views on the question whether some stricter form of control over the sale of arms in Kuwait is necessary and if so, what measures can be devised for the purpose the penultimate sentence of paragraph o. They are impressed by the statement made by Major hdmonas and would be glad to know what the present position is in Kuwait with regard, to the sale of firearms and in particular whether such sale is completely un restricted, how and where it is conducted, what appro ximately is the number of firearms changing hands in a year and who are, generally speaking, the sellers and who the purchasers. They note that the British Naval authorities are confident that very few if any arms enter Kuwait by sea and that you are equally confident that there is no traffic in anna from Kuwait into Iraq, It is not however clear whether arms are or are not entering Kuwait in large quantities b y .land . If it could be shown that there is no sucn import and that no manu facture of arms takes place in Kuwait, it would be easiereasier to controvert the statement^ made by Mr* aiidmonds that Aui^it had become a recognized market where Arabs went to purchase arms. The Crovernment oi India would be glad of your connents on this point. Crovernmont of India would also be glad to know whether in your opinion there are any measures that can usefully be suggested at present for adoption by the dheiidi of Kuwait with the object of reducing the extent of smuggling as a whole from Kuwait into Ir&amp;QL vide the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the letter under reference. The Government of India are examining their records on this subject further and will let you know if they have any suggestions to make or if there are any particular points on which they require your advice. 5.

I.E., C.B.E., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf. To - The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs department, new Delhi. I have the honour to refer to your letter do.F.ll4-XM/38 of the 20 th December 1938 on the subject of the alleged sale of arms in Kuwait. 2 . I am proceeding to Kuwait on tour next month and will then in consultation with the Political Agent make enquiries into the points raised in paragraph 3 of your letter. 3 . in regard to the statement made by Major Edmonds, referred to in the same paragraph of your letter. Personally I would be more impressed by it if Major Edmonds had produced any evidence for his allegation that Kuwait was a recognised arms market for arms smuggling into Iraq. J-t is indeed this entire absence of evidence on the part of the iraqi Government for their statements, whether now or on previous occasions during the past four years or so, in regard to arms trading from Kuwait, which in my opinion is the most unsatisfactory feature of the whole question. i 4. It is inconceivable to me that if the arms smuggling exists to the extent alleged by the Iraqi Government further details are not in their possession, and there is the additional important point /important point that the production of such details by giving a basis for our further enquiries would make these considerably easier. i note that Mr. Baxter in his conversation with the Iraqi Minister for foreign Affairs on the 4th October 1938 asked if the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence 'to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Kuwait 11 . (Bee paragraph 2 of my letter ito.648-^3 of 29th November 1938 to the India Office, copy sent to the Government of J-ndia under my Printed Letter Bo.649-3 of the same date). To this enquiry faufiq Suwaidi replied that 'he thought that the Iraqi Government could produce evidence of this.' I venture to suggest that the Iraqi Government might be reminded of Mr. Baxter’s query, and asked to produce any evidence which may be in their possession. Such information from our point of view could be most usefully given in the form of replies to a questionnaire as follows: (1) What roughly is the number and make of rifles and amount of ammunition smuggled Isay) in the Jiast year ? ( 2 ) What were the dates on which especially large consignments of arms and ammunition were smuggled ( 3 ) What are the names of the individuals in Kuwait whom the Iraqi Government suspect of being con cerned in the arms trade ? ( 4 ) Who are the individuals, or tribes, who actually smuggle the arms ? ( 5 ) What are the routes by which arms are smuggled and to what centres in Iraq ? ( 6 ) What tribal bhaikhs in Iraq actually receive the it / arms ?-3- It seems to me that the Iraqi Government should be well able to give some sort of answers to the above queries* Kuwait is only some ICO miles from basrah, there is a constant fikow of Iraqis coming and going between the two places, aid at Safwan on the ^uwait-Basrah motor route there is an important Iraqi frontier post. 5 , Mr* Baxter in the course of the same conversation with Taufiq Suwaidi pressed the point that the Iraqi Government themselves should take anti-smuggling measures in Iraq itself. In this connection the opinions of Major Edmonds himself, Major Sargon of the Iraq Police and baj| ^ * al Asil, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, (see paragraph 4 of my letter quoted above), are of importance. it is true that some of these measures apply to forms of smuggling other than arms, but there seems no doubt that the Iraqi Government could exercise a much closer control than they do over the entry of arms across the Ira&lt;ii frontier le.g. para^aph 5 'MJ of ay Express Letter ao.427 -3 of 21 Bti July 1938 to the Air Officer Coaaanding, hritieh forces in -Iraq). 1 venture to suggest that this point also night be again brought to the notice of the Iraqi Government. 6 .
