The author goes on to suggest that the dispute be allowed to continue unresolved until the Russo-Afghan boundary has been settled and perhaps until after the death of the Amir [Emir] of Afghanistan.A further note records that the Shah of Persia subsequently accepted the arbitration of the Indian Government in the Hashtadan dispute.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Hashtadan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000091#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
