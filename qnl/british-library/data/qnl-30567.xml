For many years, during the reign of {er Majesty Queen Victoria, the only salutes fired were one for Iot Majes- -ty’s Birthday ard similarly one for the American Independence hay, and one for the French hatioral hay. Then after the Queen ^press's 'Proclamation, January 1st. 1887, r Tis Mighreon was asked to fire one on that Anniversary. The American and French '''orsuls, however,demurred to Mia Mlghress firing salutes and paying the British representative ceremonial visits for two Anr iversarjreo whereas they only celebrated one each. His Highness accordingly got over the difficulty by suggesting to them that he celebrated the 1st January not only as being the British 'Proclamation Day' but also as being tae Christian dew Year, and on that pretext he pays his ceremonial call on 1st January to tae Consuls of ail three Christian Powers in turn. 3. During the last two years,owing to t ie fact that a British Man-of-war has either been in or cone in to Muscat 'harbour on Her Majesty the Oueon*s B1rthday,May 26th, His Highness has been informed at the request of His Majesty’s. 10 % Slips t.iat t'aey intend to fire a royal salute in. celebration of the occasion. It has at the same time been suggested by I.B.M'e Consul to '{is 'Tighness that a salute should also be fired from 'Tis '{ighness* saluting battery in celebration of fck the anniversary.Time not admitting of discussion before the fact,His 'Tighress has complied on both occasions, but at the same time, on the last occasion, he pointed out in a private and friendly way that old prec edent only provided for the firing of two Royg d Salutes and the payment of two ceremonial visits; and that the recognition of a third anniversary in- -volving the incidence of 2 Royal Salutes so soon after one another was a little inconvenient and was also calculated to lead to demurs from other Consuls; he acoordiiigly requested, as you will remember, during your last visit to liuacat,tliat a conv«nieat opportunity be taken to represent tne matter to higher authority, with a view, If possible, to the British anniversaries being restricted to Proclamation Day,January 1st, and His Majesty the King's Birthday,Juno 3rd.

Major unox’s letter sufficiently explains the local position and subject to th© wishes of Government, 1 am of opinion, in the^circumstances, that if His Highness fires a sal ute on His Majesty the King’s Birthday and 1st Ja nuary , it is a B much as we need require of him.
