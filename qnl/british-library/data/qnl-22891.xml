Please refer to my de^i-offIcial letter No. 2333, dated 16th July, 1947. 2. Now that the Oil Company are operating froia Abu Dhabi it would be a great advantage to have a sea-going launch for the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, in Sharjah. The Jurisdiction of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast,includes 275 miles of co^t line; there are no ovorland roads and the trtLcks are extremely hard on cars. Ras A1 Khaimah and Abu Dhabi can be more easily reached by sea than by road at most tiaes of year; and travel by launch has the added advantage that the Political Officer on tour can live aboard. Anyone who has stayed in Ras A1 Kiaima or ' labi will readily appreciate the advantage of this. 3. Would it be possible to get for the Political Officer, Trucial Coast,the Bandar Abbas^ Launch at present tied up to the Agency pier her?.

Repeated to - PRODRCUE, Tehran (Paragraphs 3(d) 4,5 and 6 only) No. 2032-34/3• Bahrain, 27th September, 1947. Your telegram No. 10259 dated August 10th, 1947, xxx xxx xxx xxx 3. xxx xxx xxx, xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx (d) Bandar Abbas and Trucial Coast . One sea-going motor launch valued at 5s»o3,200 paid in moieties between H.M.G. and Government of India. The need for a launch to be shared between Bandar Abbas and the Trucial Coast was established at the time of sanction, but due to various delays the boat has only recently been put'to sea and a few fittings are still required. The Bandar Abbas Consulate has been closed, but as regards the Trucial Coast the renewal of the Petroleum Concessions Ltd.'si operations increases the necessity for the political Officer, Trucial Coast and the Residency Agent to tour the Shaikhdoms and the islands in the vicinity. -Desert tracks do exist, of course, but, excepting Sharjah, there is no accommodation in any town, the headquarters of the Shaikhs, and a launch, besides providing transport, also provides accommodation when on tour. The transport of tents and pitching of camp is impracticable and without a launch, therefore, only rush visits can be paid. A suitable launch is seldom available for hire and then only at high rates of some Es. 400 a day. The launch is in good condition and I recommend that it Should be acquired for the Trucial Coast» 4. Reference paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference^ The Bandar Abbas - Trucial Coast launch is the only one that is likely to become available due to closing of Consulates on the Persian littoralo 5. Reference Ambassador, Tehran^ telegram No. 48 of the 15th August. The Bandar Abbas - Trucial Coast launch is not suited for Khorramshahr where a river boat is requjred. It could be utilised at Bushire if it is decided not to acquire it for the Trucial Coast, but being designed for touring it would not be really suitable 0 6. We do not require the Bandar Abbas lorry for any of the Arab Agencies.D.O. No. T /l. British Agency, Sharjah. The 23rd December, 1947. Please refer to the Resident's demi-official letter No. 2314-34/3, dated the 3rd November to me when I was acting as political Agent. I have delayed answering it until I could study the possibility of hiring launches on the Trucial Coast and the cost of fitting out and maintaining the Bandar Abbas launch there. 2. If the rudder were strengthened, the hatches completed, the mast replaced, and a second anchor and oil-burning navigation lights purchased, the Bandar Abbas launch would be sea-worthy for use on the Trucial • Coast; but you will appreciate that it is not by any means completely fitted out. At present it consists of a good hull with bow suit and yard, sails, one anchor and ropes, a new engin^, and an unfitted cabin only. 3. To make it suitable for long journeys and to enable the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to stay aboard when on tour it will require the following addi tional equipment and structural alterations in this order of priorityj^ ^ « (i) A row boat; (ii) a bilge pump; (iii) two galleys: one for the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and one for the' crew (iv) fuel storage tanks; (v) wheel house and wheel forward to facilitate navigation; (vi) alternation to the engine room hatch to facilitate control and operation of the engine; (vii) drinking water tanks; (viii) a tarpaulin for protection against sun and rain; (ix) a cabin bed, table, and cushions; (x) a lavatory and wash basin with water tank; and (xi) an electric lighting set. /4. I estimate....-2- % 4. I estimate that the repairs and additions mentioned in paragraph 2 would cost Ks. 1,000/- in Bahrain - or Rs.500/- without the mast. The alterations and additions mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) to (ix) in paragraph 3 would require another Hs. 1,900/-, and the equipment mentioned in sub paragraphs (x) and (xi) a further Rs. 1,200/-. 5. A grant for its operation and maintenance will also be required amounting to Es.2,070/- up to the 1st April, 1948. This amount is made up as follows; Pilot ri ... Rs. 150/- p.m. Driver ... 150/- p.m. , - 4 Sailors at Ss. 60/- each p.m. 240/- Puel, maintenance and minor repairs 150/- p.m. Total Ks.690/- p.m. or Rs.2,070/- for 3 months. 6. I recommend that the repairs mentioned in paragraph 2 be put in hand imraediately; and that a sum of Ss.2,900/- should be provided to cover the cost of these repairs and the modifications mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) to (ix) of paragraph 3. I also recommend that a grant of Rs.2,070/- be sanctioned for operation and maintenance up to the 1st April, 1948. As soon as the repairs (costing Rs. 1,000/-) mentioned in paragraph 2 have been completed the launch could be sent to the Trucial Coast for immediate use and the additions and alterations mentioned in paragraph 3 could be carried out in. Dubai (where there are good boat builders) between tours. The equipment described in sub-paragraphs (x) and (xi) might be ordered now and paid for next year. 7. If funds for the additions and modifications mentioned in paragraph 3 cannot be made available now, I should still like to take this launch to the Trucial Coast because, without it, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, has to rely on hired launches. They are always difficult to get at short notice, are expensive, and are usually unreliable; and, although touring on the Bandar Abbas launch without the fittings men tioned in paragraph 3 will be tough, touring on hired launches is tougher, for they too have no conveniences and are, in addi tion, exceedingly dirty. Moreover, it is impossible to train a hired crew to habits of good order and cleanliness, or to ensure that hired launches are seaworthy or that the engines are serviceable. 8. I expect to have to make frequent trips to Abu Dhabi this winter and to have to stay there for some days each time. A launch will be much more convenient for these Journeys than a couple of cars.D.0.N0.77/-34/3 //Secretary to the The/Hon'l 'ble the Political llesident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu ment (s).

Insurance Department,sahra^: ■ Sa THE POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT, 1 29th Septenber, 1949. Thank you for your letter of the 21st September. I wrote to you about servants last week, rather belatedly I am afraid. The Trenchard Fowle is in fact the Trucial Coast launch-dhow. It was pro vided especially for the F.O.T.C's touring. To do his job properly the P.O.T.C. badly needs a launch of his own. It Is mocked in the Bahrain Agency probably because there is no P.O.T.C. to keep an eye on it at presert. If you allow McCaully to share it at all I would suggest that it be made quite clear to him that he is borrowing it from the P.O.T.C. at the P.O.T.C's discretion. Otherwise tfc P.O.T.C. will be denied his own launch when he wants to go on tour. I am afraid the Bahrain Rgency launch was wrecked in the early summer of 1948. The engine was salvaged and is in your Agency, I believe. Pelly told me he had rmt up a scheme to H.M.G. to buy an ex- naval craft to replace it. There must be papers in the office.
